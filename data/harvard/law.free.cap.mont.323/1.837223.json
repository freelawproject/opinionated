Officer Baumann recognized Frasure, checked the vehicle\u2019s license plate, and had confirmed for him the fact that Frasure owned the vehicle in which he was sitting. At that point, Officer Baumann was also told that there was a warrant out for Frasure\u2019s arrest. Officer Baumann, who was assisted by Officer Jason Cichosz (Officer Cichosz), then approached Frasure to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b65 Upon approaching Frasure, both officers noticed that Frasure appeared jittery and nervous in nature, his speech was accelerated and choppy, and he was sweating. Based on the officers experience and training, they knew Frasure\u2019s actions were consistent with a person who was under the influence of methamphetamine. The officers also knew from previous investigations that Frasure was addicted to methamphetamine and that he had been arrested for methamphetamine offenses in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\u00b66 The officers began speaking to Frasure, after which time Frasure stated that he had more drugs, but then said that he had left those drugs at a friend\u2019s house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Cichosz then conducted a pat-down search of Frasure-incident to Frasure\u2019s arrest-and found a ceramic pipe, like those used to ingest marijuana, in Frasure\u2019s left pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u00b67 Frasure denied consent to a search of his vehicle, which the officers later impounded. Officer Baumann then obtained a search warrant and found a considerable amount of drugs and drug paraphernalia in Frasure\u2019s vehicle, including: a digital scale; one hundred seventy three dollars in cash; three baggies of methamphetamine; five baggies of marijuana; two packages of twenty seven pills of acetaminophen/codeine; one capsule of oxycodene; and one package of nyproxin pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b68 Frasure moved to suppress the evidence found on his person and in his vehicle. The District Court denied this motion. Frasure, ultimately, was convicted by a jury of criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, a felony, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. A district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if review of the record reveals that a mistake was committed. <em>State v. Hill, </em>2004 MT 184, \u00b6 12, 322 Mont. 165, \u00b6 12, 94 P.3d 752, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b610 1. Did sufficient evidence exist to support the search warrant obtained for the search of Frasure\u2019s vehicle?</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">\u00b611 Frasure argues that there was insufficient probable cause to support the officers\u2019 search warrant regarding methamphetamine, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. Specifically, Frasure argues that because the police indicated in their warrant that the pipe they found was the kind used to ingest marijuana, and not methamphetamine, the only evidence the police had supporting the possibility of methamphetamine possession was Frasure\u2019s appearance and reputation. This appearance and reputation, Frasure argues, is not enough to raise mere suspicion to probable cause that Frasure had methamphetamine in his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">\u00b612 In addition, Frasure contends that \u201cthe only evidence to support the possibility that marijuana ... [was] in the car ... [was] the pipe, which the State conceded was not enough to establish probable cause for a search on its own.\u201d Frasure argues that his appearance was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>consistent with possible methamphetamine use, not marijuana use. Hence, the officers did not have sufficient probable cause to search for marijuana. Finally, Frasure argues that, regarding the drug paraphernalia, there \u201csimply\u201d was not enough information to provide the officers \u201cwith a basis to search the car for possible drug paraphernalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b613 The State of Montana (the State) counters that in looking at the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the search warrant application, probable cause existed to search Frasure\u2019s vehicle. Specifically, the State argues that Officer Baumann \u201cpursued the correct course of action\u201d in applying for a search warrant to search Frasure\u2019s vehicle, given his observations \u201cin conjunction with the information he already knew about Frasure, as well as his training and experience regarding the indicators of methamphetamine usage.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b614 Section 46-5-221, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">A judge shall issue a search warrant to a person upon application, in writing or by telephone, made under oath or affirmation, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">(1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">(2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">(3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">(4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">\u00b615  Probable cause exists \u201cif the facts and circumstances within an officer\u2019s personal knowledge ... are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that someone has ... committed an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Williamson, </em>1998 MT 199, \u00b6 12, 290 Mont. 321, \u00b6 12, 965 P.2d 231, \u00b6 12. Probable cause is evaluated \u201cin light of a trained law enforcement officer\u2019s knowledge, taking into account all the relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Williamson, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">\u00b616 Here, upon being informed that there was a warrant out for Frasure\u2019s arrest, Officer Baumann and Officer Cichosz approached Frasure to arrest him. At that point, both officers noticed that Frasure \u201cappeared jittery and nervous,\u201d that his speech was \u201caccelerated and choppy,\u201d and that Frasure was sweating. Based on these observations, both officers knew from their experience and training that Frasure\u2019s demeanor was consistent with a person who was under the influence of methamphetamine. They also knew, from previous encounters with and arrests of Frasure, that he was addicted to methamphetamine. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>After making these observations and arresting Frasure, Officer Cichosz conducted a pat-down search of Frasure, finding a ceramic pipe in his left pocket. And, based on this information, Officer Baumann impounded Frasure\u2019s vehicle, obtained a search warrant, and thereafter found a considerable amount of drugs and drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b617  In light of both Officer Baumann\u2019s and Officer Cichosz\u2019s knowledge, we conclude that probable cause existed to support the search of Frasure\u2019s vehicle, given that the facts and circumstances-namely, Frasure\u2019s nervousness, accelerated speech, the ceramic pipe found on his person, and the officers\u2019 prior knowledge of Frasure\u2019s methamphetamine addiction-indicated sufficient evidence to support their beliefs that Frasure had committed an offense. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Frasure\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b618 2. Is the omnibus hearing a critical stage of a criminal proceeding, thereby requiring Frasure\u2019s presence?</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b619 We have repeatedly held that we will not review issues raised for the first time on appeal, as it is unfair to fault the District Court for something that it never had opportunity to decide. <em>Kallowat v. State, </em>2004 MT 152, \u00b6 12, 321 Mont. 501, \u00b6 12, 92 P.3d 1176, \u00b6 12. Therefore, we decline to address Frasure\u2019s second issue raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b26-12\"> The State of Montana concedes that these statements were obtained in violation of Frasure\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, these statements are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
