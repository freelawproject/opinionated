Bradshaw, Granite County Attorney, Philipsburg.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-8\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AkI\">delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b6 1 Richard Motta filed a <em>prose </em>lawsuit against the defendants named above (\u201cSchool District\u201d), alleging that they did not adequately publicize a series of negotiation sessions and a special school board meeting which was held on February 13,2001, to approve a negotiated agreement between the Philipsburg School District No. 1 and the United Teachers Association of Philipsburg (\u201cAgreement\u201d). Motta petitioned to have the results of that meeting voided, and further complained that the School District did not have an appropriate procedure in place for assisting public participation in its decision-making process. Both Motta and the School District moved for Summary Judgment. The School District\u2019s Motion was denied. Motta received partial summary judgment in his favor, with the District Court ordering that the School District submit copies of its procedures for permitting and encouraging public participation, and that the School District maintain minutes consistent with the mandates of the applicable statutes. However, the District Court did not void the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Agreement that resulted from the February 13, 2001 meeting. Motta appeals on the grounds that the District Court abused its discretion when it refused to void the Agreement and abused its discretion when it did not award Motta his costs. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b62 Motta presents the following two issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to void the negotiated Agreement between the Philipsburg School Board and the Philipsburg United Teachers Association?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not award costs to Motta pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b65 Motta brought this action on March 12,2001, in the Third Judicial District Court, claiming that the School District violated various provisions of Title 2, Section 3, MCA, and Article II, Sections 8 and 9, of the Montana Constitution, by failing to properly and adequately publicize a February 13, 2001, School Board meeting concerning the negotiation of new contracts with the Philipsburg United Teachers Association, and by failing to give the public an adequate means by which to comment upon the proposed Agreement. He further alleged that a series of meetings leading up to this School Board meeting had been clandestine gatherings for negotiation purposes which were not properly publicized, and from which no minutes were kept. Motta requested that the District Court void the Agreement which resulted from these negotiations; enjoin the School District from further violations of the applicable statutes and Constitutional provisions; and require the School District to publish notice of upcoming meetings in the local newspaper at least seven days in advance of any scheduled meeting. He further requested an Order that the School District pay his costs, pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b66 Both Motta and the School District filed Motions for Summary Judgment. After mediation and other negotiation attempts failed to resolve the case, the District Court heard oral arguments on the cross-motions for summary judgment on July 15, 2003. On November 18, 2003, the District Court entered an Order in which it concluded that the School District had not complied with the provisions of Article II, Sections 8 and 9, of the Montana Constitution and \u00a7 2-3-103 et. seq., MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">\u00b67 The District Court found that the School District\u2019s February 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>2001 meeting was open to the public \u201cin theory only\u201d due to inadequate notification, and further found that the public had been given little opportunity to examine documents, submit data, or comment on the Agreement during the negotiation process. The District Court also took issue with the series of clandestine meetings held prior to the February 13 meeting, stating that these meetings took place with little or no public notice, and that the School District\u2019s failure to keep minutes at these meetings violated \u00a7 2-3-212, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b68 Finally, the District Court considered the remedy of voiding the Agreement, pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA. The court chose not to void the Agreement, but did order the School District \u201cto comply with the spirit and the letter of the law in regards to providing adequate notice to the public, to assist the public in participation in all future meetings, [and] to keep adequate minutes of all meetings held.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b69 The District Court further ordered the School District to develop procedures pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-103, MCA, and to submit those procedures to the court so as to allow it to determine the reasonableness of the proposed procedures. The School District was given 30 days to comply, and ordered to publicize any meetings during the interim by placing notices in the local newspaper at least seven days prior to each meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u00b610 Motta then moved the District Court to amend its Judgment and void the Agreement which resulted from the February 13 meeting. The District Court did not act upon Motta\u2019s Motion and this appeal timely followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same evaluation under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as the district court. <em>Glacier Tennis Club at the Summit, LLC v. Treweek Constr. Co., </em>2004 MT 70, \u00b6 21, 320 Mont. 351, \u00b6 21, 87 P.3d 431, \u00b6 21 (citations omitted). In other words, the party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of proving that there are no genuine issues of material fact that would permit a non-moving party to succeed on the merits of the case, and if the moving party meets that burden, then the non-moving party must provide substantial evidence that raises a genuine issue of material fact in order to avoid summary judgment in favor of the moving party. <em>Glacier, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted). Once it is established that no genuine issues of material fact exist, the district court must then determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and this Court reviews that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>determination to determine whether the district court erred. <em>Glacier, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AL5\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b612 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it refused to void the negotiated Agreement between the Philipsburg School Board and the Philipsburg United Teachers Association?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b613 There being no issues of material fact in dispute, we consider only whether the District Court erred in its conclusions of law when it refused, pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA, to void the Agreement entered into after the February 13 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b614 Motta argues that the District Court should have voided the Agreement, pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA, and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone County Elementary School District No. 2, </em>2002 MT 264, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381. The School District responds that the District Court\u2019s ruling should be upheld, and further points out that \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA, by its very language grants the District Court the discretion to determine whether to void a decision made in violation of Montana\u2019s Open Meeting Laws. Motta replies that this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Bryan </em>requires the Agreement to be voided, and reiterates his request for this remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u00b615 At the outset of this discussion, we note that the School District has not filed a cross-appeal in this case. Nonetheless, the School District attempts to reargue the question of whether its prior public participation procedures comply with Montana law. No cross-appeal having been filed, this issue is not properly before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">\u00b616 Section 2-3-213, MCA, states, \u201cAny decision made in violation of 2-3-203 may be declared void by a district court having jurisdiction....\u201d Section 2-3-203, MCA, codifies Montana\u2019s constitutional requirement that meetings of public agencies and certain associations of public agencies be open to the public. The District Court concluded the School District was in violation of Montana\u2019s Open Meeting Laws, and that conclusion is not disputed here today. The language of \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA, is discretionary, providing that a District Court <em>may </em>declare a decision void. Motta maintains, however, that the District Court was required by the language of <em>Bryan </em>to void the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">\u00b617 In <em>Bryan, </em>the appellant filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to prevent school closures which had been ordered by a Billings school district and its board of trustees. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 1. We concluded that Bryan\u2019s right to participate and right to know as guaranteed by Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>II, Sections 8 and 9, of the Montana Constitution had been violated. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 39 and \u00b6 46. As a remedy, Bryan requested that the school district\u2019s decision to close certain schools be voided. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 48. We determined that two courses of action were available to us-voiding the decision, or issuing a declaratory judgment while allowing the decision to stand. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 51. We chose the former, explaining that we would not let a constitutional violation stand for the sake of convenience. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b618 Motta argues that this case is factually similar <em>to Bryan, </em>and that, since the District Court found that the School District violated Article II, Sections 8 and 9, of the Montana Constitution in his case, he is entitled to the same remedy as Bryan. The School District replies that <em>Bryan </em>is factually distinguishable, because in <em>Bryan, </em>the appellant was prevented from presenting new evidence to the school board, and school officials had withheld documentation from a concerned citizen who had requested it. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 41. Essentially, the School District argues, voiding the decision in the <em>Bryan </em>case gave that school board a chance to consider new evidence and reconsider its decision in light of that evidence. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 55. In the case at hand, the School District maintains, Motta has no new evidence to present that could cause the School District to reach a different result were it to reconsider the Agreement. The School District further points out that the District Court\u2019s Order required it to implement a public participation procedure which has rectified the problem and ensures that similar violations will not happen in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b619 The Agreement at issue was the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the 2000-2001 school year in this school district. The School District asserts,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">Voiding the School\u2019s 2000-01 contract with the teacher\u2019s union will only cause confusion and waste public resources as the School is now conforming to Montana law. Three members of the School Board have changed since the Appellant brought suit. Several teachers, who taught back in 2000-01, no longer teach at the School. The teachers have already performed their teaching and have been paid for teaching the 2000-01 School year.... The District Court acted reasonably and justifiably by not voiding the contracts, but providing for future compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">As a practical matter, we are at a loss to determine what would be the legal effect, if any, were we to void an Agreement which has run its course and has presumably expired. While Motta asserts in his Brief, \u201cRespondents effectively continue to benefit from their overt violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>of open meeting laws,\u201d he presents us with no evidence to support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b620 In <em>Bryan </em>we were faced with a situation where voiding the decision gave the appellant the opportunity to make a presentation to the school board which could cause that board to reconsider its decision to close certain schools in Billings. <em>Bryan, </em>\u00b6 55. As indicated above, the situation at hand is different. Because the Agreement at issue expired in 2001, nothing Motta now argues concerning that contract would impact any future decision of the Board. Regardless of the merits of his position, Motta cannot at this juncture resurrect an expired contract.</p>\n<p id=\"A86\">\u00b621  Returning to \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA, the language of the statute clearly leaves the issue of whether to void any decisions reached at a meeting held in violation of Montana\u2019s Open Meeting Laws to the discretion of the District Court. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to void the Agreement which resulted from the February 13 meeting. Thus, we determine that the District Court did not err when it awarded only partial summary judgment to Motta, and we affirm on Issue One.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b622 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it did not award costs to Motta pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b623 Motta argues that as the prevailing party, he should have been awarded his costs, pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA. The School District does not address Motta\u2019s argument regarding costs, but simply asserts in its Brief that the District Court\u2019s decisions were discretionary and that the court did not abuse its discretion in reaching them, and should thus be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\u00b624 The District Court did not address Motta\u2019s prayer for costs of suit in its Order. Section 2-3-221, MCA, provides, \u201cA plaintiff who prevails in an action brought in district court to enforce his rights under Article II, section 9, of the Montana constitution [sic] may be awarded his costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d The decision to award such costs and fees is discretionary. <em>Gaustad v. City of Columbus, </em>265 Mont. 379, 382, 877 P.2d 470, 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u00b625  Although Motta did not receive all of the remedy he desired, he did prevail in an action to enforce his rights under Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution. It is thus up to the discretion of the District Court, pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, to determine whether to award his costs. (Because Motta acted <em>pro se </em>throughout this proceeding, there are no attorneys\u2019 fees for him to recover.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00b626 In <em>Gaustad, </em>appellant Gaustad appealed the District Court\u2019s denial other costs and fees pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, after she had prevailed in an action brought under Article II, Section 9, of the Montana Constitution. <em>Gaustad, </em>265 Mont. at 380, 877 P.2d at 471. The District Court did not offer a rationale for its denial of her costs and fees. <em>Gaustad, </em>265 Mont. at 381, 877 P.2d at 471. We held that, while an award of fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, is discretionary, an outright denial without a sufficient rationale is an abuse of that discretion. <em>Gaustad, </em>265 Mont. at 383, 877 P.2d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"ANq\">\u00b627  In the case at hand, the District Court did not deny the request for costs; rather, it failed to address the issue at all. From the record, we do not know if the District Court intended to deny Motta\u2019s request for costs, or if it simply neglected to address the issue. Thus, we remand to the District Court on this issue so that it may determine whether to award Motta his costs pursuant to \u00a7 2-3-221, MCA, and to set forth its rationale should it choose to deny him this remedy. '</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court on Issue One and remand on Issue Two.</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
