Gardipee appeals the District Court\u2019s order allowing the State to amend its Information. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion when it allowed the State to file an Amended Information on the morning of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b63 On December 21, 2001, the State filed an Information alleging that Melvin Gardipee committed five offenses, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADZ\">COUNT IV: PARTNER MEMBER ASSAULT, A MISDEMEANOR, in violation ofMCA \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(a)(2001). The above-named defendant purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to a family member, namely his daughter, Valarie Gardipee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">With the permission of the District Court, the State filed an Amended Information on May 20, 2002, the morning of the trial. The Amended Information included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">COUNT IV (AMENDED): FAMILY MEMBER ASSAULT, A FELONY, in violation ofMCA \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(a)(2001). The above-named defendant purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to a family member, namely his daughter, Valarie Gardipee. The Defendant was convicted on one count of domestic abuse on December 4,1988, and was convicted on two additional counts of domestic abuse on January 26, 1993.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">\u00b64 A jury found Gardipee guilty of several of the offenses charged against him, including Count IV. Gardipee appeals the District Court\u2019s order permitting the State to file its Amended Information.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">\u00b65 Whether to allow the amendment of an information is left to the discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Abe, </em>1998 MT 206, \u00b6 28, 290 Mont. 393, \u00b6 28, 965 P.2d 882, \u00b6 28. We review discretionary trial court rulings to determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Abe, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">\u00b66 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>State to file an Amended Information on the morning of the trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b67 Gardipee alleges the District Court erred by permitting the State to file the Amended Information on the morning of the trial. Amendments to the substance of an Information must be filed not less than five days before trial, but amendments to the form of an Information may be filed any time prior to verdict if the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced. Section 46-11-205, MCA, <em>City of Red Lodge v. Kennedy, </em>2002 MT 89, \u00b6 11, 309 Mont. 330, \u00b6 11, 46 P.3d 602, \u00b6 11. Gardipee concedes that the Amended Information was an amendment of form rather than substance. Accordingly, amendment of the Information on the day of trial was proper \u201cif the substantial rights of the defendant are not prejudiced.\u201d Section 46-11-.205(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b68 Gardipee argues that his substantial rights were prejudiced by changing Count IV from a misdemeanor to a felony, which carries a much more severe penalty. Under Montana law, a first conviction of Partner or Family Member Assault constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine from $100 to $1000 and imprisonment in the county jail for 24 hours to 1 year. Section 45-5-206(3)(a)(i), MCA. A second offense, also a misdemeanor, is punishable by a fine from $300 to $1000 and imprisonment in the county jail from 72 hours to 1 year. Sections 45-5-206(3)(a)(ii), MCA. A third or subsequent conviction, however, constitutes a felony and carries a penalty of $500 to $50,000 and imprisonment of 30 days to 5 years. Section 45-5-206(3)(a)(iv), MCA. Gardipee asserts that if he and his counsel had advance notice of the Amended Information and the more severe penalty, their \u201cplea bargaining and trial strategy may have taken a different course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b69  We hold that Gardipee\u2019s substantial rights were not violated when the District Court allowed the State to amend the Information on the day of the trial. The only difference between the first Information and the Amended Information was the recognition that pursuant to Montana statute, a persistent offender of the partner or family member assault statute receive an enhanced sentence for a third or subsequent conviction. The elements of the crime were not changed. Under the Amended Information, Gardipee was still charged under the same statute. Gardipee\u2019s substantial rights were not prejudiced by amendment of the Information to reflect the statutorily-mandated sentencing range for a repeat offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b610 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
