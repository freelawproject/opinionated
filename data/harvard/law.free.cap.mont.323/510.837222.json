We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b62 We rephrase the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in denying Nelson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u00b64 On May 26, 2002, Hill County Deputy Sheriff Cory D. Matkin (Deputy Matkin) and Reserve Deputy Sheriff Tim Herron were covering the \u201cgraveyard shift.\u201d At approximately 12:40 a.m., Deputy Matkin observed two vehicles parked next to each other in the IGA grocery store (IGA) parking lot, including a white Chevy truck, which belonged to Becky Hillard (Hillard). Believing Hillard was a minor and violating the city\u2019s curfew law, Deputy Matkin decided to investigate. Deputy Matkin then observed the defendant, later identified as Nelson, exiting the IGA with two 18-packs of beer. Deputy Matkin also noted Nelson had a male passenger waiting in his vehicle. Shortly, both men began conversing with Hillard and her passenger. As Deputy Matkin circled the two parked cars, Nelson abruptly proceeded to his vehicle and followed Hillard as she exited the IGA parking lot. Suspecting that Nelson was attempting to transfer alcohol to the minors, Deputy Matkin followed. After traveling a few blocks, Nelson turned his vehicle into the Duck Inn parking lot, where he came to a brief stop. Deputy Matkin parked across the street. A few minutes later, Nelson\u2019s vehicle exited the parking lot, but first waited for Deputy Matkin to pull out in front of him. Deputy Matkin then noticed that Nelson\u2019s vehicle failed to have a properly mounted front license plate and turned into a parking lot and waited for Nelson, who was driving behind him, to pass so that he could initiate a traffic stop. However, to Deputy Matkin\u2019s surprise, Nelson signaled and pulled his vehicle into the parking lot where Deputy Matkin was parked. Nelson then rolled down his window, as did Deputy Matkin. Nelson then asked \u201cIs there a problem officer or have I done something wrong?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Deputy Matkin responded affirmatively, noting Nelson\u2019s failure to properly display a front license plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b65 As Deputy Matkin exited his patrol vehicle and approached Nelson\u2019s vehicle, he believed that Nelson was acting as if he did not want the Deputy to look inside his vehicle. Deputy Matkin requested Nelson\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance, and observed the two 18-packs of beer Nelson had carried from the IGA in the vehicle. Nelson produced a suspended out-of-state license, his only proof of identification, and an expired proof of insurance. As Nelson did so, Deputy Matkin further observed that Nelson\u2019s hands were shaking and that his demeanor was anxious and tense. Deputy Matkin then observed that Nelson\u2019s eyes were glassy and continuously moved back and forth, raising Deputy Matkin\u2019s suspicions that Nelson was impaired by drugs or alcohol. Deputy Matkin further observed that Nelson responded rapidly to questions, often splitting his sentences. At that point, Deputy Matkin did not detect the odor of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b66 Deputy Matkin then turned his attention to Nelson\u2019s passenger, who appeared to be under the drinking age, and began to question him. After determining that the passenger was underage, he requested Deputies Ostberg and Dahl to respond to the scene. Hearing the radio call, Montana Highway Patrol Officer Baiamonte (Officer Baiamonte) also responded. All of the officers arrived at the scene within eight minutes of the initial stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b67 During the interim, Deputy Matkin advised Nelson that he would be cited for license and insurance violations. Deputy Matkin then requested the passenger, identifying himself as Brandon Nelson (Brandon), to step out of the vehicle, advising him that he would be cited for Minor in Possession of Alcohol. While escorting Brandon to the patrol vehicle, Deputy Matkin asked Brandon why his pants were wet, to which Brandon replied that a beer had spilled in the vehicle\u2019s seat. Deputy Matkin returned to Nelson\u2019s vehicle and ordered Nelson to remove the empty beer bottle. At that point, Officer Baiamonte, who had just arrived on the scene, observed a second empty bottle behind Nelson\u2019s seat. Thereafter, Nelson was requested to remove that bottle as well. However, although Nelson continually moved his hand across the top of the bottle, he was unable to retrieve it, and Officer Baiamonte assisted him. Deputy Matkin then placed Brandon in his patrol vehicle and again requested that Brandon identify himself. Based on Brandon\u2019s answers, dispatch found no record matching Brandon\u2019s name and description. Deputy Matkin repeated the process three times to no avail. Brandon\u2019s true identity as Brandon Montagne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>was later determined at the Hill County Detention Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b68 Upon his arrival, Officer Baiamonte had immediately noticed that Nelson\u2019s physical actions were nervous and agitated. Officer Baiamonte is experienced and highly trained in recognizing the signs of drug intoxication, and is one of only two individuals in Montana certified to teach drug identification courses at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy. As Officer Baiamonte questioned Nelson, he observed from Nelson\u2019s behaviors that he was not merely nervous, and suspected that Nelson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He noted that Nelson\u2019s pupils were dilated and his eyes continually darted back and forth as he responded to the questions. Nelson also fidgeted and continuously gripped and moved the gear shift. Further, when Officer Baiamonte reached into the vehicle to secure a pocket knife near Nelson\u2019s seat, he smelled the odor of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b69 After making these observations and consulting with Deputy Matkin, Officer Baiamonte administered a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test (HGN) to Nelson. Nelson exhibited four of the six indicators of being under the influence of an intoxicating substance, although a subsequent preliminary breath test did not indicate the presence of alcohol. Officer Baiamonte then told Nelson that he believed Nelson was under the influence of drugs, and asked Nelson if that was correct. Nelson at first equivocated, but then said he had ingested methamphetamine earlier that night. Nelson was not given <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to this admission. Nelson was then arrested for DUI and taken to the hospital for blood tests. He subsequently consented to a search of his vehicle, where police located methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia which gave rise to the charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u00b610 On September 27, 2002, Nelson filed a Motion to Suppress the evidence obtained from the investigative stop of his vehicle. Following a suppression hearing, the District Court denied the motion. On December 2, 2002, Nelson pled guilty to criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102, MCA, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-10-103, MCA, reserving the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, which he now challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u00b611 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence is whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. </em>Martinez, 2003 MT 65, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 19. Further, we engage in plenary review of conclusions of law to determine whether the district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Martinez, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in denying Nelson\u2019s Motion to Suppress Evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b613 Nelson makes two primary arguments. First, he argues that his admission to Officer Baiamonte that he had used methamphetamine, Officer Baiamonte\u2019s observations of his behavior and the administration of the sobriety tests should be suppressed because officers gave him neither the stop advisory, pursuant to \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA (2001),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor the <em>Miranda </em>advisory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, Nelson argues that Officer Baiamonte\u2019s DUI investigation at the scene was unlawful because it exceeded the permissible scope of Deputy Matkin\u2019s investigative stop. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u00b614 Nelson focuses his first argument on two pieces of evidence-his admission of methamphetamine use and Officer Baiamonte\u2019s observations regarding his inability to retrieve an empty beer bottle from his vehicle-asserting that this information was obtained in violation of \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA (2001), and our holding in <em>State v. Krause, </em>2002 MT 63, \u00b6 38, 309 Mont. 174, \u00b6 38, 44 P.3d 493, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u00b6 15 In <em>Krause, </em>we held that the district court erred by not suppressing the defendant\u2019s statements made to an officer prior to the officer giving the stop advisory required by \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA (2001).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.KraMse, \u00b6 38. However, the State conceded in the District Court and again on appeal that Deputy Matkin and Officer Baiamonte failed to give the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>stop advisory, and, consequently, Nelson\u2019s statement should be suppressed. Because this issue is not contested, we need not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b616 Turning to the second piece of evidence-officer Baiamonte\u2019s observations of Nelson\u2019s behavior, specifically, Nelson\u2019s inability to retrieve a beer bottle-Nelson argues that his action in response to Officer Baiamonte\u2019s requests at the scene was, in effect, a \u201cstatement\u201d and should also be suppressed under <em>Krause, </em>as well as <em>Miranda. </em>However, our holding <em>in Krause </em>required the suppression of a suspect\u2019s <em>verbal statements, </em>not an officer\u2019s observations of the suspect\u2019s nonverbal actions or behaviors. <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10 and 38. Further, \u00a7 46-5-402, MCA, which is the provision interpreted in <em>Krause, </em>permits various actions by law enforcement without a prior advisory, such as frisking the suspect and demanding the suspect\u2019s name and address. An advisory is required only \u201cbefore questioning the person.\u201d Section 46-5-402(4), MCA. Thus, neither this statute nor our holding in <em>Krause </em>require suppression of Officer Baiamonte\u2019s observations of Nelson\u2019s appearance and behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b617 Similar reasoning requires that we reject Nelson\u2019s reliance on <em>Miranda. </em>Nelson argues that he was in custody immediately upon Deputy Matkin\u2019s determination to issue a citation for the license violation, and that the evidence obtained thereafter was tainted because of Officer Baiamonte\u2019s failure to give him a <em>Miranda </em>advisory. As noted, the State does not contest the suppression of Nelson\u2019s statement, and, in regard to the officers\u2019 observations, <em>Miranda </em>offers Nelson no support. The constitutional protections under <em>Miranda </em>are afforded during a custodial interrogation, and do not attach at the time an investigative stop is made. In <em>Hulse v. Dept. of Justice, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6 37, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6 37, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6 37, we held that a \u201croadside questioning of a detained motorist pursuant to a routine traffic stop does not constitute a custodial interrogation subject to the procedural safeguards of <em>Miranda.\u201d State v. Allen, </em>1998 MT 293, \u00b6 12, 292 Mont. 1, \u00b6 12, 970 P.2d 81, \u00b6 12. As we have recognized, Officer Baiamonte\u2019s roadside detention, questioning, and field sobriety tests were analogous to a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which an officer may briefly question a detainee to confirm or dispel his suspicions, but where the detainee is not obligated to respond. <em>See Hulse, </em>\u00b6 40. Further, Nelson offers no authority, in his request for suppression of all the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>from the scene, that failure to give the Miranda advisory requires suppression of an officer\u2019s observations of a suspect\u2019s nonverbal conduct. We thus conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Nelson\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b618 In his second primary argument, Nelson contends that Officer Baiamonte\u2019s actions violated \u00a7 46-5-403,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MCA, by exceeding the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the initial stop made by Deputy Matkin. Although Nelson concedes that his failure to properly mount a front license plate provided particularized suspicion for Deputy Matkin to initiate the investigative stop, he contends this did not provide a particularized suspicion for Officer Baiamonte to further investigate him for DUI. Nelson argues Officer Baiamonte\u2019s detention, questioning, and field sobriety tests improperly exceeded the scope of the stop and therefore, unlawfully prolonged the stop, citing to <em>State v. Carlson, </em>2000 MT 320, \u00b6 18, 302 Mont. 508, \u00b6 18, 15 P.3d 893, \u00b6 18, and <em>State v. Henderson, </em>1998 MT 233, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 291 Mont. 77, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 966 P.2d 137, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b619 In <em>Carlson, </em>\u00b6 18, we held that the police exceeded the time necessary to investigate the defendant for a suspected trespass by detaining the defendant for thirty minutes until a drug-sniffing dog was available, when there was no particularized suspicion to believe that a defendant was under the influence of drugs. However, unlike the defendant in <em>Carlson, </em>who showed no signs of being under the influence of drugs, Nelson, upon Deputy Matkin\u2019s initial encounter, immediately presented indicators that he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and thus, <em>Carlson </em>is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b620 Nelson attempts to contrast <em>Henderson </em>by arguing that the driving by the defendant in that case was impaired, while he exhibited no signs of poor driving. However, <em>Henderson </em>is more supportive of the State\u2019s position. There we held that the district court erred in suppressing evidence, concluding that the investigation progressed properly following the stop for failure to display license tags: \u201c[fjrom the moment that the officer noted the smell of alcohol and the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>slurred speech, the initial investigative stop took on the quality of an escalating situation in which the additional information gave rise to further suspicions and enlarged the scope of the investigation to that of a possible DUI.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 22. The same occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b621  Although we do not dispute Nelson\u2019s contention that the right against unreasonable searches and seizures, as codified in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 2, Section 11, of the Montana Constitution, are implicated in an investigative stop, thus, requiring that the officer have an objective manifestation to support his particularized suspicion to investigate, <em>Carlson, </em>\u00b6 18, we conclude that Officer Baiamonte had particularized suspicion to conduct a DUI investigation that properly extended the time of the stop. First, we recall that, prior to the investigative stop, this incident began when Deputy Matkin witnessed Nelson exiting the IGA with two 18-packs of beer and following two minors from the parking lot, which Deputy Matkin suspected was an attempted transfer of alcohol to a minor and which led Deputy Matkin to follow Nelson. Nelson then drove in such a manner that he placed his vehicle in traffic behind Deputy Matkin\u2019s vehicle. Deputy Matkin then pulled his vehicle over waiting for Nelson to pass to initiate a traffic stop; however, to his surprise, Nelson signaled and pulled his vehicle in next to that of Deputy Matkin.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b622  At the scene, Deputy Matkin believed Nelson was trying to keep him from looking inside his vehicle. He then observed Nelson\u2019s anxious and nervous demeanor, glassy eyes, shaky hands and rapid speech in which he split his sentences. In turning his attention to Nelson\u2019s passenger, Deputy Matkin was thwarted in his multiple attempts to identify the passenger by false answers to his questions. However, in no more than eight minutes, Officer Baiamonte arrived at the scene, and observed Nelson\u2019s appearance and the smell of alcohol from the beer spilt in the interior of Nelson\u2019s vehicle. These served to confirm Deputy Matkin\u2019s suspicions and properly established a separate particularized suspicion that Nelson was impaired, and further led to Officer Baiamonte\u2019s administration of field sobriety tests, Nelson\u2019s arrest for DUI, and the search of the vehicle where methamphetamine and drug paraphernalia were found. In fact, one discovery led to another, and \u201ctook on the quality of an escalating situation in which the additional information gave rise to further suspicions and enlarged the scope of the investigation to that of a possible DUI.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 22. Thus, the stop was appropriately extended for the DUI investigation, and, concomitantly, the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u201cnecessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop\u201d was appropriately extended. Section 46-5-403, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\u00b623  Moreover, this Court has never established specific time parameters to which an officer is to adhere to when conducting an investigative stop. Here, the entire investigation, sobriety tests, and arrest of Nelson and his passenger took approximately 24 minutes. We cannot conclude that this time was excessive. We have noted that, while law enforcement officers conducting an investigation or investigatory stop should be guided by principles of reasonableness, \u201ceffective law enforcement requires some latitude to be given to investigating officers to react to and follow up on their observations.\u201d <em>State v. Sharp </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 40, 47, 702 P.2d 959, 963; <em>also see State v. Roberts, </em>1999 MT 59, \u00b6 25, 293 Mont. 476, \u00b6 25, 977 P.2d 974, \u00b6 25.
