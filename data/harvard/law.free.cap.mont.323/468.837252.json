B. and D. B. (\u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the judgment of the Twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, which terminated their parental rights to their children M. B., J. B., and W. B., and awarded permanent legal custody of these children to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (hereinafter, \u201cthe Department\u201d), together with the right to consent to their adoption. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to all three children?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated both the mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights to W. B.?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err by failing to approve a second treatment plan for the mother?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u00b66 4.

Did the District Court err in finding that the social worker did not have a conflict of interest with the mother such as to warrant reversal?</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Atfq\">\u00b68 M. B., and J. B., the two minor daughters of S. B. and D. B., and W. B., their minor son, were removed by the Department from the family home on March 23,2001. The Department took this action after receiving a report that S. B., the children\u2019s natural father, had been arrested pursuant to an affidavit-supported bench warrant which alleged that he had committed felony incest against his four daughters, including M. B. and J. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">\u00b69 On October 10, 2001, S. B. pled guilty to four counts of felony incest-one count as to each of his daughters-and was sentenced on December 31, 2001, to 40 years in prison, with 20 years suspended. S. B. later appealed his sentence, though not his guilty plea or his conviction, to this Court. We affirmed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">\u00b610 The Department ultimately petitioned for permanent legal custody of the minor children, and termination of Appellants\u2019 rights to them, on February 3, 2003. By Order dated June 2, 2003, the District Court granted the Department\u2019s petition. S. B. and D. B. appeal therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights is discretionary, and we review that decision to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>In re J. W., </em>2001 MT 86, \u00b6 7, 305 Mont. 149, \u00b6 7, 23 P.3d 916, \u00b6 7. In reviewing a decision to terminate parental rights, we determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact supporting termination are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>In re C. B., </em>2001 MT 42, \u00b6 6, 304 Mont. 252, \u00b6 6, 20 P.3d 117, \u00b6 6. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>In re J. N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 524, \u00b6 11, 977 P.2d 317, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b612 Moreover, it is well established that in reviewing a district court\u2019s findings, we do not consider whether the evidence could support a different finding; nor do we substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder regarding the weight given to the evidence. <em>In re L.</em>S., 2003 MT 12, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 42, \u00b6 10, 63 P.3d 497, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">\u00b613 This Court has stated, furthermore, that a natural parent\u2019s right to care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. Thus, before terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights, a district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement. The party seeking to terminate an individual\u2019s parental rights has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been met. <em>In re J. </em>N., \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to all three children?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">\u00b615 The Appellants argue that M. B., J. B., and W.B. were never properly adjudicated to be youths in need of care, a pre-requisite for termination of parental rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\u00b616  Section 41-3-609(1), MCA, authorizes a district court to order a termination of the parent-child legal relationship upon a finding, established by clear and convincing evidence, that circumstances exist as set forth in any of several subsections. The District Court terminated D. B.\u2019s parental rights to all three children based on subsection (f):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">(f) the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care and both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the following exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">(i) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parents or has not been successful; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">(ii) the conduct or condition of the parents rendering them unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. Thus, proof by clear and convincing evidence that the child was previously adjudicated a youth in need of care is a statutory precondition for terminating parental rights to the child under the statute. <em>See In re J.N., </em>\u00b6 12. \u201cThe adjudication of a child as a youth in need of care is a threshold requirement without which a court may not... terminate a person\u2019s parental rights under the statute.\u201d <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>2003 MT 241, \u00b6 22, 317 Mont. 291, \u00b6 22, 77 P.3d 189, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u00b617  Section 41-3-437, MCA, provides that a child\u2019s adjudication as a youth in need of care may occur upon a hearing in which the court determines the same by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 41-3-437(2), MCA; <em>In re A.M., </em>2001 MT 60, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 304 Mont. 379, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 22 P.3d 185, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45 (evidentiary standard for adjudication of child as youth in need of care different from the ultimate standard applied in parental termination cases).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such a hearing apparently did not occur in the present case. This Court has, however, recognized that the parents\u2019 stipulation that a child is a youth in need of care, when filed with the district court, may be treated as an adjudication for the purposes of \u00a7 41-3-437, MCA, and, therefore, may suffice for purposes of terminating parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609, MCA, although it should be \u201cclosely scrutinized.\u201d <em>In re Custody of M. </em>W., 2001 MT 78, \u00b6 47, 305 Mont. 80, \u00b6 47, 23 P.3d 206, \u00b6 47. Further, the 2001 Legislature enacted \u00a7 41-3-434(1), MCA, which authorizes a parent to stipulate that a child is a youth in need of care by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">\u00b618  The record herein reflects that Appellants twice stipulated that all three of their minor children were youths in need of care. First was the Stipulation to Temporary Legal Custody, filed on November <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>13, 2001, which was signed by, among others, both Appellants and their attorney. Appellants acknowledged therein that M. B., J. B., and W. B. were all youths in need of care. The District Court found therefrom that the minor children were youths in need of care and granted the Department\u2019s request for temporary legal custody by its order of December 19, 2001. Appellants again so stipulated in the Stipulation to Extension of Temporary Legal Custody, filed October 23, 2002. (\u201cThe children named above have been previously adjudicated Youths in Need of Care.... The parents ... stipulate and agree that... the State could prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the children ... continue to be Youths in need of care.\u201d) This latter stipulation set forth the evidentiary basis for such an adjudication in considerable detail. D. B. and her attorney signed this document, and though S. B. did not sign it, he agreed through his counsel in open court to the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b619 On the basis of these stipulations, \u00a7 41-3-434(1), MCA, and our holding in <em>Custody of M.W., </em>we conclude that the District Court properly adjudicated the minor children to be youths in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"AjO\">\u00b620 Appellants next argue that the District Court clearly erred in finding that D. B., the natural mother, did not successfully complete her tre\u00e1tment plan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b621 The Department presented D. B. with a treatment plan on November 13, 2001, and on December 19, 2001, the District Court ordered D. B. to complete the treatment plan. The plan stated its ultimate goal was \u201cto reunite [D. B.] with her children and for [D. B.] to demonstrate her ability to believe her children and protect them.\u201d The treatment plan identified three \u201cproblems\u201d related to D. B.\u2019s ability to provide emotional care and support to her children and otherwise to parent them in a manner conducive to their overall health and well-being. Each problem was accompanied by a \u201cgoal,\u201d which set forth the general criterion for success in addressing the problem, together with a series of specific \u201cclient objectives\u201d for meeting each goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b622 The District Court found that D. B. had failed to meet many of her objectives. For example, the treatment plan\u2019s Problem 1 states that D. B., having endured sexual molestation during her own childhood and having never received treatment for it, tended to minimize the effect such abuse had had on herself. Consequently, she was unable to empathize with and protect her own daughters when the eldest revealed to her the sexual abuse being perpetrated against them by S. B., some two years before the Department filed its first petition in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>matter. The goal which the treatment plan prescribed for D. B. in this regard was that she understand how being sexually abused had affected her ability to parent and to protect her children, and that she demonstrate empathy and appropriate care for her children regarding their sexual abuse issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b623  Citing the collective testimony of the witnesses presented at the termination hearing, documentary evidence, and information contained in the court file, the District Court found that D. B. had clearly failed to achieve this goal. The children\u2019s therapist, Laurie Bogart, testified that D. B. was disruptive and antagonistic in the two Department-sponsored meetings with her children, and failed to demonstrate empathy for, or understanding of, their suffering. Furthermore, D. B. often appeared skeptical in these meetings about her children\u2019s truthfulness regarding the abuse. As a result, D. B.\u2019s therapist, Billie Nelson, continually had to redirect their interactions down less volatile paths. The Department\u2019s social worker, Amy Rau, testified that in group therapy sessions D. B. made excuses for her husband\u2019s behavior towards her daughters, and that she continued to express doubts about the abuse. The District Court found that, taken together, these facts clearly indicated that D. B. had failed to achieve an empathetic understanding of her children\u2019s needs in the wake of their abuse at her husband\u2019s hands, the crucial objective of D. B.\u2019s treatment plan, and we conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in making this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b624 Appellants further argue that the District Court clearly erred in finding that D. B. was unable to change her condition within a reasonable time. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b625 As we previously noted, the District Court terminated D. B.\u2019s parental rights to her children pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA. This subsection requires a finding, not only (i) that the natural parent in question has not successfully completed her treatment plan, but also (ii) that the conduct or condition which renders the natural parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. For making this latter determination, \u00a7 41-3-609(2), MCA, provides guidance in the form of a non-exhaustive list of considerations. Among these is the natural parent\u2019s emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency, of such a duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the continuing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u00b626 The District Court referred in its factual findings to Dr. Paul Moomaw\u2019s diagnosis that D. B. was suffering from paranoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>personality disorder. At the termination hearing, D. B.\u2019s therapist, Ms. Nelson, testified that she disagreed with this diagnosis, preferring one of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) precipitated by the removal of the children from the family home. In response to questioning from the District Court, however, Ms. Nelson conceded that D. B. did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis, and that D. B.\u2019s condition was consistent with paranoid personality disorder, a mental illness which is extremely resistant to treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b627 The District Court also cited what it termed D. B.\u2019s long history of disregarding her children\u2019s needs, her exposure of the children to unreasonable risk, and her failure to protect them in determining that D. B. was unlikely to be able to parent her children adequately within a reasonable time. D. B. stipulated to the fact that her eldest daughter had disclosed to D. B. the continuing abuse she was suffering fully two years before the Department filed its initial petition in this case; the young woman herself confirmed this at the termination hearing. Furthermore, the District Court received testimony to the effect that other individuals, to whom D. B. allowed unsupervised access to her children, also had inflicted sexual abuse upon them with impunity. S. B., moreover, testified that he and his wife left the children at home alone for long periods in order to accept construction work in other cities.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b628  Given this evidence, we conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in finding that D. B.\u2019s unfitness to parent her children would not change within a reasonable time. We therefore hold that, based on its supported statutory findings, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating D. B.\u2019s parental rights to the children at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b629 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it terminated both the mother\u2019s and the father\u2019s parental rights to W. B.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b630 Appellants argue that the evidence regarding the abuse allegedly inflicted on W. B. was insufficient to support the District Court\u2019s finding that W.B., in particular, was a youth in need of care. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00b631 As noted previously, both S. B. and D. B. stipulated that all their minor children were youths in need of care. Moreover, the District Court found that W. B. had been a secondary victim of the abuse which S. B. inflicted on his sisters. Ms. Bogart, the children\u2019s therapist, testified that W. B. suffered anxiety and emotional trauma which originated in his father\u2019s abuse of his sisters, manifesting in regressive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>behavior, insomnia, and night-terrors. Ms. Bogart further opined that the family situation as a whole inhibited W. B.\u2019s normal development in childhood. We have previously held that \u00a7 41-3-101, et seq., MCA, grants to the district court the authority to make a determination of neglect and abuse as to all children in a family based on the policy that abuse of one child has a detrimental effect on the other children\u2019s development. <em>See In the Matter of T. Y. K. </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 91, 95-96, 598 P.2d 593, 595-96 (\u201ca parent does not have the privilege of inflicting brutal treatment upon each of his children in succession before they may individually obtain the protection of the state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b632  Thus, on the facts presented by this case, in which the Department has clearly demonstrated the emotional harm which S. B.\u2019s abuse of his daughters was causing his son, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating both Appellants\u2019 rights to W. B. based on the continuing sexual abuse which his sisters endured.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b633 <em>3. Did the District Court clearly err when it failed to approve a second treatment plan for D. B. after the District Court granted the Department an extension of its temporary legal custody of the </em>children?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b634 Appellants argue that, because several deadlines in the original treatment plan had already passed when the District Court extended the Department\u2019s temporary legal custody of the children, the District Court erred when it did not likewise extend the original treatment plan\u2019s deadlines. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\u00b635  We note, first, that the Department sought an extension of its temporary legal custody on the grounds that Appellants required more time to complete their respective treatment plans, and that Appellants stipulated to this fact in documents supporting the Department\u2019s motion. This action was consistent with the statutory preference for resolution of parenting problems and reunification of the family over termination of parental rights, insofar as reunification is in the best interests of the children at issue. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-3-101 and -102(25), MCA. Secondly, we note that Appellants requested no modification of the treatment plan\u2019s deadlines when the Department\u2019s extension was granted, and that this issue appears to have been raised for the first time before the District Court at the termination hearing. Third, it is clear from the order which terminated S. B.\u2019s and D. B.\u2019s parental rights that the District Court considered all their efforts to complete their treatment plans, not merely those which preceded the deadlines set forth therein, which appears to have been the intent of the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>in entering the stipulation. After all, the Department\u2019s stated reason in petitioning for an extension of its temporary legal custody was to allow Appellants more time to complete their treatment plans. Finally, Appellants have failed to cite any authority whatsoever which would oblige a District Court to modify a treatment plan when a parent has failed to meet its deadlines, as is the case here. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by not modifying the treatment plan in the manner advanced by Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b636 <em>4. Did the District Court err with regard to the father\u2019s treatment plan?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b637 Appellants argue that the District Court erred both in failing to approve the treatment plan which the Department offered to S. B. and in basing its decision to terminate his parental rights on this treatment plan. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b638 The District Court terminated S. B.\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we noted previously, \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), MCA, requires, in the first instance, \u201can appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court.\u201d This is precisely what Appellants\u2019 claim was lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">\u00b639  As a factual matter, their assertion is clearly wrong. The District Court both approved the Department\u2019s plan for S. B. prepared by the Department, and ordered him to complete it. Furthermore, S. B. himself stipulated to the fact that the Department had offered him a treatment plan, and confirmed this stipulation in his testimony at the termination hearing. He further testified to the fact that the District Court had ordered him to complete the plan. We thus conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in terminating S. B.\u2019s parental rights based on his failure to comply with the treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"Apy\">\u00b640 <em>5. Did the District Court err in finding that the social worker did not have a conflict of interest with the mother such as to warrant reversal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u00b641 D. B. argues that because the Department\u2019s social worker, Amy Rau, was the complaining witness in a criminal complaint against D. B., she had a conflict of interest which impeded D. B. in completing her treatment plan, and which warrants reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>\u00b642 The criminal complaint to which D. B. refers arose out of a disturbance which D. B. caused at the Department office. The record reflects that Ms. Rau summoned the police, and was later formally listed as the complaining witness when charges of disorderly conduct and attempted assault were filed against D. B. The District Court found that the restraining order which was subsequently issued as a condition of D. B.\u2019s release in this criminal matter forbade her from going to the Department\u2019s Hamilton office without the prior consent of the municipal court, but did not impede her ability to progress in her treatment plan. This finding is not challenged by Appellants on appeal. Given that D. B.\u2019s plan did not require her to report to the Department\u2019s Hamilton office or prevent her from communicating with Ms. Rau in places or by means other than those proscribed by the restraining order, we conclude that the District Court did not clearly err in finding no conflict of interest between Ms. Rau and D. B. arising out of this matter. .</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b643 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b490-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-13\"> Because providing the citation to the opinion which affirmed S.

This assertion is erroneous. Rather, the statute in question requires clear and convincing evidence that the child <em>has been adjudicated </em>a youth in need of care. This standard can be met by simply introducing the adjudication order, or by moving the district court to take judicial notice of its prior ruling. Section 41-3-437(2), MCA, provides the evidentiary standard for the prior adjudication: preponderance of the evidence. <em>See In re \u00c1.M., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b489-9\"> Although the District Court stated its belief that S.
