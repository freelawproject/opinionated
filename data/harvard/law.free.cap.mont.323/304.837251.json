Motarie argues that the State failed to prove an element necessary for finding him guilty of intimidation and tampering with witnesses. Sections 45-7-206 and 45-5-203, MCA (2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b62 Phil Iverson reported Motarie to the Turn in Poachers, or T.I.P. program, for allegedly poaching an elk on the Sun River Game Range-where hunting elk is illegal. The Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks established the T.I.P. program to give recreationists an easy way to report violations of fish, wildlife, or parks violations. Through the Cut Bank grapevine, Motarie learned that Iverson had reported Motarie to the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u00b63 Within one month after accusing Motarie, Iverson received a phone call from a person who did not identify himself, but whose voice Iverson recognized as Motarie\u2019s. Motarie told Iverson, \u201cYou\u2019re a dead mother fucker, [sic] you\u2019ll never live to see your next birthday.\u201d Motarie called again the next day, but said nothing. The jury found Motarie guilty of both intimidation under \u00a7 45-5-203, MCA (2001), and tampering with a witness under, \u00a7 45-7-206, MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u00b64 We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a criminal defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict to determine if the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Dahlin, </em>2004 MT 19, \u00b6 8, 319 Mont. 303, \u00b6 8, 84 P.3d 35, \u00b6 8. If, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, we will conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion. <em>State v. Dahlin, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">\u00b65 The intimidation statute provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-13\">Intimidation. (1) A person commits the offense of intimidation when, <em>with the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, </em>he communicates to another, under circumstances which reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out, a threat to perform without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>lawful authority any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">(a) inflict physical harm on the pei\u2019son threatened or any other person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">(b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">(c) commit any felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Section 45-5-203(1), MCA (2001) (emphasis added). The tampering with witnesses and informants statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Tampering with witnesses and informants. (1) A person commits the offense of tampering with witnesses and informants if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted, he <em>purposely or knowingly attempts to induce or otherwise cause a witness </em>or informant to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">(a) testify or inform falsely;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">(b) withhold any testimony, information, document, or thing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">(c) elude legal process summoning him to testify or supply evidence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-12\">(d) absent himself from any proceeding or investigation to which he has been summoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">Section 45-7-206(1), MCA (2001) (emphasis added). Citing <em>State v. Plenty Hawk </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 183, 948 P.2d 209, Motarie claims that the prosecution failed to prove that he acted with any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">\u00b66 Plenty Hawk was behind bars when he told the deputy he was going to \u201ckick [the deputy\u2019s] ass and terrorize [him] and his family.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 185, 948 P.2d at 210. By threatening the deputy with violence once released from his cell, Plenty Hawk would have made the deputy even more disposed to leaving Plenty Hawk in the cell. We concluded that the record lacked any evidence that the threats \u201cwere made for any particular purpose.\u201d <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 186, 948 P.2d at 211. Instead, the record showed nothing \u201cto indicate that Plenty Hawk\u2019s threats to [the deputy] were anything other than a continuation ofhis belligerent <em>attitude\u201d Plenty Hawk, </em>285 Mont. at 186-87, 948 P.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">\u00b67 Motarie asserts that, as in <em>Plenty Hawk, </em>the State failed to show his purpose in making his threats. Plenty Hawk was simply drunk and belligerent, but in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the record speaks of a more invidious purpose. Iverson was the central witness to the State\u2019s poaching case against Motarie. It could certainly be inferred that Motarie could have intended that his threats stop Iverson from cooperating with law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-16\">\u00b68  \u201c[C]riminal intent, being a state of mind, is rarely susceptible of direct or positive proof and therefore must usually be inferred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the facts testified to by witnesses and the circumstances as developed by the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Longstreth, </em>1999 MT 204, \u00b6 34, 295 Mont. 457, \u00b6 34, 984 P.2d 157, \u00b6 34 (quotation omitted). Seen in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a reasonable jury could have determined that Motarie intended to stop Iverson from continuing his cooperation in Motarie\u2019s prosecution and, thus, he had the requisite purpose for both the intimidation statute and the tampering with witnesses and informants statute. We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
