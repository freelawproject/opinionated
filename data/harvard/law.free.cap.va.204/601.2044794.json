Pullen, the defendant, seeking to recover damages for personal injuries allegedly sustained when an automobile operated by the plaintiff was in a collision with one operated by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">There have been two jury trials of this action. The first trial resulted in a verdict in favor of the defendant but, upon the motion of the plaintiff, the trial court set aside the verdict and awarded a new trial, \u201climited solely to the quantum of damages which the plaintiff is entitled to recover of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">At the second trial, a verdict was rendered by the jury in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $15,000.00. From the final order approving the second verdict, the defendant was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The sole question before us is whether the trial court erred in setting aside the first verdict. That being so, we will look only to the first trial and if the verdict there returned was improperly set aside, that verdict will be reinstated and all proceedings subsequent thereto will be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">The evidence at the first trial showed that the accident occurred at 5:45 p.m., after dark, on November 6, 1961, on U. S. highway number 60 in Alleghany county, approximately thirteen m\u00fces east of Clifton Forge. The collision took place during a heavy rainfall on a sharp curve on the western slope of North mountain where the highway, paved with asphalt, was steep and winding.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">The plaintiff, who was the public health officer for the counties of Alleghany, Bath and Highland, was travelling in an easterly direction up North mountain, en route from her office in Clifton Forge to her home in Lexington. The defendant, who resided in Newport News, was proceeding westerly down the mountain on her way to Clifton Forge.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">The plaintiff testified that she proceeded up the mountain at a speed of 25 to 30 miles per hour and that as she approached the curve in question, which bore to her left, she observed, through the trees, the lights of an approaching vehicle. She dimmed her headlights and as she reached the curve she saw the defendant\u2019s vehicle, \u201cdashing toward me in my lane.\u201d She said, \u201c[t]here was no time to do anything.\u201d The two vehicles collided in the plaintiff\u2019s lane of travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The defendant testified that she was familiar with the highway and with the particular curve where the accident occurred because she had travelled from Newport News to Clifton Forge at least twice a year for eighteen years. She said that her automobile was in excellent mechanical shape and that her tires were in good condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The defendant further testified that she had proceeded about one-fourth of the way down the mountain when she approached the curve in question, which bore to her right. She stated that she was then travelling at a speed of 25 miles per hour and that as she prepared to enter the curve she applied her brakes, reducing her speed, \u201cat least 5 or 6 miles an hour.\u201d She said that when she, \u201cgot into the swing of the curve\u201d she felt the rear of her car begin to skid and she, \u201capplied her brakes a little more\u201d but could not keep the vehicle from skidding and it went, \u201csidewise and forward\u201d across the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant testified that she told the investigating state trooper, on the night of the accident, that the only explanation she had for the accident was, \u201cthe weather, the rain.\u201d She stated that she told the trooper the next day that she might have skidded on some leaves on the highway because there were leaves, \u201cankle deep on the shoulder of the road\u201d and, \u201cthere must have been some on the hard surface.\u201d When pressed to tell the jury what caused the accident, she candidly admitted that she was unable to do so, but insisted that, \u201cshe had not slipped before\u201d and had, \u201cno reason to know that I was going to slip on this curve.\u201d She further said that she might have slipped on a grease spot on the road because, \u201cthey tell me that\u2019s possible.\u201d When asked whether the accident could have been avoided had she been driving more slowly she replied, \u201cit might have been avoided\u201d but later added, \u201cit\u2019s hardly possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The state trooper who investigated the accident testified that the road was wet and slippery; that a highway sign on the defendant\u2019s side of the curve indicated a maximum safe speed of 30 miles per hour; that the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle was damaged, \u201cin the center of the front\u201d and the defendant\u2019s vehicle on its right front, and that the positions and angles of the two vehicles, after the accident, were as shown on a diagram prepared by him and admitted into evidence. He also testified concerning the version of the accident given to him by the defendant, which did not conflict with that given by her at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">It was upon this evidence that the jury returned this significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>verdict, \u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant, Mrs. Pullen, not guilty of negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">But the crucial inquiry is, was the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence one for the jury to decide?</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Here, the accident occurred on the plaintiff\u2019s side of the highway. When that fact was shown, a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence was made out against the defendant, and the burden was cast upon her to explain how she came to be on the wrong side of the road. She was required to produce evidence, acceptable to the jury, tending to show that she was on the plaintiff\u2019s side of the highway because of something other than her own negligence. <em>Early </em>v. <em>Mathena, Adm\u2019r, </em>203 Va. 330, 334, 335, 124 S. E. 2d 183; <em>Bedget </em>v. <em>Lewin, </em>202 Va. 535, 539, 118 S. E. 2d 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The defendant\u2019s evidence was sufficient if it outweighed the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case or if it left the ultimate question of her negligence in equipoise. These were questions for the jury unless the evidence produced in explanation was such that reasonable men should not differ as to its effect; unless the evidence in explanation was unreasonable, as a matter of law, or was inherently incredible. When all of the evidence was in, the ultimate burden remained upon the plaintiff to prove that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>202 Va. 941, 946, 947, 121 S. E. 2d 364; <em>Interstate Veneer Co. </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>191 Va. 107, 114, 60 S. E. 2d 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The defendant\u2019s explanation was that her automobile skidded from its proper lane of travel to the opposite lane. The skidding of an automobile on a slippery highway is not negligence, in and of itself, but is a circumstance to be considered along with all the other evidence in determining whether the resulting accident was caused by negligence. <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>204 Va. 36, 38, 129 S. E. 2d 19; <em>Crist v. Coach Company, </em>196 Va. 642, 650, 85 S. E. 2d 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">The principal inquiry, in such cases, is as to the driver\u2019s conduct prior to the skidding. The purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether the skidding resulted from the negligence of the driver. The test is that of due care, having regard to the duty of the driver to exercise increased caution in the face of the known and obvious dangerous condition of the highway. And such questions, too, are ordinarily for the jury to decide. <em>Whitley </em>v. <em>Patterson, supra, </em>204 Va., at pp. 38, 39; 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Automobiles, etc., \u00a7 689, p. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">In the case before us, the defendant consistently maintained that her vehicle skidded from its proper lane of travel. Her testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>in that respect was unshaken. She testified fully as to her conduct prior to the skidding. She insisted that her vehicle had not skidded before and that she had no reason to know that it was going to skid on the curve in question. She told the jury what her speed was before the accident and what she did in an attempt to control her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We are of opinion that the defendant\u2019s evidence was of such character that reasonable men might differ as to its effect; that her explanation was neither unreasonable, as a matter of law, nor inherently incredible. A proper situation was presented for the jury to decide whether it would accept or reject the defendant\u2019s explanation. It was for the jury to say whether the defendant, in the exercise of due care under the circumstances, should have driven more slowly, should have applied her brakes sooner, or should have taken other measures to avoid the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We do not overlook the fact that the verdict rendered at the first trial has been disapproved by the trial court and is not, therefore, entitled to the same weight on appeal as a verdict that has been approved. But by its verdict, the jury has found that the defendant\u2019s vehicle was on its wrong side of the highway because it skidded there and that the skidding was caused by something other than the defendant\u2019s negligence. That finding is supported by credible evidence and we cannot say, and the trial court should not have ruled, that the jury\u2019s finding was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Accordingly, the first verdict will be here reinstated, judgment will be entered thereon for the defendant and all proceedings subsequent to the first verdict will be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
