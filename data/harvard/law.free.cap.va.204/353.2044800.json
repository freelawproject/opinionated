Sproles instituted an action against Donald deY. Freeman, Gates Enterprises, Inc., Donlee East Corporation, Donlee Construction Corporation and Cosine Realty Corporation, jointly and severally, for $50,000 compensatory plus $50,000 exemplary damages. She alleged in her motion for judgment that Freeman was the agent and servant of the defendant corporations and was acting within his scope of employment on March 12, 1962, when Freeman did wilfully and maliciously assault and strike her causing personal injuries and that he did maliciously falsely imprison and detain her, all without provocation on her part. The trial court sustained a motion of defendants to quash service on defendant Gates Enterprises, Inc. and an order was entered which changed the style of the case to read: \u201cLois L. Sproles, plaintiff vs Donald deY. Freeman, Donlee East Corporation and Cosine Realty Corporation, said corporations being partners trading as The Gates Enterprises, and Donlee Construction Corporation, Defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">A trial by jury was had. At the conclusion of defendants\u2019 evidence, the trial court sustained a motion of defendant Donlee Construction Corporation to strike plaintiff\u2019s evidence as to it, and summary judgment was entered in favor of that defendant. Over the objection and exception of .defendants the court sustained a motion of plaintiff to strike defendants\u2019 evidence as to liability, and the case was then submitted to the jury on the question of damages only. After deliberation the jury returned their verdict for plaintiff in a form the court did not consider proper. This verdict is not a part of or quoted in the record before us. But as a result thereof the following colloquy ensued between the court, counsel and some of the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cThe Court: Say, \u2018We, the jury, find for the plaintiff in the amounts as follows against,\u2019 and name the three and if you get that space, names of the three parties involved here, then when you get down to punitive, repeat the name of Mr. Freeman, and whoever wrote the verdict, say \u2018Compensatory.\u2019 Say, \u2018We, the jury, find for the plaintiff in the amount as follows against\u2019 write the word \u2018against\u2019 use these three names and then you use the Freeman name as to punitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cAt this time a juror is writing the verdict in the manner as described by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201cThe clerk is handing the verdict to the court again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cThe Court: You have Realty Corporation, Donlee Corporation and Gates Enterprises. Gates is out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cMr. Israel Steingold: May I suggest, if it\u2019s for the plaintiff on compensatory damages, the way it should read: \u2018We, the jury find for the plaintiff against Freeman and the two corporations trading as Gates Enterprises,\u2019 and that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s the way it is. Do you mean to find an additional $5,500.00 against Freeman or a total of $5,500.00 against Freeman? In other words, you have $4,500.00 against the other defendants. Then you include down on the bottom punitive damages against Donald Freeman, the sum of $5,500.00. Do you mean you have $4,500.00 against Freeman for compensatory and an additional $5,500.00, or do you mean a thousand dollars more than the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201cA Juror: That\u2019s correct, $5,500.00 against Donald Freeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-10\">\u201cThe Court: That would be what you intend he should pay, $5,500.00 in all fox his activities and the others $4,500.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201cSeveral Jurors: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-12\">\u201cThe Court: Let the record show that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-13\">\u201cMr. Israel Steingold: That can\u2019t be a proper verdict in this case. That couldn\u2019t be a proper verdict in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-14\">\u201cThe Court: Why couldn\u2019t it be? Add compensatory and punitive, $5,500.00 right in front of the word \u2018punitive,\u2019 compensatory and against him and that will be what will be found against him. You don\u2019t have to mention what part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-15\">\u201cMr. Maurice Steingold: I take it from the reading, it\u2019s a total of $10,000.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-16\">\u201cThe Court: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-17\">\u201cMr. Maurice Steingold: If it\u2019s compensatory, it should be the three defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-18\">\u201cThe Court: He\u2019s got it that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-19\">\u201cMr. Halpern: I thought the juror stated that he found\u2014that the jury found in the amount of $5,500.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-20\">\u201cThe Court: $5,500.00. In other words, they found every body $4,500.00 and against Freeman a thousand dollars more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-21\">\u201cA Juror: $5,500.00, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-22\">\u201cThe Court: You didn\u2019t mean to say ten thousand against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-23\">\u201cA Juror: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-24\">\u201cMr. Maurice Steingold: Total of $10,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cMr. Maurice Steingold: May we see the verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201cThe Court: Freeman is not to pay ten thousand; he\u2019s to pay forty-five hundred and one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cMr. Israel Steingold: Now, the way this is, they have left him out of the corporations and technically speaking it\u2019s the jury\u2019s verdict, but I\u2019m afraid on appeal this might be so confused, it might have to go back to a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201cThe Court: The record shows how the jury answered. The total of $10,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u201cMr. Israel Steingold: The way it\u2019s set up, it\u2019s got to be wrong; it\u2019s got to be fifty-five hundred against Freeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">\u201cThe Court: For both compensatory and punitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">\u201cMr. Israel Steingold: If it\u2019s the understanding that it\u2019s ten thousand, then this will be alright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">\u201cA Juror: The fifty-five hundred has nothing to do with the corporation; that\u2019s strictly against Donald Freeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-14\">\u201cMr. Halpern: Say that again please sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-15\">\u201cA Juror: The $5,500.00 is strictly against Donald Freeman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-16\">\u201cThe Court: Both compensatory and punitive, I think the record shows it clear after the conversation. I\u2019ll read it. Compensatory and punitive $5,500.00. We, the jury, find for the plaintiff in the amounts as follows: Compensatory damages against Realty Corporation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-17\">\u201cMr. Halpern: Against\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-18\">\u201cThe Court: Against Gates Enterprises sum of $4,500.00. Against those three' corporations and compensatory and punitive damages against Donald Freeman, sum of $5,500.00. Is this your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-19\">\u201cThe jurors answered affirmatively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-20\">The final verdict of the jury, written in the courtroom after receiving from the court the verbal instructions hereinbefore mentioned, was in these words and figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-21\">\u201cWe the jury find for the plaintiff, for the amounts as follows: Compensatory against Cosine Realty Corporation, Donlee East Corporation and Gates Enterprises the sum of $4,500.00\u2014 Compensatory and Punitive against Donald Freeman the sum of $5,500.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-22\">The defendants\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict as being contrary to the law and evidence was overruled, to which action of the court defendants excepted. The judgment order entered on the verdict, which was excepted to and appealed from reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-23\">\u201cWhereupon it is considered by the Court that said <em>plaintiff re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>cover against said defendants the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars </em>($10,000.00), $4,500.00 of which are compensatory damages only against the defendants, Cosine Realty Corporation, Donlee East Corporation and <em>Gates Enterprises, Inc., </em>and $5,500.00 of which are compensatory and punitive damages against the defendant, Freeman, # # #.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Although the defendants have made a number of assignments of error we are of opinion that it is only essential that we decide the question whether the court erred in entering this judgment on the verdict as returned by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">It is not clear to us from the colloquy above quoted exactly what the jury intended as their verdict although they did assent to it as amended in open court. The verdict as rendered was irregular and improper, because by it the jury undertook to apportion compensatory damages among the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>166 Va. 374, 185 S. E. 873, the plaintiff was awarded a joint judgment against a master and his servant for personal injuries received while riding in a vehicle owned by the master and driven by the servant. We held, among other things, that while the master and the servant \u201cmay not be joint tort-feasors in the strict sense\u201d their liability to the plaintiff was joint and several and the same principles were applicable. 166 Va. at p. 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">In 52 Am. Jur., Torts, \u00a7 123, p. 458 it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">\u201c* # # indeed in the absence of statutory authorization, no apportionment of compensatory damages may be made between joint tort-feasors, and in actions against two or more persons for a single tort, it is improper to return two verdicts for different sums against different defendants upon the same trial; there may be only one verdict for a single sum against all who are found guilty of the tort, irrespective of the degree of culpability. This is true even though the defendants plead separately, or are charged with distinct and different acts contributing to the injury. The restriction applies as well where the damages claimed are for an injury to property as where an invasion of personal rights is the wrong complained of.\u201d See also 89 C. J. S., Trial, \u00a7 508, p. 182.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">And in 108 A. L. R. Anno. pp. 793, 794 it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">\u201cThus, when an action is against several joint tort-feasors, if the finding is against all of them, the verdict should be a single verdict against all for a single sum, and not a several verdict against each defendant either in the same or separate sums; there can be no appor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tionment of damages as between defendants jointly liable in such a case.* * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We said in <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Schneller, </em>148 Va. 573, 581, 139 S. E. 275:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cWhatever the decisions elsewhere, the true rule in this jurisdiction is, that, with one exception (where no harm is done a defendant), in an action against several for a single wrong, the verdict should be a joint one against all found guilty. * # *\u201d See also <em>Southern Ry. Co. </em>v. Fitzpatrick, 129 Va. 246, 252, 105 S. E. 663; <em>Remine and Meade </em>v. <em>Whited, </em>180 Va. 1, 21 S. E. 2d 743; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Appalachian Constructors, </em>138 W. Va. 437, 76 S. E. 2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Here, the verdict should have been a joint one for compensatory damages against all defendants and included a separate finding against defendant Freeman for punitive damages, instead of apportioning compensatory damages among the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Aside from the fact that the verdict was improper, the judgment entered thereon was not in \u00e1ccordance with it. The trial court correctly ruled that the corporate defendants trading as The Gates Enterprises were not liable for punitive damages. This is true because such damages \u201ccannot be awarded against a master or principal for the wrongful act of his servant or agent in which he did not participate, and which he did not authorize or ratify.\u201d <em>Hogg </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>145 Va. 175, 181, 133 S. E. 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The judgment rendered is not clear and unambiguous. The first part of it contains these words: \u201cWhereupon it is considered by the Court that said plaintiff recover against said defendants the sum of # * * (|io,000.00)..\u201d That means a judgment for that amount against all defendants and it necessarily includes punitive damages against the corporate defendants for which the court had ruled they were not liable. Following this recitation the order reads that 14,500.00 of this amount \u201care compensatory damages only against the defendants, Cosine Realty Corporation, Donlee East Corporation and Gates Enterprises, Inc., and f5,500.00 of which are compensatory and punitive damages against the defendant, Freeman, * * *.\u201d The provisions are conflicting and we cannot say with certainty what amounts are collectible from the defendants. Moreover the judgment rendered is against \u201cGates Enterprises, Inc.\u201d instead of \u201cGates Enterprises\u201d as contained in the verdict. Service upon that corporation was quashed before trial of the case and it was no longer a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Since it is not clear from the colloquy what the jury intended as their verdict and since the verdict itself is improper in that it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>portioned compensatory damages and because the judgment rendered on the verdict is defective, our conclusion is that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
