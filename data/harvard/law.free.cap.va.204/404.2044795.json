One of the routes permitted by the certificate is from \u201cRichmond over U. S. Highway 1 to junction with Virginia Highway 10, thence over Virginia Highway 10 to Hopewell, and return via Virginia Highway 10 to U. S. Highway 1, thence over U. S. Highway 1 to junction with Virginia Highway 621, thence Virginia Highway 621 to La Crosse, serving stations on its line at Richmond, Hopewell, Petersburg, # #</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Seaboard\u2019s application to amend certificate No. F-773 requested that it be permitted to operate from Hopewell to Petersburg and return over Virginia Highway No. 36 as an alternate route but serving no intermediate points. The stated reason was that the \u201cproposed service would be more economical in that it would reduce the number of miles operated to serve these points.\u201d The record shows that by using this alternate route distance of travel would be reduced by approximately 13 miles per trip and about 15 minutes in time would be saved, which would result in an annual savings of $310 to the railroad. Seaboard had sought to obtain authorization for its trucks to operate over Virginia Highway No. 36 in its application for the original certificate in 1958, but it was refused without any reason being stated by the Commission. Since that time the Interstate Commerce Commission has issued Seaboard a certificate which permits the use of this highway to haul interstate less than carload freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">At the hearing on the application, before any evidence was adduced, counsel for Richmond-Petersburg Freight Lines, Incorporated', which had intervened in opposition to Seaboard\u2019s application, moved for a dismissal of the application as a matter of law. He contended, among other things, that under the provisions of \u00a7 56-287.1 the truck route must generally parallel the applicant\u2019s railroad line; that Seaboard has no railroad operation between Petersburg and Hopewell generally parallel to Virginia Highway No. 36, and that the statute was not applicable. After argument by counsel, the Commission expressed the opinion that the motion should be sustained. Whereupon, counsel for Seaboard asked permission to submit testimony to show public convenience and necessity for purposes of appeal and he was allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>to do so with the understanding that such evidence was not to be considered by the Commission. This evidence was not considered and the order of August 16, 1962, appealed from dismissed Seaboard\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Here, Seaboard challenges the correctness of the Commission\u2019s action in dismissing its application for the certificate sought as a matter of law without considering evidence as to whether the public convenience and necessity require the proposed service. The question presented involves a construction of \u00a7 56-287.1. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">\u201cThe Commission, shall, upon a showing of public convenience and necessity, notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 56-281 of the Code of Virginia, issue to any common carrier by railroad or any common carrier by express, upon its application therefor, a certificate as a restricted common carrier to operate motor vehicles upon the highways of the State for the transportation of property, which transportation shall be auxiliary to or supplemental of rail or express service, such certificate to show the stations between which the operation is to be conducted, and a warrant or warrants identifying the trucks or vehicles to be used in such operation which shall be limited to less than carload freight or express in the cas\u00e9 of a railroad as a substitute for transportation by rail from freight station or express station to freight station or express station on its line of railroad on railroad bills of lading or express receipts, and in the case of an express company, as a substitute for transportation by rail from express station to express station on any line of railroad on express receipts, at the published railroad or express tariff charges, whichever may be applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">By sustaining the motion of Richmond-Petersburg Freight Lines, Inc., to dismiss Seaboard\u2019s application, the Commission held in effect that \u00a7 56-287.1 requires that the highways which are used by the railroad\u2019s motor vehicles between freight stations must parallel or generally parallel its line of railroad. Seaboard has a circuitous line between Hopewell and Petersburg, but since it has no line of railroad between the two cities which parallels or generally parallels Virginia Highway No. 36, its application was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Here, appellees argue, among other things, that the key to the interpretation of the statute is found in the words \u201cauxiliary to or supplemental of rail or express service\u201d and \u201ca substitute for transportation by rail from freight station or express station to freight station or express station on its line of railroad.\u201d They say that when these words are given their natural meanings and read in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>with the entire statute it is clear that the Commission\u2019s order was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We have not heretofore had occasion to construe \u00a7 56-287.1. We are of opinion that its provisions are clear and unequivocal. Hence, the rules of construction do not come into play. <em>Town of South Hill </em>v. Allen, 177 Va. 154, 164-5, 12 S. E. 2d 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Upon application of a railroad and upon a showing of public convenience and necessity, notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 56-281, the Commission is required to issue a restricted common carrier certificate to the railroad \u201cto operate motor vehicles upon the highways of the State for the transportation of property.\u201d The restrictions or limitations set forth in the statute are that the truck transportation shall be (1) \u201cauxiliary to or supplemental of rail or express service\u201d, (2) \u201climited to less than carload freight or express\u201d, (3) \u201cas a substitute for transportation by rail from freight station * * * to freight station * * * on its line of railroad\u201d, and (4) \u201con railroad bills of lading # # * at the published railroad <em>* </em>* # tariff charges, # <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The phrase \u201cauxiliary to or supplemental of rail or express service\u201d merely means that the transportation shall be related to rail service. The language \u201cas a substitute for transportation by rail from freight station * * * to freight station # * * on its line of railroad\u201d requires that the substituted transportation by motor vehicles shall be between the railroad\u2019s freight stations which are on its line of railroad and it does not require that the highway route shall generally parallel the railroad line. The words \u201con its fine of railroad\u201d relate to and modify freight stations and not \u201cthe highways of the State\u201d found in the first part of the statute. Such transportation is precluded between a freight station on the fine of one railroad to stations not on its fine of railroad. In the present case Seaboard has freight stations at Hopewell and Petersburg which are on its fine of railroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The statute does not state that the highway routes to be used shall parallel, generally parallel or be reasonably distant from the railroad\u2019s fine. Had the General Assembly intended this to be a requirement it could have stated so in appropriate words. However, we do not mean to say that highway routes sought by railroads for substituted service are not a factor to be considered by the Commission in determining whether public convenience and necessity exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">Public convenience and. necessity r a question of fact and must be proved by the evidence. It is an issue addressed to the sound dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>cretion of the Commission. <em>Seaboard Air Line R. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 799, 807, 809, 71 S. E. 2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Our conclusion is that the Commission has authority under \u00a756-287.1 to issue the amended certificate requested, subject to the express limitations, provided public convenience and necessity is shown, and that the Commission erred in dismissing Seaboard\u2019s application as a matter of law. It should have heard and considered evidence as to whether public convenience and necessity exists for the use of the alternate route and made a factual determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The order appealed from is, therefore, reversed and the case is remanded to the Commission with direction that it hear evidence on the question of public convenience and necessity in order for it to decide whether the requested certificate should be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
