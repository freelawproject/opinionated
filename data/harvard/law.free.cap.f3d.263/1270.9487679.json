Scott raises only one issue on appeal. He argues that the felony-in-possession statute is an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power because possession of a firearm by a convicted felon is not conduct which has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. In support of his position, he relies on <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). For the reasons stated below, we reject his constitutional challenge and affirm his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-18\">We review the constitutionality of statutes <em>de novo. See United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2000). The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution states in pertinent part: \u201cThe Congress shall have the power ... [t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several states.\u201d U.S. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b1315-19\">Under the framework established by <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>Congress permissibly may regulate three broad categories of activity under the Commerce Clause. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. <em>Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. at 1629. Second, the Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>state commerce, even if the threat may derive only from intrastate activities. <em>See id., </em>115 S.Ct. at 1629. Lastly, Congress\u2019 commerce power includes the authority to regulate activities with a \u201csubstantial relation to interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-4\">When <em>Lopez </em>was convicted of violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q), the Supreme Court reversed his conviction and invalidated the statute, reasoning that \u00a7 922(q) was an invalid exercise of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power. <em>Lopez </em>identified at least three considerations in analyzing 922(q). First, the Court found that \u201c[w]here economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 115 S.Ct. at 1630. Because \u00a7 922(q) was \u201ca criminal statute that by its terms ha[d] nothing to do with \u2018commerce\u2019 or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms,\u201d the Court found that the statute could not be sustained as a regulation of activities which, viewed in the aggregate, have a substantial affect on interstate commerce. <em>Lopez, </em>514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31. Second, the Court found it dispositive that \u00a7 922(q) contained \u201cno express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 115 S.Ct. at 1631. Third, the <em>Lopez </em>Court cited its concern that neither \u00a7 922(q) \u201c \u2018nor its legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone\u2019.\u201d <em>Id., </em>115 S.Ct. at 1631. Based on these three deficiencies pertaining to \u00a7 922(q), the Supreme Court invalidated the statute as an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 commerce power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-5\">In <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387 (11th Cir.1996), we examined, and rejected, the argument that, under <em>Lopez\u2019s </em>reasoning, \u00a7 922(g)(1) also exceeds Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power. We reasoned that, unlike the Gun Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q), at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>the felon-in-possession statute has an express jurisdictional element, <em>see id. </em>at 389-90, and is an explicit \u201cregulation o\u00ed] guns that have a connection to interstate commerce.\u201d Indeed, section 922(g)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1316-6\">It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1316-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Because \u00a7 922(g)(1) makes it a crime for a felon to \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u201d we held that this \u201cjurisdictional element defeats [a] facial challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1).\u201d <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">Likewise, we rejected McAllister\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was invalid, as applied to him, because the government did not demonstrate how his purely intrastate possession of a firearm affected interstate commerce. We reasoned that because \u00a7 922(g) explicitly applies to guns that have a connection to interstate commerce, and the government demonstrated that the firearm at issue in McAllister had traveled in interstate commerce, the statute was not unconstitutional, as applied to him. <em>See id. </em>at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>Scott argues that <em>McAllister </em>has been abrogated by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), and <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000). He argues that <em>Jones </em>and <em>Morrison </em>establish that Congress may only regulate activities with a substantial effect on interstate commerce. We find his argument unpersuasive, as nothing in <em>Morrison </em>or <em>Jones </em>alters the reasoning upon which <em>McAllister </em>is moored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">In <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658, former university students brought suit under the Violence Against Women Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13981, which states that \u201c[a]ll persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 13981(b). The defendant-university claimed that \u00a7 13981 exceeded Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power, the district court agreed and dismissed the suit, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-6\">In the <em>Morrison </em>decision, the Supreme Court reiterated the three broad categories of activity that Congress permissibly may regulate under the Commerce Clause, but concluded that, just as with \u00a7 922(q) at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>only the third category\u2014 Congress\u2019 power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce\u2014 could sustain the Violence Against Women Act. <em>Id. </em>at 609, 120 S.Ct. at 1749. The Court found that \u201c[l]ike the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in <em>Lopez, </em>\u00a7 13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress\u2019 power to regulate interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612, 120 S.Ct. at 1751. While \u00a7 13981 was accompanied by \u201cnumerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families,\u201d the Court found these findings insufficient to establish that the regulated activity substantially affected interstate commerce. <em>See id. </em>at 614, 120 S.Ct. at 1752. Instead, the Court explained that \u201c[wjhether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question, and can be settled finally only by th[e] Court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>120 S.Ct. at 1752. Finding that \u00a7 13891 was not directed at the regulation and punishment of \u201cintrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce,\u201d <em>Morrison </em>struck down the statute as an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-8\"><em>Morrison </em>does not alter our analysis in <em>McAllister. </em>As we noted in <em>McAllister, </em>the jurisdictional element of the statute, <em>i.e., </em>the requirement that the felon \u201cpossess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u201d immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from Scott\u2019s facial constitutional attack. In <em>McAllister, </em>we relied on the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) to sustain the statute under <em>Lopez. Morrison </em>does not compel us to reach a different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-9\">Similarly, <em>Jones </em>does not alter <em>McAllister </em>or otherwise invalidate \u00a7 922(g). In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the federal arson statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(i), did not reach arson of an owner-occupied residence that is not used for any commercial purpose because such property could not be said to be \u201cused in ... any activity affecting commerce,\u201d as required by the statute. <em>Jones, </em>529 U.S. at 859, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>S.Ct. at 1912. The holding of <em>Jones </em>was an issue of statutory construction, which was buttressed by the long-standing principle that constitutional dilemmas must be avoided, where possible. <em>See id. </em>at 858, 120 S.Ct. at 1911. The Court recognized that under the <em>Lopez </em>rubric, a constitutional question would arise by \u201creading] \u00a7 844(i) to render the \u2018traditionally local criminal conduct,\u2019 in which petitioner <em>Jones </em>engaged \u2018a matter for federal enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>120 S.Ct. at 1912. In order to avoid this constitutional problem, the Court refused to read \u00a7 844(i) to encompass the crime of arson of a owner-occupied personal residence. <em>Jones </em>purely statutory holding likewise does not alter <em>McAllister.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1318-4\">Neither <em>Morrison </em>nor <em>Jones </em>modifies our decision in <em>McAllister, </em>upholding the felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), under Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause power. This conclusion is consistent with that of each court of appeals that has examined the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) after <em>Jones </em>and <em>Morrison. See, e.g., United States v. Stuckey, 255 </em>F.3d 528 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>238 F.3d 213, 216-17 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 585-86 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Napier, </em>233 F.3d 394, 399-402 (6th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Wesela, </em>223 F.3d 656, 659-60 (7th Cir.2000). For these reasons, we reaffirm McAllister\u2019s holding that as long as the weapon in question has a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce, \u00a7 922(g)(1) is constitutional. <em>See McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-5\">To effectuate a constitutional conviction under \u00a7 922(g)(1), <em>McAllister </em>requires the government to demonstrate that the firearm possessed traveled in interstate commerce. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1215 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344 (11th Cir.1998). Here, the interstate nexus was demonstrated by the government when Special Agent Steve Kosch with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms testified that the .25 caliber Raven Arms semiautomatic pistol that Scott possessed was manufactured in California and had moved in interstate commerce to Georgia where Scott was caught with the weapon. Such evidence is sufficient to demonstrate the required nexus to interstate commerce. Accordingly, to the extent Scott raises an as applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1), we reject this argument as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-8\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1315-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-15\">(g) It shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1315-16\">(1) who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
