(Further section references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise specified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">On appeal, plaintiffs claim section 3482.5 does not apply because the statute \u201cwas never intended to bar [an action] by one farmer against another farmer\u201d; rather, its purpose is to preclude suburban dwellers from seeking to enjoin neighboring agricultural practices. In plaintiffs\u2019 words, the statute \u201cwas only intended to bar claims by non-agricultural uses \u2018coming to the nuisance\u2019 \u201d as a result of \u201curban crawl.\u201d Defendants retort the plain language of section 3482.5 precludes any lawsuit that attempts to enjoin a lawful, commercial agricultural activity that meets the requisites of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">We agree with defendants\u2019 construction of section 3482.5. As we will explain, the plain meaning of the section\u2019s unambiguous language does not limit its preclusive effect to nuisance actions commenced by nonagricultural plaintiffs. The statute applies broadly to bar a nuisance action, such as this, brought by one commercial agricultural entity against another commercial agricultural entity. We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 claim that their switch from rice to row crops does not constitute a changed condition within the meaning of section 3482.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">In the unpublished portion of our opinion, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">Plaintiff Mary DeMatos is the owner of real property (the DeMatos parcel) near the Sacramento International Airport. DeMatos and her husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>farmed the property since 1945. Prior to the 1970\u2019s, they planted row crops; thereafter, and until 1988, they planted rice.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">DeMatos\u2019s husband died in 1988. Since then, her daughter, plaintiff Janet Souza, and son-in-law, plaintiff Martin Souza, have managed the DeMatos parcel. In 1988, the Souzas hired plaintiffs Joe Perry, Joaquin Perry and John Perry to farm row crops on the DeMatos parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Defendants are owners and lessees of real property which borders the DeMatos parcel to the north and east. They began farming rice on their property as early as 1983. At that time, the DeMatos parcel also was being used for rice farming.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Sometime after plaintiffs shifted to planting row crops on the DeMatos parcel in 1988, they begin to notice that, when defendants\u2019 neighboring rice fields were flooded, the portion of the DeMatos parcel closest to defendants\u2019 land became so wet it could not be farmed properly in row crops. Plaintiffs also noticed that the timing of defendants\u2019 flooding and subsequent drainage coincided with water intrusion under and onto the DeMatos parcel. They attributed the reduced yields from their sugar beets and safflower crops to excessive seepage of water from defendants\u2019 rice growing activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Plaintiffs sued. Their complaint states three untitled \u201ccauses of action.\" The first alleges negligence against each defendant \u201cfor allowing excessive amount[s] of water to seep under and onto plaintiffs\u2019 land,\u201d resulting in property damages and lost profits from plaintiffs\u2019 farming operations. The second seeks to enjoin defendants\u2019 conduct alleged in the first cause of action. The third asserts that defendants\u2019 failures to refrain from the actions alleged in the first cause of action constitute unlawful business practices and unfair competition in violation of California Business and Professions Code sections 17200 through 17208.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint constitutes a nuisance action and, as such, is precluded by section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo agricultural activity . . . conducted or maintained for commercial purposes, and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the locality, after it has been in operation for more than three years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">It is undisputed that plaintiffs did not notice any water intrusion onto their property due to defendants\u2019 rice farming until after plaintiffs switched from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>growing rice to growing row crops in 1988. Defendants also submitted as undisputed the following facts: Their rice farming is an agricultural activity conducted for commercial purposes in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality, has been ongoing for more than three years, and was not a nuisance at the time it began in 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 papers disputed the last material fact. In their response to defendants\u2019 statements of undisputed facts, plaintiffs stated they \u201cdo not dispute the manner of [defendants\u2019] rice farming, only that [the] rice farming causes water intrusion onto plaintiff[s\u2019] property and has done so since its inception\u201d; [Defendants\u2019] [r]ice farming did constitute a nuisance at the time rice farming began but not [sz'c] damage occurred until later.\u201d Plaintiffs attached the declaration of a civil engineer, stating his opinion that water has intruded from defendants\u2019 property onto the DeMatos parcel since defendants first flooded their fields for rice farming, but that plaintiffs and their predecessors \u201cmay not have been aware of the severity of the water intrusion due to the fact that Mr. DeMatos, Mary DeMatos\u2019s husband, for several years farmed the subject property to rice and therefore the water intrusion would not have been noticeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In addition to asserting that defendants failed to satisfy the requisites of section 3482.5 because their rice farming was a nuisance when it started, plaintiffs argued the statute does not bar this action because (1) legislative history indicates the section was intended only to provide a \u201ccoming to the nuisance\u201d defense to actions brought as a result of \u201curban crawl,\u201d and (2) plaintiffs\u2019 change from rice to row crops is not a \u201cchanged condition in or about the locality\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Thus, plaintiffs argued, the seepage of water onto plaintiffs\u2019 property gives rise to tort liability under a variety of theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The trial court found that, regardless of how they are denominated, plaintiffs\u2019 claims for relief are \u201cin fact based on a theory of nuisance\u201d because they allege the violation of a single primary right, i.e., plaintiffs\u2019 right to the unimpaired ownership and undisturbed enjoyment of their premises. Concluding that section 3482.5 \u201cclearly applies to this factual scenario,\u201d the court held the statute bars plaintiffs\u2019 action because the undisputed facts establish the following: Defendants had been growing rice for more than three years prior to 1989; they did so for a commercial purpose and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards in the locality; during the same time period, plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor had grown rice exclusively; and \u201cplaintiffs changed their use of the land in 1989\u201d by commencing to grow crops other than rice. Accordingly, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>granted defendants\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment on the ground they had met their burden of showing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint has no merit because there is a complete defense to the action. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subds. (c) &amp; (o)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We first address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that section 3482.5 does not preclude this action because the statute \u201cwas never intended to bar claims of water intrusion from one farmer against another farmer\u201d but \u201cwas only intended to bar claims by non-agricultural uses \u2018coming to the nuisance\u2019. . . .\u201d  As the applicability of a statute to a given situation is a question of law, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>(Southern California Edison Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 652, 659, fn. 8 [102 Cal.Rptr. 766, 498 P.2d 1014].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">After reciting the history of urban expansion following World War II and asserting that, when suburban areas expanded into agricultural areas, residents \u201csuddenly discovered the disadvantages of adjacent agricultural enterprises,\u201d plaintiffs claim the \u201cimagined threat\u201d of lawsuits against agricultural enterprises by their new suburban neighbors was the sole impetus for the enactment of section 3482.5. To support this claim, they ask us to take judicial notice of various documents purportedly representing the statute\u2019s \u201clegislative history,\u201d from which we are urged to glean the statute\u2019s meaning. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 451-455, 459.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">For reasons whiph follow, we shall deny plaintiffs\u2019 request for judicial notice and reject their interpretation of section 3482.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">In construing a statute, a court must ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].) To determine legislative intent, we first examine the words of the statute. \u201c \u2018If there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u201cthen the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d [Citation.] \u201cWhere the statute is clear, courts will not \u2018interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Lennane </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Thus, only when statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation do we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the legislative history. <em>(Granberry </em>v. <em>Islay Investments </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 738, 744 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 650, 889 P.2d 970]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007-1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">As stated previously, subdivision (a)(1) of section 3482.5 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo agricultural activity . . . conducted or maintained for commercial purposes, and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the locality, after it has been in operation for more than three years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Noting that section 3482.5 does not define the phrases \u201cany changed condition\u201d and \u201cin or about the locality,\u201d plaintiffs contend these phrases are uncertain and thus incapable of being understood without resort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>to the legislative history. We disagree. The absence of a definition for each of the statute\u2019s terms does not automatically create an ambiguity which requires our resort to the volume of documents plaintiffs proffer as legislative history.  Rather, \u201c[a]n ambiguity arises only if \\ . . there [is] more than one construction in issue which is semantically permissible, i.e., more than one usage which makes sense of the statutory language given the context and applicable rules of usage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 786, 795 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 545]; 2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (5th ed. 1992) \u00a7 45.02, p. 6 [\u201cAmbiguity exists when a statute is capable of being understood by reasonably well-informed persons in two or more different senses.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We discern no such ambiguity in the phrases \u201cany changed condition\u201d and \u201cin or about the locality.\u201d That the phrases encompass countless varieties of change in all manner of conditions in the general area surrounding the alleged nuisance does not mean the language of the statute is ambiguous. To the contrary, the word \u201cany\u201d expresses an unambiguous legislative intent to broadly apply the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because there is nothing ambiguous about the language of section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1), we do not resort to extrinsic materials to discern its meaning. <em>(Granberry </em>v. <em>Islay Investments, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th at p. 744.) Consequently, we decline to take judicial notice of any of the documents accompanying plaintiffs\u2019 request.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Despite the broad language of the statute, plaintiffs suggest section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1) should not be construed to preclude a nuisance action brought by a commercial agricultural entity against another commercial agricultural entity based upon crop damage caused by the latter\u2019s agricultural activity as this would result in absurd consequences that the Legislature could not have intended. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420] [statutory language should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequence the Legislature did not intend].) In plaintiffs\u2019 view, when a statute intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>to protect commercial agricultural activities is applied to the detriment of a commercial agricultural entity, this is an absurd consequence inconsistent with the purpose of the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">There is nothing absurd about construing section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1) to prohibit a commercial agricultural entity from suing another commercial agricultural entity on a nuisance theory where defendants\u2019 longstanding agricultural activity, conducted in a manner consistent with local customs and standards, caused damage to plaintiffs only after plaintiffs chose to change their agricultural activity to grow different crops. To the contrary, interpreting the statute otherwise would result in the absurd consequence of allowing plaintiffs, by changing their agricultural activity, to dictate that defendants must do likewise, i.e., allow plaintiffs to preclude defendants from continuing to grow rice on their property even though they had done so for over three years consistent with accepted agricultural standards in the locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude the language of section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1) does not limit its preclusive effect to nuisance actions commenced by nonagricultural plaintiffs; the statute applies broadly to bar a nuisance action, such as this, brought by one commercial agricultural entity against another commercial agricultural entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Even if, as plaintiffs suggest, the Legislature did not have such an application in mind when it enacted section 3482.5, a different construction is not required because our interpretation of the statute is compelled by the plain meaning of its words, does not frustrate its apparent purpose, and does not result in absurd consequences. (Cf. <em>Barr </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1944) 324 U.S. 83, 90 [65 S.Ct. 522, 525, 89 L.Ed. 765, 771] [where the Legislature \u201chas made a choice of language which fairly brings a given situation within a statute, it is unimportant that the particular application may not have been contemplated\u201d]; <em>Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 334 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788] [\u201c. . . if there is a flaw in the statutory scheme, it is up to the Legislature, not the courts, to correct it.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">We now turn to plaintiffs\u2019 contention that their action is not barred because defendants have not satisfied the requisites of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">For section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1) to apply, defendants must satisfy seven requisites: The activity alleged to be a nuisance must be (1) an agricultural activity (2) conducted or maintained for commercial purposes (3) in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards (4) as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>locality; the claim of nuisance arises (5) due to any changed condition in or about the locality (6) after the activity has been in operation for more than three years; and the activity (7) was not a nuisance at the time it began.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">By their statements of undisputed facts, defendants have demonstrated that the rice farming which plaintiffs claim has caused the water intrusion onto the DeMatos parcel is an agricultural activity conducted for commercial purposes in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality, and that defendants\u2019 rice farming had been ongoing for more than three years before plaintiffs first noticed the water intrusion. Therefore, defendants have satisfied requisites one through four and requisite six of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Defendants also have established by undisputed facts the seventh requisite, i.e., their rice farming was not a nuisance \u201cat the time it began\u201d by 1983. Plaintiffs have failed to create a triable issue of material fact concerning this element because they concede defendants\u2019 rice farming caused no damage to the DeMatos parcel from 1983 to 1989 while plaintiffs used the parcel for rice farming. <em>(Helix Land Co. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 932, 950 [147 Cal.Rptr. 683] [\u201cAn essential element of a cause of action for nuisance is damage or injury.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Plaintiffs challenge on appeal only the fifth requisite of the statute: The claim of nuisance arises due to any changed condition in or about the locality. In effect, they argue the condition of their property has not changed, i.e., the property has been farmed commercially with rice or row crops at different times since 1945, and plaintiffs were continuing to use the property for commercial farming at the time they were harmed by water seepage from defendants\u2019 rice farming. In their view, the \u201cchange from row crops to rice and back to row crops\u201d on the DeMatos parcel does not change the condition of the property as a commercial agricultural activity and, thus, should not be considered a \u201cchanged condition\u201d within the meaning of section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">As defendants point out, however, the statute applies to \u201cany\u201d changed condition, and the definition of \u201cchange\u201d includes \u201cto make different\u201d and \u201cto make substitution for or among.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Internal. Dict. (3d ed. 1993) p. 373.) Applying this common usage as we must, we conclude plaintiffs\u2019 \u201csubstitution\u201d of row crops for the \u201cdifferent\u201d process of rice farming was a \u201cchanged condition\u201d within the meaning of section 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1). (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Catelli </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1434, 1448 [278 Cal.Rptr. 452] [courts must accord the words of a statute their \u201c \u2018usual, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>ordinary, and common sense meaning based on the language used and the evident purpose for which the statute was adopted\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Since the damages alleged by plaintiffs occurred only after they changed the condition of their agricultural activity more than three years after defendants began commercial rice farming in a manner consistent with accepted standards established and followed by similar agricultural activities in the locality, the alleged harm arose \u201cdue to\u201d the changed condition within the meaning of 3482.5, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Because undisputed facts satisfy all the requisites of the statute, as a matter of law defendants\u2019 rice farming is not a nuisance. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in defendants\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Davis, Acting P.
