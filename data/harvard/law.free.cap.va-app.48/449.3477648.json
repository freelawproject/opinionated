Stiles\u2019s child support obligation. He maintains the trial court erred in making the modification \u201cretroactive to January 1, 2002.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The father contends that Pamela L. Stiles\u2019s request for \u201cretroactive modification\u201d is barred by res judicata and laches, and precluded by Code \u00a7 20-108. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the mother. <em>Mullin v. Mullin, </em>45 Va.App. 289, 299, 610 S.E.2d 331, 336 (2005). The parties married in 1988, had two children (b.1987 and 1992), and were divorced by decree dated April 6, 1998. The decree ordered the father to pay monthly child support of $994 and monthly spousal support of $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">The father was dismissed from his job on April 29,1999, and filed a lawsuit against his employer for wrongful termination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He filed a petition to reduce his child and spousal support obligations and, by order dated February 10, 2000, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>court reduced his monthly payments to $657 and $350 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On December 26, 2000, the mother filed a Motion for Modification of Child Support and Alimony on the ground that the father had increased his income through other employment and \u201chad been awarded $3.1 million dollars in a lawsuit.\u201d The cover letter that accompanied the petition to the clerk specifically requested that the ease not be placed on the Court\u2019s docket \u201cat this time.\u201d The petition was served on the father on January 5, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Acting <em>pro se, </em>the father filed a Motion to Terminate Alimony due to the mother\u2019s cohabitation. After an <em>ore terms </em>hearing on May 9, 2001, the trial court terminated the father\u2019s obligation to pay spousal support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">On August 15, 2001, the mother sought assistance from the Division of Child Support Enforcement to increase the father\u2019s child support obligation. DCSE refused to take her case because \u201cthe case was not old enough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In December 2004, the mother again contacted DCSE. On April 15, 2005, DCSE filed a petition to intervene on her behalf and to modify child support. DCSE averred that financial hardship caused the mother to apply for food stamps and move out of her former home while the father\u2019s ability to pay substantially changed due to his $2,325 million settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The father subsequently filed a petition to recalculate child support because the eldest child would be emancipated in July 2005, and he requested the trial court place the matter on the docket for August 31, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">On August 24, 2005, the mother filed a Motion for Modification of Child Support requesting that the modified award be applied from December 2000, \u201cthe date on which her earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Motion was filed, but never heard.\u201d She alleged that the father\u2019s \u201cfinancial circumstances have materially changed since December 2000, which warrants an upward modification of his child support obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">After an <em>ore terms </em>hearing on August 31, 2005, the trial court determined that the mother\u2019s claim for modification of child support \u201cwas not litigated back in May 2001\u201d and the \u201cFinal Order\u201d entered at that time \u201cdid not resolve the dispute about child support.\u201d The court modified child support as of January 1, 2002, and held the father in arrears in the amount of $42,282, plus interest at the judgment rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The father contends the trial court erred in finding that the mother\u2019s 2000 petition for modification of child support \u201cremained alive\u201d and in modifying child support \u201cretroactive\u201d to January 1, 2002. He maintains the mother\u2019s claim is barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>and asserts the defense of laches. Finally, he contends the trial court\u2019s \u201cretroactive ruling\u201d is contrary to the intent of Code \u00a7 20-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u201cWe begin our analysis by recognizing the well-established principle that all trial court rulings come to an appellate court with a presumption of correctness. Thus, we will not invalidate a court\u2019s decree unless the only reasonable interpretation thereof requires invalidation.\u201d <em>Riggins v. O\u2019Brien, </em>263 Va. 444, 448, 559 S.E.2d 673, 675-76 (2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The father maintains the mother\u2019s pleading seeking modification of child support was before the trial court at the 2001 hearing and its order, titled \u201cFinal Order,\u201d disposed of all claims that had been or could have been litigated at that time. He thus contends the order disposed of the pending child support modification claim before the court. As such, he argues the mother\u2019s current prosecution of that claim is barred by <em>res judicata </em>and laches. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">At the hearing, the trial court only addressed the father\u2019s motion to terminate spousal support based on the mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>cohabitation. There was no hearing, no consideration, and no adjudication of the mother\u2019s claim for modification of child support. The May 9, 2001 order specifically recited that \u201cthis cause came to be heard ... on the Plaintiff's/Defendant\u2019s motion for [sic] terminate alimony.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order addressed only spousal support and gave only one directive, which related solely to that claim: \u201cFor all the reasons stated on the record, alimony payable to the [mother] is terminated.\u201d While the court\u2019s order was captioned \u201cFinal Order,\u201d it did not remove the case from the docket or end the cause. <em>See Travis v. Finley, </em>36 Va.App. 189, 195, 548 S.E.2d 906, 909 (2001) (order was final as to determination of custody but not as to remaining claims regarding \u201ccontempt, visitation, child support, health insurance, attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions against mother\u201d); <em>Mina v. Mina, </em>45 Va.App. 215, 220, 609 S.E.2d 622, 625 (2005) (holding that trial court did not lose jurisdiction in divorce case to hear wife\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees more than twenty-one days after entry of order on merits of property-related claim where court had earlier bifurcated the two claims for trial); <em>see also Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 60-62, 602 S.E.2d 426, 430-31 (2004) (label of \u201cFinal Order\u201d is not conclusive as to whether the matter is \u201cstill open\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We therefore conclude that the order adjudicating spousal support was not a final judgment with regard to child support, thus negating application of the <em>res judicata </em>bar. Unless there is a final judgment, <em>res judicata </em>is not applied. \u201c[T]he party seeking to assert <em>res judicata </em>... must prove that the [tribunal] rendered a final judgment in its favor.\u201d <em>Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 128, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Straessle v. Air Line Pilots\u2019Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>253 Va. 349, 353, 485 S.E.2d 387, 389 (1997)). A judgment or decree, in turn, \u201c \u2018is final only when it disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated and leaves nothing to be done by the court in the cause except its ministerial execution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Lewis, </em>271 Va. 520, 528 n. 3, 628 S.E.2d 314, 318 n. 3 (2006) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Brooks v. Roanoke County Sanitation Auth., </em>201 Va. 934, 936, 114 S.E.2d 758, 760 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The father also maintains that the mother was obligated to act upon her petition in a timely fashion and by having failed to do so for more than four years, she defaulted her 2000 request for modification. Thus, he argues, the trial court\u2019s child support ruling, from which he claims he was prejudiced, is barred by the defense of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018Laches </em>is such neglect or omission to do what one should do as warrants the presumption that he has abandoned his claim, and declines to assert his right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pittman v. Pittman, </em>208 Va. 476, 479, 158 S.E.2d 746, 749 (1968) (citation omitted). Laches is \u201can omission to assert a right for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances prejudicial to the adverse party.\u201d <em>Finkel Outdoor Prods., Inc. v. Bell, </em>205 Va. 927, 933, 140 S.E.2d 695, 699 (1965).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The mother asserted her right by filing the petition for modification of child support <em>and </em>serving it on the father in January 2001. She did not abandon her claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While the father contends the mother was required to exercise due diligence in pursuing her claim, the law requires the moving party to exercise \u201cdue diligence in the service\u201d of a petition for support, and by implication a petition for modification of support, on the respondent. Peter N. Swisher, Lawrence D. Diehl, and James R. Cottrell, <em>Family Law: Theory, Practice, and Forms </em>\u00a7 10:2, 370 (2005). The father was served and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>notice of her claim. Both parties could have, but did not, request the court to either address child support at the spousal support hearing or separately set the matter on the court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Whether to apply laches to an equitable claim is a matter left to the discretion of the trial court. While parties are not encouraged to sit on their rights, the father was aware of the pending claim and neither party asked the court to address it until 2005. Furthermore, while the petition was pending, no evidence was lost. <em>Cf. Rowe v. Big Sandy Coal Corp., </em>197 Va. 136, 144, 87 S.E.2d 763, 768 (1955) (thirty-three year delay in asserting claim to land is \u201cunreasonable delay\u201d \u201cwithout excuse\u201d resulting in \u201cthe loss of material evidence\u201d that disadvantaged other parties and warranted the court\u2019s \u201cdenial of equitable relief1\u2019). Consequently, the father was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Finally, the father argues that the General Assembly could not have intended Code \u00a7 20-108 \u201cto apply where a party serves a petition and, without justification or excuse, never acts on the same.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On the contrary, that code section clearly allows the trial court to modify child support awards \u201cwith respect to any period during which there is a pending petition for modification in any court, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given to the responding party.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>see also Riggins, </em>263 Va. at 447, 559 S.E.2d at 675. \u201c[WJhether to make modification of a support order effective during a period when a petition is pending is entirely within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien v. Rose, </em>14 Va.App. 960, 965, 420 S.E.2d 246, 249 (1992); <em>see also Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 310, 605 S.E.2d 268, 279 (2004). The court\u2019s paramount concern when awarding child support is the best interest of the children. Code \u00a7 20-108; <em>see also Riggins, </em>263 Va. at 447, 559 S.E.2d at 675; <em>Conway v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Conway, </em>10 Va.App. 653, 658, 395 S.E.2d 464, 466-67 (1990) (\u201cThe court must consider the basic needs of the child, the parent\u2019s ability to pay, and to the extent that the parent is able to provide more than the basic necessities of life, the degree to which the child should reasonably share in his or her parents\u2019 prosperity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The father was served with the petition in January 2001. The trial court considered the changed circumstances of the parties and the best interest of the children and modified support as of January 1, 2002. Code \u00a7 20-108. On this record, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion or was plainly wrong in modifying the award while the mother\u2019s petition was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The trial court did not err in finding that neither <em>res judicata </em>nor laches barred its child support ruling. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s modification of the child support award to January 1, 2002 and its finding that the father was in arrears in the amount of $42,282, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\">. The father does not contest the increase in the amount of child support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-12\">. On December 4, 2000, the father won a jury verdict of $3.1 million in the lawsuit, but the employer appealed. The parties settled the matter in June 2001, and the father received $2,325 million. As part of the settlement, he was re-hired for one month and then retired with 25 years of service. His retirement benefits of $3,300 per month commenced in December 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-11\">. The father agreed, by letter dated July 12, 2001, to provide additional support for the children and moved to Florida at the end of August 2001. He does not seek credit for these nonconforming payments, but contends the court\u2019s child support award resulted in a windfall to the mother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">. However, the defense does not apply to one who is \"ignorant of [her] rights.... This defense is only permitted to defeat an acknowledged right on the ground that laches affords evidence that the right has been abandoned.\u201d <em>Rutledge v.
