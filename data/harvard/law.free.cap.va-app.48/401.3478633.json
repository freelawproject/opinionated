HUMPHREYS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b452-16\">Otis Scott, III (\u201cScott\u201d) appeals his convictions of abduction with intent to extort money, two counts of armed common law burglary, seven counts of robbery, nine counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, attempted extortion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>and statutory burglary, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-48, 18.2-90, 18.2-58, 18.2-53.1, 18.2-59, and 18.2-90, respectively. Scott contends the trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial motion for joinder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, Scott argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the offenses were part of a \u201ccommon scheme or plan\u201d and, even if they were, that \u201cjustice still required separate trials.\u201d For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). So viewed, the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On February 3, 2003, at approximately 10:30 p.m., a man approached Michelle Bingaman (\u201cBingaman\u201d) from behind as she was getting out of her car in front of her apartment building. The man pointed a gun at Bingaman\u2019s head and stated, \u201c[w]e can do this the easy way or the hard way.\u201d The man told Bingaman to empty her pockets, and to lay down facing the ground. He then took her purse and fled on foot. Bingaman described the man as African-American, approximately six feet tall, medium build, and in his mid-twenties to thirties. During a photo lineup, and at trial, Bingaman positively identified Scott as the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">On March 16, 2003, at approximately 10:40 p.m., a man approached Florentina Lizan (\u201cLizan\u201d) from behind as she was getting out of her car in front of her house. The man pointed a gun at her head, demanded money and credit cards, and threatened to kill Lizan if she did not cooperate. Lizan gave the man her wallet and her credit cards. After demanding the PIN number for her card, the man fled on foot to a car parked across the street. Lizan described the man as African-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>American, approximately five feet, nine inches tall, medium build, and in his mid-twenties or thirties. At a photo lineup, and at trial, she positively identified Scott as the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On March 23, 2003, shortly after 10:00 p.m., a man approached Kay Holloway (\u201cHolloway\u201d) from behind as she was unloading her car in front of her house. The man had a gun on his side, and he demanded money, credit cards, and Holloway\u2019s ATM number. When Holloway did not move fast enough, the man raised the gun to his chest and pointed it at Holloway. Once Holloway gave him her money, the man fled on foot. Moments later, Holloway heard a car start up. Holloway identified the man as African-American, approximately five feet, nine inches tall, medium build, and in his mid-twenties or thirties. However, she could not identify Scott at either a photo lineup, or at trial, as the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">On April 27, 2003, between 10:00 and 10:30 p.m., a man approached Jeffrey Ratliff (\u201cRatliff\u201d) from behind as he was vacuuming out a van in front of a friend\u2019s home. The man placed a gun on the back of Ratliffs head, and he demanded Ratliffs wallet and the \u201ccode\u201d for his credit cards. Ratliff gave the man his wallet, but told the man that he did not have any \u201ccodes\u201d for his cards. The man then fled on foot. Ratliff identified the perpetrator as African-American, approximately five feet ten to five feet eleven inches tall, and about 180 pounds. He could not identify the perpetrator in a photo lineup. However, on the day of the trial, Ratliff identified Scott as his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">On May 2, 2003, at 8:30 p.m., a man approached Holly Narducci (\u201cNarducci\u201d) while she was alone in her garage. The man came up behind her from the driveway, pointed a gun at her, and said, \u201c[s]cream and I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The man demanded her wallet, stating that he wanted money and credit cards. He then asked for Narducci's PIN number, which she told him she did not have. Narducci then grabbed for the gun, a brief struggle ensued, and the man fled on foot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Narducci identified Scott as the perpetrator at both a photo lineup and at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">On May 13, 2003, at approximately 11:00 p.m., a man approached Jean Becker (\u201cBecker\u201d) as she was getting out of her car in her driveway. When the man came up beside her car, Becker attempted to cross over to the other side of the vehicle in order to get away from him. However, the man grabbed her wrist and struggled with Becker in an attempt to get her wallet. In the course of the struggle, the man hit Becker with a hard object, chipping her tooth. The man took the wallet and fled. At trial, Becker identified Scott as the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">On May 15, 2003, at approximately 12:30 a.m., a man approached Aderonke Aderonmu (\u201cAderonmu\u201d) as she was getting out of her car in front of her home. The man pointed a gun at Aderonmu\u2019s head, and he demanded all of her money or else he would \u201cblow her head off.\u201d Aderonmu panicked and dropped her purse. The man grabbed the purse, and he left in a car that was parked in front of a neighboring house. Aderonmu described the man as African-American with a medium build. She positively identified Scott in a photo lineup, and at trial, as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On May 31, 2003, at approximately 9:30 p.m., a man approached Samuel Owens (\u201cOwens\u201d) as he was working alone in his garage. The man ran up Owens\u2019 driveway, came into the garage, and pulled out a gun. When Owens began screaming, the assailant pointed the gun at Owens and told him to be quiet. The man demanded Owens\u2019 wallet. When Owens told him that his wallet was in the house, the assailant forced him to retrieve it at gunpoint. After demanding Owens\u2019 PIN number, the gunman fled on foot. Owens described the man as African-American, approximately five feet, seven inches tall, muscular, and in his mid-twenties. Owens identified Scott at both a photo lineup, and at trial, as the perpetrator of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">On June 7, 2003, at around 10:00 p.m., a man approached Ian Goodwin (\u201cGoodwin\u201d) as he was getting into his car in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>front of a friend\u2019s house. The man was holding a gun, and he demanded the keys to Goodwin\u2019s car. Goodwin said \u201cno,\u201d and he began yelling for help. The man hit Goodwin several times in the head, and he then fled on foot. After the attack, Goodwin realized that his wallet was missing. Goodwin described his attacker as African-American, in his thirties, under six feet tall, and well built. Goodwin could not identify his attacker in a photo lineup, but at trial, Goodwin stated that Scott \u201cpositively resemble[d] the figure\u201d he saw on the night he was attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">On June 14, 2003, a police officer stopped Scott for a traffic violation, and he was arrested for driving on a suspended license. After he was arrested, the police found a credit card belonging to Goodwin in Scott\u2019s possession. They also found, in his car, clothing matching the descriptions given by Lizan and Narducci.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">On September 2, 2003, a grand jury issued a twenty-seven-count indictment against Scott. On December 18, 2003, the Commonwealth moved for joinder, arguing that the multiple armed robberies had the following common scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">1. They occurred in the late evening;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">2. Each of the victims were alone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">3. Each of the victims were threatened with a handgun;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">4. The suspect demanded personal property from each victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">5. The victims had either just arrived in their vehicle or were in their garage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">6. All of the robberies occurred in a residential neighborhood;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-13\">7. Most of the victims were either threatened or suffered bodily injury at the hands of the suspect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-14\">8. Each robbery was committed by a lone suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">On January 14, 2004, after oral argument, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder. The trial court held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>[i]n weighing all of the various factors that we have considered ... and in balancing all of the prejudice or the possible prejudice to the defendant and the other factors we\u2019ve talked about, including the fact that several lay witnesses perhaps ostensibly might be required to testify in multiple separate trials if they were to be held separately, the standard by which that evidence is judged, the likelihood that at least some of those individuals may be in a position to be permitted to offer testimony as to identity in those cases in which identity would be an issue, the substantial similarities in terms of the modus operandi in these offenses, the method by which they were carried out, the similarity in the selection of victims, the type of victim, the location that was selected for the offenses, the offense itself that was committed, what was taken, what was requested in addition to the method and means by which the crimes were carried out, I think all of that suggest that the Commonwealth\u2019s motion should be granted____ I do not find that justice requires separate trials in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">On December 16, 2004, a jury convicted Scott of abduction with intent to extort money, two counts of armed common law burglary, seven counts of robbery, nine counts of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, one count of attempted extortion, and one count of statutory burglary, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-48, 18.2-90, 18.2-58, 18.2-53.1, 18.2-59, and 18.2-90.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On January 21, 2005, the trial court affirmed the findings of the jury, and sentenced Scott to 253 years incarceration. Scott now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">\u201cRule 3A:10(e) permits the trial of multiple offenses committed by one defendant \u2018if justice does not require separate trials and ... the offenses meet the requirements of Rule 3A:6(b).\u2019 \u201d <em>Traish v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 114, 129, 549 S.E.2d 5, 12 (2001) (quoting Rule 3A:10(c)). Rule 3A:6(b), in turn, \u201cpermits the joinder of offenses \u2018if the offenses are based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>on the same act or transaction, or on two or more acts or transactions that are connected or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The determination of whether different offenses should be tried separately is a matter that rests within the sound discretion of a trial court, <em>Yellardy v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 19, 23-26, 561 S.E.2d 739, 742 (2002), and a trial court\u2019s ruling on the matter will not be reversed absent a showing that the court abused its discretion, <em>Ferrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 380, 386, 399 S.E.2d 614, 617 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">A. <em>Whether the Offenses Were Connected or Constituted Parts of a Common Scheme or Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Rule 3A:6(b) provides three alternative ways to join multiple offenses into one trial. Specifically, \u201c[o]ffenses may be joined if (1) the offenses are based on \u2018the same act or transaction,\u2019 (2) the offenses are based on \u2018two or more acts or transactions that are connected,\u2019 or (3) the offenses \u2018constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 225, 228, 372 S.E.2d 780, 782 (1988) (quoting Rule 3A:6(b)). Here, the offenses were not \u201cbased on the same act or transaction.\u201d <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 507, 514, 559 S.E.2d 415, 418 (2002) (noting that the alleged offenses \u201cwere not part of the \u2018same act or transaction\u2019 \u201d because \u201c[e]ach offense was a separate act taking place at a different location and at a different time\u201d); <em>see also Purvis v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 298, 305, 522 S.E.2d 898, 901 (2000) (same). Accordingly, the controlling inquiry is whether the alleged offenses are \u201cconnected\u201d or \u201cconstitute parts of a common scheme <em>or </em>plan.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 3A:6(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">To determine whether the offenses were based on two or more acts or transactions that are \u201cconnected,\u201d the \u201ccrimes should be \u2018so intimately connected and blended with the main facts adduced in evidence, that they cannot be departed from with propriety.\u2019\u201d <em>Spence v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1040, 1044, 407 S.E.2d 916, 918 (1991) (quoting <em>Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 273, 176 S.E.2d 802, 806 (1970)). In determining whether separate crimes are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201cconnected\u201d within the meaning of Rule 3A:6(b), the trial court should therefore consider whether the acts \u201cwere closely-connected in time, place, and means of commission,\u201d <em>Satcher v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 220, 229, 421 S.E.2d 821, 827 (1992), as well as whether any evidence \u201clink[s] or connect[s] one [offense] with the other,\u201d <em>Spence, </em>12 Va.App. at 1044, 407 S.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">A \u201ccommon <em>plan,\u201d </em>in contrast, exists when the \u201c \u2018relationship among offenses ... is dependent upon the existence of a plan that ties the offenses together and demonstrates that the objective of each offense was to contribute to the achievement of a goal not attainable by the commission of any of the individual offenses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Godwin v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 118, 122, 367 S.E.2d 520, 522 (1988) (quoting 2 ABA Standards for Criminal Justice \u00a7 13-1.2., at 13.9 (Supp. 1986) (commentary following \u00a7 13.1.2.) (omission in original)). In determining whether a common <em>plan </em>exists, the trial court should consider the \u201crelationship among offenses,\u201d <em>id., </em>focusing upon whether the crimes, collectively, are motivated by a desire to attain a particular and identifiable goal. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cA conspiracy involving more than one offense is a typical example of offenses involving a common plan.\u201d); <em>see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1729 (1993) (defining \u201cplan\u201d as \u201ca proposed undertaking or goal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On the other hand, separate offenses may be deemed part of a common <em>scheme </em>if their commonality of features, taken together, gives rise to a reasonable inference that each individual offense is attributable to the existence of an \u201cartful plot\u201d\u2014for example, to repeatedly commit a particular type of crime. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1346 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201cscheme\u201d as \u201c[a]n artful plot,\u201d usually \u201cto deceive others,\u201d such as \u201ca scheme to defraud creditors\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 269 (defining \u201ccommon design,\u201d a designated synonym of \u201ccommon scheme,\u201d as \u201c[a]n intention to commit more than one crime\u201d); <em>see also Scates v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 757, 762, 553 S.E.2d 756, 759 (2001) (holding that evidence of similar acts is admissible as proof of a common scheme \u201c \u2018where there is such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>concurrence of common features that the various acts are naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestations\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>McWhorter v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 857, 870-71, 63 S.E.2d 20, 26 (1951)) (internal quotations omitted)). In determining whether two or more offenses are sufficiently related to constitute parts of a common scheme, the trial court should consider the common features between the offenses, such as whether the crimes have common types of victims, a common purpose, or a similar modus operandi. <em>See, e.g., Traish, </em>36 Va.App. at 129-30, 549 S.E.2d at 12 (holding that the defendant\u2019s commission of several virtually identical crimes sufficed to prove a \u201ccommon scheme\u201d to \u201csystematically bilk women drivers\u201d); <em>Kirk v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 291, 296, 464 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1995) (finding that various robberies were part of a \u201ccommon scheme\u201d where the defendant \u201capproached the same store, on foot, at the same time of night, and from the same direction,\u201d and \u201cused the same handgun, made similar demands for money, and threatened the clerk not to follow upon exiting the store\u201d); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. Appx. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. 9A (noting that two or more offenses may be tried together under the federal system if they are \u201csubstantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>In this case, the trial court never made an explicit finding as to which alternative in Rule 3A:6(b) led to the decision to grant the motion for joinder. Instead, the trial court made several findings of fact supporting the decision. Specifically, the court found that there were \u201csubstantial similarities in terms of the modus operandi,\u201d as well as in \u201cthe method by which they were carried out.\u201d It also found \u201csimilarit[ies] in the selection of victims, the type of victim, [and] the location that was selected for the offenses.\u201d Moreover, it found similarities in \u201cthe offense itself that was committed, what was taken, [and] what was requested.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that the \u201creasonable inferences\u201d drawn from this evidence clearly support a finding that the crimes were related by virtue of a common scheme. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Scott chose to attack all nine of his victims during the late evening when they were alone by a vehicle or inside a garage. Scott used a handgun<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> each time he approached a victim, and each time he threatened violence or actually struck the victim. In every instance, Scott demanded money and credits cards, and, in some cases, PIN numbers. In each instance, there was a lone victim and a single attacker. And, all of the attacks took place in residential areas located in the City of Virginia Beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Thus, although the crimes spanned a period of five months, the crimes were \u201cclosely connected in ... place[ ] and means of commission.\u201d <em>Satcher, </em>244 Va. at 229, 421 S.E.2d at 827; <em>see also Yellardy, </em>38 Va.App. at 25, 561 S.E.2d at 742. As noted by the trial court, in addition to similar modus operandi, each crime also had a similar type of victim and occurred in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>similar location. It follows that the trial court, considering this evidence, could have reasonably concluded that Scott formulated a general scheme to approach unprotected residents of Virginia Beach, while those individuals were standing just outside of their homes late at night, with a handgun and under threat of violence, and with the common purpose of obtaining the victims\u2019 credit cards, money, and PIN numbers. <em>Cf. Ferrell, </em>11 Va.App. at 391, 399 S.E.2d at 620 (holding that the defendant\u2019s \u201csimilar and continuing acts\u201d of breaking and entering into various automobile dealerships, all located in the City of Chesapeake, constituted a common scheme or plan even though the crimes occurred over a span of approximately six weeks). Because the trial court could reasonably have concluded that the common features of the separate crimes sufficed to prove that they were the individual manifestations of some overriding criminal scheme, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the crimes, by virtue of their striking factual similarities, satisfied the requirements of Rule 3A:6(b). <em>See Satcher, </em>244 Va. at 230-21, 421 S.E.2d at 827-28; <em>Yellardy, </em>38 Va.App. at 25-26, 561 S.E.2d at 742-43; <em>Traish, </em>36 Va.App. at 129-30, 549 S.E.2d at 12; <em>Kirk, </em>21 Va.App. at 296, 464 S.E.2d at 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">B. <em>Whether Justice Required Separate Trials</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Although the offenses were \u201cpart of a common scheme or plan\u201d under Rule 3A:6(b), we must also determine if justice required Scott to have separate trials. <em>See </em>Rule 3A:10(c). Scott objected to the motion for joinder, arguing that there will be obvious prejudice to him by joining, into one trial, victims who can identify Scott as the attacker, with those who cannot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Justice typically \u201crequires separate trials where the evidence of one of the crimes is not admissible in the trial of the other.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>6 Va.App. at 123, 367 S.E.2d at 522. Thus, when determining whether justice permits separate offenses to be tried simultaneously, the primary inquiry is whether evidence of the other criminal conduct would be admissible, during the trial of each individual offense, under one of the exceptions to the rule prohibiting the introduction of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. <em>See generally Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272, 176 S.E.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">As pertinent here, evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d is relevant and admissible to prove \u201cthe perpetrator\u2019s identity,\u201d as long as \u201c \u2018some aspects of the [other criminal conduct] are so distinctive or idiosyncratic that the fact finder reasonably could infer that the same person committed both crimes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shifflett v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 521, 529, 513 S.E.2d 440, 444 (1999) (quoting <em>Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 134, 138-39, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998)). Thus, justice does not generally require separate trials when evidence of the other offenses would be admissible, in each individual trial, to prove the perpetrator\u2019s identity. <em>Traish, </em>36 Va.App. at 130, 549 S.E.2d at 13; <em>see also Commonwealth v.

We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Because the crimes were strikingly similar, evidence from one crime would be highly relevant in the trial of another in order to establish the identity of the perpetrator. <em>See Shifflett, </em>29 Va.App. at 529, 513 S.E.2d at 444. Specifically, as discussed above, each crime was committed during the late evening, each victim was alone outside of his or her Virginia Beach residence, each perpetrator used a handgun, each perpetrator threatened violence or actually struck the victim, each perpetrator demanded money and credit cards from the victim, each perpetrator fled on foot, and, during most of the crimes, the perpetrator also requested a PIN number. Considering these factual similarities, \u201cproof of the identical methods used to commit the [] robberies tends to prove the identity of appellant as the person who committed [each] offense[ ].\u201d <em>Yellardy, </em>38 Va.App. at 25, 561 S.E.2d at 742; <em>see also Ferrell, </em>11 Va.App. at 389-90, 399 S.E.2d at 619 (upholding joinder of offenses for trial under Rule 3A:6(b) and noting that the charged offenses \u201cneed not bear ... an exact resemblance\u201d to one another, but must instead \u201cbear a singular strong resemblance ..., thus tending to establish the probability of a common perpetrator\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Although relevant to prove identity, however, we must also consider whether the probative value of the other offenses would be outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. <em>See Guill, </em>255 Va. at 139, 495 S.E.2d at 491-92 (\u201cAdmission of [other crimes] evidence ... is subject to the further requirement that the legitimate probative value of the evidence must exceed the incidental prejudice caused the defendant.\u201d); <em>Lewis v.

If so, justice would likely require separate trials because the evidence, although factually relevant, would be inadmissible during the individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>trials of the separate offenses. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 223, 226, 456 S.E.2d 138, 139 (1995) (\u201cJustice often requires separate trials where highly prejudicial evidence of one of the crimes is not admissible in the trial of the other.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In each of the instant cases, \u201c[a]t trial, the identity of the perpetrator was the primary issue in dispute.\u201d <em>Traish, </em>36 Va.App. at 130, 549 S.E.2d at 13. Because, under these circumstances, \u201cthe probative value of the evidence of the other offenses is obvious, we cannot say that [the] trial court abuse[d] its discretion by finding that the probative value outweigh[s] the prejudicial effect of such evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 549 S.E.2d at 13; <em>see also Brown, </em>37 Va.App. at 516, 559 S.E.2d at 420. Because proof of the other crimes would therefore be admissible during each individual trial as proof of the perpetrator\u2019s identity, it follows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that justice permitted these offenses to be tried simultaneously. <em>See Traish, </em>36 Va.App. at 131, 549 S.E.2d at 13; <em>see also Yellardy, </em>38 Va.App. at 26, 561 S.E.2d at 743 (\u201cBecause proof of the two offenses was relevant to prove ... identity, ... justice did not require separate trials.\u201d). And, because justice did not require separate trials, the separate offenses met the requirements of Rule 3A:10(c) and, thus, could be tried together in a single proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Because of the strikingly similar characteristics of the nine robberies, a fact finder could reasonably infer that they constituted parts of a common scheme, as required by Rule 3A:6(b). And, because evidence of the other crimes would have been admissible in each of the individual trials to establish the identity of the perpetrator, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that justice allowed the offenses to be tried together. Because the requirements of Rule 3A:10(c) were therefore fulfilled, it follows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder. Thus, we affirm Scott\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">. Judge Stephen C.

To establish a \u201ccommon scheme or plan,\u201d then, it is not always necessary to show that the defendant was motivated by a goal \u201cnot attainable by the commission of any of these individual offenses.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>6 Va.App. at 122, 367 S.E.2d at 522. Although <em>Godwin </em>has been subsequently cited as defining a \"common plan <em>or </em>scheme,\u201d we note that the language of the opinion itself was limited to defining a <em>\u201ccommonplan.\" See id. </em>In that sense, <em>Godwin </em>is distinguishable from <em>Traish </em>and <em>Kirk, </em>both of which focused, instead, upon whether the evidence sufficed to prove a common <em>scheme.

Thus, because the language of Rule 3A:6(b) is phrased disjunctively (\u201ccommon scheme <em>or </em>plan\u201d), these cases may be reconciled on the ground that <em>Traish </em>and <em>Kirk </em>dealt with the former, and <em>Godwin, </em>the latter. <em>See generally Lewis v.

Scott points out that the testimony regarding the type of gun used in each attack differs. Specifically, some victims testified that the gun was silver, while others testified that it was black.

On brief, the Commonwealth concedes that Scott made this argument at the motion hearing. However, the Commonwealth argues that, because Scott did not make this argument again at trial, Rule 5A:18 bars its consideration on appeal. To the contrary, because the trial court's ruling on the motion for joinder\u2014the same motion hearing at which the argument was made\u2014is before this Court on appeal, we hold that the argument is preserved for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AT8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">I dissent from the majority opinion because I believe that the circuit judge did not have the discretion to join the offenses for a single trial. I also believe that in reviewing this appeal, we are limited to considering the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial proffer made to the circuit judge in support of the motion for joinder and, thus, we cannot consider the evidence later introduced at trial in determining the propriety of the pretrial decision to join the offenses for trial. Even so, neither the proffer nor the evidence established a sufficient basis to find a common scheme or plan underlying the charges. The circuit judge\u2019s error was prejudicial to Otis Scott, and it requires the granting of new, separate trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">When arguing the motion for joinder, the prosecutor proffered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">The first victim\u2014alleged victim is Michelle Bingham.... The second victim.... It\u2019s Florentina Lizan. That\u2019s March 16th of 2003. The third victim is Kay Holloway. That is March 23rd of 2003. The fourth victim is Jeff Ratliff, 4-27-2003. The fifth victim is Holly Narducci, and that\u2019s May 2nd of 2003. The sixth victim is Aderonte Aderonmu, which is May 15th of 2003. The seventh alleged victim is Samuel Owens on May 31, 2003. The eighth victim is Jean Becker on May 31, 2003; and the ninth victim is Ian Goodwin; and that is June 7, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">...

In each ... the attacker was alone as he approached the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">In eight of the nine separate incidents, each victim alleged\u2014stated that a gun was allegedly used. The ninth victim, Jean Becker, stated that a hard metal object was used.

In each of the incidents, they were all adult suspects. In each of the incidents it was an African-American; and, again, in each it was a male.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">This proffered version of the facts was all that the circuit judge had available to consider when deciding the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial joinder motion and, thus, this proffer is all that we should consider when determining whether the judge erred in making that decision. <em>See Spence v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1040, 1045, 407 S.E.2d 916, 918-19 (1991) (explaining that in determining whether to sever charges, the circuit judge \u201cshould make the determination based upon the situation as it appears before trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In support of the joinder motion, the prosecutor argued that the proffered facts indicated the common plan or scheme was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">The scheme was to rob people as they were going into their residence\u2014either getting out of their vehicle in their driveway or entering the residence late at night in a residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>area when they were alone and with a gun and demanding property and threatening bodily harm or committing bodily harm in most of the cases; and so, yes, I think that\u2019s a common scheme tying all these cases together\u2014and in each one approaching on foot. That is distinctive as well, and then seen fleeing in a vehicle\u2014approaching on foot and then seen fleeing in a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In response, Scott\u2019s attorney argued that those circumstances were irrelevant to the issue of joinder and pertained only to \u201cwhether the evidence would be admissible in a single trial to prove identity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The circuit judge applied a \u201cbalancing\u201d test and granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion. He ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">In weighing all of the various factors that we have considered during our discussions today on this motion, and in balancing all of the prejudice or the possible prejudice to the defendant and the other factors that we\u2019ve talked about, including the fact that several lay witnesses perhaps ostensibly might be required to testify in multiple separate trials if they were to be held separately, the standard by which that evidence is judged, the likelihood that at least some of those individuals may be in a position to be permitted to offer testimony as to identity in those cases in which identity would be an issue, the substantial similarities in terms of the modus operandi in these offenses, the method by which they were carried out, the similarity in the selection of the victims, the type of victim, the location that was selected for the offenses, the offense itself that was committed, what was taken, what was requested in addition to the method and means by which the crimes were carried out, I think all of that suggest that the Commonwealth\u2019s motion should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The judge\u2019s decision was plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">The governing principles are straight-forward. The circuit judge \u201chas limited discretion to order an accused to be tried for more than one offense at the same time.\u201d <em>Godwin v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 118, 121, 367 S.E.2d 520, 521 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>(1988). The judge\u2019s discretion is prescribed in Rule 3A:10(c): \u201cThe court may direct that an accused be tried at one time for all offenses then pending against him, if justice does not require separate trials and (i) the offenses meet the requirements of Rule 3A:6(b) or (ii) the accused and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney consent thereto.\u201d By its plain terms, Rule 3A:6(b) provides for the joinder of offenses in the absence of consent only where the offenses are \u201cbased on\u201d (1) \u201cthe same act or transaction,\u201d (2) \u201ctwo or more acts or transactions that are connected,\u201d or (3) \u201ctwo or more acts or transactions that ... constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">As the majority notes, the Commonwealth argues only that the circuit judge could have reasonably inferred \u201cthat the acts constituted parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the charged crimes \u201cwere related by virtue of a common scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We have been clear about the required standard in these cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">A common scheme or plan is present only if the \u201crelationship among offenses ... depend[s] upon the existence of a plan that ties the offenses together and demonstrates that the objective of each offense was to contribute to the achievement of a goal not obtainable by the commission of any of the individual offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\"><em>Spence, </em>12 Va.App. at 1044, 407 S.E.2d at 918 (quoting <em>Godwin, </em>6 Va.App. at 122, 367 S.E.2d at 522); <em>see also Yellardy v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 19, 25, 561 S.E.2d 739, 742 (2002) (applying <em>Spence\u2019s </em>definition of a common scheme or plan). In a similar vein, the Supreme Court has held that similar acts may tend to show a common scheme or plan only \u201cwhere there is \u2018such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are <em>naturally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestations\u2019 \u201d Scates v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 757, 762, 553 S.E.2d 756, 759 (2001) (emphasis added, citation omitted). These cases recognize a distinction between mere similarity of crimes and a \u201ccommon scheme or plan.\u201d Separate crimes of the same type do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>automatically translate to crimes of a common scheme or plan. <em>See Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 52, 53, 189 S.E.2d 359, 360 (1972) (reversing a conviction because the three heroin sales were not part of a general scheme); <em>Spence, </em>12 Va.App. at 1044, 407 S.E.2d at 918 (holding that no evidence of the four drug sale charges tied the sales together); <em>see also Scates, </em>262 Va. at 760-62, 553 S.E.2d at 758-59 (reversing the conviction because the defendant\u2019s admission that he \u201cjammed\u201d credit cards into doors in order to enter other homes was not admissible as demonstrative of a common \u201cscheme of breaking into homes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The nine robberies charged against Scott occurred over the span of four months. Fitting with the definition of robbery, the nine acts involved violence or the threat of violence. Although each victim was alone in a residential neighborhood in the City of Virginia Beach (the most populous city in Virginia and one of the largest cities in land area in the continental United States), this fact establishes no relationship among the offenses that is relevant to a common scheme or plan. While it is true that on each occasion the robber demanded personal property, this is the hallmark of an ordinary robbery. Despite sharing some similarities, the robberies were not shown to have a relationship indicative of a common plan or scheme. Neither the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer nor the full record revealed \u201ca plan that ties the offenses together ... [or] demonstrates that the objective of each offense was to contribute to the achievement of a goal not obtainable by the commission of any of the individual offenses.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>6 Va.App. at 122, 367 S.E.2d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Rule 3A:10(c) requires more than proof of propensity to commit crime. <em>Spence, </em>12 Va.App. at 1045, 407 S.E.2d at 918. Merely to posit that the robberies had striking similarities is insufficient to show that the separate crimes grew from a common scheme or even were related. Indeed, one robbery is not connected to another merely because they occurred in a residential area; robberies are not limited to commercial districts. Muggings are not uncommon occurrences and often involve threats of violence and guns. Likewise, it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>unusual for a robber to demand money or credit cards. The fact that a lone robber chose a lone victim is hardly surprising. Possibly the only peculiar fact about some of these robberies is that the robber demanded personal identification numbers for the stolen cards, but, because it is common knowledge that such a number is necessary to withdraw cash from an automated machine or using a credit card, this fact does not adequately connect even those five robberies. These proffered facts established no \u201cgeneral plan\u201d or acts that were \u201cnaturally ... the individual manifestations\u201d of a general plan or scheme. Scates, 262 Va. at 762, 553 S.E.2d at 759. Simply put, \u201c[t]here is no evidence of a plan tying [the offenses] together or showing that each offense was intended to assist in accomplishing a goal other than that achieved by each individual offense.\u201d <em>Spence, </em>12 Va.App. at 1044-45, 407 S.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In addition, the judge\u2019s ruling that the similarities of the crimes was a sufficient basis to grant the joinder motion invoked an erroneous legal standard and, therefore, was an abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion is \u201can adjudicator\u2019s failure to exercise sound, reasonable, and legal decision-making.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>11 (8th ed. 2004). Thus, a judge errs, \u201cas a matter of law\u201d when the judge \u201cuse[s] an improper legal standard in exercising [a] discretionary function.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 216, 233, 559 S.E.2d 652, 661 (2002); <em>see also Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (holding that a trial judge by definition abuses his discretion when the judge makes an error of law). Here, the circuit judge indicated he was swayed by the inconvenience of requiring witnesses \u201cto testify in multiple separate trials\u201d and \u201cthe similarities in terms of the modus operandi of these offenses.\u201d The judge\u2019s consideration of these factors of convenience and identity caused the judge to misapply the law in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. The provisions of Rule 3A:10 and Rule 3A:6 do not pertain to the convenience of witnesses. Moreover, the circuit judge relied on the similarities between the crimes but did not explicitly find the existence of circumstances indicative of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>common plan or scheme. While it is possible the judge concluded \u201cthat, since the offenses were factually similar, they were committed by the same person[ ] as part of a plan,\u201d such a conclusion \u201cis speculative.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>6 Va.App. at 123, 367 S.E.2d at 522.

As in <em>Godwin, </em>\u201calthough factually similar, [the offenses] were not so unusual or distinctive as to identify the person who committed ... them.\u201d 6 Va.App. at 125, 367 S.E.2d at 523. Proof of the nine offenses in a single trial merely tended to improperly show that Scott \u201chas the propensity to commit the crime[,] and this inference has been held to be error because it reverses his presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Spence, </em>12 Va.App. at 1045, 407 S.E.2d at 918 (reversing a conviction because the trial judge refused to sever four charges for distribution of cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">For these reasons, I would hold that the trial judge abused his discretion in granting the motion to join the offenses for trial. I would reverse the convictions and remand for new, separate trials.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
