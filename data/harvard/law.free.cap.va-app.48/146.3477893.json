In a connected case, Surles also appeals the denial of his motion for visitation with Kayla\u2019s half-sibling, James, whose biological father is appellee Marty Cullen, Jr. (\u201cCullen\u201d), and to whom Surles has no biological ties. We consolidated these separate appeals for purposes of oral argument, and, because the two cases involve similar factual and legal issues, we have also consolidated them for purposes of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">On appeal, Surles argues that the trial court erred in determining that he lacked standing to pursue visitation \u2022with James because he is not a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1, even though he resided intermittently with James, Kayla, and their biological moth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>er, appellee Kristan Mayer (\u201cMayer\u201d). Surles further contends that the trial court erred in determining that, even if he is a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest,\u201d he failed to prove that awarding visitation would be in the best interests of the child. Surles also argues that the trial court erroneously: (1) held that granting him custody of Kayla would not be in the best interests of the child, (2) permitted Mayer to relocate to Florida with the children, and (3) admitted evidence that, while living with Mayer, Surles had been involved in relationships with other women. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments below. We also deny Mayer\u2019s request for an award of the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to Mayer, the party prevailing below. <em>Yopp v. Hodges, </em>43 Va.App. 427, 430, 598 S.E.2d 760, 762 (2004). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In November of 1998, Mayer and Surles began dating. At the time, Mayer had a ten-month-old son, James. During the early months of his relationship with Mayer, Surles saw James \u201cmaybe twice, three times a month.\u201d During the summer of 1999, however, Mayer started to work from her home, and Surles and James began to have contact \u201calmost [ ] everyday.\u201d At that point, James had virtually no contact with Cullen, his biological father. As a result, Surles served as James\u2019 primary father figure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In February of 2000, Mayer and Surles moved in together. They separated soon afterwards, when Mayer discovered that Surles had \u201ccheated on her.\u201d In the middle of July, however, the parties reunited, and, one month later, Mayer discovered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>that she was pregnant with Surles\u2019 child. In May of 2001, Mayer gave birth to Kayla. The parties never married, however, and, in December of 2002, they ended the relationship. Surles has since become engaged to another woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">While Mayer and Surles were living together, Surles was, on at least two separate occasions, physically abusive toward Mayer. Specifically, Surles once \u201cshoved Ms. Mayer in the bedroom over a laundry basket and onto the bed.\u201d On another occasion, Surles, who \u201chad been drinking,\u201d \u201csmack[ed]\u201d Mayer while at the home of a family friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Following the parties\u2019 separation, Mayer filed a petition for custody of Kayla. On May 5, 2003, the Spotsylvania County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court entered a \u201cCustody/Visitation Order\u201d granting the parties joint legal custody of Kayla. According to the court order, Mayer obtained primary physical custody of Kayla, and Surles received the right to \u201creasonable and seasonable visitation\u201d with the child. Following entry of this custody order, James occasionally accompanied his half-sister to Surles\u2019 home for visitation. James\u2019 last visit with Surles occurred in November of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In late 2003, Mayer\u2019s father moved to Florida. Accordingly, Mayer\u2014who worked as a loan officer for a mortgage company\u2014decided to accept a transfer offer to Florida. In January of 2004, Mayer notified Surles by letter that she intended to relocate to Florida in March of 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">After receiving the letter, Surles filed a motion to amend the May 2003 custody order on the grounds that Mayer \u201cis moving to Florida.\u201d Surles requested that he \u201cbe granted physical custody of Kayla or that [Mayer] be prohibited from moving from Virginia,\u201d reasoning that, if Mayer were permitted to relocate, Kayla \u201cwill be effectively alienated from her Father.\u201d Surles also filed a petition seeking visitation with James, alleging that James \u201cis a child whose visitation requires determination as provided by [Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(3) ].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">After conducting an expedited hearing regarding Surles\u2019 petition to amend the May 2003 custody order, the juvenile and domestic relations district court denied Surles\u2019 request. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>By final order dated April 8, 2004, the court also held that Mayer was permitted to move to Florida with Kayla, further providing that Surles was to receive visitation with Kayla \u201cfor six consecutive days per month beginning April 2004.\u201d Immediately following issuance of the order, Mayer moved to Florida. The rest of Mayer\u2019s family\u2014including her mother and stepfather\u2014soon followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">After Mayer moved to Florida, the juvenile and domestic relations district court scheduled a hearing to resolve the merits of Surles\u2019 petition for visitation with James. Cullen\u2014 James\u2019 biological father\u2014did not appear at the hearing before the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By order dated September 10, 2004, the district court denied Surles\u2019 request for visitation with James. Surles appealed this decision to the circuit court, and he also appealed the April 2004 order allowing Mayer to relocate to Florida and denying Surles\u2019 petition to amend the custody arrangement regarding Kayla.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">While the appeals to the circuit court were pending, Mayer and Surles had difficulties scheduling his court-ordered visitation with Kayla. These problems apparently stemmed from the parties\u2019 different work schedules\u2014Mayer preferred to have the visitation begin on a weekend, so she would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>to miss work, whereas Surles\u2014a firefighter who works four ten-hour days a week\u2014preferred to have visitation begin on one of his days off, which are often weekdays. However, although Surles was only given six consecutive days of visitation with Kayla under the April 2004 visitation order, Mayer allowed him \u201cseven or more\u201d days of visitation on some occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Also, because Mayer missed several office meetings while trying to convey Kayla to and from Virginia, she lost the job that enabled her to work at home. Instead, in September of 2004, she started a new office job as a loan processor with another mortgage company. As a result, Mayer enrolled Kayla in a \u201cHead Start\u201d program that lasts from approximately 8:00 a.m. until 5:15 p.m. Kayla also started gymnastics lessons in Florida, and James became involved in a Cub Scouts program. Also, after moving to Florida, Kayla stopped having problems with her allergies, which had troubled her since birth. Thus, Kayla\u2019s allergy specialist recommended that she stop taking her prescription allergy medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">During the May 10 hearing before the circuit court, Surles testified that he had been a \u201cfather figure\u201d to James and had \u201ctreated [James] just like he was my son.\u201d Surles also said that he \u201ctook [James] under [his] wing\u201d because James\u2019 biological father \u201cwas only around ... a handful of times\u201d during \u201cthe first couple years.\u201d Similarly, Surles\u2019 father testified that Surles\u2019 relationship with James was \u201cjust like any father would have with any son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">As to Kayla, Surles said that, when she comes to visit, \u201c[s]he\u2019s a whole lot more clinging to me\u201d than she had been before the move to Florida. Similarly, Surles\u2019 father\u2014Kayla\u2019s grandfather\u2014testified that, generally, Kayla \u201cseems to be a little bit nervous and very glad to be here.\u201d Surles also said that, if he is awarded custody of Kayla, he has made arrangements for her to receive child care while he is at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">At the conclusion of Surles\u2019 case-in-chief, Mayer moved to strike the petition for visitation with James, reasoning that there was no evidence that James would suffer actual harm in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the absence of visitation. In response, Surles argued that \u201cactual harm has been shown at this point\u201d because the child has been \u201cemotionally harmed by the fact that he has limited contact with Mr. Surles____\u201d Mayer also made a second motion to strike, arguing that Surles lacked standing to seek visitation with James because he did not fall within the \u201cstatutory standard of a party who has a legitimate interest.\u201d In response, Surles argued that he fell within the statutory definition of \u201cblood relatives and family members\u201d because he is the father of James\u2019 half-sister. The court took both motions to strike under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Mayer, testifying on her own behalf, stated that her entire family now resides in Florida. Specifically, in addition to her father and stepmother, Mayer\u2019s brother, half-brother, stepbrother, uncle and seven-year-old cousin, grandfather, and step-grandparents live in Florida. According to Mayer, the children have become close to each of these members of her family. For example, Mayer stated that, in the year and a half since the family moved to Florida, the children visited with her brother (their uncle) between twelve and fifteen times, each visit lasting for an entire weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Additionally, Mayer testified that Surles was involved with other women on three separate occasions during the course of their two-and-a-half-year relationship. Surles objected on the grounds of relevance, and Mayer responded that the evidence was relevant because \u201cSurles is trying to paint himself as a man who is completely and utterly concerned about his family.\u201d The court overruled the objection, noting its belief that \u201cmorals are always an issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">According to Mayer, the first incident involving another woman\u2014to which Surles had already admitted during his prior cross-examination\u2014occurred soon after the parties moved in together. The second incident occurred when Mayer was \u201capproximately three and a half months pregnant\u201d with Kayla. Mayer testified that the third incident occurred in December of 2002, presumably precipitating the parties\u2019 decision to end the relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Following the parties\u2019 closing arguments, the trial court granted Mayer\u2019s motion to strike Surles\u2019 petition for visitation with James, reasoning that Surles \u201cis not a party in interest\u201d under Code \u00a7 20-124.1 because he does not \u201chav[e] a biological connection with [James].\u201d Thus, by final order dated July 25, 2005, the court found that Surles \u201cis not a person with a legitimate interest pursuant to Virginia Code Section 20-124.1, ... and further finds that pursuant to Section 20-124.3, ... the best interests of the child are supported by the continued placement of said child with [Mayer] without order of visitation to [Surles].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">As to the petition for custody of Kayla, the circuit court ruled that \u201cit is appropriate to allow the relocation of the child to Florida\u201d because \u201cthe benefit to Kayla of the relocation to Florida outweighs the detriment [to] her relationship [with Surles].\u201d Thus, the court concluded that \u201cthe best interests of the child would be served by continued residence in Florida and physical custody to [Mayer].\u201d This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In this consolidated appeal, Surles argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for visitation with James, contending: (1) that he is a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1, and (2) that, considering the factors set forth in Code \u00a7 20-124.3, awarding visitation would be in the best interests of the child. In regard to Kayla, Surles contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to amend the May 2003 custody order or, in the alternative, to deny Mayer\u2019s request to move to Florida. Surles reasons: (1) that granting him custody of Kayla would be in the best interests of the child; (2) that the harm to his relationship with Kayla caused by Mayer\u2019s relocation to Florida outweighs the benefit of the relocation to the child; and (3) that the trial court erred in considering evidence that Surles had been involved in relationships with other women.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that, although Surles is a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1 and, thus, has standing to pursue visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>with James, he failed to establish that, in the absence of visitation, James would suffer actual harm. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Surles\u2019 petition for visitation with James. We further hold that the trial court did not err in denying Surles\u2019 petition to amend the May 2003 custody order and in permitting Mayer to relocate to Florida. Moreover, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence demonstrating Surles\u2019 tendency to engage in simultaneous relationships with multiple women. Finally, we deny Mayer\u2019s request for an award of the attorneys\u2019 fees she incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">A. <em>The Petition for Visitation with James</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_B\">Under Virginia law, an individual who is not the biological parent of a child may, under certain circumstances, petition for visitation with that child. Specifically, according to Code \u00a7 20-124.2, a trial court may, \u201cupon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the best interest of the child would be served thereby!,] award ... visitation to any [ ] person with a legitimate interest.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B). The phrase \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\"><em>\u201cPerson with a legitimate interest\u201d </em>shall be broadly construed and includes, but is not limited to grandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members provided any such party has intervened in the suit or is otherwise properly before the court. The term shall be broadly construed to accommodate the best interest of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Code \u00a7 20-124.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">Initially, then, we must consider whether Surles qualifies as a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest,\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1. This presents a pure issue of statutory construction, which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (\u201c[A]lthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>1. <em>Whether Surles Is a \u201cPerson with a Legitimate Interest\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">When deciding whether Surles is a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1, we begin, as always, with the plain language of the statute, for \u201c \u2018[w]here the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). \u201cWe must ... assume that the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the ... statute, and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">As noted above, Code \u00a7 20-124.1 lists several types of individuals who qualify as a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest,\u201d specifically, \u201cgrandparents, stepparents, former stepparents, blood relatives and family members.\u201d Surles does not fall within the plain meaning of any of these terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unquestionably, Surles is not a grandparent, stepparent, or former stepparent, nor is he a \u201cblood relative\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or a \u201cfamily member\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of James. Regardless, we hold that Surles\u2014who acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>as a surrogate father to James for almost four years\u2014is a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">As both parties correctly note, when a statute expressly lists the individuals to be encompassed by its terms, the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>generally bars application of the statute to persons other than those specifically enumerated in the statute. <em>See Smith Mountain Lake Yacht Club v. Ramaker, </em>261 Va. 240, 246, 542 S.E.2d 392, 395 (2001); <em>Commonwealth v. Brown, </em>259 Va. 697, 704-05, 529 S.E.2d 96, 100 (2000). It is this principle upon which Mayer principally relies in arguing that Surles has no standing to request visitation with James.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">However, in enacting Code \u00a7 20-124.1, the legislature provided that the phrase \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d includes, <em>\u201cbut is not limited to,\u201d </em>the designated individuals. Code \u00a7 20-124.1 (emphasis added). Moreover, the legislature expressly stated that the phrase \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d is to be \u201cbroadly construed to accommodate the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The list of individuals in the statute, then, is clearly intended to be illustrative, not exhaustive. Thus, the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is, by its very nature, inapplicable. <em>See Santa Ana v. Garden Grove, </em>100 Cal.App.3d 521, 160 Cal.Rptr. 907, 910 (1979) (\u201cUse of those words [but not limited to] manifests a legislative intent that the statute not be given an <em>\u2018expressio unius \u2019 </em>construction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Turning now to the applicable canons of statutory construction, we note that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">[u]nder the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>when a particular class of persons or things is enumerated in a statute and general words follow, the general words are to be restricted in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>meaning to a sense analogous to the less general, particular words. Likewise, according to the maxim <em>noscitur a sociis </em>... [,] when general and specific words are grouped, the general words are limited by the specific and will be construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those things identified by the specific words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\"><em>Wood by &amp; Through Wood v. Henry County Pub. Schs., </em>255 Va. 85, 94-95, 495 S.E.2d 255, 260-61 (1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Inc. v. Kappa Sigma Fraternity, </em>266 Va. 455, 470, 587 S.E.2d 701, 710 (2003). Thus, if a statute provides an illustrative list of persons or things to which its provisions should apply, an unenumerated person or thing must be \u201csimilar in nature\u201d to those expressly listed in order to fall within the scope of the statute. <em>Wood, </em>255 Va. at 95, 495 S.E.2d at 261; <em>see also Helvering v. Morgan\u2019s, Inc., </em>293 U.S. 121, 125 n. 1, 55 S.Ct. 60, 61 n. 1, 79 L.Ed. 232 (1934) (\u201c[T]he verb \u2018includes\u2019 imports a general class, some of whose particular instances are those specified in the definition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">To qualify as a \u201cperson -with a legitimate interest,\u201d then, a petitioner need not establish that he is a \u201cgrandparent ], stepparent ], former stepparent ], blood relative[ ][or] family member[ ].\u201d Rather, the petitioner need only show that he maintains a relationship with the child similar in nature to those expressly listed in Code \u00a7 20-124.1. <em>See In re Henderson, </em>96 B.R. 820, 825 (Bankr.E.D.Tenn.1989) (\u201c[I]n cases in which the relationship at issue is not one of the relationships enumerated in [the statute], the relevant inquiry is whether the relationship nonetheless falls within the general class ... contemplated by the statute. One way to undertake this analysis ... is to consider whether the relationship at issue is similar to or has characteristics of any of the relationships [expressly listed in the statute].\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, when determining whether the relationship between the petitioner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>the child qualifies the petitioner as a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest,\u201d we must keep in mind that this phrase is to be broadly construed, so as to accommodate the best interests of the child. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.1. Ultimately, whether a petitioner\u2019s relationship with a child is sufficient to qualify that petitioner as a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d is a fact-specific inquiry that must be resolved on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Here, as Surles argues, his relationship with James is the functional equivalent to that of a \u201cformer stepparent.\u201d It is uncontroverted that Surles resided in the same household as James for almost three years, while maintaining a relationship with James\u2019 mother similar to that of husband and wife. During that time period, Surles served as James\u2019 primary father figure, and he developed a close relationship with the child. Also during this time period, Surles and James\u2019 mother conceived and gave birth to another child\u2014James\u2019 half-sibling. There can be little doubt that, under these circumstances, James and Surles developed a relationship similar to\u2014if not closer than\u2014that ordinarily established between a stepfather and his stepson.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Thus, under the circumstances of this case, we hold that Surles is a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1. Accordingly, the trial court erred in holding that Surles lacked standing to pursue visitation with James. However, because Surles failed to present any evidence indicating that the absence of visitation would result in \u201cactual harm\u201d to James, <em>see </em>Part II(A)(2), <em>infra, </em>we also hold that this error is harmless as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">2. <em>Whether the Trial Court Erred in Denying the Petition for Visitation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The \u201cliberty interest at issue in this case\u2014the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children\u2014is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\u201d <em>Troxel v.

Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 784-85, 485 S.E.2d 651, 654 (1997), <em>ajfd as modified, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998)) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Surles, as the party requesting visitation with James, bore the burden of producing clear and convincing evidence that James would suffer \u201cactual harm\u201d to his \u201chealth or welfare\u201d in the absence of visitation. <em>See id. </em>at 85, 581 S.E.2d at 903. Because Surles failed to produce any evidence\u2014much less clear and convincing evidence\u2014that would support a finding of \u201cactual harm\u201d to James\u2019 \u201chealth or welfare,\u201d we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the petition for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Surles argues, however, that the \u201cactual harm\u201d standard established in <em>Williams </em>and its progeny does not apply under the circumstances of this case. Surles reasons that James\u2019 biological father \u201cdid not appear at the hearing ... to express his opinion as to whether [Surles] should be entitled to court-ordered visitation.\u201d Surles concludes that, because James\u2019 biological father \u201cvoiced no objection as to the visitation,\u201d the \u201cactual harm\u201d standard is inapplicable because he was not, in fact, requesting visitation \u201cover the objection of the child\u2019s parents.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">This Court has held that the actual harm standard does not apply where one parent objects to the third party\u2019s request for visitation, but the other parent affirmatively requests that the third party be allowed visitation. <em>See Yopp, </em>43 Va.App. at 438, 598 S.E.2d at 765; <em>Dotson v. Hylton, </em>29 Va.App. 635, 639, 513 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1999). Also, where the third party already possesses, through a valid consent order, joint legal custody of the child and sole physical custody of the child, the \u201cactual harm\u201d standard is likewise inapplicable. <em>Denise, </em>46 Va.App. at 388, 617 S.E.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We have never held, however, that, if a biological parent fails to voice an objection to visitation, that failure to object amounts to acquiescence in the third-party\u2019s petition for visitation. Indeed, in <em>Griffin, </em>we held that the \u201cactual harm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>standard was applicable where the biological father, who merely \u201cappeared and testified that he paid child support, but did not intend to foster a relationship with the child,\u201d did not actually \u201crequest that visitation be awarded to [the third party].\u201d <em>Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. at 80, 83-84, 581 S.E.2d at 900, 902. Similarly, here, James\u2019 biological father did not \u201crequest that visitation be awarded to [Surles].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although Cullen did not appear at the hearing and voice a formal objection to visitation, we decline to hold that a biological parent\u2019s silence is the functional equivalent of that parent\u2019s affirmative consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">In a similar vein, Surles contends that Mayer did not actually object to his petition for visitation, reasoning that she only testified that she objected to \u201ca specific schedule of visitation.\u201d We disagree. Mayer never testified that she agreed to any form of court-ordered visitation. In fact, when asked whether she was \u201coffering a schedule of visitation at all for James,\u201d Mayer responded in the negative. Viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to Mayer, it is clear that, although Mayer did not wish for a court order \u201cprohibit[ing] [Surles from] hav[ing] contact with James,\u201d she did, in fact, oppose any form of court-ordered visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, then, neither of James\u2019 biological parents affirmatively requested that Surles receive visitation with James. <em>Cf. Yopp, </em>43 Va.App. at 438, 598 S.E.2d at 765; <em>Dotson, </em>29 Va.App. at 639, 513 S.E.2d at 903. Thus, the \u201cactual harm\u201d standard enunciated in <em>Williams </em>applies to Surles\u2019 petition for visitation. <em>See Griffin, </em>41 Va.App. at 80, 83-84, 581 S.E.2d at 900, 902. And, because Surles failed to produce any evidence from which it could be determined, under the clear and convincing standard of proof, that James would suffer actual harm in the absence of court-ordered visitation, his request for visitation fails as a matter of law. Accordingly, although the trial court erred in holding that Surles lacked standing to pursue visitation with James, that error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>3. <em>Whether the Court Erred in Permitting Mayer to Relocate to Florida with James</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Finally, Surles contends that the trial court erred in permitting Mayer to relocate to Florida with James, reasoning that, as a result of the move, \u201cthe minor child was unable to maintain the regular contact that he had with [Surles] prior to the move.\u201d Surles, however, never raised this argument before the trial court. Although the argument that Mayer should not have been allowed to relocate to Florida is preserved with respect to Surles\u2019 relationship with his own daughter, <em>see </em>Part 11(B)(2), <em>infra, </em>Surles never cited his relationship with James as a ground for preventing Mayer from relocating. Accordingly, we hold that Surles is proeedurally barred from raising this issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18; <em>see also Roberts v. Roberts, </em>41 Va.App. 513, 525, 586 S.E.2d 290, 296 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">B. <em>Whether the Court Erred in Denying Surles\u2019 Petition for Custody of Kayla and Permitting Mayer to Relocate to Flordia</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">In a separate appeal, Surles contends that the trial court erred in denying his petition requesting modification of the May 2003 custody order, or, in the alternative, an order preventing Mayer from relocating to Florida with his daughter. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that the best interests of Kayla would be served by continuing to reside with her mother, nor did the court err in permitting Mayer to relocate to Florida. We also hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Mayer to present evidence that, while the parties were cohabitating, Surles was involved in relationships with other women. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">1. <em>Whether the Court Erred in Denying the Petition to Amend the Custody Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">When a party requests a modification of a preexisting custody order, the trial court, \u201cin determining whether a change in custody should be made, must apply a two-pronged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>test.\u201d <em>Ohlen v. Shively, </em>16 Va.App. 419, 423, 430 S.E.2d 559, 561 (1993). First, the trial court must decide \u201cwhether there has been a [material] change in circumstances since the most recent custody award.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If so, the trial court must next determine \u201cwhether a change in custody would be in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Keel v. Keel, </em>225 Va. 606, 611, 303 S.E.2d 917, 921 (1983); <em>Denise, </em>46 Va.App. at 395, 617 S.E.2d at 425. Under the circumstances of this case, the burden of proving each of these elements was upon Surles, the party seeking modification of the May 2003 custody order. <em>See Denise, </em>46 Va.App. at 397, 617 S.E.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The trial court, when denying Surles\u2019 motion to amend the May 2003 custody order, did not make an express finding that Surles carried his burden of proving a material change in circumstances. Rather, the court merely held \u201c[t]hat the best interests of the child would be served by ... [an award of] physical custody to [Mayer].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we assume, without deciding, that Mayer\u2019s decision to relocate to Florida constituted a material change in circumstances, and consider only whether the best interests of the child would be served by continuing to reside with her mother. <em>See Sullivan v. Jones, </em>42 Va.App. 794, 595 S.E.2d 36 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Code \u00a7 20-124.3 lists several factors that the trial court must consider when determining whether a change in custody would further the best interests of the child. As noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, however, \u201cthere is no simple, mechanical, cut and dried way to determine whether a change in custody will be in the best interests of children.\u201d <em>Keel, </em>225 Va. at 613, 303 S.E.2d at 922. Rather, \u201cthe trial court is bound to consider evidence sufficient to allow it to make a rational comparison between the circumstances of the two parents as those circumstances affect the children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>erally, this \u201crequires an analysis to determine which parent is better qualified to provide the highest quality of care to the child and which home will provide the child with the greatest opportunity to fulfill his or her potential.\u201d <em>Turner v. Turner, </em>3 Va.App. 31, 36, 348 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1986). Ultimately, this Court \u201cafford[s] great deference to the trial court\u2019s determination of what is in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Yopp, </em>43 Va.App. at 439, 598 S.E.2d at 766. Accordingly, unless the court fails to consider the required statutory factors or applies an incorrect legal standard, a trial court\u2019s decision as to whether a change in custody would be in the best interests of the child is reversible on appeal only if \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bailes v. Sours, </em>231 Va. 96, 101, 340 S.E.2d 824, 828 (1986); <em>Petry v. Petry, </em>41 Va.App. 782, 790, 589 S.E.2d 458, 462 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Mayer, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining that Kayla\u2019s best interests would be served by continuing to reside with her mother. Kayla, along with her older half-brother, James, has been in Mayer\u2019s sole custody and care since she was bom. If custody of Kayla were transferred to Surles, she would no longer have daily contact with her sibling. There can be little doubt that separating the children would adversely affect the relationship Kayla has with James, who is only three years her senior. And, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, \u201c[w]here it is reasonably possible, brothers and sisters of tender years should be reared together, and have the full benefit of natural ties of affection and interest that such association develops.\u201d <em>Hepler v. Hepler, </em>195 Va. 611, 623, 79 S.E.2d 652, 659 (1954); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.3(4) (providing that the trial court should give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to the child\u2019s relationship with, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201csiblings\u201d); <em>Hughes v. Gentry, </em>18 Va.App. 318, 323, 443 S.E.2d 448, 451-52 (1994) (\u201c[T]he effect of the separation of siblings must be and should be considered by a court during both the initial determination of custody and in subsequent determinations of change of custody.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Also, under their current work schedules, both parties would be required to provide child care for Kayla. After moving to Florida, Mayer placed Kayla in a \u201cHead Start\u201d program, thereby giving the child a routine day-to-day schedule that also provides her with certain educational benefits. And, although Surles testified that he made arrangements for Kayla to receive child care if he were awarded custody, he did not produce any evidence indicating that the selected child care facility would be similar in nature to a \u201cHead Start\u201d program.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Moreover, Surles has, in the past, engaged in acts of domestic violence, whereas no evidence indicates that Mayer is prone to such acts. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.3(9) (providing that the trial court should consider \u201c[a]ny history of family abuse\u201d). Also, although Surles is engaged to marry, he did not introduce any evidence as to the identity, background, or character of his fianc\u00e9e, who would be an important figure in Kayla\u2019s daily life if Surles were to receive primary physical custody of the child. Finally, although the parties have struggled to establish an acceptable visitation schedule, Mayer has frequently allowed Surles longer periods of visitation than that to which he is strictly entitled. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.3(7) (providing that the trial court should consider \u201c[t]he propensity of each parent to actively support the child\u2019s contact and relationship with the other parent, including whether a parent has unreasonably denied the other parent access to or visitation with the child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">From these facts, the trial court\u2019s determination that a change of custody would not be in Kayla\u2019s best interests is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying the petition to amend the May 2003 custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">2. <em>Whether the Trial Court Erred in Permitting Mayer to Relocate to Florida</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u201cNo Virginia statute specifically addresses relocation of a custodial parent.\u201d <em>Petry, </em>41 Va.App. at 789, 589 S.E.2d at 462. However, upon petition by either parent, \u201c[a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>court may forbid a custodial parent from removing a child from the state without the court\u2019s permission, or it may permit the child to be removed from the state.\u201d <em>Scinaldi v. Scinaldi, 2 </em>Va.App. 571, 573, 347 S.E.2d 149, 150 (1986). Before granting a custodial parent permission to remove a child from the state, \u201cthe court must find: (1) a material change in circumstances since the prior decree; and, (2) that relocation would be in the children\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Wheeler v. Wheeler, </em>42 Va.App. 282, 288, 591 S.E.2d 698, 701 (2004); <em>see also Parish v. Spaulding, </em>257 Va. 357, 362, 513 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1999). The party seeking permission to relocate bears the burden of establishing both of these elements, <em>Sullivan, </em>42 Va.App. at 806, 595 S.E.2d at 42, and, on appeal, the court\u2019s decision granting or denying permission to relocate is not reversible unless \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Here, the trial court did not make an express finding as to whether there had been a \u201cmaterial change in circumstances\u201d since entry of the May 2003 custody order. However, this Court has held that \u201cthe relocation of [a] custodial parent constitutes a material change of circumstances,\u201d thereby vesting the trial court with jurisdiction to modify a prior custody decree. <em>Hughes, </em>18 Va.App. at 322, 443 S.E.2d at 451; <em>see also Parish v. Spaulding, </em>26 Va.App. 566, 573, 496 S.E.2d 91, 94 (1998), <em>affd, </em>257 Va. 357, 513 S.E.2d 391 (1999). Because it is undisputed that Mayer moved to Florida prior to the circuit court hearing, the evidence establishes a material change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Turning now to the issue presented on appeal, we must determine whether the trial court erred in holding that Kayla\u2019s best interests would be served by permitting Mayer to relocate to Florida. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court\u2019s decision is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">As noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, in deciding whether relocation should be permitted, \u201c[t]he welfare of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>children [is] the controlling consideration,\u201d and \u201call other matters\u201d are \u201csubordinate.\u201d <em>Parish, </em>257 Va. at 362, 513 S.E.2d at 393. For this reason, where the party seeking permission to relocate has already moved out of state, the trial court may consider any resulting positive or negative changes in the child\u2019s life, regardless of whether those changes occurred after the relocation. <em>See Sullivan, </em>42 Va.App. at 809-10, 595 S.E.2d at 43-44; <em>see also Parish, </em>257 Va. at 363, 513 S.E.2d at 394. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201c[i]f the court could not retroactively approve a move or order a change in custody[,] ... having before it evidence that the relocation of the children or the modification of custody would be in the best interests of the children, the court would be required to act contrary to the best interests of the children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Sullivan, </em>42 Va.App. at 810, 595 S.E.2d at 44 (quoting <em>Parish, </em>26 Va.App. at 572, 496 S.E.2d at 94). Thus, \u201c \u2018[w]e [have] deeline[d] to establish such a rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Parish, </em>26 Va.App. at 572, 496 S.E.2d at 94).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Here, when viewed in the light most favorable to Mayer, the evidence establishes that Kayla is happy, adjusted, and well-settled in her new environment. She has become involved in several community activities, including gymnastics and a local \u201cHead Start\u201d program. <em>Cf. Sullivan, </em>42 Va.App. at 809, 595 S.E.2d at 43 (affirming order permitting relocation where the child, <em>inter alia, </em>had become \u201cintegrated] into the [new] community\u201d). All of Kayla\u2019s maternal relatives\u2014with whom she has developed close relationships\u2014reside in Florida. <em>See Petry, </em>41 Va.App. at 793-94, 589 S.E.2d at 464 (affirming order permitting relocation where, <em>inter alia, </em>the trial court \u201chad ample basis to conclude that the children would benefit from the nurture and support of their extended family in New York\u201d). Also, Kayla\u2019s new home \u201cha[s] a lot more room\u201d than the house she occupied in Virginia, including a playroom inside the home. More importantly, Kayla\u2019s allergies\u2014for which she consistently required medication while living in Virginia\u2014no longer trouble her. Kayla also has been geographically removed from an area in which she witnessed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>traumatic event, specifically, a criminal \u201creach[ing] over Kayla\u2019s head and grabbling] Mayer\u2019s purse.\u201d From these facts, the trial court could reasonably have inferred that Kayla\u2019s quality of life improved significantly during the year after she moved to Florida with her mother and half-brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Unquestionably, Kayla\u2019s relocation may result in less frequent visitation with her father and paternal relatives. However, \u201cthe added difficulty in maintaining a beneficial relationship between a child and a non-eustodial parent should not be the sole basis for restricting a custodial parent\u2019s residence except where the benefit of the relationship cannot be substantially maintained if the child is moved away. . . .\u201d <em>Scinaldi, </em>2 Va.App. at 575, 347 S.E.2d at 151. Here, the trial court found that \u201cthe benefit to Kayla of the relocation to Florida, outweighs the detriment [to] her relationship [with] [Surles].\u201d Considering, as discussed above, the positive aspects of the relocation, that factual finding is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See Wheeler, </em>42 Va.App. at 295, 591 S.E.2d at 705; <em>Goodhand v.

Accordingly, the trial court has broad latitude to admit any evidence that is relevant to the past, present, or future welfare of the child. <em>See Keel, </em>225 Va. at 613, 303 S.E.2d at 922 (holding that \u201cthe trial court should consider the broadest range of evidence\u201d so that it may \u201cmake a rational comparison between the circumstances of the two parents as those circumstances affect the children\u201d); <em>see also Armistead v. Armistead, </em>228 Va. 352, 357, 322 S.E.2d 836, 838 (1984); <em>M.E.D. v. J.P.M., </em>3 Va.App. 391, 407, 350 S.E.2d 215, 225 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Here, Surles contends that the trial court abused its discretion because the fact he had \u201ccheated\u201d on Mayer on multiple occasions was not relevant to the issue of whether he should receive custody of his daughter. Because this evidence is relevant to Kayla\u2019s best interests, however, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Mayer to testify about Surles\u2019 relationships with other women.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Specifically, Surles engaged in at least three affairs with other women while cohabitating with Mayer. The third of these affairs precipitated the parties\u2019 decision to end their relationship, resulting in Kayla\u2019s removal from a two-parent to a one-parent home. Thus, Surles\u2019 affairs have, in the past, had a direct and negative impact on Kayla\u2019s well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Moreover, Surles\u2019 inability to refrain from engaging in affairs with other women has created palpable hostility between Kayla\u2019s biological parents, which plainly does not foster the child\u2019s best interests. Thus, the fact that Surles \u201ccheated\u201d on Mayer has undermined the parties\u2019 present abilities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>cooperate, thereby affecting Kayla\u2019s present and future ability to interact freely with both parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Additionally, Surles\u2019 tendency to engage in affairs with other women bears upon the future stability of his home. Surles testified that he has become engaged to marry. Should he demonstrate the same philandering tendencies with his future \"wife, he would be placing Kayla at risk of once again being exposed to a broken home. The fact that Surles has been unable to maintain a monogamous relationship in the past is therefore relevant to Kayla\u2019s future welfare if Surles were to be given primary physical custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Finally, as noted by the Virginia Supreme Court, \u201c[t]he moral climate in which the children are to be raised is an important consideration for the court in determining custody, and adultery is a reflection of a [parent\u2019s] moral values.\u201d <em>Brown v. Brown, </em>218 Va. 196, 199, 237 S.E.2d 89, 91 (1977). The fact that Surles demonstrated little or no compunction in \u201ccheating\u201d on the mother of his child has some bearing on his moral character. Accordingly, this evidence was relevant to the \u201cmoral climate\u201d in which Kayla would be raised if Surles were to receive custody of the child. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIt is within common knowledge and experience that a child learns by example, especially from his parents. Such utter disregard for moral guidance and social standards can have but ill effect upon the young [child].\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <em>cf. Roe v. Roe, </em>228 Va. 722, 727, 324 S.E.2d 691, 694 (1985) (\u201cThe father\u2019s continuous exposure of the child to his immoral and illicit relationship renders him an unfit and improper custodian as a matter of law.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that evidence of Surles\u2019 relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ships with other women was both relevant and admissible. <em>See Brown, </em>218 Va. at 199, 237 S.E.2d at 91 (\u201cAn illicit relationship to which minor children are exposed cannot be condoned. Such a relationship must necessarily be given the most careful consideration in a custody proceeding.\u201d); <em>see also Rosenberg v. Rosenberg, </em>210 Va. 44, 47, 168 S.E.2d 251, 253 (1969) (noting that \u201cadultery is highly relevant to the issue[ ] of ... custody\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">C. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Finally, Mayer has requested an award of the attorneys\u2019 fees she incurred on appeal. However, because this litigation \u201caddressed appropriate and substantial issues,\u201d and \u201cneither party generated unnecessary delay or expense in pursuit of its interests,\u201d <em>Estate of Hackler v. Hackler, </em>44 Va.App. 51, 75, 602 S.E.2d 426, 438 (2004), we deny Mayer\u2019s request for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in concluding that Surles is not a \u201cperson with a legitimate interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 20-124.1. However, because Surles failed to present evidence that James would suffer actual harm in the absence of visitation, we further hold that the court\u2019s error was harmless. We also hold that the trial court did not err in denying Surles\u2019 request for custody of Kayla or in permitting Mayer to relocate to Florida with Kayla. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Mayer to introduce evidence that Surles, while cohabitating with Mayer, engaged in affairs with other women. Thus, we affirm the judgments below. Finally, we deny Mayer\u2019s request for an award of the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\">. The guardians <em>ad litem </em>failed to file an appellate brief, appear during oral argument, or otherwise enter an appearance before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. The record reflects that Cullen began informal visitation with James when the child was approximately two years old. Cullen also pays child support to Mayer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b206-7\">. However, on March 5, 2004, Cullen mailed a letter to the court indicating that he was on full bed rest recovering from major surgery and would, therefore, be unable to appear at the hearing. Cullen further informed the court that he opposed Surles' motion for visitation, that he was \"in full agreement\u201d with Mayer\u2019s \"decision to relocate to Florida,\u201d and that the two had \"mutually agreed on visitation [with James] after [Mayer\u2019s] expected move in March of 2004.\u201d This letter was directed solely to the attention of the \"court of Spotsylvania,\u201d and it was marked \u201cReceived and Filed\u201d in the circuit court on September 21, 2004. Because the parties presumably were unaware of the letter's existence, it was not introduced as an exhibit in the proceedings before the circuit court, and it was not included in the Joint Appendix filed on appeal. Also, the record fails to indicate whether the trial court considered this letter when reaching its decision. Regardless, because, as discussed in Part 11(A)(2), <em>infra, </em>the letter is not necessary to the resolution of this appeal, we need not decide whether it would have been appropriate for the trial court to consider its contents when deciding the merits of this case, nor do we decide whether it would be appropriate for this Court to consider the letter on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">. Surles maintained before the trial court, and in his opening brief in this Court, that he qualifies as both a \"blood relative\u201d and a \"family member\u201d within the meaning of the statute. However, during oral argument, Surles conceded that he does not fall within the plain meaning of these terms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\">. A \"blood relative\u201d is one who shares a common ancestor with the child, <em>see Black's Law Dictionary </em>164 (7th ed.1999) (defining \u201cblood\u201d as \"[t]he relationship by descent from a common ancestor\u201d), and, thus, is directly related to that child by a consanguineous relationship, <em>see Doyle v. Commonwealth, </em>100 Va. 808, 811, 40 S.E. 925, 926 (1902) (defining \"consanguinity\u201d as \"relation by blood\u201d); <em>see also Black\u2019s, supra, </em>at 299 (defining \"consanguinity\u201d as \"[t]he relationship of persons of the same blood or origin\u201d). Thus, a \"blood relative\u201d would be, for example, a grandparent, aunt, uncle, cousin, sibling, nephew, or niece.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b211-8\">. The generally accepted definition of a \"family\u201d is \"[a] group of persons connected by blood, by affinity, or by law.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s, supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>620. Thus, a \u201cfamily member\u201d is an individual who is related to the child by \u201cblood,\u201d <em>see </em>note 5, <em>supra, </em>by \u201caffinity,\u201d which is \"the relation of one spouse to the other spouse\u2019s kindred,\u201d <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 454, 460, 585 S.E.2d 852, 855 (2003), or by \"law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. We note that the determinative relationship is not that between the petitioner and the child\u2019s natural parent, but rather, the relationship between the petitioner and the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. Although the trial court did not spell out the reasons underlying its decision, Surles does not argue that the trial court failed to \"communicate to the parties the basis for [its] decision,\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-124.3. <em>Cf. Kane </em>v. <em>Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 585 S.E.2d 349 (2003). Accordingly, we do not address this issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. Surles also argues that the evidence was inadmissible under Rule 1:1 because his conduct occurred \"prior to the last order of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court concerning Kayla.\u201d However, the fact that the misconduct occurred prior to an earlier custody order does not render it entirely devoid of probative value in a subsequent custody hearing. Accordingly, this argument is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
