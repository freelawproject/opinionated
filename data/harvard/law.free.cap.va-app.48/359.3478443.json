The trial court suspended imposition of sentence on the robbery convictions for twenty years upon certain conditions and sentenced Bullock to consecutive terms of three and five years\u2019 incarceration in the Department of Corrections on the firearm convictions. On appeal, Bullock contends the trial court erred (1) in refusing to consider the possibility of allowing him to serve any part of his sentences in a juvenile facility under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(l)(i) and (2) in concluding it lacked the discretion under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to suspend any portion of the mandatory minimum sentences on the firearm convictions or to set those sentences to run concurrently. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The relevant facts and procedural posture of this case are not in dispute. Using a twelve-gauge shotgun, Bullock robbed Brian Walthall at gunpoint of $40 on February 22, 2004. Approximately thirty minutes later, Bullock robbed William Buckman at gunpoint of $20. Shortly after the second robbery, Bullock was arrested and charged with the two robberies and with using a firearm in the commission of each of the robberies. Bullock was sixteen years old at the time of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Bullock was subsequently certified to be tried as an adult in the circuit court, and a grand jury returned indictments charging him with the two robberies and the two related firearm offenses. On September 30, 2004, Bullock pled guilty in the circuit court to all four charges. After hearing a summary of the evidence, the court accepted Bullock\u2019s guilty pleas and convicted him of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">At the sentencing hearing, both parties agreed that the trial court had the discretion to sentence Bullock as a serious juvenile offender under Code \u00a7 16.1-272 with respect to the robbery convictions. They disagreed, however, as to what discretion the court had with respect to sentencing Bullock for the use of a firearm convictions. Bullock argued that, under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1), the court could and should allow him to serve all or at least part of his sentences on the two firearm convictions as a serious juvenile offender in the Department of Juvenile Justice. The balance of his sentence, if any, he further argued, could then be served as an adult in the Department of Corrections. He further argued that the two mandatory minimum sentences required by Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 could be suspended in whole or in part under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) or be set to run concurrently with each other. The prosecutor argued that the inflexible \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 precluded application of the discretionary sentencing options in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) and required that the two mandatory minimum sentences on the firearm convictions be served consecutively with each other in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>the Department of Corrections, without suspension or reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the trial court suspended imposition of sentence on the robbery convictions for twenty years on certain conditions. Stating it lacked the discretion to \u201csuspend any part of the time\u201d of the mandatory minimum sentences required by Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and that they \u201cmust run consecutively],\u201d the court sentenced Bullock to serve consecutive terms of three and five years\u2019 incarceration on the use of a firearm convictions. Asked by defense counsel if it would \u201cconsider committing [Bullock] under [Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i) ] so that at least some of th[e] time [would be] in the juvenile system,\u201d the court responded: \u201cNo, the Court is sentencing him as an adult. The appropriate placement will be determined by the Department of Corrections.\u201d Asked by the court if \u201cthere [was] anything else,\u201d both parties responded in the negative, and the proceedings ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">This appeal involves the application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-53.1 and 16.1-272(A)(1). Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any ... shotgun ... or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing ... robbery.... Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction, and to a mandatory minimum term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction under the provisions of this section. Such punishment shall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-10\">In any case in which a juvenile is indicted, the offense for which he is indicted and all ancillary charges shall be tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in the same manner as provided for in the trial of adults, except as otherwise provided with regard to sentencing....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">1. If a juvenile is convicted of a violent juvenile felony, for that offense and for all ancillary crimes the court may order that (i) the juvenile serve a portion of the sentence as a serious juvenile offender under \u00a7 16.1-285.1 and the remainder of such sentence in the same manner as provided for adults; (ii) the juvenile serve the entire sentence in the same manner as provided for adults; or (in) the portion of the sentence to be served in the same manner as provided for adults be suspended conditioned upon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case including, but not limited to, commitment under subdivision 14 of \u00a7 16.1-278.8 or \u00a7 16.1-285.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Because Bullock was a juvenile who was tried and convicted as an adult in the circuit court on two counts of robbery\u2014a \u201cviolent juvenile felony\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1\u2014and two ancillary counts of use of a firearm in the commission of those robberies, both Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) were facially applicable to Bullock\u2019s sentencing. After suspending imposition of sentence on the robbery convictions, the trial court sentenced Bullock \u201cas an adult\u201d to consecutive terms of three and five years\u2019 incarceration in the Department of Corrections on the two firearm convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">A. The Trial Court\u2019s Consideration of Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(l)(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">Bullock claims the trial court abused its discretion during sentencing by \u201crefus[ing] to consider the possibility of sentencing [him] to serve part of his sentence[s]\u201d on the use of a firearm convictions in a juvenile correctional facility, as permitted by Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014272(A)(1)(i). Bullock concedes \u201cthe trial court had the authority to sentence him as it did\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(ii). He asserts, however, that, having \u201cimproperly adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s position\u201d that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 precluded Bullock from serving any part of his sentences on the firearm convictions in the juvenile system, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the court failed to \u201cgive proper consideration\u201d to the sentencing alternative available under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i). Thus, Bullock contends, this matter should be remanded to the trial court for reconsideration of sentencing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u201cAbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977); <em>see also Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 391, 396, 404 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1991) (\u201cOn appeal, the judgment of the trial court is presumed correct.\u201d). The party alleging reversible error has the burden \u201cto show by the record\u201d that the alleged error occurred. <em>Johnson, </em>12 Va.App. at 396, 404 S.E.2d at 387; <em>see also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 630, 635, 432 S.E.2d 2, 6 (1993) (\u201cAn appellate court must dispose of the case upon the record and cannot base its decision upon appellant\u2019s petition or brief, or statements of counsel in open court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">For purposes of this appeal, we will assume, without deciding, that the underlying contention implicit in Bullock\u2019s claim of error\u2014that the trial court was required, in determining the sentences for Bullock\u2019s use of a firearm convictions, to specifically consider the sentencing alternative set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i)\u2014is correct. Nevertheless, we find that the record before us fails to show by clear evidence that the alleged error actually occurred. Indeed, although the record shows the trial court refused to allow Bullock to serve any part of his sentences on the firearm convictions in a juvenile facility, the record fails to support by clear evidence Bullock\u2019s assertion that the trial court refused to \u201cconsider the possibility\u201d of allowing him to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">To the contrary, taken as a whole, the record supports the conclusion that, in determining Bullock\u2019s sentences on the firearm convictions, the trial court was aware of and gave consideration to all of the sentencing alternatives set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1). The record demonstrates that Bullock\u2019s counsel thoroughly advised the trial court of the sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing options available to it under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) and argued at length in favor of the court allowing Bullock to serve part, if not all, of his sentences in the juvenile system under Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i) or 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii). Defense counsel specifically advised the court that Bullock \u201cshould not be put in the adult system\u201d and that the court could \u201csentence him as a serious juvenile offender\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i) and allow him to serve at least the first part, if not all, of his total sentence in the juvenile system. After the trial court announced it was suspending imposition of sentence on the robbery convictions and imposing a total sentence of eight years on the firearm convictions, Bullock\u2019s counsel specifically asked if the court would allow Bullock to serve at least some of the imposed sentence in a juvenile facility. The court responded in the negative, stating simply that it was \u201csentencing [Bullock] as an adult.\u201d In other words, having been informed by counsel that Bullock could be properly committed to the Department of Juvenile Justice under Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i) and 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii) or sentenced to the Department of Corrections as an adult under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014272(A)(1)(ii), the court decided that the sentencing alternative set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(l)(ii) was the most appropriate option under the circumstances before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">There being no clear evidence in it to the contrary, the record thus shows that, in sentencing Bullock \u201cas an adult,\u201d in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(ii), the court gave consideration to and ultimately rejected the other sentencing options available under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1). The court\u2019s failure, in announcing its decision, to specifically indicate it had considered the sentencing alternative set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i) does not ineluctably lead to the conclusion that the court failed to consider that alternative. Despite being given the opportunity to do so, neither party asked the court to articulate the basis for its decision, and nothing in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) required the court to make any findings or otherwise expressly indicate that it had considered the sentencing alternative available under Code \u00a7 16.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>272(A)(1)(i) before refusing Bullock\u2019s request to be sentenced under that section. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Bullock to serve any time in the juvenile system does not constitute a failure by the court to consider the possibility of sentencing him under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Moreover, there is no clear evidence in the record that supports Bullock\u2019s assertion that the trial court adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s position that the court had to sentence Bullock to the Department of Corrections under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Although he provides no factual basis for that assertion, Bullock apparently equates the court\u2019s negative response to defense counsel\u2019s inquiry whether the court would consider allowing Bullock to serve at least a part of his total sentence for the firearm convictions in the juvenile system with a determination by the court that it lacked the discretion to do so. We will not, however, \u201cfix upon isolated statements of the trial judge taken out of the full context in which they were made, and use them as a predicate for holding the law has been misapplied.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>217 Va. at 978, 234 S.E.2d at 291. Indeed, when taken in context with the trial court\u2019s other comments in announcing its rulings from the bench, the trial court\u2019s statement that it would not consider allowing Bullock to serve any time in a juvenile facility because the court was \u201csentencing him as an adult\u201d does not support Bullock\u2019s assertion that the court adopted the Commonwealth\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In declaring it lacked the discretion to suspend Bullock\u2019s sentences on the firearm convictions, the trial court stated that it <em>could not </em>\u201csuspend any part of the time.\u201d In announcing it lacked the discretion to set the two sentences on the firearm convictions to run concurrently, the court stated the two sentences <em>\u201cmust </em>run consecutively].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court, however, made no such declaration regarding its discretion when it ruled on Bullock\u2019s request to be allowed to serve some part of his sentences in a juvenile facility. The court merely indicated it would not consider sentencing Bull<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ock as a juvenile under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014272(A)(1)(i) because it was \u201csentencing him as an adult,\u201d the sentencing alternative available under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(ii). Given its earlier comments, it is clear that, had the court believed it lacked the discretion to consider allowing Bullock to serve some part of his sentences as a juvenile offender under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i), it would have said so. It did not, and, there being no clear evidence in the record showing otherwise, we cannot say the court failed to consider the possibility of sentencing Bullock as a serious juvenile offender under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We hold, therefore, that Bullock failed to meet his burden of showing by the record that the alleged error actually occurred. Accordingly, we reject Bullock\u2019s claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">B. The Trial Court\u2019s Sentencing Discretion under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Bullock contends the trial court erred in concluding it lacked the discretion under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to suspend any portion of his sentences on the firearm convictions. According to Bullock, the legislature\u2019s amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in 2004 permitted the court to suspend his sentences under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014272(A)(1)(iii). Bullock also contends the trial court erred in concluding it lacked the discretion under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to set his two mandatory minimum sentences on the firearm convictions to run concurrently with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In considering the merits of Bullock\u2019s claims, we are guided by the elementary principle that \u201c[t]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998). Thus, we construe a statute \u201cwith reference to its subject matter, the object sought to be attained, and the legislative purpose in enacting it; the provisions should receive a construction that will render it harmonious with that purpose rather than one which will defeat it.\u201d <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003). Furthermore, although \u201c[i]t is a cardinal principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of law that penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth]\u201d and \u201ccannot be extended by implication, or be made to include cases which are not within the letter and spirit of the statute,\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1960), \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein,\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">1. Suspension of Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Bullock concedes that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 requires the imposition of a \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, may not normally be suspended. Bullock also acknowledges that this Court determined in <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 567, 507 S.E.2d 627 (1998), that the inflexible terms of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 prohibiting suspension of the mandatory sentence imposed for a use of a firearm conviction prevailed over the discretionary terms of Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) permitting suspension of a juvenile offender\u2019s sentence. Bullock asserts, however, that <em>Green </em>was superseded by the General Assembly\u2019s amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in 2004. As amended, Bullock argues, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 no longer specifically precludes suspension under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014272(A)(1)(iii) of a juvenile offender\u2019s sentence for a use of a firearm conviction. Thus, Bullock concludes, the trial court erred in ruling it lacked the discretion to suspend the mandatory minimum sentences imposed for his firearm convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In response, the Commonwealth contends that, notwithstanding the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green </em>still controls and precludes the suspension of Bullock\u2019s firearm sentences under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii). We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Consideration of Bullock\u2019s contention that the legislature\u2019s 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 abrogated our decision in <em>Green </em>requires a review of <em>Green </em>and the legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tive background of the amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 that followed. <em>See generally Lucy v. County of Albemarle, </em>258 Va. 118, 122, 516 S.E.2d 480, 481 (1999) (holding that courts may review the legislative background of statutes at issue where the statutes \u201care in apparent conflict and susceptible to differing constructions\u201d and judicial construction is necessary to reconcile them in a manner \u201cconsistent with legislative intent\u201d). At the time we examined the application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-53.1 and 16.1-272(A)(1) in <em>Green, </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction, and for a term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction under the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sentence prescribed for a violation of the provisions of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part, nor shall anyone convicted hereunder be placed on probation. Such punishment shall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The relevant part of Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) provided then, as it does now, that the sentence of a juvenile offender sentenced as an adult may \u201cbe suspended conditioned upon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A74\">Observing in <em>Green </em>that the application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-53.1 and 16.1-272(A)(1) appeared to be in conflict \u201cbecause one allow[ed] what the other specifically prohibited],\u201d we considered the plain meaning of the terms of the statutes, noting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 states that courts \u201cshall\u201d sentence one convicted of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony to a mandatory sentence \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d The word \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d is defined as \u201cwithout prevention or obstruction from or by.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1545 (1993). Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>that understanding of the word, we conclude that the terms of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 are not limited by other incongruous laws because the General Assembly intended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to function \u201cwithout obstruction\u201d from them. Nothing in Code \u00a7 16.1-272 contradicts this interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><em>Green, </em>28 Va.App. at 569-70, 507 S.E.2d at 628-29. We further noted that Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) did \u201cnot contain mandatory language as [did] Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1\u201d and reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\">Our interpretation of the statutes is also in concert with our opinion in <em>LaFleur v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 190, 366 S.E.2d 712 (1988). In <em>LaFleur, </em>we interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in light of Code \u00a7 19.2-311, which allowed alternate sentencing for certain youthful offenders. We found that the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was \u201c \u2018to deter violent criminal conduct rather than to reform the most dangerous class of criminals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 366 S.E.2d at 713 (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 763, 250 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1979)). To apply the juvenile sentencing provisions in place of the mandatory sentence in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cwould substitute a discretionary penalty for an inflexible one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201cthe General Assembly has directed a contrary policy which courts must follow,\u201d we held a mandatory sentence was rightfully imposed. <em>Id. </em>We are under no less a burden to follow the General Assembly\u2019s clear mandate in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-7\"><em>Green, </em>28 Va.App. at 570, 507 S.E.2d at 629. For these reasons, we held that \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-53.1 required the trial court to impose [an] ... unsuspended sentence despite the provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-272.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">In 2004, the General Assembly of Virginia passed House Bill 1059, whereby Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was amended to its present form by adding the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d to describe the terms of imprisonment to be imposed and deleting the sentence \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, the sentence prescribed for a violation of the provisions of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part, nor shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>anyone convicted hereunder be placed on probation.\u201d 2004 Va. Acts, c. 461, at 674. In the same bill, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\"><em>\u201cMandatory minimum </em>\u201d wherever it appears in this Code means, for purposes of imposing punishment upon a person convicted of a crime, that the court shall impose the entire term of confinement, the full amount of the fine and the complete requirement of community service prescribed by law. The court shall not suspend in full or in part any punishment described as mandatory minimum punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALC\"><em>Id. </em>It is clear, therefore, that, while the 2004 amendment removed the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d clause from Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the amended statute retained, under the definition of \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, its prohibition against suspending any part of the mandatory sentence imposed for a use of a firearm conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In contending the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 abrogated this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Green, </em>Bullock relies exclusively on our judgment in <em>Green </em>that the phrase \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d indicated the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 were intended to take precedence over the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) and on the General Assembly\u2019s deletion of that phrase when it amended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in 2004. The removal of that phrase, Bullock argues, clearly reflected the General Assembly\u2019s intent to supersede <em>Green </em>and allow the courts to apply the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii) to suspend any part, if not all, of a juvenile offender\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence for a use of a firearm conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Although seemingly sound at first glance, Bullock\u2019s argument ultimately fails under closer scrutiny. For one thing, Bullock\u2019s exclusive reliance on the removal of the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d clause from Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to support his argument that the 2004 amendment abrogated our decision in <em>Green </em>ignores the fact that we based our decision in <em>Green </em>on two separate, independent grounds, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>one of which involved the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d clause. Indeed, after addressing the meaning of the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d clause in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, we proceeded in <em>Green </em>to address the application of our rationale in <em>LaFleur </em>regarding the statute\u2019s underlying purpose. <em>Green, </em>28 Va.App. at 570, 507 S.E.2d at 629. Noting that, unlike Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1), Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 contained \u201cmandatory language\u201d and that \u201cthe purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was \u2018\u201cto deter violent criminal conduct rather than to reform the most dangerous class of criminals,\u201d \u2019 \u201d we held that \u201c[t]o apply the juvenile sentencing provisions [in Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) ] in place of the mandatory sentence in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u2018would substitute a discretionary penalty for an inflexible one\u2019 \u201d in subversion of \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s clear mandate\u201d and thwart the statute\u2019s purpose, which we could not do. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>LaFleur, </em>6 Va.App. at 192, 366 S.E.2d at 713 (quoting <em>Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 763, 250 S.E.2d at 763)). As it was unrelated to the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d clause in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, this rationale provided a separate, independent basis for our decision in <em>Green.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Because we had a separate, independent basis for our decision in <em>Green </em>that was undisturbed by the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, we cannot say the 2004 amendment reflects an intent by the General Assembly to countermand our decision in <em>Green. See Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 803, 805, 553 S.E.2d 729, 730 (2001) (\u201cWhen the General Assembly acts in an area in which one of its appellate courts already has spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the court has stated it and to acquiesce therein, and if the legislature intends to countermand such appellate decision it must do so explicitly.\u201d) Indeed, while the 2004 amendment to Code 18.2-53.1 removed the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d clause from the statute, it did not add any provision to the statute explicitly allowing the courts to apply Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii) or any other statute to suspend part, if not all, of a mandatory minimum sentence imposed under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. To the contrary, when read in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>junction with Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1 still provides that the trial court \u201cshall impose the entire term of confinement\u201d required by the statute for a firearm conviction and that the court \u201cshall not suspend in full or in part any\u201d of that term of confinement. Plainly, the aforementioned purpose ascribed to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in <em>Ansell, LaFleur, </em>and Green\u2014 \u201cto deter violent criminal conduct rather than to reform the most dangerous class of criminals\u201d\u2014remains unchanged, despite the 2004 amendment. To read the amended statute as Bullock urges would undermine that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We conclude, therefore, that, notwithstanding the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, our decision in <em>Green </em>remains valid and precludes the courts from applying Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014272(A)(1)(iii) to suspend any part of a mandatory minimum sentence imposed under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The legislative background of the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 further buttresses this conclusion. While it is true that, \u201cin the field of statutory construction, a presumption normally arises that a change in law was intended when new provisions are added to prior legislation by an amendatory act,\u201d <em>Boyd v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 16, 20, 215 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1975) (per curiam), no such presumption arises where \u201cthere is clear indication that the General Assembly intended that the legislation declare or explain existing law,\u201d <em>Chappell v. Perkins, </em>266 Va. 413, 420, 587 S.E.2d 584, 587-88 (2003) (citing <em>Boyd, </em>216 Va. at 20, 215 S.E.2d at 918). Here, the legislative background of the 2004 amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 clearly demonstrates that the amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was not a \u201cchange[ ] of substance, which add[ed] rights to, or withdr[e]w existing rights from, an original act,\u201d but rather a \u201cchange[ ] of form, which merely interpreted\u201d the existing law. <em>Boyd, </em>216 Va. at 20, 215 S.E.2d at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">As previously mentioned, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1 in House Bill 1059. <em>See </em>2004 Va. Acts, c. 461, at 674. In the same bill, the General Assembly amended twenty-five other existing statutes involving mandatory penalties. <em>See id. </em>at 673-90. All but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>of the statutes amended by the General Assembly in House Bill 1059 were altered to include the specific phrase \u201cmandatory minimum,\u201d or to exclude language made redundant by the inclusion of the definition of that phrase in Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, or, like Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, to do both. <em>See id.; </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-305; 18.2-36.1; 18.2-51.1; 18.2-57; 18.2-121; 18.2-154; 18.2-248; 18.2-248.01; 18.2-248.1; 18.2-248.5; 18.2-255; 18.2-255.2; 18.2-270; 18.2-308.1; 18.2-308.2; 18.2-308.2:2; 18.2-308.4; 19.2-120; 30-19.1:4; 46.2-301; 46.2-341.28; 46.2-357; 46.2-391; 53.1-203. The remaining statute was amended, for apparent stylistic purposes, by rearranging the passage therein containing the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum.\u201d <em>See </em>2004 Va. Acts, c. 461, at 689; Code \u00a7 53.1-116.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">According to the legislative summary accompanying House Bill 1059, the amendments set forth in House Bill 1059 were enacted in response to recommendations by the Virginia State Crime Commission based on its study of Title 18.2. <em>See </em>House Bill 1059, <em>Mandatory minimum, punishment; definition </em>(2004), <em>available at </em>http://legl.state.va.us/041/lis.htm. The Crime Commission recommended \u201camendments throughout the Virginia Code to use consistent language when describing mandatory minimum criminal sentences.\u201d Beport of the Virginia State Crime Commission to the Governor and General Assembly of Virginia, <em>The Reorganization and Restructuring of Title 18.2, </em>House Document 15, 5 (2004), <em>available at </em>http:// leg2.state.va.us/dls/h&amp;sdocs.nsf/By+Year/HD152004/$file/ HD15\u20142004.pdf. To that end, the Commission suggested that a \u201cdefinition of mandatory minimum punishment [be] added to the Code and language in various sections throughout the Code [be] conformed\u201d with that definition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">It is clear, therefore, that the underlying purpose of the amendments set forth in House Bill 1059 was not to make substantive changes to the existing Code sections that required or referred to mandatory penalties, but to make the language used in those sections consistent with the new statutory definition of \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d set forth in Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-12.1 and to make other minor editorial corrections where necessary. The changes in each of the twenty-five other statutes amended in House Bill 1059 are consistent with this view. Plainly, then, the General Assembly did not intend, in enacting House Bill 1059, to substantively change the existing scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1 to permit suspension under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii) of the mandatory sentences required by Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Rather, it intended merely to make the terms of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 conform with those of Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1. Thus, the General Assembly added the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d to describe the terms of imprisonment to be imposed under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and deleted those terms that became surplusage with Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1\u2019s addition to the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err in ruling it lacked the discretion to suspend Bullock\u2019s sentences on his firearm convictions under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">2. Consecutive or Concurrent Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Bullock contends that, because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 does not specifically require that mandatory sentences on multiple use of a firearm convictions run consecutively <em>with each other, </em>the trial court erred in concluding it lacked the discretion to allow Bullock to serve his three-and five-year sentences for his use of a firearm convictions concurrently. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 requires the trial court to sentence a person convicted of using a firearm in the commission of a felony \u201cto a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction, and to a mandatory minimum term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction.\u201d As previously mentioned, the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is \u201cto deter violent criminal conduct by imposing a mandatory penalty,\u201d not to reform or rehabilitate \u201c \u2018the most dangerous class of criminals.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaFleur, </em>6 Va.App. at 192, 366 S.E.2d at 713 (quoting <em>Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 763, 250 S.E.2d at 763). Read in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 expressly requires the court to \u201cimpose the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>term of confinement\u201d and provides that \u201c[t]he court shall not suspend [the sentence] in full or in part.\u201d We construe this language as meaning that the trial court may not set the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentences imposed for multiple convictions under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to run concurrently with each other. To construe the statute as Bullock urges would require us to apply \u201c \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein\u201d and thwart the statute\u2019s purpose, which we may not do. <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 581, 562 S.E.2d at 144 (quoting <em>Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 761, 250 S.E.2d at 761); <em>see also LaFleur, </em>6 Va.App. at 192, 366 S.E.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not err in ruling that Bullock\u2019s \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentences on his firearm convictions \u201cmust run consecutively]\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and Bullock\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
