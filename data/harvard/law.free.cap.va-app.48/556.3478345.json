Glenn (\u201cGlenn\u201d) appeals his convictions for robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, and conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-22. On appeal, Glenn argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, reasoning that the police officers, while searching his residence, obtained certain evidence in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, Glenn contends that, although his grandfather\u2014the owner of the premises\u2014consented to the search of the house, that consent did not give the officers the authority to open a closed container located in Glenn\u2019s bedroom. For the following reasons, we agree that, in this case, an objectively reasonable police officer would not have believed that the grandfather\u2019s consent to search the premises also gave the officer the authority to open the closed container. Accordingly, we reverse Glenn\u2019s convictions and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">\u201c[0]n appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below.\u201d <em>Aldridge v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 618, 638, 606 S.E.2d 539, 549 (2004). So viewed, the evidence in this case establishes the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">In the early hours of January 4, 2004, Glenn and his cousin were driving down a road in the City of Colonial Heights when they saw \u201ca white guy walking down the street.\u201d Glenn and his cousin decided to rob the pedestrian. The two men pulled their car \u201coff to a side street,\u201d got out of the vehicle, approached the pedestrian, pointed a gun at him, and said, \u201cGive me all your money.\u201d After taking the victim\u2019s cell phone and $370 in cash, they fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Four days later, Detective Dan Ferguson, Detective Greg Russell, and Captain Mo Williams obtained arrest warrants for Glenn and his cousin. After taking Glenn\u2019s cousin into custody, the three officers went to the address identified on the arrest warrant as Glenn\u2019s residence. When they got to the house, Glenn\u2019s mother and grandmother said that Glenn was not there, but was probably \u201con his way home\u201d to his grandfather\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The officers then went to the home of Glenn\u2019s grandparents, where Glenn had been residing for about two months. They knocked on the front door, and Glenn answered. The officers asked Glenn \u201cif his name was Keith Glenn,\u201d and Glenn said that it was. The officers then arrested Glenn, handcuffed him, and read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">After Glenn\u2019s arrest, the officers and Glenn \u201cwent into the house.\u201d The officers escorted Glenn to the living room, where Glenn\u2019s grandfather was \u201cwalking around.\u201d The three detectives identified themselves as police officers, \u201casked the grandfather if he understood, and he shook his head yes.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Captain Williams then asked the grandfather if the officers could search the house. The grandfather again nodded yes. Captain Williams also asked if Glenn paid rent to stay in the home, and the grandfather shook his head no.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Detective Ferguson then began to search the house. Glenn stayed in the living room while Ferguson conducted the search. At no time did the officers ask Glenn for consent to search his rooms or their contents, nor did Glenn object to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Ferguson first searched the room closest to the living room, which Glenn had indicated was the \u201croom he slept in.\u201d In that room, Ferguson found three mattresses propped up against the wall and \u201cvarious boxes of women\u2019s clothing.\u201d Having found no evidence of the crime, Ferguson left the room and looked down the hallway. Glenn then pointed down the hall and stated, \u201cOh yeah, I sleep in that bedroom as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Ferguson entered the second room and searched it. He found a pair of pants on the bed, men\u2019s clothing hanging in the closet, a cell phone lying on the closet floor, and a backpack on the bedroom floor. The backpack was closed, and Ferguson had to \u201cmanipulate it open\u201d to see its contents. Inside the backpack, Ferguson found $45 in cash, a wallet containing Glenn\u2019s identification, and another cell phone, which matched the description of the phone stolen during the armed robbery.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this point, Captain Williams \u201cescorted\u201d Glenn from the living room to the door of the bedroom. Glenn identified the backpack as belonging to him, and he claimed to have found the phone lying on the ground in Colonial Heights.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Glenn was taken to the police station, where he gave a full confession, both written and verbal. A grand jury subsequently indicted Glenn for robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Before trial, however, Glenn filed two pretrial motions to suppress. In one motion, Glenn requested that the trial court \u201csuppress any and all statements made by the defendant ... to all law enforcement agencies,\u201d arguing that the statements were obtained after he invoked his right to remain silent and, thus, in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. In the second motion, Glenn requested that the trial court suppress \u201call evidence obtained and/or recovered by the Commonwealth incident to his arrest at his residence on the grounds that the search is in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, [and] Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of Virginia____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The trial court, by written order dated June 25, 2004, denied both motions to suppress, reasoning, as pertinent to this appeal, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Mr. Brooks, the defendant\u2019s grandfather and owner of the residence, consented to the search of the property without reservation or qualification. Mr. Brooks also indicated to the police that the defendant did not pay rent. The rooms that were searched were open to view and contained a mixture of personal property, which the police subsequently learned belonged to the defendant and his grandmother, Rose Brooks. The defendant was present at the search, observed the search, and took no action to countermand his grandfather\u2019s permission by advising the police that he objected to the search of that portion of the residence he later claimed he occupied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">After the trial court denied the motions to suppress, Glenn entered a conditional guilty plea to the counts of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Glenn then filed a petition for appeal to this Court, assigning as error both that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the physical evidence recovered during the search of the residence and that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress his statements to the police. This Court granted the petition for appeal as to the motion to suppress the physical evidence, and denied the petition for appeal as to the motion to suppress Glenn\u2019s statements to the police. Thus, the sole issue presented on appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress the physical evidence found in Glenn\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">II. MERITS OF THE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (en banc) (citing <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). \u201cHowever, we consider <em>de novo </em>whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>those facts implicate the Fourth Amendment and, if so, whether the officers unlawfully infringed upon an area protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Shaver v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 789, 794-95, 520 S.E.2d 393, 396 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, we must consider two separate, but related, questions. First, we must decide whether the grandfather\u2019s consent authorized the police officers to search Glenn\u2019s bedroom. Second, we must also consider whether the grandfather\u2019s consent authorized the police officers to open Glenn\u2019s backpack. For the reasons that follow, we hold that, although the grandfather\u2019s consent to search the bedroom was valid, that consent did not authorize the officers to open a closed container found in that bedroom. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A. <em>Validity of the Third-Party Consent as to the Bedroom</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">The Fourth Amendment protects \u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their person, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. However, although the Fourth Amendment \u201cordinarily prohibits] the warrantless entry of a person\u2019s house as unreasonable <em>per se, </em>one \u2018jealously and carefully drawn\u2019 exception recognizes the validity of searches [conducted pursuant to] the voluntary consent of an individual possessing authority\u201d to give that consent. <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 1520, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006) (quoting <em>Jones v. United States, </em>357 U.S. 493, 499, 78 S.Ct. 1253, 1258, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514 (1958)) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Individuals who possess the authority to consent to the search of a premises include \u201ca fellow occupant who shares common authority over property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 170, 94 S.Ct. 988, 992-93, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974)). Similarly, \u201cthe exception for consent extends even to entries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>and searches with the permission of a co-occupant whom the police reasonably, but erroneously, believe to possess shared authority as an occupant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 186, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 2800-01, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990)); <em>see also Bryant v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 465, 470-72, 573 S.E.2d 332, 335 (2002); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 725, 727-28, 432 S.E.2d 517, 519 (1993); <em>Caldwell v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 540, 542, 425 S.E.2d 534, 535 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In this case, Glenn\u2019s grandfather\u2014the owner of the premises\u2014gave the officers his consent to search the house. Glenn, although present, did not expressly object to that search. <em>Cf. Randolph, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 126 S.Ct. at 1528. Also, there was no evidence that Glenn\u2019s grandfather lacked the authority or ability to enter Glenn\u2019s bedroom whenever he wished. For example, there was no landlord-tenant relationship between Glenn and his grandparents, <em>cf. Stoner v. California, </em>376 U.S. 483, 489-90, 84 S.Ct. 889, 893-94, 11 L.Ed.2d 856 (1964); <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 610, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828 (1961); <em>United States v. DiPrima, </em>472 F.2d 550, 551 (1st Cir.1973), and Glenn\u2019s bedroom did not have a separate key, padlock, or other device restricting access to the room. In fact, Glenn\u2019s grandmother testified that she could \u201cgo in and out of [the bedroom] anytime [she] want[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">From these facts, it follows that the grandfather \u201cshar[ed] common authority\u201d over the bedroom and, thus, possessed the actual authority to consent to a search of that room. Thus, the general search of the premises, including the bedroom, did not violate Glenn\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. <em>See Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 993 (\u201cPermission to search [may be] obtained from a third party who possesses] common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">B. <em>Validity of the Third-Party Consent as to the Backpack</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">However, we must also decide whether the grandfather\u2019s consent to the search of his home also vested the officers with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the authority to open Glenn\u2019s backpack. <em>See Randolph, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 126 S.Ct. at 1522 (noting, for example, that, \u201cwhen it comes to searching through bureau drawers, there will be instances in which even a person clearly belonging on the premises as an occupant may lack any perceived authority to consent\u201d); <em>United States v. Karo, </em>468 U.S. 705, 725, 104 S.Ct. 3296, 3308, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (stating that when a third party gives consent to search a room, that person is not necessarily consenting to a search of the closed containers within the room). For the following reasons, we hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">An individual claiming Fourth Amendment protection must demonstrate a \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy in the invaded place,\u201d and it must be one which \u201csociety recognizes as reasonable.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 95-96, 110 S.Ct. 1684, 1686-87, 109 L.Ed.2d 85 (1990) (citations omitted). Clearly, \u201can individual has a heightened expectation of privacy in the contents of a closed container.\u201d <em>Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 253, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1805, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991) (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>see also United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 13, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 2484, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977) (\u201c[A] person\u2019s expectations of privacy in personal luggage are substantially greater than in an automobile.\u201d). \u201cLuggage, handbags, paper bags, and other containers are common repositories for one\u2019s papers and effects, and the protection of these items from state intrusion lies at the heart of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. at 253, 111 S.Ct. at 1805 (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. IV (\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their ... papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">However, it is also clear that a third party, with standing to do so, may validly consent to the search of a closed container, even though the actual owner of the container has a heightened expectation of privacy in its contents. <em>See, e.g., Frazier v. Cupp, </em>394 U.S. 731, 740, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 1425, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969) (cousin had authority to consent to search of the defendant\u2019s duffel bag, which both men used and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>had been left in the cousin\u2019s home); <em>United States v. Ladell, </em>127 F.3d 622, 624 (7th Cir.1997) (holding that a mother could consent to a search of her adult son\u2019s bedroom, including a closed duffle bag stored in between the mattresses on the bed); <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>562 F.2d 476 (7th Cir.1977) (holding that a woman can consent to a search of a bedroom, shared by herself and the man she lived with, including the closet). But consent to search a private container is only effective if given by someone \u201cwith common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the ... effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171, 94 S.Ct. at 993. Common authority \u201crests ... on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. at 994, n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The burden of proving the effectiveness of a third party\u2019s consent rests with the government. <em>United States v. Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d 861, 864 (10th Cir.1992) (citing <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148). The government can meet this burden by (1) coming \u201cforward with persuasive evidence of both shared use and joint access to or control over a searched area, which would demonstrate actual authority to consent,\u201d (2) \u201cshowing] that the owner of the property to be searched has expressly authorized a third party to give consent to the search,\u201d or (3) \u201cestablishing] consent by means of the apparent authority doctrine.\u201d <em>United States v. Welch, 4 </em>F.3d 761, 764 (9th Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In this case, there is no evidence to suggest that the grandfather possessed the <em>actual </em>authority to consent to a search of the backpack. Specifically, the Commonwealth presented no evidence\u2014much less \u201cpersuasive\u201d evidence\u2014from which it could be inferred that the grandfather owned, used, or was able to freely access either the backpack or its contents. <em>See id. </em>Indeed, Glenn\u2019s grandmother testified that neither she nor Glenn\u2019s grandfather ever used the backpack. It follows that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the grandfather possessed the actual authority to consent to a search of the backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Nor did the Commonwealth present any evidence indicating that Glenn had given his grandfather express authorization to consent to a search of the backpack. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the only remaining issue is whether the Commonwealth established that the grandfather had the <em>apparent </em>authority to consent to a search of the backpack. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">When determining whether an individual possesses apparent authority to consent to a search, the relevant inquiry is whether, under the totality of the circumstances, an objectively reasonable officer would \u201cconclude that the person providing consent had the requisite authority to do so.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>39 Va.App. at 471, 573 S.E.2d at 335. To establish that a third party has the apparent authority to consent to the search of a closed container, the Commonwealth must prove that an objectively reasonable police officer would have believed that the third party had \u201cjoint access or control\u201d of that container. <em>Matlock, </em>415 U.S. at 171 n. 7, 94 S.Ct. at 993 n. 7 (noting that authority to consent \u201crests on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control\u201d of the item or area being searched). This determination must be judged by the facts available to the officer at the moment the officer conducted the search. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 185-86, 110 S.Ct. at 2800-01. Accordingly, if the facts, as the officer reasonably believed them to be, would have justified an objectively reasonable belief that the third party either owned or maintained some level of control over a closed container found within the area being searched, the resulting search of that closed container does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>939 F.2d 1071, 1075 (D.C.Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Basinski, </em>226 F.3d 829, 834 (7th Cir.2000) (\u201c[A]pparent authority turns on the government\u2019s knowledge of the third party\u2019s use of, control over, and access to the container to be searched, because these characteristics are particularly probative of whether the individual has authority over the property.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Here, then, considering the totality of the circumstances, we must determine whether an objective police officer could have reasonably believed that the grandfather used, controlled, or had unrestricted access to the backpack and its contents. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Commonwealth failed to prove that an objectively reasonable police officer would have believed that the grandfather had control over, or joint access to, the backpack.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>the grandfather therefore lacked the apparent authority to consent, the resulting search of the backpack and its contents violated Glenn\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, establishes that Glenn lived with his grandparents, but did not have exclusive control over the rooms searched. Specifically, Glenn\u2019s grandmother could go in and out of the rooms and, in fact, kept a box of her personal belongings in Glenn\u2019s bedroom. Also, Glenn had a key to the house, but neither room he claimed as \u201chis\u201d had a separate key belonging solely to him. Thus, as discussed above, the officers could have formulated an objectively reasonable belief that the grandfather had the authority to consent to a search of Glenn\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">However, the record also establishes that Ferguson focused his search on the rooms identified by Glenn as those he \u201cslept in.\u201d When Ferguson entered the second bedroom, he saw a pair of pants lying across the bed. Glenn\u2019s clothes were hanging in the closet. The only item in the room not belonging to Glenn was a box of clothes that the officer may or may not have seen before he opened the backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Also, the backpack itself was closed, although not locked or otherwise sealed shut. <em>Cf. United States v. Block, </em>590 F.2d 535, 541 (4th Cir.1978) (although mother could consent to search of house, she could not consent to search of locked footlocker found in her son\u2019s room). And, although there is no evidence suggesting the backpack was tucked under the mattress or otherwise hidden from view, <em>cf. Commonwealth v. Sardone, </em>10 Mass. L. Rep. 97, 1999 WL 1319236 (Super.Ct.1999) (mother could not consent to the search of her son\u2019s knapsack that was at least partially under the foot of the bed in an area not visible from the door), there were no marks or tags on the backpack that would indicate its ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>From these facts, the question of whether the grandfather owned, used, or otherwise controlled the backpack was ambiguous, at best. And, although the backpack was located inside the grandfather\u2019s home, \u201c[f|or purposes of closed containers, mere possession of the container by a third party does not necessarily give rise to a reasonable belief that the third party has authority to consent to a search of its contents.\u201d <em>Basinski, </em>226 F.3d at 834; <em>see also Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 866 (\u201cTo hold that an officer may reasonably find authority to consent solely on the basis of the presence of a [container] in the home of another would render meaningless the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection of such [containers]. Given awareness by the police officers of the ambiguities present here with respect to the apparent ownership of the backpack, we hold that the police could not infer such authority merely from [the consenter\u2019s] ownership of the house.\u201d (internal quotations omitted) (third alteration in original)); <em>State v. Tonroy, </em>32 Kan.App.2d 920, 92 P.3d 1116, 1120 (2004) (\u201c[C]onsent by an owner or tenant of a residence does not necessarily give the police consent to search closed containers within the residence that belong to others.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Moreover, although not clearly addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States, many lower courts have held that the burden of proving apparent authority \u201ccannot be met if [law enforcement] agents, faced with an ambiguous situation, nevertheless proceed without making further inquiry.\u201d <em>Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 864. Thus, if the officers \u201cdo not learn enough, if the circumstances make it unclear whether the property about to be searched is subject to \u2018mutual use\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>by the person giving consent, \u2018then [a] warrantless [search] is unlawful without further inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Whitfield, </em>939 F.2d at 1075); <em>accord United States v. Waller, </em>426 F.3d 838, 846 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Chun Yen Chiu, </em>857 F.Supp. 353, 361 (D.N.J.1993); <em>People v. Jenkins, </em>22 Cal.4th 900, 95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044, 1093-94 (2000); <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>88 N.Y.2d 289, 644 N.Y.S.2d 673, 667 N.E.2d 323, 326-27 (1996); <em>Riordan v. State, </em>905 S.W.2d 765, 771 (Tex.App.1995); <em>State v. Kieffer, </em>217 Wis.2d 531, 577 N.W.2d 352, 359-60 (Wis.1998). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We have often noted that the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., Bryant, </em>39 Va.App. at 471-72, 573 S.E.2d at 335; <em>Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 652, 658, 529 S.E.2d 847, 850 (2000). Considering the heightened expectation of privacy that exists in closed containers, we believe that, when permitted by the circumstances, \u201creasonableness\u201d requires officers acting under third-party consent to make reasonable attempts to resolve any apparent ambiguity in the ownership or control over closed containers located within the place being searched. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at 2801 (holding that, when law enforcement officers obtain consent to search pursuant to apparent authority, if the \u201csurrounding circumstances could conceivably be such that a reasonable person would doubt [that authority exists] and not act upon [the consent] without further inquiry, ... <em>then [the] warrantless [search] without further inquiry is unlawful unless authority actually exists\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence, absent some affirmative indicia that the party consenting to a general search of the premises either owns or maintains some level of control over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>closed container found within the place being searched, law enforcement officers should not proceed further without first determining that the third party has an interest in the container sufficient to vest that party with the authority to consent to its search. To hold otherwise would encourage law enforcement officers to remain deliberately ignorant of whether the party consenting to the search has any interest in the closed container, thereby heightening the risk that those officers will infringe upon the Fourth Amendment rights of the absent owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In this case, although Glenn did not object to the search of his backpack, neither did he consent. He was instructed by the officers to wait in the living room while Ferguson conducted the search of the bedrooms. Thus, even if he had wanted to object to the search of his backpack, Glenn was not given the opportunity to identify the backpack as belonging to him until after it had been opened.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And, because it was ambiguous at best as to who owned the backpack, and because both Glenn and his grandfather were mere steps away, a reasonable officer should have made further inquiries and asked either the grandfather or Glenn for permission to search it. <em>See Salinas-Cano, </em>959 F.2d at 864. Because the officer failed to do so, we hold that the search was \u201cunlawful.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In sum, although the facts of this case would \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the grandfather \u201chad authority over the premises,\u201d those same facts were insufficient to \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that the grandfather either owned or shared control of the backpack. <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 188-89, 110 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>2801 (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It follows that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the grandfather possessed the apparent authority to consent to the search of the backpack. And, because an objective law enforcement officer could not have reasonably believed that the grandfather had the authority to consent to a search of the backpack, the resulting search violated the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in denying Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">III. APPROPRIATE APPELLATE REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">Code \u00a7 19.2-254 provides that, if a defendant who enters a conditional guilty plea \u201cprevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d Here, as discussed above, this Court partially denied Glenn\u2019s petition for appeal, thereby raising the question of whether Glenn should be allowed the opportunity to withdraw his conditional plea even though he only prevailed on appeal with respect to one of the two issues forming the basis for his plea. Accordingly, following oral arguments, this Court asked for additional briefing on the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">What effect, if any, does the partial denial of Appellant\u2019s petition for appeal have on this Court\u2019s application of Code \u00a7 19.2-254, which provides that a defendant who enters a conditional guilty plea \u201cshall be allowed to withdraw his plea\u201d if he \u201cprevails on appeal,\u201d or upon the Court\u2019s application of harmless error principles under Code \u00a7 8.01-678?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmCm\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that an appellant who partially prevails on appeal is entitled to an opportunity to withdraw his conditional guilty plea. We further hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>harmless error doctrine is inapplicable in the context of an appeal from a conditional guilty plea, and, therefore, we do not address whether the remaining evidence in the case\u2014specifically, Glenn\u2019s oral and written confessions\u2014provides such overwhelming evidence of guilt as to render the trial court\u2019s error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">A. <em>Whether an Appellant Who \u201cPartially Prevails\u201d on Appeal Is Entitled to Withdraw His Conditional Plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">No Virginia appellate court has ever addressed the question of whether an appellant who partially prevails on appeal should be entitled to withdraw his conditional plea. Every other jurisdiction to have directly addressed this issue, however, has held that an appellant should be given the opportunity to withdraw his conditional guilty plea if he succeeds in excluding, on appeal, evidence that would reasonably have influenced his decision to enter a conditional plea. We agree. Accordingly, we remand this case to give Glenn the opportunity to withdraw his conditional plea and, if he so chooses, proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Of the approximately thirty jurisdictions<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that authorize some form of a conditional plea procedure, at least four have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>held that a defendant who partially prevails on appeal is entitled to an opportunity to withdraw his conditional plea. For example, in <em>State v. Juarez, </em>120 N.M. 499, 903 P.2d 241 (N.M.Ct.App.1995), the New Mexico Court of Appeals observed that, \u201cif improperly admitted evidence could have influenced a defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, there is a fair inference that the evidence contributed to the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Thus, in situations involving a defendant who is \u201cpartially successful,\u201d the court concluded that it must \u201cremand so that Defendant may have the opportunity to reassess the admissible evidence in this case and either plead guilty or proceed to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Piorkowski, </em>236 Conn. 388, 672 A.2d 921 (1996), the Connecticut Supreme Court observed that, under the applicable state statute, \u201cthere may be suppression issues that result in only partial appellate success,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[t]he denial of a motion to suppress based on a claim of an unreasonable search and seizure\u201d could conceivably \u201cyield an appellate result suppressing part, but not all, of the evidence gathered as a result of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 930-31. The <em>Piorkowski </em>court concluded that, when an appellant has partially prevailed on the appeal of a conditional plea, the appropriate appellate remedy would be to remand so as to permit \u201cboth the state and the defendant ... to reevaluate their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>respective positions in light of the availability of some, but not all, of the evidence gathered as a result of the search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 931 n. 15; <em>accord United States v. Tantalo, </em>680 F.2d 903 (2d Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>69 F.3d 309, 317 n. 8 (9th Cir.1995); <em>People v. Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1, 28 (1974); <em>State v. Dinsmore, </em>182 Or.App. 505, 49 P.3d 830, 838 (2002), <em>aff'd, </em>336 Or. 565, 87 P.3d 1120 (2004); <em>see also United States v. Leake, </em>95 F.3d 409, 420 &amp; n. 21 (6th Cir.1996) (articulating a case-specific standard that \u201crequires an examination of the degree of success and the probability that the excluded evidence would have had a material effect on the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">We agree with the reasoning in these decisions. There is nothing in the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-254 indicating that an appellant must prevail on appeal with respect to every issue that formed a basis for his conditional plea. Where, as here, a defendant has sought to exclude two separate bodies of evidence on different constitutional grounds, and this Court only reverses the trial court\u2019s decision on one of those two grounds, it would be unduly harsh to punish that defendant for exercising his statutory right to appeal the denial of both motions to suppress. Holding that a defendant who \u201cprevails in part\u201d is not entitled to withdraw his conditional guilty plea would then have the practical effect of forcing a defendant to select just one appealable issue and waive any other constitutional objections he might have to the remaining evidence. This does not comport with either the spirit or language of Code \u00a7 19.2-254.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Accordingly, in situations where an appellant has conditionally pleaded guilty pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-254 and has been partially successful on appeal, we hold that the appropriate remedy is to remand the case \u201cso that Defendant may have the opportunity to reassess the admissible evidence in this case and either plead guilty or proceed to trial.\u201d <em>Juarez, </em>903 P.2d at 249.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because Glenn has prevailed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>merits of his motion to suppress the physical evidence recovered from the backpack, and because, for the reasons discussed in Part III(B), <em>supra, </em>application of the harmless error doctrine would be inappropriate, we remand this case to allow Glenn the opportunity to decide whether he \u201cwishes to withdraw [his] plea and go to trial,\u201d or, \u201cin light of [his] limited success on appeal, not to withdraw it.\u201d <em>Dinsmore, </em>49 P.3d at 838.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>B. <em>Applicability of the Harmless Error Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The Commonwealth argues, however, that Glenn has not \u201cprevailed\u201d on appeal, reasoning that the remaining evidence in the case\u2014specifically, Glenn\u2019s statements to the police\u2014 would be sufficient, standing alone, to support his conviction. Because \u201cGlenn may no longer prevail even if the suppression motion as to the search of his home was erroneously denied,\u201d the Commonwealth concludes that the trial court\u2019s error \u201cwas harmless.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">No Virginia appellate decision has ever addressed the question of whether the harmless error doctrine is applicable in the context of an appeal from a conditional guilty plea. We note, however, that, of the jurisdictions that have adopted some form of a conditional plea procedure, the overwhelming majority has declined to apply a harmless error analysis in cases involving a conditional guilty plea. The two cases that are generally considered the most authoritative in this respect are <em>People v. Grant, </em>45 N.Y.2d 366, 408 N.Y.S.2d 429, 380 N.E.2d 257 (1978), and <em>People v. Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1, 28 (1974), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by People v. DeVaughn, </em>18 Cal.3d 889, 135 Cal.Rptr. 786, 558 P.2d 872 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In <em>Grant, </em>the New York Court of Appeals held that the trial court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his confession. Although the state urged the court to affirm based on a harmless error analysis, the court vacated the conditional guilty plea and remanded for further proceedings. In rejecting the state\u2019s request to apply a harmless error analysis, the <em>Grant </em>court observed that, \u201c[bjecause harmless error rules were formulated to review trial verdicts, they are difficult to apply to guilty pleas.\u201d 408 N.Y.S.2d 429, 380 N.E.2d at 264. The court reasoned that, \u201c[wjithout a trial there will be little if any evidence in the record, apart from the proof which should have been excluded,\u201d and, \u201cwithout a verdict, there is no predicate for determining what causal effect the error had or might have had upon the fact finder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Grant </em>court therefore held that the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>inquiry should be \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c[t]his question [ ] is one which an appellate court is rarely equipped to answer without resorting to speculation,\u201d the court concluded that it was required to remand the case for further proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Similarly, in <em>Hill, </em>the California Supreme Court remanded to permit withdrawal of the defendants\u2019 conditional guilty pleas even though the \u201cbulk <em>of </em>the evidence which defendants sought to suppress would indeed be admissible if they were to be tried.\u201d 117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d at 28. There, the court reasoned that \u201c[t]he harmless error concept as a basis for according relief in such a setting is clearly inappropriate\u201d because \u201c[t]here simply is no intelligent means of assessing the impact of a particular erroneous refusal to suppress evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. The <em>Hill </em>court observed that, \u201c[ujnlike the ordinary post-trial appeal, there is nothing at all in the record to indicate what evidence or defenses the defendant is capable of producing on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[t]he strategic considerations which lead an accused to plead guilty pursuant to a plea bargain will frequently hinge not only on the quantum and quality of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, but also on the probable effectiveness of the defenses and evidence which the defendant has to counterbalance the incriminating evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, although, \u201c[a]fter the exclusion of certain items of evidence, the prosecution\u2019s case may continue to appear invulnerable to an appellate court,\u201d the defendant \u201cmay have or believe he has means of impeaching, discrediting or casting doubt on such evidence, and the items excluded on appeal might be the very ones which posed the most difficult strategic problems for the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c[o]nly the accused and his counsel are aware of what favorable evidence is available to them,\u201d the <em>Hill </em>court reasoned that it could not, \u201cwith any assurance, conclude that an appellate court, which does not have the benefit of that knowledge, can consistently arrive at an accurate assessment of whether the defendant would again plead guilty after knowledge that some but not all of the challenged evidence is to be suppressed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>Id. </em>\u201cTo the contrary, an unacceptable degree of appellate speculation would necessarily inject itself into the application of the harmless error concept in such a context.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">For these reasons, the <em>Hill </em>court concluded that, \u201c[i]n view of the magnitude of the consequences of a guilty plea and the lack of an adequate basis upon which an appellate court can evaluate the impact of a trial court\u2019s error, ... the doctrine of harmless error is inapplicable in the context of an appeal under [California\u2019s conditional guilty plea statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Thus, \u201c[t]he accused must be afforded an opportunity to personally elect whether, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling, the suppression of certain items of evidence would alter the situation in a sufficiently favorable manner so as to render a plea of not guilty strategically preferable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Virtually without exception,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> every subsequent appellate decision expressly addressing the issue has held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>harmless error doctrine is inapplicable in the context of an appeal from a conditional guilty plea. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Weber, </em>668 F.2d 552 (1st Cir.1981); <em>Jones v. Wisconsin, </em>562 F.2d 440 (7th Cir.1977); <em>Juarez, </em>903 P.2d at 249; <em>Dinsmore, </em>49 P.3d at 838; <em>State v. Monahan, </em>76 Wis.2d 387, 251 N.W.2d 421, 426 (Wis.1977);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>see also </em>Official Comment, Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2) (noting that, in cases involving conditional guilty pleas, \u201cinvocation of the harmless error rule is arguably impossible\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <em>cf. Hooten v. State, </em>212 Ga.App. 770, 442 S.E.2d 836, 839 (1994) (overruling earlier precedent and holding that conditional pleas would no longer be effective in the state of Georgia, reasoning that conditional pleas had, in the past, led to \u201creversals in some cases even though the appellants have failed to show that they were harmed\u201d and even though \u201ca full trial record might show only harmless error,\u201d noting that the harmless error doctrine was inapplicable in those cases because \u201cno trial took place\u201d and \u201cthere is no way to determine whether the error asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>resulted in prejudice to the appellant\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">We agree with the rationale articulated in these cases. Where there has been no trial on the merits, this Court has no way of knowing whether the defendant \u201chas means of impeaching, discrediting, or casting doubt\u201d on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and \u201c[o]nly the accused and his counsel are aware of what favorable evidence is available to them.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d at 29. Any discussion of whether the erroneous denial of a suppression motion was \u201charmless\u201d would, therefore, require \u201can unacceptable degree of appellate speculation.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We further note that Code \u00a7 19.2-254 expressly provides that, if a defendant prevails on appeal, he or she may withdraw the conditional guilty plea. As recently noted by the Oregon Court of Appeals, \u201c[ejmploying a harmless error analysis would defeat that statutory right.\u201d <em>Dinsmore, </em>49 P.3d at 838 (concluding that the defendant \u201cmay, on remand, decide that she wishes to withdraw her plea and go to trial, or she may choose, in light of her limited success on appeal, not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>withdraw it,\u201d but that \u201c[t]he legislature ... has left that choice to defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">For these reasons, we hold that, when an appellant prevails on appeal with respect to <em>any </em>issue he has preserved for appeal under Code \u00a7 19.2-254, that statute implicitly permits the appellant to choose between withdrawing his guilty plea and proceeding to trial, or leaving his guilty plea intact.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We expressly decline to consider whether the Commonwealth\u2019s remaining evidence constitutes such overwhelming evidence of guilt as to render the trial court\u2019s erroneous denial of Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress \u201charmless.\u201d Accordingly, we remand this case to the trial court to permit Glenn, if he so chooses, to withdraw his conditional guilty plea and proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Although the grandfather\u2019s consent vested the law enforcement officers with the authority to conduct a general search of the premises, we hold that an objective police officer could not have reasonably believed that the grandfather also possessed the authority to consent to a search of Glenn\u2019s backpack. Thus, we hold the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress. Moreover, because Glenn has prevailed on the merits of one of the issues forming the basis for his conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>guilty plea, we reverse Glenn\u2019s convictions and remand this case to the trial court to provide him with the opportunity, if he so chooses, to withdraw his conditional plea and proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\">. As a result of \"several strokes,\u201d Glenn\u2019s grandfather cannot speak.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">. Although not discussed by the officer who performed the search, Glenn\u2019s grandmother testified that she had left one box of clothes in Glenn\u2019s bedroom. Other than the box, \"[e]verything in [the room] was [Glenn\u2019s].\u201d It is not clear from the record where that box of clothes was located, or whether the officer noticed the box before he opened the backpack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">.

The decision in <em>Randolph </em>was handed down following oral arguments in this case. Accordingly, this Court asked the parties to submit additional briefs addressing the possible impact of the <em>Randolph </em>decision on the resolution of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b619-6\">. Some courts have held that the relationship between the consenting party and the owner of the item searched should be a factor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>determining whether the third-party consent is valid. <em>See, e.g., Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>43 S.W.3d 777 (Ky.2001); <em>see also People v. Lucero, </em>720 P.2d 604 (Colo.Ct.App.1985) (no evidence that mother relinquished control of room, despite having her own reasons for never entering it); <em>People v. Brooks, </em>277 Ill.App.3d 392, 214 Ill.Dec. 79, 660 N.E.2d 270 (1996) (no evidence that room was locked or that son had left instructions not to enter it); <em>People v. Goforth, 222 </em>Mich.App. 306, 564 N.W.2d 526 (1997) (although son was 18 years old and paid rent, nothing indicated that mother lacked access to the room); <em>State v. Cole, 706 </em>S.W.2d 917 (Mo.Ct.App.1986) (a person living with his family can expect more intrusion than an independent renter living with non-relatives). However, these courts have found that the consent is valid because of the consenting party\u2019s \"superior right in the home,\" <em>Colbert </em>43 S.W.3d at 777, and that the consent is sufficient even when the defendant is present, <em>id..; see also Gray v.

In that case, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment because, although the district court erred in its interpretation of the federal statute, the defendant failed, as a matter of law, to meet the statutory requirements for a collateral attack on his conviction.

We note that, because Glenn has succeeded in excluding the physical evidence that linked him to the alleged crime, the only remaining evidence on the record is his extrajudicial confession.

This proposition strikes me as an unwarranted departure from existing Fourth Amendment doctrine, which historically has examined the permissible scope of a search solely in terms of reasonable reliance on actual or apparent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Applying the traditional standard, I agree with the trial court that the officers in this case did not act unreasonably by relying on the unqualified consent of the homeowner, Glenn\u2019s grandfather, to search his home and everything in it that one would ordinarily expect to be within the scope of that consent\u2014like an unidentified, unlocked, unclaimed backpack lying on the floor of a room within the home. This is particularly true here because Glenn never once objected to the search of the room or the backpack. Nor did he express or imply anything suggesting an exclusive privacy interest in either.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">I also read the majority opinion to hold that the conditional guilty plea statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-254, has effectively repealed by implication the harmless error statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-678, for all appeals following a conditional guilty plea. No Virginia case can be cited for this proposition. Nor does anything in the text of the conditional plea statute or in the contextual logic underlying the statute compel such a conclusion.

Glenn answered the door and was immediately arrested. The officers asked Glenn\u2019s grandfather for permission to search his home. Unable to speak because of a medical condition, the grandfather nodded his head in agreement. The officers then asked the grandfather if Glenn paid rent. The grandfather shook his head no. When asked if Glenn was in fact his grandson, the grandfather nodded yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The officers went to Glenn\u2019s bedroom, identified by Glenn as the \u201croom he slept in.\u201d The officers found, among other things, boxes containing his grandmother\u2019s clothing in Glenn\u2019s bedroom. The officers then went to a second room, identified by Glenn as a room that he also slept in on occasion. There, the officers discovered a backpack on the floor. Nothing suggested to the officers the backpack was locked, used for any particular purpose, or owned by any particular person. During this time, Glenn stood nearby and voiced no objections or concerns about the search. The officers opened the backpack and found evidence implicating Glenn in the suspected robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">While in police custody, Glenn confessed to the robbery. He had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings on three occasions prior to the confession. He did not request legal counsel or insist upon his right to remain silent. Instead, while at the police station, Glenn wrote out a full confession by hand in which he admitted that he and an accomplice robbed the victim at gunpoint. Glenn also gave a verbal confession in which he alerted the officers to where the weapon used in the robbery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>could be found. Officers later found the weapon exactly where Glenn said it would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Prior to trial, Glenn filed two motions to suppress. The first sought to exclude from evidence the incriminating item (the victim\u2019s stolen cell phone) found in the backpack, asserting that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The second challenged the admissibility of his confession on Fifth Amendment grounds. Glenn did not, however, argue that the search of his backpack somehow tainted his confession. Nor does he make this claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">At the suppression hearing, Glenn\u2019s grandmother took the stand on his behalf and testified that the backpack was his. The grandmother, however, conceded that Glenn did not pay rent. Nor did he have exclusive access to, or control over, any room in the house. She agreed to the characterization of the first room searched as \u201cKeith\u2019s room\u201d and \u201chis bedroom.\u201d The woman\u2019s clothes in Glenn\u2019s bedroom were hers, she admitted. There were no locks on the doors of either room.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The trial court denied Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress, reasoning that the grandfather\u2019s consent to search was given \u201cwithout reservation or qualification.\u201d The scope of this consent, the trial court held, provided the officers with apparent authority to open the backpack. The officers had no reason to question this authority, the court pointed out, because they knew Glenn\u2019s grandfather owned the home, Glenn did not pay rent to stay there, a \u201cmixture of personal property\u201d was found in Glenn\u2019s principal bedroom, and nothing suggested Glenn had an exclusive privacy interest in the backpack. To be sure, the trial court found, Glenn \u201cwas present at the search, observed the search and took no action to countermand his grandfather\u2019s permission by advising the police that he objected to the search of that portion of the residence he later claimed he occupied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">At trial, Glenn entered a conditional guilty plea preserving his opportunity to appeal his convictions. After finding the plea to be voluntary, the trial court received a factual proffer from the Commonwealth. The prosecutor reported that Glenn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>and an accomplice robbed the victim at gunpoint, taking from him a cell phone and cash. Glenn confessed to the robbery and advised the police where to find the weapon. The trial court asked Glenn if he would \u201caccept the proffered testimony.\u201d Glenn\u2019s counsel said they did. His counsel added that the police found the weapon based upon Glenn\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The trial court ended the colloquy this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">Court: Mr. Purnell, do you stipulate that the evidence, if proven, would be sufficient to find the defendant guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">Glenn\u2019s Counsel: I do, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Court: Does the defense wish to offer any evidence other than the proffer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">Glenn\u2019s Counsel: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">Court: Would you please stand, Mr. Glenn? Based on the evidence that the Court has heard, the Court will find you guilty as charged....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Based upon the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered evidence (stipulated by Glenn as sufficient) and Glenn\u2019s guilty plea (previously found to be voluntary), the trial court convicted Glenn of robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, and conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">Glenn then filed a petition for appeal asserting that his convictions should be overturned because the trial court erroneously denied his two motions to suppress. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-407(D), a three-judge panel of our Court rejected Glenn\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of his confession. The Court held that, under the circumstances of this case, Glenn \u201cfailed to make a clear and unambiguous assertion of his right to remain silent.\u201d The Court, however, granted further review of Glenn\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of the evidence found during the backpack search.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">This appeal comes to us in an unusual posture. The Court has already ruled that the trial court properly denied Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress his confession. It necessarily follows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>the trial court correctly accepted th\u00e9 evidence of Glenn\u2019s confession (coupled with the corroborating evidence that it led police to the weapon used in the robbery) in support of the court\u2019s finding of guilt. For appellate purposes, two questions remain to be answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">A. Did the trial court err in denying the motion to suppress the incriminating evidence found during the backpack search?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">B. If so, was any such error harmless given our holding that the trial court correctly denied Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress his confession making it fully admissible, along with the stipulated proffer, in support of Glenn\u2019s guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The majority concludes the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule forbids the trial court from considering the backpack evidence and, as a matter of law, the doctrine of harmless error has been superseded by the conditional guilty plea statute. I disagree with both conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">A. <em>The Motion to Suppress\u2014Scope of Consent to Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">Though the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>scrutiny, \u201cwe defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u201chistorical fact\u2019 and give \u2018due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 105, 582 S.E.2d 448, 449-50 (2003) (citations omitted). To prevail on appeal, \u201cthe defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Whitfield v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 358, 361, 576 S.E.2d 463, 464 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">In this ease, Glenn argues that his grandfather\u2019s consent to search the home did not extend to opening the backpack and examining its contents. The trial court disagreed, as do I.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>As a general rule, \u201ca search authorized by consent is wholly valid.\u201d <em>Kyer, </em>45 Va.App. at 483, 612 S.E.2d at 218 (quoting <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 222, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973)). \u201cPolice officers act in full accord with the law when they ask citizens for consent. It reinforces the rule of law for the citizen to advise the police of his or her wishes and for the police to act in reliance on that understanding.\u201d <em>Barkley v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 682, 696, 576 S.E.2d 234, 241 (2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>536 U.S. 194, 207, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002)).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Consent to search can be given by one with actual authority or apparent authority. Actual authority exists if the consenting party has a privacy interest in the premises to be searched, and thus, a concomitant right to waive that interest and authorize the search. <em>See United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 170-71, 94 S.Ct. 988, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974), Apparent authority exists if it merely <em>appears </em>to a reasonable officer that the consenting party has \u201cauthority over the premises.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. 177, 188, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148 (1990). When multiple parties share privacy interests in the premises, any one of them with \u201ccommon authority over the premises\u201d may consent to the search despite the lack of express concurrence by others possessing a shared privacy interest. <em>Id. </em>at 181, 110 S.Ct. at 2798.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Here, the trial court found that the grandfather owned the home and consented to its search. The police knew Glenn was staying in his grandfather\u2019s home and confirmed that Glenn did not have the status of a renter. From these facts, the police had ample reason to accept the grandfather\u2019s consent to search the home and every room in it. No circumstances suggested to the police that Glenn had preserved a private enclave within the home or had somehow undermined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>grandfather\u2019s authority over all areas of his own home. The police, therefore, crossed no Fourth Amendment boundary by searching either of the two bedrooms in which Glenn slept.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">But that boundary was crossed, Glenn argues, when the police opened the backpack and looked inside. Consent should have been specifically requested for searching the backpack, Glenn reasons. Absent such specificity, the majority opinion agrees, the officers have a duty of \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d whenever there is any \u201cambiguous situation\u201d concerning the scope of the consent as it applies to \u201cclosed containers.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>48 Va.App. at 574-576, 633 S.E.2d at 214-216. I believe this new duty of \u201cfurther inquiry\u201d to be inconsistent with settled Fourth Amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Consent to search a space includes consent to search containers within that space where a reasonable officer could construe the consent to extend to the container. <em>See Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 251, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 1804, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991). This principle applies to automobiles, <em>Wyoming v. Houghton, </em>526 U.S. 295, 302, 119 S.Ct. 1297, 1302, 143 L.Ed.2d 408 (1999), as well as physical premises, <em>United States v. Melgar, </em>227 F.3d 1038, 1041-42 (7th Cir.2000). \u201cThe rule regarding containers found in automobiles applies also to containers found in premises.\u201d 27 J. Moore <em>et al., Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00a7 641.44, at 641-151 (3d ed.2006). \u201cA grant of consent to search premises includes consent to search closed containers found within the premises <em>unless </em>the officers have reliable information that the container is not under the control of the person granting consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">This conclusion stems from the observation that a \u201clawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of entry or opening may be required to complete the search.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>456 U.S. 798, 820-21, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 2170-71, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982). The consent to search a home may reasonably include the \u201cauthority to open closets, chests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>drawers, and containers\u201d in which the object of the search may be found. <em>Id. </em>at 821, 102 S.Ct. at 2171. \u201cWhen a legitimate search is under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This reasoning \u201capplies equally to all containers, as indeed we believe it must.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 102 S.Ct. at 2171.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Glenn\u2019s duty-of-inquiry argument, particularly the version of it accepted by the majority, inverts the reasonableness test of the Fourth Amendment. The constitutional standard forbidding unreasonable searches has been retooled, in effect, to demand the most reasonable searches. Under the conventional view, the \u201cambiguous situation\u201d described by the majority, <em>ante, </em>48 Va.App. at 574-575, 633 S.E.2d at 214, is simply a fact pattern where reasonable officers could differ as to the scope of apparent authority. They may get it wrong, <em>Rodriguez, </em>497 U.S. at 186, 110 S.Ct. at 2800, but they nonetheless should be given the benefit of the doubt where reasonable people could construe the circumstances differently. As the Seventh Circuit has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">the real question for closed container searches is which way the risk of uncertainty should run. Is such a search permissible only if the police have positive knowledge that the closed container is also under the authority of the person who originally consented to the search ... or is it permissible if the police do not have reliable information that the container is <em>not </em>under the authorizer\u2019s control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Melgar, </em>227 F.3d at 1041 (emphasis in original). Rejecting the duty-to-inquire argument, the Seventh Circuit noted the impracticability of such a doctrine and its express rejection by the United States Supreme Court in other contexts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">A contrary rule [recognizing a duty of further inquiry] would impose an impossible burden on the police. It would mean that they could never search closed containers within a dwelling (including hotel rooms) without asking the person whose consent is being given <em>ex ante </em>about every item they might encounter. We note that there is no possibility of such a rule for automobile searches, because the Supreme Court has already authorized this type of container search in that context. <em>See Ross, supra; Houghton, supra. </em>Our conclusion here rests in part on the discussion in <em>Houghton </em>that indicates that the container rule rests on general principles of Fourth Amendment law that do not depend on the special attributes of automobile searches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1042. The proper standard, therefore, does not forbid the container search whenever it involves an \u201cambiguous situation,\u201d <em>ante, </em>48 Va.App. at 574-575, 633 S.E.2d at 214. The Fourth Amendment prohibition applies only when no reasonable officer could interpret the scope of consent\u2014when given by one with apparent authority over the premises\u2014to include containers found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Stated another way, a general consent to search \u201cincludes consent to search closed containers found within the premises <em>unless </em>the officers have reliable information that the container is not under the control of the person granting consent.\u201d 27 <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, supra, </em>\u00a7 641.44, at 641-151 (emphasis added); <em>see United States v. Ladell, </em>127 F.3d 622, 624 (7th Cir.1997) (holding that a mother had \u201capparent authority to consent\u201d to a search of her adult son\u2019s bedroom, including a closed vinyl bag found in the bedroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Reinforcing these traditional principles, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 1520, 164 L.Ed.2d 208 (2006), recently addressed the underpinnings of the apparent authority doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>as applied to the \u201cco-occupant consent\u201d situation. The Court pointed out that police must be permitted to rely on \u201cwidely shared social expectations\u201d when discerning the apparent authority of one co-inhabitant to consent to a search of an area in which another co-inhabitant has a dual privacy interest. <em>Id. </em>at 1521.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\u201cDisputed permission,\u201d however, undermines that reliance because no reasonable officer could rely on one co-inhabitant\u2019s apparent authority to speak for another when the person spoken for is, at that very moment, \u201cexpressly refusing consent\u201d to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 1524, 1526. But if he <em>does not object, </em>the co-inhabitant\u2019s apparent authority remains secure. As the majority in <em>Randolph </em>conceded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">we have to admit that we are drawing a fine line; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant\u2019s permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy, loses out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1527. This approach places the burden on the objector to assert his objection. As <em>Randolph </em>explains, for the very reason that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\"><em>it would be unjustifiably impractical to require the police to take affirmative steps to confirm the actual authority of a consenting individual whose authority was apparent, </em>we think it would needlessly limit the capacity of the police to respond to ostensibly legitimate opportunities in the field if we were to hold that reasonableness required the police to take affirmative steps to find a potentially objecting co-tenant before acting on the permission they had already received. There is no ready reason to believe that efforts to invite a refusal would make a difference in many cases, whereas every co-tenant consent case would turn into a test about the adequacy of the police\u2019s efforts to consult with a potential objector.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1527-28 (emphasis added). The reasoning of <em>Randolph, </em>therefore, eschews the duty-to-inquire thesis advocated by Glenn and adopted by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Applying these principles here, I believe the trial court correctly held that the factual circumstances gave the officers no reason to believe that the grandfather\u2019s consent to search his house did not include the backpack laying on the floor in one of the rooms of the house. The grandfather owned the home, after all, and had not encumbered his prerogatives as a homeowner by entering into any sort of contractual relationship with Glenn. His relationship with Glenn was not one of landlord-tenant, but of grandfather-grandson. The backpack was not locked. It was not found in some secretive place hidden from plain view. No information on the backpack revealed to whom it belonged\u2014unless we were to speculate that grandsons, but never grandfathers, use backpacks. The officers did not find the backpack in Glenn\u2019s principal bedroom. Finally, as the trial court held, though Glenn was \u201cpresent at the search\u201d and \u201cobserved the search,\u201d he \u201ctook no action to countermand his grandfather\u2019s permission\u201d and never once advised the police that he objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Given these circumstances, I fully agree with the trial court that the grandfather\u2019s consent to search the house was \u201cwithout reservation or qualification\u201d and included a search of the backpack. Nothing in this fact pattern put the officers on notice that the grandfather had been excluded from using the backpack or that Glenn asserted any exclusive privacy interest in it. A reasonable officer, therefore, could construe the scope of the grandfather\u2019s consent to the search of his home to permit the opening of an unidentified, unlocked, unclaimed backpack lying on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">B. <em>Harmless Error &amp; Conditional Guilty Pleas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">After concluding that the officers violated the Fourth Amendment by looking inside the backpack, the majority then holds that the harmless error statute does not apply to this case as a matter of law. Though disclaimed, <em>ante, </em>48 Va.App. at 587 n. 20, 633 S.E.2d at 221 n. 20, the reasoning appears to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>be that the conditional guilty plea statute, Code \u00a7 19.2-254, creates a process so inherently incompatible with the harmless error statute, Code \u00a7 8.01-678, that the former has implicitly repealed the latter in all appeals involving conditional guilty pleas. No matter how restated, this assertion is wholly unpersuasive to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">To begin with, the harmless error concept is no mere prudential, judge-made doctrine of appellate review. It is a legislative mandate, part of our statutory law since the early 1900s, limiting the <em>ad judicatory </em>power of Virginia appellate courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">Whatever may be the law elsewhere, or whatever it may have been aforetime in this State, since the adoption of the Code of 1919 there has existed in this State a statute which puts a <em>limitation on the powers </em>of this court to reverse the judgment of the trial court\u2014a limitation which we must consider on every application for an appeal and on the hearing of <em>every case </em>submitted to our judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\"><em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>144 Va. 648, 652, 131 S.E. 230, 231 (1926) (emphasis added). The General Assembly \u201cdeliberately engrafted\u201d the harmless error doctrine into the statutory law of the Commonwealth. <em>Irvine v. Carr, </em>163 Va. 662, 669, 177 S.E. 208, 211 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The harmless error limitation on judicial power applies to criminal cases no less than civil cases. <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 259, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2001). And it has never been a begrudged limitation, but rather one \u201cfavored\u201d by Virginia courts, <em>Windsor v. Carlton, </em>136 Va. 652, 655, 118 S.E. 222, 223 (1923), because it so obviously grows out \u201cof the imperative demands of common sense,\u201d <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>151 Va. 533, 541, 145 S.E. 307, 309 (1928), and consequently has been \u201cdeeply embedded in our jurisprudence,\u201d <em>Gilland v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 223, 235, 35 S.E.2d 130, 134 (1945). For these reasons, Code \u00a7 8.01-678 makes \u201charmless-error review required in <em>all </em>cases.\u201d <em>Ferguson v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. ix, ix, 396 S.E.2d 675, 675 (1990) (emphasis in original and text in parenthetical).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Glenn essentially argues that, as a matter of law, the harmless error statute has been partially displaced by the conditional guilty plea statute. Virginia, however, follows a long tradition of disfavoring judicial interpretations that in effect hold that one statute has \u201cpartially repealed by implication\u201d another. <em>Sexton v. Cornett, </em>271 Va. 251, 256-57, 623 S.E.2d 898, 901 (2006). This tradition requires us to employ \u201ca presumption against a legislative intent to repeal where the later statute does not amend the former or refer expressly to it.\u201d <em>Id.;see also Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp., </em>456 U.S. 461, 468, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 1890, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982) (recognizing the presumption against the \u201cimplied partial repeal\u201d of an earlier statute by a later one).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Nothing in the text of the conditional guilty plea statute suggests that it has partially repealed the harmless error statute. The conditional guilty plea statute merely preserves a right to appeal a criminal conviction on grounds (like a pretrial order denying a suppression motion) that would have otherwise been waived by an unconditional guilty plea. What is on appeal, however, is not the interlocutory order denying the suppression motion\u2014it is the conviction itself. As the statute makes plain, the appeal is \u201cfrom the judgment\u201d entered against the defendant. Code \u00a7 19.2-254.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">Understood this way, conditional guilty pleas \u201care like all others, except that the accused reserves a right to contest on appeal a pretrial issue on which he lost.\u201d John L. Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 46.2-2, at 617 (3d ed.2002). But, here again, the right preserved is <em>the right to appeal. </em>That right necessarily must be exercised with the expectation that all principles ordinarily applicable to appeals, like the venerable doctrine of harmless error, would likewise apply\u2014particularly where, as in Virginia, the legislative enactment of the doctrine acts as an express limitation on the appellate court\u2019s powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The implied repeal, Glenn responds, can be inferred from the conditional guilty plea statute for it specifically allows an appellant to withdraw a guilty plea if he \u201cprevails\u201d on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-254. To me, this argument is at once circular and counterintuitive. No criminal defense attorney would tell a client that he <em>prevailed </em>on appeal after receiving an appellate opinion finding the alleged error to be harmless and thus the conviction valid. A criminal defendant prevails on appeal by winning an acquittal or by reducing his punishment. From any practical point of view, appellate success hardly can be claimed when a criminal defendant merely secures from the appellate judges their intellectual acquiescence to the merits of his argument followed immediately by their declaration that, in any event, it does not change the result. <em>Cf. Polston v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 500, 504, 498 S.E.2d 924, 926 (1998) (ruling a conditional guilty plea would be affirmed \u201cregardless of the actual validity of the search warrant\u201d because the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule would apply). To prevail on appeal means to demonstrate reversible, not irreversible, error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">At any rate, Glenn concludes, harmless error cannot be applied in this case because there has been no trial and thus no way of knowing if the confession could be corroborated by other evidence. Not so. There was a trial. Under Virginia constitutional law, after receiving a guilty plea, \u201cthe court shall <em>try </em>the case.\u201d Va. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-257 (providing that, following a guilty plea, \u201cthe court shall hear and determine the case\u201d). And that is just what happened in this case. At trial, the Commonwealth proffered evidence that Glenn\u2019s confession advised police where to find the weapon used in the robbery. Glenn\u2019s counsel advised the trial court that Glenn \u201caccept[ed] the proffered testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Glenn\u2019s counsel immediately added that, in fact, the police found the weapon used in the robbery based upon Glenn\u2019s confession. The trial court asked Glenn\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>counsel if he wanted to \u201coffer any evidence\u201d in addition to the agreed proffer. He declined to offer any.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Glenn does not argue (and I would not accept it if he did) that, if applicable, the harmless error doctrine cannot be satisfied. The proper admission of a corroborated confession renders harmless the improper admission of mere cumulative evidence. <em>See, e.g., Luginbyhl v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 58, 66, 628 S.E.2d 74, 78-79 (2006) <em>(en </em>banc) (finding defendant\u2019s \u201ccorroborated\u201d confession rendered \u201charmless\u201d any \u201cconstitutional error\u201d in admitting cumulative incriminating evidence); <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>419 F.3d 34, 41-42 (1st Cir.2005) (finding that the cumulative evidence \u201cpales in light\u201d of the defendant\u2019s voluntary and corroborated confession); <em>Hocker v. State, </em>840 So.2d 197, 215 (Ala.Crim.App.2002) (holding that any error in admitting evidence of a \u201ccollateral bad act\u201d was harmless in light of defendant\u2019s corroborated confession). To be sure, a \u201cconfession is like no other evidence\u201d and is \u201cprobably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 296, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1257, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991). By rejecting Glenn\u2019s only challenge to the admission of his corroborated confession, we rendered harmless any error by the trial court in admitting the mere cumulative evidence (the victim\u2019s cell-phone) found in the backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Finally, I offer only a brief rejoinder to the many citations relied on by the majority as justification for abandoning harmless error in this case. As I read them, most of these authorities merely point out the obvious: that, absent a sufficient factual record, the harmless error analysis cannot be competently performed by an appellate court.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> I certainly agree. The difference here, though, is that we have a sufficient factual record. Other authorities relied upon by the majority have serious precedential limitations,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> while still others I think have been either misunderstood<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> or understat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ed.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But, most important, not one of these citations addresses the unique procedures governing the trials of guilty pleas in Virginia\u2019s circuit courts or the General Assembly\u2019s codification of the harmless error doctrine as a limitation on appellate court power.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In sum, the trial court did not misapply Fourth Amendment principles when it denied Glenn\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found in the search of the backpack. The majority\u2019s invocation of a duty to inquire for container searches rests on an unwarranted extension of existing search-and-seizure precedent. The majority also errs in not conducting a harmless error analysis given our prior ruling rejecting Glenn\u2019s only legal challenge to the use of his confession in support of the finding of guilt. For these reasons, I would affirm Glenn\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\"><em>. </em>Glenn's counsel also claimed the weapon was a \"BB gun,\u201d but the Commonwealth replied that \"it sure doesn\u2019t look like one.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">.

The majority comes to the opposite conclusion, in part, based on the belief, <em>see ante, </em>48 Va.App. at 569, 633 S.E.2d at 212, that \"Clearly, 'an individual has a heightened expectation of privacy in the contents of a closed container.\u2019 \" This proposition, however, was clear only to the two-Justice dissent in <em>Jimeno </em>(from which the quoted language comes), not from the <em>Jimeno </em>majority's reasoning or holding. <em>Florida v.

That said, the validity of a guilty plea does not require a proffer of evidence by the prosecution. \"In accepting a plea of guilty, any Virginia trial judge is, of course, free to hear the evidence he deems necessary,\u201d but that does not mean \"evidence must be heard upon a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Kibert v.

Nothing in Virginia law \"requires the introduction of evidence to sustain a conviction based upon a plea of guilty in a criminal case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665, 222 S.E.2d at 793; <em>see generally Haring v.

So, in cases where, unlike here, there is no proffer at trial of the dispositively incriminating evidence, it may indeed be impractical to conduct a harmless error analysis. From this sensible observation, however, Glenn insensibly reasons that harmless error is thus inapplicable as a matter of law to <em>all </em>appeals from <em>all </em>conditional guilty pleas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b651-5\">. The majority cites <em>People v.

I agree <em>Grant </em>did just that. But the more important point is why. The court explained that the doctrine is \"difficult to apply to guilty pleas\u201d because absent \u201ca trial there will be little if any evidence in the record, apart from the proof which should have been excluded,\u201d thus leaving the appellate court \"rarely\u201d able to competently conduct a harmless error analysis. <em>Id. </em>at 264-65.

Here, too, the holding presupposes an appellate record (unlike ours) which lacks a sufficient factual basis to conduct the harmless error inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b651-7\">. The majority cites <em>State v. Monahan, </em>76 Wis.2d 387, 251 N.W.2d 421, 426 (Wis.1977), for the proposition that the \u201charmless error doctrine is inapplicable in the context of an appeal from a conditional guilty plea.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>48 Va.App. at 585, 633 S.E.2d at 219. The same court later said that it did not \"read <em>Monahan </em>to preclude, in any way, the use of a harmless error approach\u201d in appeals of conditional guilty pleas. <em>State v. Armstrong, </em>225 Wis.2d 121, 591 N.W.2d 604, 604 (Wis.1999) <em>(per </em>curiam). The defendant in <em>Armstrong </em>entered his guilty plea pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 971.31(10)\u2014which, like Virginia\u2019s conditional plea statute, permits an appeal of an \"order denying a motion to suppress evidence\u201d despite \"the fact that such judgment was entered upon a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>Id. Cf.

In any event, this principle\u2014followed by the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits\u2014merely places the onus on the trial court to refuse its consent to conditional guilty pleas that would produce appeals destined to fall apart on appeal because of the continuing applicability of the harmless error doctrine. As Judge Newman\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Lace </em>cautioned, a guilty plea \"with a reservation of appellate rights should not be a device to circumvent the harmless error rule.\u201d <em>Lace, </em>669 F.2d at 57 n. 7.
