They also object to the commission\u2019s denial of their request for an award of postjudgment interest on a prior award of fees in the same case. Agreeing with both assertions, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">On behalf of their daughter Jordyn, Gary and Angela Spicer filed a petition with the commission seeking benefits under the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act. In considerable detail, the petition described Jordyn\u2019s medical condition, provided expert statements asserting Jordyn sustained an injury covered by the Act, and attached voluminous medical records in support of the claim. The Spicers also served interrogatories and requests for production seeking to determine whether and on what basis the Birth-Related Neurologi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>cal Injury Compensation Program (\u201cthe Program\u201d) denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">In response, the Program denied every allegation, claiming a lack of sufficient information to address the merits of the petition. The Program refused to respond to the Spicers\u2019 discovery requests, providing instead a verbatim series of boilerplate objections. At the Spicers\u2019 request, the deputy commissioner overruled the Program\u2019s objections and ordered responses. The Program moved to reconsider, which the deputy commissioner summarily denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Shortly thereafter, the Program produced a report from its own expert witness concluding that Jordyn\u2019s injury fell within the statutory definition of a birth-related neurological injury. A week later, the medical advisory panel filed its report under Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(C) likewise finding Jordyn qualified for benefits under the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act. The Program then conceded liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Based on that concession, a deputy commissioner ordered the Program in March 2004 to provide all required statutory benefits. A day after this order, the Spicers filed a petition requesting $37,806 in attorney fees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and $5,174 in expenses. Though the Program ultimately conceded liability, the Spicers argued, they had to incur a considerable amount of legal and expert expenses to obtain this concession. In reply, the Program agreed the Spicers should recover such expenses, but asserted the total recovery should be no more than $18,013.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The Spicers served discovery requests seeking to establish the reasonableness of their fee petition by comparing it to other cases and to analogous costs incurred by the Program when retaining outside counsel. Both sides filed briefs addressing in detail various aspects of the petition. The deputy commissioner held the Spicers should be awarded fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>expenses, in June 2004, and issued an award of $34,124 for both. On review, the full commission affirmed. The Program paid the award in January 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In February 2005, the Spicers filed a supplemental petition seeking $18,269 for fees and expenses incurred during the litigation over their original petition for fees and expenses. The parties again submitted additional briefing on this issue. The deputy commissioner denied outright the supplemental petition, finding that counsel spent an \u201cexcessive amount of time collecting information about attorney\u2019s fees and that the Program should not be responsible for compensating this attorney for her research efforts in regard to attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Analogizing the situation to another case in which a \u201csimple proceeding had been \u2018over-lawyered, over-tried, and over-prepared,\u2019 \u201d <em>Davison v. FastComm Communs Corp., </em>42 Va. Cir. 76, 77 (Va. Cir. Ct. 1997), the deputy commissioner found the supplemental petition unreasonable and thus noncompensable under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">At the same time, the Spicers requested an award of postjudgment interest for the period between the June 2004 award of fees by the deputy commissioner and the Program\u2019s ultimate payment, after the full commission\u2019s review and affirmance, in January 2005. The deputy commissioner denied this request as a matter of law, holding that the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act did not authorize an award of postjudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">On review, the full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s denial of the supplemental petition. Rather than examining the reasonableness of the fees requested, however, the commission held that as a matter of law the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act \u201cdoes not provide for attorney\u2019s fee shifting in the context of fee requests for time spent on previous attorney\u2019s fee disputes.\u201d Adopting the deputy\u2019s reasoning, the commission held the Act disallowed postjudgment interest as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">On appeal, the Spicers argue that the commission mistakenly construed the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act to preclude an award of (a) attorney fees incurred during litigation over the reasonableness of a fee request, and (b) postjudgment interest on a fee award. Both assertions implicate issues of statutory construction, pure questions of law which we review <em>de novo. See Meador v. Va. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Program, </em>44 Va.App. 149, 152, 604 S.E.2d 88, 90 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">A. <em>Attorney Fees Incurred During Fee Disputes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Upon determining that the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act applies to an infant\u2019s claim, the commission \u201cshall make an award providing compensation\u201d for certain \u201citems relative to such injury. . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A). Item 3 of \u00a7 38.2-5009(A) authorizes an award of \u201c[rjeasonable expenses incurred in connection with the filing of a claim under this'chapter, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, which shall be subject to the approval and award of the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The Program concedes that this provision authorizes attorney fees incurred in litigating an infant\u2019s eligibility to participate in the statutory scheme and in later seeking specific benefits compensable under the Act. But it goes no further, the Program reasons, because attorney fees incurred during litigation over a disputed fee request cannot by definition be \u201cincurred in connection with\u201d a claim within the meaning of Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(3). From this perspective, a fee petition is not itself a claim or even part of a claim\u2014so, <em>a fortiori, </em>a petition for fees incurred in litigating a fee petition cannot be \u201cin connection -with\u201d a claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">The problem with the Program\u2019s reasoning is its first premise. The Act does not define \u201cclaim\u201d as such, but several statutory provisions reveal what is meant by the word. A \u201cclaimant\u201d is someone who files a claim under Code \u00a7 38.2-5004 for \u201ccompensation\u201d under the Act.Code \u00a7 38.2-5001. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Under Code \u00a7 38.2-5004(A)(1)(h), all \u201cclaims\u201d must provide information necessary for the commission to determine the \u201camount of compensation to be paid to, or on behalf of, the injured infant\u201d on account of the covered injury. Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(4) then directs the commission to determine the amount of any \u201ccompensation\u201d awardable under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009. And Code \u00a7 38.2-5009 specifically mentions attorney fees as an allowable item of \u201ccompensation.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A) &amp; (A)(3). <em>Cf. Roman v. Ondeo Degremont, Inc., </em>47 Va.App. 773, 781, 627 S.E.2d 539, 543-44 (2006) (holding that, under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, where attorney fees are \u201cto be paid out of a claimant\u2019s accrued compensation, the fee remains compensation within the meaning of the penalty statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Thus, the original fee petition filed by the Spicers was every bit as much a compensable aspect of their \u201cclaim\u201d under the Act as their request for the payment of medical bills. It necessarily follows that their supplemental petition included fees \u201cincurred in connection with\u201d a claim under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(3). We fail to see how this conclusion somehow falls short, as the Program insists, of giving the statute its natural and intended meaning. In analogous circumstances, scores of courts have \u201cconsistently held that attorneys may be awarded, under statutory fee authorizations, compensation for the expenses of and time spent litigating the issue of a reasonable fee.\u201d <em>Hollen v. Hathaway Elec., Inc., </em>213 W.Va. 667, 584 S.E.2d 523, 528 (2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nothing in the text of Code \u00a7 38.2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>5009(A)(3) reveals a legislative intent to depart from this conventional understanding of statutory fee awards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">That does not necessarily mean, however, the Spicers should have been awarded all or even part of the fees sought in the supplemental petition. The deputy commissioner disallowed the entire supplemental petition as unreasonably \u201cexcessive\u201d under the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Spicers\u2019 original fee petition sought $42,980 in fees and expenses. The Program conceded $18,013, making the amount in controversy only $24,967. The litigation over this disputed amount yielded the Spicers only $16,111, yet produced a supplemental petition seeking fees on fees in the amount of $18,269. Thus, for every dollar awarded in <em>disputed </em>fees incurred while litigating the merits of the case, the Spicers spent more than a dollar in fees on fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The proportionality of the supplemental fee request gets no better when we look only at billable hours. Claimants\u2019 counsel logged 139 hours litigating the merits and 68 hours defending the fee petition. So, for every hour of work on the merits, counsel spent about a half hour seeking fees for that hour. \u201cThis is the tail wagging the dog, with a vengeance.\u201d <em>Ustrak v. Fairman, </em>851 F.2d 983, 987-88 (7th Cir.1988) (complaining about a 4 to 1 merits/fees ratio). Such an inefficiency has a direct bearing on the reasonableness of the supplemental petition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>It is for exactly this reason we do not share the Program\u2019s fear that, logically applied, our holding would produce an endless cycle of requests for fees-on-fees-on-fees <em>ad infinitum. </em>The statute authorizes only <em>reasonable </em>fees. When the issue in dispute is reasonableness of fees, all the more litigation over that issue must itself be reasonable\u2014a difficult conclusion to reach when the cost of the contest exceeds the amount contested or, for that matter, when the fees-on-fees bear a disproportionate ratio to the work on the merits of the case. Because successive attorney fee requests incrementally exacerbate the likelihood that each will be declared unreasonable on its face, the statute has a built-in deterrent against <em>seriatim </em>fee requests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In this case, however, the parties agree that the full commission never ruled on the reasonableness of the supplemental petition. Nor will we now. Instead, we remand this case to the commission to determine whether the supplemental petition, in whole or in part, constitutes a reasonable request under the specific circumstances of this case. We commit this decision to the \u201csound discretion of the commission.\u201d <em>Mister Kleen Maint. Co. v. Clark, </em>17 Va.App. 474, 477, 438 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1993), <em>affd, </em>18 Va.App. 812, 447 S.E.2d 541 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc). To be sure, if ever there was a case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMH\">for reviewing the determinations of a trial court under a highly deferential version of the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard, it is in the matter of determining the reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>of the time spent by a lawyer on a particular task in a litigation in that court. Not only is the trial court in a much better position than the appellate court to make this determination, but neither the stakes nor the interest in uniform determination are so great as to justify microscopic appellate scrutiny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><em>Ustrak, </em>851 F.2d at 987 (Posner, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">B. <em>Postjudgment Interest On Original Fee Award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The Spicers also argue that the commission erroneously deprived them of postjudgment interest on their original fee petition award entered in June 2004 and paid in January 2005 after the full commission completed its review. Because the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act does not expressly provide for postjudgment interest on awards, the commission concluded the legislature necessarily intended that postjudgment interest could never be awarded as a matter of law. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Code \u00a7 38.2-5003 directs the commission to \u201cexercise the power and authority granted to it in Chapter 2 of Title 65.2 as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-201(A) authorizes the commission to administer Title 65.2 and to \u201cadjudicate issues and controversies relating thereto.\u201d One such issue and controversy is interest on an appealed award governed by Code \u00a7 65.2-707, which provides that an award</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">entered by the Commission shall take effect on the date of entry. To the extent that any payment due under an award is delayed beyond its due date by reason of an appeal to the full Commission or an appellate court, payments so delayed shall bear interest at the judgment rate as provided in \u00a7 6.1-330.54.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">This statute tracks the traditional Virginia view treating post-judgment interest as a \u201cmandatory\u201d award, <em>Dairyland Ins. Co. v. Douthat, </em>248 Va. 627, 631, 449 S.E.2d 799, 801 (1994), \u201cfor delay in the payment of money actually due.\u201d <em>Pulliam v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Coastal Emergency Servs., Inc., </em>257 Va. 1, 25, 509 S.E.2d 307, 321 (1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Given the remedial purposes of the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, we hold the powers incorporated by reference in Code \u00a7 38.2-5003 include awards of postjudgment interest. The postjudgment interest procedure generally applicable to commission awards, therefore, governs awards under the Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act. On remand, the commission should compute the appropriate amount of postjudgment interest and enter an award accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Holding that the commission has the discretionary authority to award the disputed attorney fees, as well as the mandatory authority to award postjudgment interest, we reverse the commission\u2019s ruling and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-8\">.
