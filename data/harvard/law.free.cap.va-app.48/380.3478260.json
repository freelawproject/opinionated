Venable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>reasons that his probation violation was predicated solely upon the fact that he was discharged from a court-ordered sex-offender counseling program after he refused to admit that he committed the crime for which he was convicted. Because admitting his guilt would have subjected Venable to potential criminal liability for perjury, he contends that the court could not impose a penalty upon the exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to avoid compelled self-incrimination. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On November 27, 2001, the circuit court, following a bench trial, convicted Venable of taking indecent liberties with a child, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. The trial court sentenced Venable to five years in prison, but suspended all five years of the sentence conditioned, in part, upon Venable\u2019s completion of the Advanced Therapeutics Newport News Sexual Offender Community Protection Program (\u201cthe Program\u201d). The trial court also required Venable to comply with all rules and requirements set by the probation officer. Venable did not object to entry of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Several days after his sentencing, Venable endorsed the Program guidelines, which state that, \u201c[t]o participate in the [Program], the Offender needs to accept responsibility for the sex crime he/she was convicted of committing.\u201d The guidelines also provide that \u201c[a]ny offender who remains in denial after a period of six (6) sessions will be unsuccessfully discharged from the program. They will be discharged for not being amenable to treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Although Venable attended counseling, he refused to admit that he had committed the crime for which he was convicted. Accordingly, Venable was discharged from the Program. Venable\u2019s probation officer then issued a report, requesting a rule to show cause as to why Venable\u2019s suspended sentence should not be revoked. The probation officer reasoned that Venable \u201chas been unsuccessfully discharged from sex offend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>er treatment\u201d and \u201chas remained in total denial regarding his offense and [] continually resisted the therapeutic effort afforded him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In response, Venable stated that he was \u201casserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination re a possible perjury charge in regards to my testimony concerning my conviction.\u201d Venable reasoned that, \u201c[a]s this is court ordered and there has been no immunity from prosecution given for the possible perjury charge, I do and will continue to assert my Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate myself.\u201d Venable further requested a modification to the terms of his probation, removing the requirement that he participate in the Program or \u201cthat he make incriminating admissions therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">On December 10, 2004, the trial court conducted a probation revocation hearing. In response to Venable\u2019s constitutional argument, the trial court reasoned that the Fifth Amendment did not apply because Venable was \u201cnot compelled to do anything. His choice not to admit the offense is merely a tactic[], no different than what it would be prior to trial.\u201d The trial court then heard testimony from the probation officer, who testified that Venable\u2019s discharge from the Program was primarily \u201cbased upon his ... inability to do the work necessary,\u201d including \u201cfailure to turn in general homework.\u201d The probation officer admitted, however, that \u201cwhat killed the deal is [Venable\u2019s] failing to admit to something having occurred resulting in his conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court found that \u201cVenable violated the conditions of my suspended sentence in that he has not been amenable to treatment and ... has been unwilling to admit his guilt.\u201d The court, however, continued the disposition of the case to give Venable the opportunity \u201cto submit something else to [the court], some alternative program or something like that.\u201d The court explained that, \u201c[i]f you could convince me on another program that I think would be just as effective as this one and doesn\u2019t have that requirement [of admitting guilt], I\u2019m willing to take a look at it, but I don\u2019t know of any at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>During the subsequent hearing, Venable stated that he was willing to participate in \u201cTherapeutic Options,\u201d an alternative sex-offender program, also proffering that \u201cthe Commonwealth is satisfied with the [alternative] program.\u201d Although not certain, Venable stated that he believed the requirements of the two programs are \u201cbasically the same.\u201d When asked if he had anything to say, Venable responded that he was \u201cwilling to do whatever [he] need[s] to complete the [alternative] course\u201d because he \u201cwant[s] to get out so that [he] can support [his] wife and family.\u201d The trial court then opted to \u201ccontinue [Venable] on probation, substituting the [alternate] sexual offender program\u201d for the original treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">On appeal, Venable argues that the trial court violated his Fifth Amendment rights in two respects: first, by holding that he had violated a condition of his probation, and second, by re-enrolling him in an alternative counseling program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not violate Venable\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">A. <em>Whether the Court Erred in Holding that Venable Violated His Probation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">The Fifth Amendment provides, in pertinent part, that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . .\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>It has long been held that this prohibition not only permits a person to refuse to testify against himself at a criminal trial in which he is a defendant, but also \u201cprivileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa4\"><em>Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 426, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 1142, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984) (quoting <em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973)); <em>see also Husske v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 203, 214, 476 S.E.2d 920, 927 (1996). Thus, \u201c \u2018a witness protected by the privilege may rightfully refuse to answer unless and until he is protected at least against the use of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant,\u2019 \u201d and, \u201c \u2018if he is nevertheless compelled to answer, his answers are inadmissible against him in a later criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 426, 104 S.Ct. at 1142 (quoting <em>Turley, </em>414 U.S. at 78, 94 S.Ct. at 323). Also, \u201c[a] defendant does not lose this protection by reason of his conviction of a crime,\u201d regardless of whether the defendant \u201cis imprisoned or on probation at the time he makes incriminating statements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The United States Supreme Court has further held that \u201ca State may not impose substantial penalties because a witness elects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against himself.\u201d <em>Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. 801, 805, 97 S.Ct. 2132, 2136, 53 L.Ed.2d 1 (1977); <em>see also Turley, </em>414 U.S. at 84-85, 94 S.Ct. at 326; <em>Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass\u2019n v. Comm\u2019r of Sanitation, </em>392 U.S. 280, 88 S.Ct. 1917, 20 L.Ed.2d 1089 (1968); <em>Gardner v. Broderick, </em>392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968); <em>Spevack v. Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967). These cases are grounded in the concept that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment guarantees ... the right of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>person to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, <em>and to suffer no penalty ... for such silence.\u201d Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1494, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964) (emphasis added); <em>see also Chavez v. Martinez, </em>538 U.S. 760, 768-69, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 2002, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (\u201c[N]o \u2018penalty<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may ever be imposed on someone who exercises his core Fifth Amendment right not to be a \u2018witness\u2019 against himself in a \u2018criminal case.\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For this reason, the United States Supreme Court has observed, albeit in <em>dicta, </em>that \u201cits decisions have made clear that the State could not constitutionally carry out a threat to revoke probation for the legitimate exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege,\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 438, 104 S.Ct. at 1148 for, in doing so, the government would be imposing a penalty upon an individual who \u201celects to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against himself,\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. at 805, 97 S.Ct. at 2136.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Here, Venable argues that the trial court\u2019s holding\u2014specifically, that he violated the terms of his probation when he was discharged from the Program for failing to admit to his guilt\u2014 violated the Fifth Amendment. Venable reasons that, had he admitted to his guilt during his counseling sessions, he would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>be exposed to potential criminal liability for perjury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Venable concludes that the trial court was constitutionally precluded from holding that he had violated the conditions of his probation because, in doing so, the court imposed a penalty upon the exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">It is not clear from the record before us that suspending a penitentiary sentence conditioned upon Venable\u2019s successful completion of a sex-offender treatment program constituted a form of governmental coercion. <em>Cf. McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 41, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 2029, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002) (upholding a prison regulation denying certain privileges to inmates who refused to participate in a sex-offender treatment program, reasoning that the threatened consequences, specifically, \u201ca transfer to another prison where television sets are not placed in each inmate\u2019s cell, where exercise facilities are not readily available, and where work and wage opportunities are more limited,\u201d were not so great as to \u201ccompel a prisoner to speak about his past crimes despite a desire to remain silent\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>However, because, as discussed below, the trial court in this instance did not actually impose a \u201csubstantial penalty\u201d based upon Venable\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege, we need not reach the issue of whether forcing a probationer to choose between either losing his conditional liberty or incriminating himself during court-ordered counseling constitutes \u201ccompulsion\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">As recently noted by the United States Supreme Court, \u201cmere coercion does not violate the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause.\u201d <em>Chavez, </em>538 U.S. at 767, 123 S.Ct. at 1994. Rather, we must also consider whether the trial court actually imposed a \u201csubstantial penalty\u201d upon Venable after he \u201celect[ed] to exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to give incriminating testimony against himself.\u201d <em>Cunningham, </em>431 U.S. at 805, 97 S.Ct. at 2136. Not all consequences that \u201cfollow[] directly from a person\u2019s silence\u201d constitute a \u201csubstantial penalty\u201d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. <em>McKune, </em>536 U.S. at 44, 122 S.Ct. at 2030,. Specifically, although \u201cpenalties\u201d said to implicate the Fifth Amendment are \u201cnot restricted to fine[s] or imprisonment,\u201d <em>Spevack, </em>385 U.S. at 515, 87 S.Ct. at 628 they encompass only those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>sanctions that \u201cmake[] assertion of the Fifth Amendment \u2018costly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Even if we were to assume that the Commonwealth \u201ccould not constitutionally <em>carry out </em>a threat to revoke probation for the legitimate exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege,\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 438, 104 S.Ct. at 1148 (emphasis added), the trial court in this instance did not actually revoke Venable\u2019s probation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor is there any evidence that the court\u2019s holding resulted in the imposition of a fine or other identifiable sanction. Rather, the court merely continued Venable\u2019s probation and, at Venable\u2019s request, substituted a different sex-offender counseling program for the original treatment program. Under these circumstances, \u201c[w]e are persuaded that the [trial] Court did not impose a \u2018price tag\u2019 on [the exercise of Venable\u2019s] constitutional privilege to remain silent.\u201d <em>United States v. Vermeulen, </em>436 F.2d 72, 76 (2d Cir.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the record fails to demonstrate that the trial judge imposed a \u201csubstantial penalty\u201d upon Venable. Because Venable has not, in fact, been deprived of his conditional liberty or subjected to any other \u201ccostly\u201d sanction, it follows that the trial court did not contravene the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment when it held that Venable, by reason of his discharge from the Program, violated a condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">B. <em>Whether the Court Erred in Ordering Venable to Participate in the Alternative Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Venable\u2019s second argument\u2014that the trial court also violated the Fifth Amendment when it substituted the alternative sex-offender treatment program for the original Program\u2014 also fails. First, there is no evidence in the record from which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>it could be inferred that the alternative sex-offender program requires participants to admit to their guilt. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Brescia, </em>61 Mass.App.Ct. 908, 810 N.E.2d 842, 844 (2004) (holding that the defendant did not establish that a court order requiring him to submit to counseling violated the Fifth Amendment where the defendant \u201cfailed to provide any support for the proposition that his participation in a treatment program will require him to incriminate himself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Second, Venable not only agreed to, but actually proposed, enrollment in this alternative program. Accordingly, this probation condition was imposed with Venable\u2019s full and voluntary consent. <em>See Wolfe v. Pa. Dept. of Corr., </em>334 F.Supp.2d 762, 773 (E.D.Pa.2004) (\u201cA voluntary decision to participate in the [sex-offender treatment program] does not rise to constitutional infirmity simply because some of the consequences of participation are unpleasant\u2014consequences that plaintiffs are aware of from the outset when the decision is made.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Ross, </em>9 F.3d 1182, 1191 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201c[W]e cannot accept that [a probationer] has an additional right to avoid the express conditions upon which he was granted probation.... He must make a choice. If he is to enjoy the advantages of supervised release, he must comply with any lawfully imposed conditions of probation.\u201d (citation omitted)), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>511 U.S. 1124, 114 S.Ct. 2129, 128 L.Ed.2d 860 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Because the record does not affirmatively indicate that participants in the alternative sex-offender treatment program must admit to their guilt, and because Venable both proposed and consented to his participation in that program, we hold that the trial court did not violate the Fifth Amendment when it ordered Venable, as a condition of his probation, to enroll in an alternative sex-offender treatment program. <em>See generally Wolfe, </em>334 F.Supp.2d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not contravene the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ment when it found that Venable violated a condition of his probation, nor did it violate the Fifth Amendment by ordering Venable, as a condition of his continued probationary status, to enroll in an alternative sex-offender treatment program suggested by Venable himself. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b433-10\">. Venable does not challenge the trial court\u2019s decision to impose completion of the Program as an original condition of his probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-11\">. The Fifth Amendment is made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 6, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964) (\u201cWe hold today that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s exception from compulsory self-incrimination is also protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against abridgment by the States.\u201d); <em>see also Spevack v. Klein, </em>385 U.S. 511, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>514, 87 S.Ct. 625, 628, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967) (\"[T]he Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment has been absorbed in the Fourteenth.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\">. In <em>Chavez, </em>a plurality of the United States Supreme Court held that \"mere coercion does not violate the text of the Self-Incrimination Clause.\u201d 538 U.S. at 767, 123 S.Ct. at 2001. In the \"so-called penalty cases,\" <em>McKune v. Lile, </em>536 U.S. 24, 40, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 2028, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), however, it is the <em>threat </em>to impose a substantial penalty that constitutes the governmental coercion, and the actual imposition of the penalty that implicates the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Chavez, </em>538 U.S. at 768-69, 123 S.Ct. at 2002. Thus, under existing Supreme Court precedent, it appears there are two ways in which the Fifth Amendment may be violated: (1) compulsion plus actual imposition of the threatened penalty, as in <em>Cunningham, Turley, Gardner, </em>and <em>Spevack, </em>or (2) compulsion plus \"use of the compelled statements in a criminal case against the witness.\u201d <em>Chavez, </em>538 U.S. at 767, 123 S.Ct. at 2001. Under the circumstances of this case, Venable made no statements that were introduced during a subsequent criminal proceeding. Accordingly, we are only concerned with the first line of cases, questioning whether Venable has been both compelled to testify and then penalized for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b436-6\">. The record in this case does not affirmatively indicate that Venable did, in fact, testify under oath during his original criminal trial. It is questionable, then, whether Venable actually faces a \"realistic threat of self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>465 U.S. at 435 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. at 1146 n. 7. However, because neither the Commonwealth nor the trial court disagreed with Venable\u2019s contention that admitting his guilt would place him at risk of being prosecuted for peijury, we need not decide this issue, and will instead assume, for purposes of this appeal only, that Venable\u2019s admission of guilt would be self-incriminating. <em>But compare McComb </em>v. <em>State, 32 </em>Kan.App.2d 1037, 94 P.3d 715, 717, 721 (2004), <em>with James v.

Similarly, we need not decide whether, under the circumstances of this case, Venable\u2019s acceptance of the terms of his probation constituted a valid waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">. Although taken from the plurality opinion, this rationale is identical to that expressed in Justice O'Connor\u2019s concurring opinion, which is \"arguably more narrow than the plurality\u2019s,\u201d and, thus, has generally been treated as \u201cthe holding of the Court.\u201d <em>Ainsworth v.

Thus, these cases are both unpersuasive and readily distinguishable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b440-6\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7uD\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The United States Supreme Court has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">The Fifth Amendment[, which] provides that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself[,]\u201d ... not only protects the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\"><em>Lefkowitz v. Turley, </em>414 U.S. 70, 77, 94 S.Ct. 316, 322, 38 L.Ed.2d 274 (1973) (citing <em>McCarthy v. Arndstein, </em>266 U.S. 34, 40, 45 S.Ct. 16, 17, 69 L.Ed. 158 (1924)). Indeed, in <em>Minnesota v. Murphy, </em>465 U.S. 420, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984), where a probationer admitted committing crimes to a probation officer and did not timely invoke the Fifth Amendment, <em>id. </em>at 423-24, 104 S.Ct. at 1140-41, the Supreme Court reiterated that its \u201cdecisions have made clear that the State could not constitutionally carry out a threat to revoke probation for the legitimate exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 104 S.Ct. at 1148; <em>see also Mace v. Amestoy, </em>765 F.Supp. 847 (D.Vt.1991) (granting a petition for habeas corpus because the probation revocation violated the petitioner\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination). The Supreme Court\u2019s reference to its prior decisions was not inconsequential to its decision in <em>Murphy </em>because the Court held, \u201cin light of [its] decisions proscribing threats of penalties for the exercise of Fifth Amendment rights, Murphy could not reasonably have feared that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>assertion of the privilege would have led to revocation.\u201d 465 U.S. at 439, 104 S.Ct. at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In this case, Venable, a probationer, timely asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege when he was questioned in a sexual treatment program ordered by his probation about sexual offenses. The principle is long standing that a person who is protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege may \u201crefuse to answer unless and until he is protected at least against the use of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom in any subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant.\u201d <em>Lefkowitz, </em>414 U.S. at 78, 94 S.Ct. at 323 (citing <em>Kastigar v. United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972)). Although the Commonwealth instigated proceedings to revoke Venable\u2019s probation for his refusal to respond to the questioning, the trial judge continued Venable\u2019s probation and ordered him to participate in an alternate program, one suggested by Venable.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">For these reasons, I would hold that Venable has failed to demonstrate he suffered punishment for the exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights. Thus, I too would affirm the trial judge\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
