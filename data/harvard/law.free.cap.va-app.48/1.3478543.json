On appeal, he claims his abduction conviction should be vacated because his physical restraint of the victim served only as a prelude to her murder. Pryor also contends both convictions should be overturned because the trial court violated Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 by admitting into evidence the testimony of Pryor\u2019s wife previously given at his preliminary hearing. Finding no merit in either assertion, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Under settled principles, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">On the day of her murder, Lisa Johnson was visiting the mobile home of Gary and Mary Pryor. While there, Johnson and the Pryors used illegal drugs. When Johnson tried to leave without paying for the drugs, Gary Pryor fought with Johnson. After Johnson fell to the ground, Gary Pryor \u201cwent down on top of her and held her.\u201d While detaining Johnson in this way, Gary Pryor instructed his wife to \u201cget him the tape to tape her.\u201d Mary Pryor complied, and Gary Pryor taped Johnson so she could not escape. Gary Pryor then left Johnson momentarily to retrieve a plastic bag. He returned to Johnson and used the bag to smother her to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Gary and Mary Pryor later dumped Johnson\u2019s body over the side of North Mountain near Buffalo Gap. A witness saw the Pryors and their vehicle shortly after they discarded Johnson\u2019s body. The witness also found Johnson\u2019s still-warm body and summoned the police. Upon a search of the Pryors\u2019 mobile home, the police found Johnson\u2019s personal identification, jewelry, and underwear in a plastic bag. The police also found traces of Johnson\u2019s blood as well as pieces of tape used to restrain Johnson prior to her death. Later forensic testing identified Johnson\u2019s hair fibers on the tape. After apprehending the Pryors in Michigan, the police found a bed sheet stained with Johnson\u2019s blood a few miles from where her body had been dumped.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">At Gary Pryor\u2019s preliminary hearing, Mary Pryor elected to testify against her husband. Proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gary. I have to tell the truth,\u201d she asserted no testimonial or eviden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>tiary privilege of any kind. She gave sworn testimony describing in detail both the murder and the effort to hide Johnson\u2019s body. Most of the specifics of the murder came out during cross-examination by Gary Pryor\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">At the later jury trial, the Commonwealth called Mary Pryor as a witness. She refused to take the stand, invoking the marital testimonial privilege of Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2. At the Commonwealth\u2019s request, the trial court declared Mary Pryor unavailable as a witness and allowed her prior testimony to be read to the jury. In response, Gary Pryor testified that his wife accidentally suffocated Johnson to death during a scuffle between the two. After testifying, Gary Pryor rested his case. The jury found him guilty of first-degree murder and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">A. <em>Murder &amp; The Brown Abduction Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">Relying on <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 337 S.E.2d 711 (1985), Pryor contends his abduction conviction must be reversed as a matter of law. Even accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at face value, Pryor argues, his physical restraint of Johnson before her suffocation was simply a brief prelude to the murder\u2014a merely \u201cincidental\u201d detention that cannot be separately criminalized as an abduction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">In <em>Brown, </em>the defendant argued that double jeopardy principles forbid the coupling of an abduction conviction with related rape and forcible sodomy convictions when the conduct arose \u201cout of the same criminal episode.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311-12, 337 S.E.2d at 712. <em>Brown </em>resolved the \u201cconstitutional problem\u201d by holding that the General Assembly authorized a separate punishment for abduction so long as it did not involve the \u201ckind of restraint which is an <em>intrinsic element </em>of crimes such as rape, robbery, and assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 337 S.E.2d at 713 (emphasis added). Applying that principle to the facts, <em>Brawn </em>found that \u201cthe record before us shows that the detention underlying the abduction conviction was not the kind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>of restraint that is <em>inherent in the act of rape.\u201d Id. </em>at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 714 (emphasis added). Because the \u201cacts of force and intimidation employed in the abduction were separate and apart from the restraint <em>inherent in the commission of the rape,\u201d id. </em>(emphasis added), the multiple-punishment challenge failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">We recently confirmed our understanding of <em>Brown </em>in just these terms. \u201cUnder this principle, a defendant \u2018charged with abduction by detention and another crime that factually includes restraint of the victim <em>(e.g., </em>rape or robbery)\u2019 as a matter of law cannot \u2018be convicted of both unless the abduction-detention is factually distinct from the restraint inherent in the other crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 114, 123, 622 S.E.2d 282, 286-87 (2005) (quoting Roger D. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses &amp; Defenses in Virginia </em>at 3 (5th ed.2005) (emphasis omitted)). In this way, <em>Brown </em>focuses not on whether the restraint was merely useful to perpetrating a detention-plus crime\u2014but whether the restraint was \u201cintrinsic\u201d to, <em>Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 511, 450 S.E.2d 146, 152 (1994), or \u201cinherent\u201d in, <em>Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 93, 97, 468 S.E.2d 114, 116 (1996); <em>Coram v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 623, 625-26, 352 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1987), the detention-plus crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">No Virginia case has ever held that the <em>Brown </em>multiple-punishments principle applies to abduction coupled with homicide. The first time such an assertion was ever made, the Virginia Supreme Court summarily dismissed it with the observation that restraint \u201cis not a necessary element of homicide. Thus, [defendant\u2019s] contention that the restraint of [victim] was not more than what was necessary incident to his attempt to kill her is without merit.\u201d <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 512, 541 n. 11, 552 S.E.2d 344, 360 n. 11 (2001). This makes a great deal of sense, given that an abduction preceding a murder can never be said to be legally \u201cinherent in the act\u201d of murder. <em>See Brown, </em>230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 714; <em>see also Jerman v. Dir., Dept. of Corr., </em>267 Va. 432, 440, 593 S.E.2d 255, 260 (2004) (dismissing habeas complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>on the ground that abductions immediately preceding and following a murder cannot, as a matter of law, be \u201cinherent in the act of murdering\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Maybe not, Pryor argues, but as a practical matter some murders do involve a form of simultaneous physical restraint. A murder victim stabbed multiple times would likely find, during the time between each penetration of the blade, her freedom of movement restrained as a result. Similarly here, Pryor continues, Johnson did not die at the very moment he placed the plastic bag over her mouth and nose. The process of asphyxiation took some measurable period of time to shut down her internal organs sufficient to cause her death. This period of restraint cannot be separately criminalized under the abduction statute, Pryor concludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">We need not address this argument since it posits a wholly hypothetical situation. In this case, Pryor physically held Johnson down on the ground while his wife obtained the requested tape. When she returned with the tape, Pryor taped Johnson so she could not escape while he went to retrieve a plastic bag to smother her with. An abduction occurred <em>before </em>Pryor sealed off Johnson\u2019s airways with the plastic bag and began the process of suffocating her to death. Had he relented at the last moment and decided against murdering Johnson, Pryor could have been convicted of an abduction based upon what he had already done. An abduction conviction \u201crequires only a showing of \u2018physical detention of a person, with the intent to deprive him of his personal liberty, by force, intimidation, or deception\u2019 without more.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>47 Va.App. at 120, 622 S.E.2d at 285 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Based on the logic of <em>Brown </em>and the holding of <em>Powell, </em>we conclude that an abduction preceding a murder may lead to separate convictions for each. The trial court in Pryor\u2019s case, therefore, did not err in refusing to set aside the abduction conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">B. <em>Marital Testimonial Privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Pryor also argues that the trial court erroneously admitted into evidence his wife\u2019s prior testimony at his preliminary hearing. He does not question that this evidence fits within the hearsay exception for former testimony of an unavailable witness. <em>See generally Nowlin v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 327, 335, 579 S.E.2d 367, 371 (2003) (invoicing marital testimonial privilege by a witness-spouse, when proper, makes her \u201cunavailable\u201d for hearsay purposes).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, he argues that his wife\u2019s invocation of the marital testimonial privilege at trial precluded the trial court from admitting into evidence her prior, voluntary testimony at the preliminary hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 provides that, except in certain kinds of prosecutions, one spouse cannot be \u201ccompelled to be called as a witness against the other\u201d in a criminal case. At no point in this case was Mary Pryor ever compelled to testify against her husband. Though she could have invoked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>privilege at the preliminary hearing, <em>see Livingston v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 621, 628, 466 S.E.2d 757, 760 (1996), she voluntarily chose to testify. When the time came for her to testify at trial, she chose not to. In neither instance was she compelled\u2014at least in any ordinary sense of the word\u2014to testify against her husband. \u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-271.2 affords a defendant on trial no right to object to his spouse\u2019s voluntary testimony.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 136, 141, 554 S.E.2d 695, 698 (2001); <em>see also Turner v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 88, 95, 531 S.E.2d 619, 622 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Though applicable only to criminal cases, Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 is not \u201ca penal statute that must be construed strictly against the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 601, 606, 292 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1982). Exactly the opposite is true. Because Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 impairs \u201cthe right of the public to have all relevant evidence introduced in the fact-finding process,\u201d its statutory reach \u201cshould be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Trammel v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 50, 100 S.Ct. 906, 912, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1980)); <em>see also Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 456, 374 S.E.2d 303, 309 (1988) (holding that Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 \u201cmust be strictly construed\u201d). The admission of spousal testimony, therefore, should be the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d and exclusion of that testimony \u201cthe exception.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>223 Va. at 606, 292 S.E.2d at 322; <em>Livingston, </em>21 Va.App. at 627, 466 S.E.2d at 760 (confirming that Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2 should be \u201cstrictly construed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Though the privilege has ancient roots, the \u201cmodern justification for this privilege against adverse spousal testimony is its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of the marriage relationship.\u201d <em>Trammel, </em>445 U.S. at 44, 100 S.Ct. at 909. And when \u201cone spouse has testified in a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>prosecution against the other, whatever marital harmony once existed has been dissipated, and the spousal privilege no longer serves a useful purpose.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>223 Va. at 608, 292 S.E.2d at 323. After Mary Pryor accused her husband of premeditated murder in open court, any marital harmony they may have previously enjoyed was effectively overtaken by events. Applying the privilege under such circumstances cannot be justified either by the text of the statute or the underlying public policy supporting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the preliminary hearing testimony of Mary Pryor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Finding no error in either conviction, we affirm the trial court\u2019s final order confirming the jury\u2019s verdict holding Gary Pryor guilty of first-degree murder and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\">. To be sure, even when abduction serves as a predicate offense for felony murder, double jeopardy principles do not preclude separate convictions (and thus multiple punishments) for both murder and abduction. <em>See Spain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 385, 392, 373 S.E.2d 728, 731-32 (1988) (relying on <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 637, 292 S.E.2d 798, 811 (1982)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\">. For these reasons, we see no need to analyze the detention dissimilarity factors outlined in <em>Hoyt v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 489, 605 S.E.2d 755 (2004). <em>Hoyt </em>did not apply <em>Brown </em>to an abduction preceding a murder or discuss any legal precedents that did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b56-9\">. Gary Pryor does not question the voluntariness of his wife's preliminary hearing testimony. Nor does he challenge any other condition ordinarily required for the admission of preliminary hearing testimony of a witness unavailable to testify at trial. <em>See generally Sapp v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 415, 423, 559 S.E.2d 645, 649 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\">. Pryor did not argue at trial, nor does he assert on appeal, that his statements to his wife constituted \u201cconfidential communications\u201d under Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-398 and 19.2-271.2. <em>See generally </em>2005 Va. Acts, ch. 809 (amending \u00a7 8.01-398 and incorporating its amended text into the second paragraph of \u00a7 19.2-271.2). We thus express no opinion on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b57-7\">. Given our holding, we need not address whether Mary Pryor's waiver of the marital privilege constituted a subject-matter waiver, releasing for all time the topics she discussed from the protection of the privilege. <em>Cf. Blackman v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 633, 641, 613 S.E.2d 460, 464-65 (2005) (applying principle to privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b58-11\">. Gary Pryor also challenges the manner in which the preliminary hearing testimony was read to the jury, which he characterizes as an impermissible \"reenactment.\u201d Under Virginia law, however, the \"manner of the introduction of evidence\u201d involves a core aspect of the trial court\u2019s discretion, \" 'and in the absence of abuse of this discretion resulting in prejudice to [the] defendant\u2019s case,' the court\u2019s ruling will not be reversed on appeal.\u201d <em>Cheng v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 26, 40, 393 S.E.2d 599, 606 (1990) (quoting <em>Virginian Ry. v. London, </em>148 Va. 699, 716, 139 S.E. 328, 333 (1927)). Nothing in this record suggests the trial court abused its discretion on this subject or that Pryor suffered any prejudice in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b58-9\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">I concur in the holding that the trial judge did not err in overruling Gary Anthony Pryor\u2019s objection to the admission of his wife\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony. I also agree that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in permitting the prosecutor and a witness to reenact the wife\u2019s testimony by question and answer at trial. I dissent, however, from the portion of the opinion upholding the abduction conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>I. Spousal Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Without any objection by Pryor or his wife, Pryor\u2019s -wife testified for the Commonwealth at the preliminary hearing that Pryor strangled Lisa Johnson. Only during cross-examination by Pryor\u2019s attorney was she asked to explain the sequence of events. She then testified for the first time that Pryor asked her to retrieve tape, he taped Johnson\u2019s wrists, and he rose to obtain a plastic bag to suffocate Johnson. During this cross-examination, Pryor\u2019s wife testified about statements Pryor made to her as these events were occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Citing Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2, Pryor\u2019s attorney contends on appeal that the trial judge erred in admitting the wife\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony because \u201cthe wife exercised her right ... to not testify against the husband.\u201d In essence, he argues that Pryor\u2019s wife invoked her testimonial privilege not to be compelled to testify against her husband. Pryor\u2019s attorney did not argue at trial and does not argue on appeal that her testimony should have been barred by the interspousal confidential communication privilege recognized in Code \u00a7 19.2-271.2, which incorporated Code \u00a7 8.01-398. Interspousal confidential communication privilege is a separate, distinct privilege created by the statute. <em>See Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 213-15, 335 S.E.2d 823, 826-27 (1985). For this reason, I concur in the ruling that the trial judge did not err in overruling the objection that was articulated by Pryor\u2019s attorney at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">II. Abduction</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Pryor argues on appeal that his detention of Johnson was not separate and apart from the detention employed in the act causing the homicide. I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the holding in <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 310, 337 S.E.2d 711 (1985), cannot apply when a defendant is charged with abduction coupled with a homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Pryor\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony did not establish that the time sequence of these events was lengthy or that Pryor moved any significant distance beyond Johnson\u2019s body in obtaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>bag. The absence of those facts is critical because in <em>Brown </em>the Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">h[e]ld ... that one accused of abduction by detention and another crime involving restraint of the victim, both growing out of a continuing course of conduct, is subject upon conviction to separate penalties for separate offenses only when the detention committed in the act of abduction is separate and apart from, and not merely incidental to, the restraint employed in the commission of the other crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 713-14. The Supreme Court further noted that \u201cother courts follow a similar rule,\u201d and it cited <em>Iowa v. Folck, </em>325 N.W.2d 368 (Iowa 1982), as an example. <em>Brown, </em>230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 714. Significantly, the Iowa Supreme Court noted in <em>Folck </em>that, when a defendant commits a criminal act, \u201cnot every incidental confinement or every trivial movement from one place to another warrants a kidnapping conviction,\u201d and it enumerated factors to be used in determining whether a separate abduction occurred. <em>Folck, </em>325 N.W.2d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In a recent decision, we analyzed a series of Virginia cases that applied the <em>Brown </em>holding and concluded that there are four \u201cfactors Virginia courts have employed on a case-by-case basis in determining whether an abduction is incidental to another crime.\u201d <em>Hoyt v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 489, 495, 605 S.E.2d 755, 757-58 (2004). Those factors, stated in summary fashion, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c(1) the duration of the detention or asportation; (2) whether the detention or asportation occurred during the commission of a separate offense; (3) whether the detention or asportation which occurred is inherent in the separate offense; and (4) whether the asportation or detention created a significant danger to the victim independent of that posed by the separate offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 494, 605 S.E.2d at 757 (quoting <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Berry, </em>604 F.2d 221, 227 (3d Cir.1979)). These factors are not far removed from those cited in <em>Folck, </em>the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>our Supreme Court referenced as applying a rule similar to that adopted in the <em>Brown </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Applied to this case, the <em>Brown </em>holding and our distillation of the four factors lead to the conclusion that Pryor\u2019s detention of Jackson was merely incidental to the restraint employed by Pryor in the commission of the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">First, the duration of Pryor\u2019s detention of Johnson and of the other events connected to the detention were not shown to be significant. The evidence proved that Pryor and Johnson argued about money Johnson owed the Pryors for drugs she consumed. Johnson said to Pryor, \u2018\"You can kill me if you want I\u2019m not going to pay you.\u201d During the argument, Pryor fell upon Johnson when she tripped at \u201cthe corner of the bar ... the counter.\u201d There, he tied her and then retrieved a bag from the cabinet and \u201csmothered\u201d her. No evidence proved Pryor moved Johnson or that he moved any significant distance in obtaining the bag to suffocate her. No evidence proved that any lengthy period of time occurred between the tying and the asphyxiation. Indeed, the evidence suggests that Pryor smothered Johnson immediately after tying her. In addition, testimony by the assistant medical examiner proved that the \u201cvery high level\u201d of the controlled substance Fentanyl in Johnson\u2019s system would have caused her to have \u201cserious problems\u201d breathing even without any contact with Pryor.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Second, the detention occurred during the argument and struggle that culminated in the homicide. No evidence established that the detention was an act that occurred separately from the act of the homicide. Both the detention and the homicide flowed from the argument in a continuous sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Third, the detention was the mode of action that facilitated the homicide. It was inherently a part of the method of the homicide that was committed. The tying of Johnson was done incidental to and in furtherance of Pryor suffocating Johnson. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 872, 879, 275 S.E.2d 592, 596-97 (1981) (reversing an abduction conviction because the evidence proved that a defendant who held a woman while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>committing an assault and battery committed this act in furtherance of sexual advances and the detention was merely incidental to that offense). Here, Pryor could not have suffocated Johnson without detaining her, and he only moved a trivial distance in obtaining the bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Fourth, the detention did not create a significant danger to Johnson that was independent of the danger posed by the homicide. In <em>Hoyt, </em>this Court held that a detention lasting five minutes and moving the victim ten feet was slight and, thus, the defendant could not be convicted of abduction as well as the underlying felony. 44 Va.App. at 493, 605 S.E.2d at 757. In this case, the continuity of the acts and the absence of evidence that a significant lapse of time occurred between the acts negate the notion that the detention posed a significant, independent danger to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Brown </em>suggests, the dispositive issue is whether the detention was \u201cmerely incidental to ... the restraint employed in the commission of the other ciime.\u201d 230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 714. In <em>Hoyt, </em>we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">the Supreme Court of Maryland ... noted that \u201ca majority of courts ... now hold that \u2018kidnapping statutes do not apply to unlawful confinements or movements incidental to the commission of other felonies\u2019 \u201d [and the Maryland court] recognized that a literal reading of abduction and kidnapping statutes would \u201coverrun other crimes, such as robbery, rape, and assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">44 Va.App. at 493, 605 S.E.2d at 757 (quoting <em>State v. Stouffer, </em>352 Md. 97, 721 A.2d 207, 212 (1998) (quoting Frank J. Wozniak, Annotation, <em>Seizure or Detention for Purpose of Committing Rape, Robbery, or Other Offense as Constituting Separate Crime of Kidnapping, </em>39 A.L.R.5th 283, 356 (1996))). This view is consistent with the holding in <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">Relying on footnote 11 in <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 512, 541 n. 11, 552 S.E.2d 344, 360 n. 11 (2001), the majority opinion asserts that the Supreme Court of Virginia has summarily dismissed the contention that the <em>Brown </em>principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>applies to an abduction coupled with a homicide. This footnote, however, is merely dicta because the abduction charge in <em>Powell </em>did not arise in connection with a homicide, and this footnote has never been relied upon by the Supreme Court or any other court. Indeed, as the following passage demonstrates, the abduction in <em>Powell </em>was not incidental to the restraint employed in any other offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">Here, there is sufficient evidence to support the finding of the jury that Powell used greater restraint than was necessary to commit rape. First, Powell ordered Kristie to go to a more secluded part of the home prior to the rape. Although Powell did not display a weapon to her at that time, it is clear under the circumstances that Kristie was in reasonable fear for her life having just discovered her sister\u2019s lifeless body and being aware that Powell was usually armed. Moreover, <em>after the rape was completed, Powell bound Kristie and left her for some time before returning to attempt to kill her. </em>This restraint clearly exceeded that necessary to accomplish the rape. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in failing to strike the evidence as to the charge of abduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 541, 552 S.E.2d at 360 (emphasis added) (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">I also disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s conclusion that the Supreme Court held in <em>Jerman v. Dir., Dept. of Corrections, </em>267 Va. 432, 593 S.E.2d 255 (2004), that abductions that immediately preceded and followed a homicide \u201ccannot, as a matter of law, be \u2018inherent in the act of murdering.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Jerman, </em>the Supreme Court noted that two separate detentions occurred apart from any that may have occurred during the assault that led to Rhatigan\u2019s later death in a hospital.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">The first abduction was accomplished through asportation by deception, which is proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-47. Panko picked Rhatigan up and drove him to her house on the pretext that some of her friends were there and they \u201call wanted to trip.\u201d She did not disclose to Rhatigan the fact that Jerman, Bohn, and Joe were awaiting him with baseball bats____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The second abduction occurred [after the assault] when Bohn and Joe carried Rhatigan\u2019s body out of the house, through the backyard to the fence, and then tossed him over the fence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">267 Va. at 439-40, 593 S.E.2d at 259. In view of these facts, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe evidence in this case proved abduction by deception before the assault and abduction by force after the assault. Neither involved the restraint or force inherent in the act of murdering Rhatigan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440, 593 S.E.2d at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Simply put, the evidence in this case proved Pryor\u2019s detention of Johnson was incidental to the act of suffocating Johnson. In other words, the detention was not \u201cremote in terms of time and distance\u201d from the homicide and was not, \u201cin terms of quality and quantity, ... separate and apart\u201d from the restraint employed in the suffocation of Johnson. <em>Brown, </em>230 Va. at 314, 337 S.E.2d at 714. For these reasons, I would reverse the abduction conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
