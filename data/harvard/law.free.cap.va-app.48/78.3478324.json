Palmer, appellant, appeals a trial court decision holding that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) had sufficient evidence to deny appellant\u2019s application for a permit to construct a storage shed on his pier, located along West Landing Creek. On appeal, appellant contends that the VMRC erred in (1) finding that construction of the storage shed violated the public trust doctrine, (2) finding that the storage shed was not water-dependent and was not necessary for appellant\u2019s use of his pier, (3) finding that the storage shed had an environmental impact on the subaqueous land of the Commonwealth, and (4) finding that the storage shed interfered with the right of others to use and enjoy the subaqueous land of the Commonwealth. Additionally, appellant argues that the VMRC failed to review his application within the time period prescribed by Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(D), thus requiring the automatic approval of his application. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The facts in this case are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">On January 24, 2001, appellant submitted an application to the VMRC to construct a 134-foot long pier and an open-sided boathouse extending from his property into West Landing Creek.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The VMRC subsequently issued a \u201cno-permit necessary\u201d letter to appellant, noting that his application fell within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the permit exemption provided by Code \u00a7 28.2~1208(A)(5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shortly after constructing this pier, appellant built a storage shed, measuring 11-feet long, 12-feet wide, and 12-feet high, on the end of his pier. Appellant used the shed to store an outboard boat motor, life jackets, fishing equipment, lawn chairs, toys for his grandchildren, and a small table. Appellant did not request a permit from the VMRC to construct this shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">On February 19, 2002, VMRC staff members were notified that \u201ca non-permitted structure\u201d had been erected on appellant\u2019s pier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After conducting a site visit to inspect the shed, the VMRC filed a sworn complaint and issued a \u201cnotice to comply\u201d letter, sent to appellant on March 13, 2002. The \u201cnotice to comply\u201d letter required that appellant either remove the shed or apply for an after-the-fact permit for the shed within 60 days. Appellant submitted an application for an after-the-fact permit on April 15,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Two people submitted written protests to the VMRC noting their objections to the construction of appellant\u2019s storage shed. One, a neighboring property owner, complained that the shed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>obstructed her views of the river and the bay, while the other, a local citizen responding to the public notice of the hearing, opposed the permit based on her personal impression that appellant deliberately ignored the permit requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">On October 22, 2002, the VMRC conducted a hearing to consider appellant\u2019s application for an after-the-fact permit for his storage shed. A VMRC staff member, Kevin Curling, presented evidence, including pictures of appellant\u2019s pier and storage shed, as well as the written protests submitted by the neighboring property owner and the local citizen. Curling recommended that the VMRC deny the permit application, based on his assessment that the storage shed was not a water-dependent structure and was not necessary to appellant\u2019s use of the pier. Curling noted that, while the shed was used to store some water-dependent articles, it could serve that same purpose if constructed on land near the pier entrance. Curling observed that moving the shed to land also reduced the threat of building materials entering the waterway during a storm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">At this hearing, appellant testified that he constructed the shed himself several months after the pier was built. He said that he did not seek a permit for the structure because he believed that building a shed was a \u201cnatural consequence\u201d of being able to use his pier. Appellant stated that it would \u201cnot be convenient\u201d for him to carry the items he stored in his shed down the length of his pier. Appellant also noted that a neighboring property owner approached him while he was building the shed and complained that it obstructed the view from her property. At the hearing, appellant agreed that his shed did obstruct that property owner\u2019s view of the water.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The VMRC voted 3-2 to deny appellant\u2019s application for an after-the-fact permit and ordered appellant to remove the shed within 30 days. One commission member, voting against the issuance of a permit, noted that the VMRC had recently denied a similar application and that future requests of this nature should also be denied. Another commissioner, who also voted against the issuance of a permit, observed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>it was the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the VMRC on past applications to deny buildings similar to appellant\u2019s shed. Appellant appealed the VMRC decision to the Circuit Court of Mathews County pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000, <em>et seq., </em>arguing that the VMRC did not have sufficient evidence to deny his permit application. The trial court affirmed the VMRC denial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellant concedes that he was required to obtain a permit from the VMRC in order to construct a storage shed on his pier. <em>See Evelyn v. Commonwealth Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>46 Va.App. 618, 621, 621 S.E.2d 130, 132 (2005) (holding that \u201cthe governing statutes limit the riparian owner\u2019s rights such that he may build, without a permit, only those structures \u2018necessary\u2019 or essential to the placement of a private pier for the limited purpose of accessing navigable waters or vessels moored in those waters\u201d and that \u201c[t]he riparian landowner may not build, without a permit, incidental appendages designed merely to enhance the primary purpose of the pier\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Essentially, appellant argues that the evidence did not support the VMRC decision to deny his application for an after-the-fact permit to construct a storage shed on his pier. Additionally, appellant argues that the VMRC violated Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(D), requiring the VMRC to decide any permit application within 90 days of its receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Determinations of whether to issue a permit for proposed construction plans over state-owned subaqueous lands are within the specialized competency of the VMRC.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">The General Assembly has given the VMRC jurisdiction over \u201call commercial fishing and all marine fish, marine shellfish, marine organisms, and habitat\u201d \u201cthroughout\u201d the \u201cstate-owned bottomlands in the Commonwealth.\u201d Code \u00a7 28.2-101.

Badger Powhatan/Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>3 Va.App. 276, 279, 348 S.E.2d 876, 877 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u201cThe sole determination as to factual issues is whether substantial evidence exists in the agency record to support the agency\u2019s decision.

In addition to other factors, the Commission shall also consider the public and private benefits of the proposed project and shall exercise its authority under this section consistent with the public trust doctrine as defined by the common law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Commonwealth adopted pursuant to \u00a7 1-10 in order to protect and safeguard the public right to the use and enjoyment of the subaqueous lands of the Commonwealth held in trust by it for the benefit of the people as conferred by the public trust doctrine and the Constitution of Virginia. The Commission shall also consider the project\u2019s effect on the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8\">1. Other reasonable and permissible uses of state waters and state-owned bottomlands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">2. Marine and fisheries resources of the Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">3. Tidal wetlands, except when this has or will be determined under the provisions of Chapter 13 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">4. Adjacent or nearby properties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">5. Water quality; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">6. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">In considering these factors, the VMRC is guided by both Article XI, Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia and the common law public trust doctrine. Article XI, Section 1 of the Constitution of Virginia reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">To the end that the people have clean air, pure water, and the use and enjoyment for recreation of adequate public lands, waters, and other natural resources, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to conserve, develop, and utilize its natural resources, its public lands, and its historical sites and buildings. Further, it shall be the Commonwealth\u2019s policy to protect its atmosphere, lands, and waters from pollution, impairment, or destruction, for the benefit, enjoyment, and general welfare of the people of the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">The public trust doctrine in Virginia provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-13\">[T]he state holds the land lying beneath public waters as trustee for the benefit of all citizens. As trustee, the state is responsible for proper management of the resource to ensure the preservation and protection of all appropriate current and potential future uses, including potentially conflicting uses, by the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Virginia Marine Resources Commission, <em>Subaqueous Guidelines, </em>21 Va. Reg. Regs. 1708 (Feb. 21, 2005). <em>See also </em>Sharon M. Kelly, Note, <em>The Public Trust and the Constitution: Routes to Judicial Overview of Resource Management Decisions in Virginia </em>75 Va. L.Rev. 895, 896 (1989) (noting that the public trust doctrine provides that \u201ctidelands and certain other lands and waters are held by the state in trust for its citizens, to be used only for the benefit of the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">In reviewing a permit application, the VMRC, under the VMRC Subaqueous Guidelines,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> also considers the water-dependency of the proposed structure and the necessity of the structure to the exercise of the applicant\u2019s riparian rights. The VMRC defines as water-dependent \u201cthose structures and activities that must be located in, on, or over State-owned submerged lands.\u201d 21 Va. Reg. Regs. 1708 (Feb. 21, 2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB\">When applying this definition, both of the following questions must be answered affirmatively:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">1. Is it necessary that the structure be located over water? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">2. Is it necessary that the activity associated with the structure be over the water?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[T]he \u2018ordinary and accepted meaning\u2019 of \u2018necessary\u2019 is \u2018whatever is essential for some purpose ... of, relating to, or having the character of something that is logically required or logically inevitable or that cannot be denied without involving contradiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Evelyn, </em>46 Va.App. at 632, 621 S.E.2d at 137 (quoting <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Glick, </em>240 Va. 283, 287, 397 S.E.2d 105, 108 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Thus, the VMRC considers several factors when considering an application for a permit to build a structure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>over the subaqueous lands of the Commonwealth. The presence or absence of any given factor is not dispositive of whether a permit should be granted; further, not every factor is applicable in every case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Additionally, the VMRC may properly consider the cumulative effect of issuing multiple permits for structures over the waters of the Commonwealth. While the construction of one storage shed on one pier may not seem to pose a threat to the Commonwealth\u2019s subaqueous lands, the construction of hundreds of storage sheds on hundreds of piers poses the risk of substantial harm to the very interests that the VMRC is charged with protecting. <em>See Evelyn, </em>46 Va.App. at 633, 621 S.E.2d at 138 (\u201cAllowing unfettered noncommercial building atop piers that do not intrude into navigable waters is contrary to the plain meaning of [Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5) ] and the common law and would produce an absurd result.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Here, there is substantial, credible evidence in the record to support the finding of the VMRC denying appellant\u2019s permit application. A VMRC staff member, who conducted the site inspection, pointed to the fact that the storage shed was not water-dependent, as it was not necessary that the shed itself be located over water, nor was it necessary for the storage of those items in the shed be over the water. The shed could be located on land, where it posed less of a threat to the waterways if there was storm damage. Appellant himself admitted that he could carry the items he stored in the shed to the water from his land, but that he found this \u201cinconvenient.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Convenience, however, does not fall under the ambit of what can be considered \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In addition, two written protests opposed appellant\u2019s permit application, one from a neighboring property owner concerned about the obstruction to her view of the surrounding water. One commissioner, who voted against the issuance of a permit, pointed to the VMRC\u2019s recent denial of a similar application. Another commissioner, who also voted against the permit, noted that it was the \u201cpolicy\u201d of the VMRC to deny buildings similar to appellant\u2019s shed, evidencing a concern that the VMRC has for the cumulative effect of issuing permits to build storage sheds on piers over the subaqueous lands of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Given the evidence before the VMRC, we cannot say that the decision to deny appellant\u2019s permit application was \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d or that it was an abuse of discretion. There was substantial, credible evidence in the record to support the VMRC decision. Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling to uphold the VMRC decision and to order appellant to remove the storage shed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\n<em>Violation of Time Requirement in Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(D)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Appellant argues that, because the VMRC failed to act on his permit application within 90 days of receiving it, Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(D) requires that the VMRC approve his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">A permit is required and shall be issued by the Commission for placement of any private pier measuring 100 or more feet in length from the mean low-water mark, which is used for noncommercial purposes by an owner of the riparian land in the waters opposite the land, <em>and that traverses commercially productive leased oyster or clam grounds, as defined in \u00a7 28.2-630, </em>provided that the pier does not extend beyond the navigation line established by the Commission or the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The permit may reasonably prescribe the design and location of the pier for the sole purpose of minimizing the adverse impact on such oyster or clam grounds or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>harvesting or propagation of oysters or elams therefrom. The permit shall contain no other conditions or requirements. Unless information or circumstances materially alter the conditions under which the permit would be issued, the Commission shall act within 90 days of receipt of a complete joint permit application to approve or deny the application. If the Commission fails to act within that time, the application shall be deemed approved and the applicant shall be notified of the deemed approval.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">(Emphasis added). It is clear from the emphasized language that this statute applies only to permits for piers that \u201ctraverse commercially productive leased oyster or clam grounds.\u201d \u201c \u2018[T]he province of [statutory] construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 768, 773, 501 S.E.2d 461, 463 (1998) (quoting <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 408, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Appellant\u2019s pier, and the storage shed built upon it, do not fall under this statute. Indeed, appellant\u2019s pier and his subsequent permit application for the storage shed are governed by Code \u00a7 28.2-1203(A)(5), as noted by the VMRC\u2019s \u201cno permit necessary\u201d letter issued in response to appellant\u2019s original permit application in January 2001. Thus, the time period contained in Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(D), which does not appear anywhere else in Title 28.2, does not apply to appellant\u2019s permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the VMRC denial of appellant\u2019s application for a permit to construct a storage shed on his existing pier. Thus, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-12\">.
