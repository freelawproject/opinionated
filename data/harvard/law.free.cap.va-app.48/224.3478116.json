The conviction arose from the shoplifting of numerous razors, over-the-counter medications, and other merchandise from a Food Lion store. On appeal, Twine contends the trial court erred in admitting into evidence, over his hearsay objection, a cash register receipt generated by scanning the bar codes on the shoplifted items to establish the value of the stolen merchandise. Twine further contends that, absent the improperly admitted register receipt, the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for grand larceny. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and Twine\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence established that, on the evening of July 29, 2004, Twine and his accomplice, Demetrius Gray, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>observed acting suspiciously in a Food Lion store. The acting store manager called the police after he saw Twine placing merchandise in his pants. Twine, the manager observed, had merchandise \u201call the way down [each] leg\u201d of his pants and was unable to \u201cwalk that well\u201d as a result. Twine and Gray then left the store without paying for the merchandise and went to their car.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Responding to the shoplifting call, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy James Hazelwood arrived at the Food Lion store as Twine and Gray were about to leave the parking lot. The acting store manager pointed them out to the deputy, and he pulled their car over a few blocks away. Sheriffs Deputy Reginald Simms arrived at the scene of the stop soon thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">When Deputy Hazelwood approached the car and asked Gray, the driver, if he had taken anything from the Food Lion, Gray responded, \u201cYou got me, man. You got me.\u201d He and Twine then \u201cstarted pulling stuff out of [their] pants,\u201d placing it on the front seat between them. Both men had stolen merchandise inside their \u201cbulky\u201d pants, including \u201cdown in the leg[s] of the pants.\u201d Gray informed the police that the items in his pants were from the Food Lion. After collecting the stolen items from the front seat and placing them in a plastic bag, Deputy Simms took the items \u201cback to Food Lion to verify that they came from Food Lion and to get a total price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">At the Food Lion, Deputy Simms emptied the bag of stolen items \u201conto the belt\u201d of a cash register. The store\u2019s \u201cmanager for the front end registers\u201d then scanned and rung up the stolen merchandise at the cash register, and a cash register receipt was produced showing the name and price of each item and the total combined price of the merchandise. The receipt was given to Deputy Simms, who \u201cturned it into [the Department\u2019s property storage unit] with Deputy Hazelwood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">At trial, Deputy Hazelwood testified that he brought the cash register receipt given to him by Deputy Simms to court that day. Asked to examine the receipt, which was marked for identification purposes as Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 1, Deputy Simms identified it as the cash register receipt from the Food Lion store generated by scanning and ringing up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>shoplifted merchandise Twine and Gray had removed from their pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Ann Vance testified that she was on duty as a cashier at the Food Lion \u201c[w]hen [Deputy Simms] brought the [stolen] items back\u201d into the store. Vance further testified that she was standing right next to the register where the retrieved merchandise was scanned and that she observed each item as it was being scanned and rung up at the register. According to Vance, the stolen items did not have individual price tags on them. Instead, they had bar codes on them that were used to scan and ring up the items at the register. \u201cThe bar codes,\u201d Vance testified, \u201care the price tags.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Asked at trial to examine Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 1, Vance testified that the date and time imprinted on the receipt corresponded with the date and time she saw the stolen merchandise being scanned and rung up. Vance further testified that, although she could not independently recall and name each item she saw being rung up, the name and price of the items listed on the cash register receipt corresponded with her \u201crecollection and understanding of what was rung up.\u201d Asked to mark each item listed on the receipt that she saw being scanned and rung up on the register, Vance testified that she saw every item on the receipt being scanned and rung up. She then checked each item listed on the receipt. She also testified that, while she was unable to independently recall and recite the exact prices of the items she saw being scanned, she was \u201cfamiliar with the prices\u201d of the stolen items and each item listed on the receipt appeared to have the right price listed next to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Over Twine\u2019s hearsay and best evidence objections, the trial court admitted the cash register receipt into evidence to establish the value of the stolen merchandise. The receipt listed each scanned item\u2019s description and the item\u2019s price. The receipt showed that the stolen merchandise consisted of seventy-five items\u2014twenty razors, five packs of razor-blade cartridges, eighteen Tylenol products, thirteen Advil products, one Aleve product, eight Claritin products, four Pepcid products, two Prilosec products, three various ointments, and one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>facial cleanser\u2014individually priced between $3.19 and $12.59. The receipt indicated that the total pre-tax price of the seventy-five items of stolen merchandise was $693.29. Twine offered no evidence at trial to refute the prices of the stolen items listed on the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief and again at the conclusion of all the evidence, Twine implicitly renewed his hearsay objection to the admission into evidence of the cash register receipt, and moved to strike the evidence, arguing that, sans the improperly admitted receipt, the evidence was insufficient to prove the stolen merchandise was valued at $200 or more. The trial court denied the motions to strike and found Twine guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">On appeal, Twine contends \u201cthe trial court misapplied the \u2018price tag\u2019 exception\u201d to the hearsay rule in this case because \u201cno price tags were introduced and there was no testimony concerning the amounts shown on the price tags.\u201d Thus, he concludes, the trial court erred in applying the price tag exception and allowing the Commonwealth to introduce the cash register receipt into evidence to establish the value of the stolen merchandise, over his hearsay objection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Twine further contends that, without the inadmissible register receipt, the evidence failed to show that the value of the shoplifted merchandise was at least $200 and was thus insufficient to establish anything more than petit larceny. We hold that the register receipt was properly admitted into evidence and the evidence was thus sufficient to sustain Twine\u2019s conviction for grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>To convict a shoplifter of grand larceny, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the stolen merchandise was $200 or more. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2\u201495(ii); <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 118, 120-21, 489 S.E.2d 482, 483 (1997) (\u201cWhile evidence that an article has some value is sufficient to sustain a conviction for petit larceny, when the value of the stolen item determines the grade of the offense, the Commonwealth must prove the value to be at least the statutory amount.\u201d). The relevant value is the stolen merchandise\u2019s retail value at the time of the shoplifting. <em>See Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 3, 5, 516 S.E.2d 475, 476 (1999) (\u201cThe test is market value, and particularly retail value.\u201d); <em>Parker, </em>254 Va. at 121, 489 S.E.2d at 483 (\u201cThe value of the stolen property is measured as of the time of the theft, and the original purchase price may be admitted as evidence of its current value.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Here, the Commonwealth offered the cash register receipt generated by scanning the bar codes on the shoplifted items recovered from Twine and his accomplice to prove the aggregate value of the stolen merchandise was $200 or more. A Food Lion cashier testified that she observed each of the stolen items listed on the receipt being scanned and rung up at the Food Lion register. Relying on the price tag exception to the hearsay rule established in <em>Robinson, </em>258 Va. at 10, 516 S.E.2d at 479, the trial court admitted the receipt into evidence over Twine\u2019s hearsay exception.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). However, \u201ca trial court \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court made an error of law, \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s ... legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001) (quoting <em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 193, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In <em>Robinson, </em>our Supreme Court recognized an exception to the hearsay rule in shoplifting cases allowing the admission into evidence of the information on price tags affixed to the stolen items of merchandise to establish the value of that merchandise. 258 Va. at 10, 516 S.E.2d at 479. In that case, the appellant challenged his conviction of grand larceny for the theft from a department store of three sports coats. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 516 S.E.2d at 476. The only evidence presented by the Commonwealth at trial to prove the value of the stolen merchandise was the testimony of two store employees regarding the amounts they had observed on the price tags affixed to the coats. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 516 S.E.2d at 476. The appellant contended the trial court erred in admitting the \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d testimony of store employees as evidence of the stolen merchandise\u2019s market value. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 516 S.E.2d at 477. Affirming the trial court\u2019s action, the Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>What is involved here is a simple, uncomplicated matter. Shoplifting is something that occurs thousands and thousands of times throughout this country every day. It is common knowledge that department and other stores regularly affix price tags to items of merchandise and that the tagged price is what a purchaser must pay to acquire an item, without the opportunity to negotiate a reduced price or to question how the tagged price was reached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">Under these circumstances, \u201cthe inherent unreliability of hearsay is not present.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>37 Conn.Supp. 796, 437 A.2d [145,] 148 [(Conn.Super.Ct.1981)]. Therefore, it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to require that in each case a merchant must send to court not only a security person but also other personnel to establish the reliability of the information shown on a price tag affixed to an item that has been stolen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Rather, we think the common-sense approach to the problem is to recognize an exception to the hearsay rule in shoplifting cases permitting the admission into evidence of price tags regularly affixed to items of personalty offered for sale or, in substitution, testimony concerning the amounts shown on such tags when, as in this case, there is no objection to such testimony on best evidence grounds. While such evidence, when admitted, would suffice to make out a prima facie case of an item\u2019s value, the accused would retain full opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses and to present rebutting evidence on the issue of value. <em>See State v. White, </em>437 A.2d at 148. For example, if a store conducts a sale but computes the reduced price at the cash register rather than marking the change on the price tag, an accused would be entitled to rely upon the reduced price as evidence of the item\u2019s value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">The evidence in the present case falls within the exception we now recognize to the hearsay rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 10, 516 S.E.2d at 478-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">We agree with the trial court that the \u201ccommon-sense approach\u201d taken by the Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>applies to the valuation evidence at issue in the present case. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>dissimilar to the items of merchandise shoplifted in <em>Robinson </em>in that they did not have tags affixed to them by the retailer displaying their prices, the stolen items of merchandise recovered from Twine and his accomplice in this case did have individual bar codes on them that, when scanned at a cash register at the store from which they were stolen, revealed their purchase prices. Indeed, the scan of the shoplifted items produced a receipt, which summarized the prices charged by Food Lion for the merchandise that was stolen. It is common knowledge that many grocery and other stores now regularly use the bar codes that appear on the packaging of most consumer goods to identify the prices charged by the store for those goods at the time of purchase. Under such a system, the price of an item is typically displayed on the shelf directly above or below that item in the store rather than on the item itself. When a customer elects to purchase the item, the bar code imprinted on or attached to the item is scanned at a cash register. Reading the bar code and accessing the electronic data associated with that bar code, the register rings up the product, displays its name and purchase price, and prints that information on a cash register receipt. When all of the items being purchased have been scanned, the register displays the sum of their prices and prints that amount on the receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Because, when scanned, they disclose to the cashier and the customer the current pricing information for the items being purchased, the bar codes on products are, as the cashier from Food Lion explained, \u201cthe price tags\u201d for those items. The bar codes by themselves, however, are not readily decipherable by a judge or jury in a grand larceny prosecution. It is the receipt generated by scanning the bar codes at a cash register that summarizes the purchase prices of the items in a form that is comprehensible to the fact finder at trial. Plainly, such a receipt is no less inherently trustworthy and reliable than the testimonial valuation summaries admitted into evidence in Robinson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, in <em>Robinson, </em>the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>recognized that the amount listed on a price tag affixed to an item by the retailer may not accurately reflect the price the customer will pay for that item because, during a sale, a store may \u201ccomputet ] the reduced price <em>at the cash register </em>rather than marking the change on the price tag.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 516 S.E.2d at 479 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the price tag exception to the hearsay rule in shoplifting cases recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>permits the admission into evidence of a cash register receipt generated by scanning the bar codes on the stolen items of merchandise \u201cor, in substitution, testimony concerning the amounts shown on such [a receipt] when ... there is no objection to such testimony on best evidence grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhile such evidence, when admitted, would suffice to make out a prima facie case of an item\u2019s value, the accused would retain full opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses and to present rebutting evidence on the issue of value.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Twine further argues that, even if <em>Robinson </em>were found to apply to the present case, the cash register receipt may not be properly admitted into evidence under the circumstances of this case because he \u201cmade an objection on best evidence grounds to testimony concerning the amount on the price tags.\u201d As Twine correctly points out, the exception to the hearsay rule recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Robinson </em>permits \u201cthe admission into evidence of price tags regularly affixed to items of personalty offered for sale or, in substitution, testimony concerning the amounts shown on such tags <em>when ... there is no objection to such testimony on best evidence </em>grounds.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Twine, however, misreads the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Robinson </em>and mischaracterizes his objection. The reference in <em>Robinson </em>to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>\u201cobjection to such testimony on best evidence grounds\u201d plainly encompasses only properly sustainable best evidence objections and speaks not to the admissibility of the written price tags themselves but to the admissibility of <em>testimonial </em>evidence \u201cconcerning the amounts shown on such tags.\u201d <em>See generally Bradshaw v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 374, 379, 429 S.E.2d 881, 884 (1993) (\u201cIn Virginia, the best evidence rule provides that \u2018where the contents of a writing are desired to be proved, the writing ... itself must be produced or its absence sufficiently accounted for before other evidence of its contents can be admitted.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 883, 889, 134 S.E. 544, 546 (1926))).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In this case, Twine objected on best evidence grounds solely to the admission of the written cash register receipt, not, as he states on appeal, \u201cto testimony concerning the amount on the price tags.\u201d Indeed, as Twine notes in his appellate brief, there was no testimony presented at trial establishing the value of the stolen merchandise. Instead, the Commonwealth relied solely on the written cash register receipt. Moreover, Twine\u2019s best evidence objection to the receipt was properly overruled by the trial court. Twine argued at trial that the seventy-five items of stolen merchandise needed to be admitted into evidence to establish their value. However, the stolen items had no pricing information on them except for their bar codes. The items themselves, therefore, would have been meaningless to the fact finder at trial, without a printout of the prices generated by scanning the bar codes on the products at a register. Thus, the register receipt, which listed the actual purchase price of each of the items shoplifted from Food Lion by Twine and his accomplice, constituted the best evidence of the stolen merchandise\u2019s retail value.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We hold, therefore, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the cash register receipt into evidence under the price tag exception to the hearsay rule recognized in <em>Robinson. </em>Because the receipt was properly admitted and established that the value of the merchandise stolen by Twine and his accomplice was $693.29 and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Twine offered no evidence at trial to refute the prices of the stolen items listed on the receipt, we further hold the evidence was sufficient to sustain Twine\u2019s conviction for grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and Twine\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b277-9\">. Despite acknowledging that the \"trial judge sustained [his] objection to admission of the [register receipt] under the business records exception to the hearsay rule,\u201d Twine also devotes a substantial portion of his appellate brief to a discussion of the applicability of that exception in this case. Given the trial court\u2019s sustainment of Twine\u2019s objection under the business records exception and our resolution of this case, we need not address the business records exception in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">. Although the trial court did not articulate the specific basis for its decision to admit the register receipt into evidence, it is clear from the record that the trial court admitted the receipt under the price tag exception set forth in <em>Robinson. </em>When the prosecutor first offered the receipt for admission into evidence, she suggested it was admissible under the business records exception. After discussion and further <em>voir dire </em>of Vance, the trial court sustained Twine\u2019s objection to admission under that exception. The prosecutor subsequently suggested the receipt was admissible under <em>Robinson, </em>\"where the value of the items stolen was established by the testimony of the employees concerning the prices of the items.\u201d The trial court agreed that <em>Robinson </em>had \"to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>with ... proving the value [of the stolen items] and not [the] business records exception.\u201d Twine\u2019s counsel then argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">Judge, I would object to [the admission into evidence of the cash register receipt]. It's not the best evidence of the items themselves. There\u2019s not a price tag exception in this case, and so the items I think need to be here in order for the\u2014in evidence themselves, and not simply a cash register receipt of items. I don\u2019t think that falls under the price tag exception, so I would object to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Disagreeing with defense counsel and stating that \"[a witness from Food Lion] by use of this [cash register receipt] says she saw each of these items being scanned,\u201d the trial court admitted the receipt into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">. As previously mentioned, the only evidence presented in <em>Robinson </em>concerning the value of the stolen coats came from two store employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>ees. One employee testified \"the value of the coats totaled $499.97\u201d and \"he knew what the value was because 'that's what it is on the price tags.' \" The other employee testified the coats \"were valued at $499.97 and that she knew the value from the 'tickets [that] were attached to the [coats].\u2019 \u201d 258 Va. at 6, 516 S.E.2d at 476.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
