HALEY, JR., Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">James and Gloria Brandt (appellants) appeal a circuit court decision upholding a ruling of the Virginia Motor Vehicle Dealer Board (the Board) that limited their recovery from the Virginia Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund (the Fund) to $20,000. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Introduction and Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-1527.1 through 46.2-1527.8, entitled \u201cthe Motor Vehicle Transaction Recovery Fund,\u201d state in part as here relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">\u00a7 46.2-1527.3. Recovery from Fund, generally.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, whenever any person is awarded a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth for (i) any loss or damage in connection with the purchase or lease of a motor vehicle by reason of any fraud practiced on him or fraudulent representation made to him by a licensed or registered motor vehicle dealer ..., the judgment creditor may file a verified claim with the Board requesting payment from the Fund of the amount unpaid on the judgment____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u00a7 46.2-1527.5. Limitations on recovery from Fund.\u2014 The maximum claim of one judgment creditor against the Fund based on an unpaid final judgment arising out of any loss or damage by reason of a claim submitted under \u00a7 46.2-1527.2 or \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 involving a single transaction, shall be limited to $20,000, regardless of the amount of the unpaid final judgment of one judgment creditor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">The aggregate of claims against the Fund based on unpaid final judgments arising out of any loss or damage by reason of a claim submitted under \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 involving more than one transaction shall be limited to $100,000, regardless of the total amounts of the unpaid final judgments of judgment creditors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">However, aggregate claims against the Fund under \u00a7 46.2-1527.2 shall be limited to $75,000 and then only after the dealer\u2019s $25,000 bond has been exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">On June 22, 2004, as the result of a trial involving a single fraudulent transaction, one covered by the Fund, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia \u201cORDERED that <em>Judgment </em>is hereby entered for plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>James and Gloria Brandt, </em>and against defendant, Maha Lakshmi Motors ... and damages are awarded in the amount of $84,000.... \u201d (Emphasis added). Their award was $84,000 in compensatory damages and $289,125 in punitive damages against Celebration Chevrolet, $17,500 in compensatory damages against Nations Auto Loan Center, and $63,906.56 in attorneys\u2019 fees. This award resulted, in part, from proof of fraud during appellants\u2019 purchase of a 1993 Toyota Camry.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Appellants received $25,000 in compensation from Celebration Chevrolet\u2019s surety and $17,500 from Nations Auto Loan Center\u2019s surety<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (constituting complete compensation as to the latter). As a consequence, the unsatisfied portion of the compensatory award against Celebration Chevrolet is $59,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In February 2005, appellants submitted a claim to the Board pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 for $40,000 from the Fund, constituting $20,000 for each of them. The Board, which administers the Fund, authorized only $20,000 in recovery for appellants jointly. Appellants appealed the Board\u2019s ruling to the circuit court under the Administrative Process Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-4026. By letter opinion dated November 28, 2005, the circuit court concluded that appellants constituted one judgment creditor entitled to only one recovery of $20,000 from the Fund. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The question here for resolution, then, is whether, for purposes of recovery from the Fund, appellants are entitled to one recovery, or two separate recoveries. Applying the principles of statutory construction, we hold that they are entitled to one recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">We note that \u201cwhen, as here, the question involves a statutory interpretation issue, \u2018little deference is required to be accorded the agency decision\u2019 because the issue falls outside the agency\u2019s specialized competence.\u201d <em>Sims Wholesale Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996) (quoting <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 246, 369 S.E.2d 1, 9 (1988)). \u201cPure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, review the decision of the circuit court <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Appellants contend the circuit court erred in ruling that Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.5 limits them to one recovery of $20,000 from the Fund. Their contention is that each judgment creditor is entitled to a claim for $20,000 and that they each constitute a separate judgment creditor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.5 establishes two different limits on claims against the Fund. The first portion of the statute limits the \u201cclaim of one judgment creditor ... involving a single transaction\u201d to $20,000, and the second portion limits \u201c[t]he aggregate of claims ... involving more than one transaction\u201d to $100,000 (with the Fund\u2019s payout limited to $75,000 after exhausting the dealer\u2019s bond). In interpreting a statute, \u201c[w]e must take the statute as we find it, gather the legislative intent from the words used and give effect to the purposes thus ascertained.\u201d <em>Van Geuder v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 548, 554, 65 S.E.2d 565, 568 (1951). The purpose of the limitations set forth in Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.5 is clear from the statutory language: to provide a maximum recovery of $20,000 for one transaction and limit the total payout of the Fund for all claims against one dealer to $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Appellants\u2019 proposed reading of the statute goes directly against the statutory purpose and fails to give effect to all the words of the statute. Under their interpretation, the Fund\u2019s payout would be defined by the number of parties involved in a single transaction rather than by the number of judgments and transactions involved. Appellants\u2019 reading emphasizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>only one element <em>of </em>the statutory scheme and effectively ignores and discounts the other material elements that limit the intended recovery from the Fund. Specifically, appellants\u2019 reading fails to acknowledge there is only one judgment in this case and only one transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Such a reading is inconsistent with basic principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cA statute is not to be construed by singling out a particular phrase; every part is presumed to have some effect and is not to be disregarded unless absolutely necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998). When interpreting a statute, we must give every word some meaning where possible. <em>McLean Bank v. Nelson, </em>232 Va. 420, 427, 350 S.E.2d 651, 656 (1986). To that end, we must evaluate each word within \u201cthe entire phrase of which it is a part.\u201d <em>Kohlberg v. Va. Real Estate Comm., </em>212 Va. 237, 239, 183 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Appellants in this case purchased one car together in a single transaction and obtained a judgment together in the lawsuit. As parties involved in a single transaction who were awarded one judgment, they constitute one judgment creditor under Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.5 and are limited to a single recovery of $20,000 from the Fund. As the statute makes plain, in order to be awarded multiple recoveries from the Fund, there must be \u201cmore than one transaction,\u201d and more than one judgment. The decision of the circuit court, therefore, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\">. As a condition of obtaining a license, each dealer is required to post a surety bond in the amount of $25,000 for covered transactions. As a result of these bonds, appellants have already collected $42,500 on their judgment from a car they purchased for $7,008.17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\">. Attorneys\u2019 fees are also recoverable from the Fund, subject to the statutory limitation on an award. <em>See Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd. v. Morgan, </em>38 Va.App. 665, 568 S.E.2d 378 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
