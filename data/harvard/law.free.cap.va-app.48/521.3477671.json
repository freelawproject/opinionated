On appeal, Smith argues that the trial court abused its discretion by (i) allowing the jury to view the crime scene, (ii) denying his motion for a mistrial, and (in) refusing to vacate the jury\u2019s sentencing verdicts after he attempted suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Disagreeing with each of these assertions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">One evening in March 2003, Smith sold crack cocaine to John Johnson and two of Johnson\u2019s neighbors, Linda and Graham Zimmerman. Smith had sold crack to the same group earlier that evening. Believing the second batch to be of poor quality, Graham Zimmerman called Smith and demanded his money back. Smith came back to Zimmerman\u2019s apartment, but refused to give Graham a refund. After a brief fight, Smith threw down the money and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Just after Smith left, Graham Zimmerman went through the house turning off the lights and closing the curtains. While Graham and Linda were looking out the \u201cside of the bedroom window,\u201d Graham told her to \u201cgo call the police.\u201d As Linda turned to step out of the bedroom, she \u201cheard a round of gunfire go off\u2019 and then saw Graham \u201chit the floor.\u201d He was later pronounced dead from a fatal gunshot wound to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Smith confessed to the shooting, telling police Graham Zimmerman attacked him with a knife during the fight over the second batch of drugs. Smith said he fired several shots from a parked car outside Zimmerman\u2019s apartment in an effort to \u201cscare\u201d him. Smith said he hoped he \u201chit him,\u201d but did not believe he actually did. Smith went to his parents\u2019 house later that night and told them he had shot someone. The next day, Smith threw the gun into a pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Prior to trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion requesting that the jury be allowed to view the crime scene. There would be no dispute at trial whether Smith shot into the dwelling, the Commonwealth explained. But the layout of the apartment complex, the location of Smith and Graham during the incident, and the distance between the two would be central issues. The view, the Commonwealth contended, was \u201cnecessary to explain and clarify the evidence regarding the placement of the defendant, victim, and others before, during, and after\u201d the shooting. Smith objected to the view. Because lighting was \u201ca crucial factor in the case,\u201d Smith argued, a view during the daylight hours \u201cwould be misleading.\u201d The trial judge deferred his ruling on the motion until he heard further evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth renewed its motion for a jury view after presenting its case. Smith objected, insisting that the photographs and measurements provided the jury with a sufficient understanding of the crime scene. The trial judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, holding that it would aid the jury in evaluating the evidence and would not prejudice Smith. Before leaving for the crime scene, however, the judge ensured that the jurors could \u201cappreciate the fact that we are not going to this area at night so the lighting conditions would otherwise change by going there in daylight versus going there at nighttime.\u201d Each juror was given an aerial photograph of the area that previously had been admitted into evidence. While there, the judge explained, the jurors could walk around the crime scene for a few moments. But they could not speak to each other or go inside the apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The bailiffs escorted the jury to the crime scene in one van while the judge, attorneys, court reporter, and Smith traveled there in another van. It was raining when the jury arrived at about 10:04 a.m. Less then ten minutes later, the view ended and everyone returned to the courthouse. Back in the courtroom, the Commonwealth rested its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Smith called his girlfriend, Joanna Howland, as a witness. She testified that she drove Smith to the apartment complex and witnessed him hang out of the car window and fire several shots at Graham Zimmerman\u2019s apartment. When she drove away, Smith told her that \u201che hoped that he hit him.\u201d Smith later received two phone calls from someone informing him that \u201cthe man was dead.\u201d Smith \u201cwas crying and very upset,\u201d Howland testified, because \u201che didn\u2019t mean to hurt him, he was just trying to scare him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">On cross-examination, the Commonwealth asked Howland if she had received any correspondence from Smith about the matter. Howland said she had received several letters from Smith while he was in jail. In these letters, she testified, Smith told her not to testify against him. After this line of questioning, Smith moved for a mistrial. These letters, he argued, should have been turned over by the Commonwealth during pretrial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The trial judge denied the mistrial motion, but agreed to \u201cinstruct the jury to disregard the testimony with respect to any letters that may have been written.\u201d Smith responded that \u201cthe only fair thing to do\u201d would be for the court to \u201cpreclude her, to strike her testimony in its entirety.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d the judge responded, \u201cif that\u2019s what you want.\u201d When the jury returned, the judge directed them \u201cto totally disregard any testimony\u201d given by Howland in the case. \u201cCan all of you abide by that instruction, put her testimony to one side, disregard it?\u201d the judge asked. He then confirmed the jurors, by nodding their heads, agreed they could disregard the stricken testimony \u201cin its entirety as if it never occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, Smith pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Questioning Smith thoroughly, the trial court found the plea voluntarily and intelligently made. The court then submitted the remaining charges to the jury. After about two hours, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges. The court proceeded to the sentencing phase and submitted the case back to the jury. An horn\u2019 later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>jury informed the court that it had reached its sentencing verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The bailiffs went to the holding cell to retrieve Smith and found that he had attempted to hang himself. After the court was informed of the situation, the following colloquy took place between Smith\u2019s counsel and the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Smith\u2019s Counsel: I believe that I would not be doing my job for Mr. Smith if I did not raise obviously the question of his mental status at this time. I bring that to the Court\u2019s attention. I don\u2019t know\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">Court: We are going to have Mr. Smith brought out at this time. <em>We\u2019re going to go ahead and finish the jury trial </em>and I\u2019m going to take some action in this case this afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">Smith\u2019s Counsel: Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The bailiffs then brought Smith into the courtroom. His counsel asked for \u201ca moment to spend with Mr. Smith\u201d before the jury returned. The court agreed. Shortly thereafter, the jury reentered the courtroom, announced their sentencing verdicts, and departed after a few brief remarks by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Two months later, Smith filed a motion seeking to vacate the jury sentencing verdicts. Smith argued that the trial court should not have permitted the jury to deliver the sentencing verdicts. Instead, counsel contended, the court should have immediately stopped the proceedings and ordered a competency evaluation of Smith. Although the \u201conly thing that took place was the jury verdict being heard, and certainly he understands what that jury verdict was at this point in time,\u201d counsel argued, \u201cwe don\u2019t know ... what he was able to comprehend prior to his attempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Later, at Smith\u2019s request, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation prior to scheduling a final hearing to review the jury\u2019s sentencing recommendations. The psychiatrist who evaluated Smith found him fully \u201ccompetent to be sentenced\u201d and noted that his brief hospitalization was \u201centirely uneventful.\u201d Smith\u2019s dangerous behavior, the psychiatrist explained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>was not \u201cthe product of mental illness but instead is the product of his volition.\u201d Better characterized as \u201cmanipulative violence,\u201d Smith\u2019s behavior made him a candidate for \u201cprotective\u201d incarceration prior to the final sentencing hearing. \u201cIt is likely he will continue to choose to engage in such behavior,\u201d the psychiatrist concluded, \u201cin an effort to avoid proceeding to sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">After reviewing the competency evaluation, the trial court denied the motion to vacate and entered the final sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">A. <em>Daytime Jury View\u2014Nighttime Crime</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">We begin with Smith\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a jury view of the crime scene. This view, Smith argues, added no probative value to the factfinding process and only served to prejudice his defense. We disagree. Code \u00a7 19.2-264.1 provides that a jury \u201cin any criminal case may, at the request of the attorney for the Commonwealth or any defendant, be taken to view the premises or place in question, or any property, matter or thing relating to the case, when it shall appear to the Court that such view is necessary to a just decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">This statute was \u201cdoubtless taken,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court has observed, from an Act of Parliament during the reign of King George IV. <em>Litton v. Commonwealth, </em>101 Va. 833, 845-47, 44 S.E. 923, 926-27 (1903) (finding the Virginia statute \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as 6 Geo. 4, c. 50, \u00a7 23). That Act eliminated the common law requirement that the accused consent to the view and authorized nonconsensual views whenever necessary and proper to enhance the jurors\u2019 \u201cbetter understanding\u201d of the evidence, <em>id. </em>at 846, 44 S.E. at 926, and to improve their ability to \u201capply the testimony\u201d offered at trial, <em>Kearns v. Hall, </em>197 Va. 736, 741, 91 S.E.2d 648, 651 (1956). <em>See also Culpepper v. Neff, </em>204 Va. 800, 806, 134 S.E.2d 315, 319-20 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The decision to grant or deny such a request \u201clies within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Quesinberry v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 378, 402 S.E.2d 218, 227 (1991); <em>see also Tross v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 362, 383, 464 S.E.2d 523, 533 (1995). When dealing with discretionary decisions on appeal, only \u201cwhen reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>Hernandez-Guerrero v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 366, 370, 617 S.E.2d 410, 412 (2005) (citation omitted). That cannot be said here.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The view helped the jury understand the layout of the apartment complex, the location of the window and the parking lot, and how \u201cthese factors related to the crimes.\u201d <em>See Quesinberry, </em>241 Va. at 379, 402 S.E.2d at 227. True, the crime occurred at night and the view during the day. But such an obvious difference, capable of being appreciated by any ordinary juror, is not the kind of dissimilarity that could mislead the jurors or cause them to ignore the evidence offered at trial. The aerial photograph, after all, was taken during daylight (not nighttime) hours. And Smith, unaware of the irony, concedes the photographs admitted into evidence \u201cprovided the jury with a fair and accurate depiction of the building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In any event, exercising commendable caution, the trial judge reminded the jurors the shooting took place at night and confirmed they could keep that in mind during the view. Like the trial judge, we think it entirely fair to assume that the jurors understood and conscientiously obeyed the admonition. We thus reject Smith\u2019s argument that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing the jury to view the crime scene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>B. <em>Motion for a Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Smith next argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a mistrial after Joanna Howland testified on cross-examination that she received letters from Smith telling her not to testify against him. Claiming that the Commonwealth should have disclosed these letters before trial, Smith contends that nothing short of a mistrial could have adequately remedied the discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We need not decide whether the Commonwealth violated its discovery obligations. Even if it did, the trial court\u2019s response to the problem amply protected Smith\u2019s right to a fair trial. The trial court, at Smith\u2019s request, struck Howland\u2019s entire testimony and instructed the jury to not consider any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">As a general rule, criminal judgments will not be reversed for \u201cthe improper admission of evidence that a court subsequently directs a jury to disregard because juries are presumed to follow prompt, explicit, and curative instructions.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 396, 418, 593 S.E.2d 270, 284 (2004) (citation omitted); <em>see Muhammad v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 451, 524, 619 S.E.2d 16, 58 (2005) (\u201cA jury is presumed to have followed the instructions of the trial court.\u201d); <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 750, 595 S.E.2d 9, 14 (2004). \u2018Whether improper evidence is so prejudicial as to require a mistrial is a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court in each particular case,\u201d <em>Elliott, </em>267 Va. at 418, 593 S.E.2d at 284, subject to the most deferential standard of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Because the record reveals to us no reason to doubt the efficacy of the trial judge\u2019s curative instruction in this case, we reject Smith\u2019s argument that only a mistrial could have remedied the claimed discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>C. <em>Motion to Vacate Sentencing Verdicts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Finally, Smith argues that the trial court erred in refusing to vacate the jury sentencing verdicts because his \u201ccompetency to stand trial during the sentencing phase of the trial was unknown.\u201d We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The historic \u201cprohibition against trying the incompetent defendant was well established by the time Hale and Blackstone wrote their famous commentaries.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Oklahoma, </em>517 U.S. 348, 356, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 1378, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 (1996); <em>see also Godinez v. Moran, </em>509 U.S. 389, 400 n. 11, 113 S.Ct. 2680, 2687 n. 11, 125 L.Ed.2d 321 (1993). Core due process principles forbid it. <em>Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 904, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975). Absent evidence to the contrary, however, courts presume the competency of an accused to stand trial. The burden of proof rests on the accused (or someone acting on his behalf) to show he \u201clacks substantial capacity to understand the criminal proceedings\u201d or is \u201cincapable of assisting counsel\u201d in his defense. <em>Orndorff v. Commonwealth, </em>271 Va. 486, 499-500, 628 S.E.2d 344, 351 (2006). A trial court\u2019s competency determination presents a \u201cquestion of fact that will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 628 S.E.2d at 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Mental illness does not necessarily render a defendant incompetent to stand trial. As the Fourth Circuit has explained, \u201cneither low intelligence, mental deficiency, nor bizarre, volatile, and irrational behavior can be equated with mental incompetence to stand trial.\u201d <em>Walton v. Angelone, </em>321 F.3d 442, 460 (4th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Even a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, like delusional paranoia, does not automatically make a defendant incompetent to stand trial. <em>Bramblett v. Commonwealth, </em>257 Va. 263, 273, 513 S.E.2d 400, 407 (1999). Whatever his <em>mental </em>state, a defendant remains competent so long as he has a substantial capacity to understand the criminal proceedings and to assist counsel in his defense. <em>Orndorff, </em>271 Va. at 499-500, 628 S.E.2d at 351-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>In this case, Smith does not contest his competency to proceed through the guilt phase of his trial. He questions only his competency during the last, few moments of the sentencing phase. After his failed suicide attempt, Smith reasons, the trial court should have \u201cimmediately recessed the proceedings\u201d and ordered a mental health evaluation prior to receiving the jury\u2019s sentencing verdicts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For a number of reasons, we reject this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">To begin with, Smith never once requested either a recess or a mental health evaluation at any point during the jury trial. Instead, Smith\u2019s counsel merely alerted the trial judge to the obvious: that Smith\u2019s suicide attempt raised a \u201cquestion\u201d about his mental status. When the trial judge stated he intended to address the issue after excusing the jury, Smith\u2019s counsel said simply, \u201cthank you.\u201d Counsel then asked for, and received, a \u201cmoment to spend\u201d with Smith before the jury returned to the courtroom. After consulting with Smith, counsel said nothing further on the subject\u2014a telling omission from the perspective of a trial judge justifiably reluctant to act <em>sua sponte </em>and thereby risk overriding defense counsel\u2019s tactical decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Even so, Smith argues, the trial court had its own duty to stop the proceedings and order an evaluation without being asked to do either. We agree that a trial court must be alert to circumstances suggesting that a defendant \u201ccompetent at the commencement of his trial\u201d has somehow later become \u201cunable to meet the standards of competence to stand trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. at 181, 95 S.Ct. at 908.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a trial court should make itself aware of any \u201chistory of irrational behavior,\u201d the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor at and prior to sentencing,\u201d and any \u201cprior medical opinions on competency.\u201d <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 397 (4th Cir.2002). But we do not agree that a suicide attempt, <em>without more, </em>mandates an immediate cessation of trial proceedings so that a mental evaluation can be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Though something the trial court should consider, <em>United States v. Mason, </em>52 F.3d 1286, 1290 (4th Cir.1995), a suicide attempt by itself does not necessarily require an immediate competency evaluation, <em>United States v. Davis, </em>61 F.3d 291, 304 (5th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, a suicide attempt does not unequivocally \u201cdemonstrate a failure to understand and appreciate the nature of the proceedings,\u201d but may actually be a \u201cquite lucid\u201d\u2014albeit tragic\u2014\u201creaction to a very chilling situation.\u201d <em>Sanchez v. Gilmore, </em>189 F.3d 619, 623 (7th Cir.1999) (finding defendant\u2019s attempted suicide did not require the trial court to immediately order a competency evaluation); <em>State v. Amaya-Ruiz, </em>166 Ariz. 152, 800 P.2d 1260, 1271 (1990) (holding that a suicide attempt, by itself, does not automatically require a competency hearing).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Here, no pretrial evaluations found Smith incompetent to stand trial or likely to become incompetent during trial. The trial lasted four days. The trial judge observed no outbursts or displays of irrational behavior by Smith. On the last day of the trial, Smith entered a guilty plea to the charge alleging a conspiracy to distribute cocaine. At that time, the trial judge conducted an extensive colloquy with Smith concerning the voluntariness and intelligence of his guilty plea. Smith\u2019s answers were clear and responsive. Nothing suggested Smith\u2019s lucidity had in any way deteriorated or, even less likely, that he was at risk of becoming mentally incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">A few hours later Smith returned to the courtroom after his suicide attempt. Neither the trial judge nor defense counsel noted on the record anything unusual about Smith\u2019s countenance or demeanor. Counsel asked for and received a moment to consult with Smith, no doubt in an effort to make her own assessment of his ability to understand what little bit remained of the sentencing proceeding and to assist her to the extent there was anything left to be done in his defense. After speaking directly with Smith, counsel made no request for an immediate cessation of the trial so that a competency evaluation could be performed. Nor did she report to the trial judge any further concerns about Smith\u2019s condition. Faced with these circumstances, the trial judge reasonably decided not to <em>sua sponte </em>stop the proceedings (moments before it would' end anyway) so a competency evaluation could be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Smith claims our reasoning puts too much emphasis on his counsel\u2019s actions rather than his own. We think the emphasis is entirely fair. Whether the precipitating event is a suicide attempt or some other anomalous event, a trial judge\u2019s first instinct should be to determine if defense counsel appears to be aware of the potential problem. Counsel is \u201cobviously in a superior position\u201d to evaluate a client\u2019s ability to understand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the proceedings. <em>United States v. Caicedo, </em>937 F.2d 1227, 1233 (7th Cir.1991) (citation omitted). It naturally follows that counsel\u2019s decision not to demand that the trial stop and the defendant be immediately evaluated can be considered \u201cprobative of whether <em>bona fide </em>doubt\u201d exists as to the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. <em>Id.; State v. Harris, </em>181 N.J. 391, 859 A.2d 364, 403-04 (2004) (finding counsel is \u201cin a far better position than the trial judge to assay the salient facts\u201d concerning a defendant\u2019s competency (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Though performed months later, the competency evaluation of Smith supports the trial judge\u2019s decision. The psychiatrist found Smith fully \u201ccompetent to be sentenced\u201d and said his brief hospitalization was \u201centirely uneventful\u201d from a psychiatric point of view. Smith\u2019s dangerous behavior, the psychiatrist explained, was not \u201cthe product of mental illness but instead is the product of his volition.\u201d In short, the psychiatrist opined, Smith\u2019s behavior (characterized as a form of \u201cmanipulative violence\u201d) would likely continue \u201cin an effort to avoid proceeding to sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Under the unique circumstances of this case, we hold the trial court did not err in refusing to vacate the jury\u2019s sentencing verdicts and in entering a final judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Because the trial court acted within its discretion in granting a jury view, denying Smith\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and refusing to vacate the jury sentencing verdicts, we affirm Smith\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">. On appeal, Smith argues that a jury view was also improper due to window drapes present at the time of the shooting, but absent at the time of the view. Smith did not make this argument at trial, however, and cannot do so for the first time on appeal. Under Rule 5A:18, the \"same argument must have been raised, with specificity, at trial before it can be considered on appeal.\u201d <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>311, 324, 591 S.E.2d 712, 719 (2004); <em>see also Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 325, 601 S.E.2d 555, 571 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. On appeal. Smith's question presented asserts only that his \"competency to stand trial during the sentencing phase of the trial was <em>unknown.\" </em>Appellant's Br. at 15 (emphasis added). This argument presents a \"procedural competency claim,\u201d which must be distinguished from a \"substantive competency claim\" alleging that the defendant \"was, in fact, tried and convicted while mentally incompetent.\" <em>Walton, </em>321 F.3d at 459-60; <em>see also United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 396 (4th Cir.2002). A few sentences in Smith\u2019s appellate brief, however, appear to go beyond the question presented and affirmatively assert his incompetence. Having carefully reviewed the record, we find no evidentiary support for this assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b582-6\">. Given our ruling, we need not decide whether waiver principles can ever be applied to competency claims on direct appeal\u2014thereby vitiating any <em>sua sponte </em>duty of the trial court to order a competency evaluation without being asked to do so. <em>Cf. Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 384, 86 S.Ct. 836, 841, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966) (stating in <em>dicta </em>that \"it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet knowingly or intelligently \u2018waive\u2019 his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial\u201d), <em>with Burket v. Angelone, </em>208 F.3d 172, 191 (4th Cir.2000) (noting that the Virginia Supreme Court, in a state habeas order, <em>held </em>an incompetency claim asserting a <em>sua sponte </em>duty to order an evaluation was procedurally defaulted by not being raised in the trial court and on direct appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">. <em>See also United States v. Messervey, </em>317 F.3d 457, 463 (5th Cir.2002) (explaining that <em>Davis </em>held \"a suicide attempt during the course of trial, without a previous history of irrational behavior or a medical opinion suggesting incompetence, was insufficiently manifest to make the trial court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>order a mental competency exam an abuse of discretion\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b582-8\">. Asserting only a constitutional due process challenge, Smith does not contend on appeal that the trial court violated Code \u00a7 19.2-169.1 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>that any evaluation pursuant to that statute was either requested or performed. We thus express no opinion on the subject.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
