The Commonwealth charged Thomas with \u201cwillfully\u201d failing to appear in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B). At his failure-to-appear jury trial, Thomas unsuccessfully moved to strike the evidence on the ground that the evidence failed to show that the general district court informed him of the prehminary hearing date. The unique circumstances of this case compel us to agree with Thomas and to reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">On the felony failure-to-appear charge, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence came from the deputy sheriff who arrested Thomas and from a handwritten notation on the arrest warrant. The deputy testified that he and Thomas appeared in general district court on January 23, 2004. The deputy recalled seeing Thomas there, but did not \u201cpersonally recall\u201d whether Thomas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201chad to go in front of the judge\u201d\u2014qualifying his earlier statement that he was \u201csure\u201d Thomas must have done so. The deputy also recalled speaking with Thomas and being told he wanted to hire \u201cGene Gunter.\u201d The deputy, however, could not recall \u201cwhy the case was continued\u201d or whether the continuance was requested by Thomas or the Commonwealth. The deputy admitted he was not certain the continued date was \u201cgiven in open court.\u201d He simply assumed that, just as he had learned about the continued hearing date, so too Thomas must have known about it. The deputy also conceded he had no \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d of \u201cwho the judge was\u201d or \u201cwho the clerk was that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The arrest warrant from the general district court\u2019s file contains a handwritten notation stating: \u201cDef. states that this is his atty. We have con\u2019t this to 2-24-04. atty is sending a letter.\u201d The notation is initialed and dated \u201c1-23-04.\u201d A hand drawn arrow points from this notation to an adjacent box on the form bearing the heading \u201cAttorney for the Accused.\u201d In that box appears the crossed-out name \u201cEugene Guner\u201d (presumably referring to Gene Gunter) and a set of initials, which also had been crossed out. No testimony established when, by whom, or for what reason these notations were made. The record similarly says nothing about whether Thomas actually retained Gunter as counsel, whether counsel sent a letter confirming his availability for the February 24 date, or why counsel\u2019s name was crossed out on the arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Thomas moved to strike the evidence, arguing that it failed to demonstrate he had ever been told of the continued hearing date. The trial judge denied the motion, holding that \u201cthe court can take cognizance of a standard procedure, that the standard procedure was followed.\u201d The \u201cstandard procedure\u201d in the general district court, the trial judge stated, was to call cases from the docket, continue them in the event the accused had not retained counsel, direct the accused to instruct counsel to write a letter of representation to the court, and, most importantly, notify the accused of the date he must reappear in court. Not doing such things in \u201copen court,\u201d the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>judge found, would be \u201ccontrary\u201d to the standard procedure of the general district court. On this ground, the trial judge found it unlikely the general district court would write the continued hearing date (February 24) on the arrest warrant \u201cwithout ever telling Mr. Thomas what they were doing.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think District Court behaves in that fashion,\u201d the trial judge concluded. \u201cThat\u2019s not consistent with this court\u2019s experience in that regard----\u201d The trial judge made clear he was denying the motion to strike \u201cbased upon this court\u2019s understanding of District Court procedure,\u201d which he found to be consistent with the notations on the arrest warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Thomas rested his case without presenting any evidence. The trial judge instructed the jury that it could find Thomas guilty of willfully failing to appear only if he \u201creceived timely notice of when and where to appear for a hearing\u201d and thereafter did not \u201cappear on the date or place specified\u201d by the court. The trial judge, however, did not give any instructions to the jury concerning the facts he judicially noticed when denying the motion to strike. The jury returned a guilty verdict, upon which the trial judge entered the final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">We review lower court factfinding with the highest degree of appellate deference. We do not ask whether we, as appellate judges, believe \u201cthe evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Stevens v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 234, 249, 616 S.E.2d 754, 761 (2005) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted). We ask only whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements \"of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This deferential standard applies not only to basic facts, but also to any resulting inferences so long as they do not push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur.\u201d Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 665, 588 S.E.2d 384, 388 (2003). An inference loses its rationality only when it becomes so attenuated as to appear to stand alone, deriving none of its probative strength from the proven basic facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>In this case, Thomas could be found guilty of violating Code \u00a7 19.2-128 only if he \u201creceived timely notice\u201d of when and where he was supposed to appear for court. <em>Edmonds v. Commonwealth, </em>43 Va.App. 197, 200, 597 S.E.2d 210, 211-12 (2004) (citation omitted). When denying the motion to strike, the trial judge found\u2014outside the presence of the jury\u2014that a rational <em>prima facie </em>inference of actual notice could be derived from the \u201cstandard procedure\u201d in general district court of informing defendants in \u201copen court\u201d of when and where they must next appear. The trial judge, however, never informed the jurors of this \u201cstandard procedure.\u201d Nor did he instruct them that they could consider this information as evidence in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Except for matters within the common knowledge and experience of jurors, adjudicative facts judicially noticed by a trial judge cannot be imputed to a jury. When presiding over a jury trial, therefore, a trial judge should</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">declare to the jury any [adjudicative] facts judicially known by the court. In the absence of any such declaration the judicial knowledge in the mind of the court could not be used by the jury in arriving at its verdict. The duty of the court to declare its judicial knowledge to the jury is generally recognized.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-7\"><em>State v. Jones, </em>240 Or. 129, 400 P.2d 524, 525 (1965); <em>see also Graham v. State, </em>275 Ga. 290, 565 S.E.2d 467, 469-70 (2002) (reversing jury verdict because \u201cthe trial court in this case did not inform the jury that it had taken judicial notice\u201d of an essential fact in the case); Fed.R.Evid. 201(g) (recognizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>that, in criminal cases, the \u201ccourt shall instruct the jury\u201d of any adjudicative facts subject to judicial notice).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The failure to instruct the jurors on the \u201cstandard procedure\u201d of the general district court left them with only the testimony of the deputy sheriff and the notation on the arrest warrant. Considered separately or together, neither was sufficient to prove actual notice. The deputy sheriff admitted he did not \u201cpersonally recall\u201d whether Thomas \u201chad to go in front of the judge.\u201d The deputy assumed Thomas must have done so, but stated he did not specifically remember that happening. The arrest warrant notation proved the case had been continued to February 24, but said nothing about Thomas being informed of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Whether the general district court\u2019s \u201cstandard procedure\u201d was admissible or even a proper matter for judicial notice, we need not say. It is sufficient for our purposes merely to observe that, without that evidentiary predicate, the inference of actual notice had nothing upon which to rest\u2014leaving an essential element of the crime unproven.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Given the paucity of any evidence available to the jury, sitting as factfinder, from which a rational inference of actual notice could be drawn, we reverse Thomas\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B) for failing to appear in general district court on February 24, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b657-8\">. <em>See generally Williams v.
