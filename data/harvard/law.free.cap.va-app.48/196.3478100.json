ELDER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Marvin James Saunders (appellant) appeals from his conviction for driving after having been declared a habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357, his fourth such conviction. On appeal, he contends operating a moped does not constitute a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357 because it is neither a motor vehicle nor self-propelled machinery within the meaning of that statute. In the alternative, he contends the evidence he was operating a moped was insufficient to support his conviction because, although the statute prohibits a habitual offender from operating a motor vehicle <em>or </em>self-propelled machinery after having been forbidden to do so, his order of conviction prohibited him from operating only a motor vehicle. We hold a moped is self-propelled machinery within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-357 and that no applicable statute required appellant to be instructed he could not operate a moped or other self-propelled machinery before he could be convicted for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Thus, we affirm the challenged conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">By order entered December 12, 1995, appellant was adjudged a habitual offender. The order indicated that he was \u201cprohibited from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia for a period of ten years from the date of this order and until the privilege ... has been restored by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d Appellant was convicted in 1999, 2000, and 2002 of driving after having been declared a habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">On August 23, 2004, Officer Robert Worsham observed appellant, who was operating a moped in the City of Danville, fail to stop for a stop sign. Officer Worsham stopped appellant and issued him a summons for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Officer Worsham knew appellant was a habitual offender and later spoke to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney about wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>er appellant was permitted to operate a moped. Thereafter, appellant was indicted for \u201cunlawfully and feloniously driv[ing] self-propelled machinery or equipment on a highway\u201d while an order declaring him a habitual offender was still in effect, after having been convicted of that same offense on three prior occasions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">At trial, appellant contended the statute did not proscribe his riding a moped because, although this Court held in <em>Diggs v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 369 S.E.2d 199 (1988) (en banc), that mopeds are \u201cself-propelled machinery,\u201d the General Assembly subsequently changed the relevant definitions. He also argued that, even if a moped is self-propelled equipment, the order adjudicating him a habitual offender \u201conly ban[ned] him from operating a motor vehicle\u201d and, thus, that he could not be convicted for operating self-propelled machinery or equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The trial court rejected those arguments and convicted appellant of \u201cFourth Offense Driv[ing] After. Being Declared An Habitual Offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u201cSELF-PROPELLED MACHINERY OR EQUIPMENT\u201d UNDER CODE \u00a7 46.2-357</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Appellant was convicted for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357, which provides in relevant part that \u201cIt shall be unlawful for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>any person determined or adjudicated an habitual offender to drive any motor vehicle or self-propelled machinery or equipment on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) [hereinafter \u201cthe habitual offender statute\u201d]. Since 1981, Code \u00a7 46.2-100 has expressly excluded from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as used in all parts of Title 46.2, with the present exception of Chapter 8 thereof (Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-800 to -947), \u201cany device herein defined as a ... moped.\u201d <em>See </em>1981 Va. Acts, ch. 585. Appellant contends a moped as defined in Code \u00a7 46.2-100 also is not \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u201cIn construing statutes, courts are charged with ascertaining and giving effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v. Hill, </em>254 Va. 88, 91, 488 S.E.2d 345, 346 (1997). \u201cThat intention is initially found in the words of the statute itself, and if those words are clear and unambiguous, we do not rely on rules of statutory construction or parol evidence, unless a literal application would produce a meaningless or absurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We give the words of a statute \u201ctheir common, ordinary and accepted meaning,\u201d absent an indication by the legislature to the contrary. <em>Gen. Trading Corp. v. Motor Vehicle Dealer Bd., </em>28 Va.App. 264, 268, 503 S.E.2d 809, 811 (1998). Absent ambiguity, \u201cthe manifest intent of the legislature clearly expressed in its enactments should not be judicially thwarted under the guise of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Cregger v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 87, 90, 486 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1997). If a statute is ambiguous,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201c[l]egislative intent may ... be gleaned by consulting other statutes \u201cusing the same phraseology,\u201d <em>[Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 523, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996)], and \u201c[\u2018]statutes which relate to the same subject matter should be read, construed and applied together[,\u2019]\u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 252, 256, 450 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1994) [(quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>791 (6th ed. 1990))].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number><em>Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">In <em>Diggs, </em>6 Va.App. 300, 369 S.E.2d 199, we considered the meaning of the term \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d as it appeared in Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a), predecessor to present Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B). At that time, Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) provided in relevant part that \u2018\u201c[N]o person, resident or nonresident, whose driver\u2019s license or instruction permit or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked ... shall thereafter drive any motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment on any highway in this Commonwealth. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Diggs, </em>6 Va.App. at 301 n. 2, 369 S.E.2d at 200 n. 2 (quoting Code \u00a7 46.1-350(a) [hereinafter \u201cthe suspension statute\u201d]). We held the term \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d as used in the suspension statute was clear, had only one meaning and, therefore, was not ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cSelf-propelled\u201d is an adjective meaning \u201c[containing its own means of propulsion. . . .\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary, </em>1113 (2d College ed. 1982). Machinery refers to \u201cMachines or machine parts collectively,\u201d while a machine is \u201c[a] system, usually of rigid bodies, formed and connected to alter, transmit, and direct applied forces in a predetermined manner to accomplish a specific objective. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 302, 369 S.E.2d at 200. We further held under this definition that \u201ca moped is a \u2018self-propelled\u2019 machine.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">We hold that in the habitual offender statute, just as in the suspension statute, the term \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d is not ambiguous and includes mopeds. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357; <em>Diggs, </em>6 Va.App. at 302, 369 S.E.2d at 200. However, even if we were to conclude the term \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d is ambiguous as used in the habitual offender statute, allowing us to look to other statutes on the same subject to determine the meaning of the term in Code \u00a7 46.2-357, we would reach the same result. At the time <em>Diggs </em>was decided, the habitual offender statute provided in relevant part as follows: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Commonwealth while the order of the court prohibiting such operation remains in effect.\u201d 1980 Va. Acts, ch. 436 (codified at \u00a7 46.1-387.8).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1990, two years <em>after </em>we decided in <em>Diggs </em>that the phrase \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d as used in the suspension statute <em>included </em>mopeds, the legislature added that very same phrase, \u201cself-propelled machinery,\u201d to the habitual offender statute. <em>See </em>1990 Va. Acts, ch. 828 (codified at \u00a7 46.2-357). Pursuant to that amendment, the legislature provided \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle <em>or self-propelled machinery or equipment on the highways of </em>the Commonwealth while the order of the court prohibiting such operation remains in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Settled principles of statutory construction provide that, \u201c[w]hen new provisions are added to existing legislation by amendment, we presume that, in making such amendment, the legislature \u2018acted with full knowledge of and in reference to the existing law upon the same subject and the construction placed upon it by the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burke v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 183, 188, 510 S.E.2d 743, 745-46 (1999) (quoting <em>City of Richmond v. Sutherland, </em>114 Va. 688, 693, 77 S.E. 470, 472 (1913)); <em>see Commonwealth v. Bruhn, </em>264 Va. 597, 602, 570 S.E.2d 866, 869 (2002). Thus, here, we conclude that by inserting the term \u201cself-propelled machinery\u201d into the habitual offender statute in 1990, the legislature knowingly added mopeds to the list of machinery a habitual offender was prohibited from operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Appellant relies on the General Assembly\u2019s 1992 amendment of the suspension statute, Code \u00a7 46.2-301, providing that \u201cthe phrase \u2018motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment\u2019 shall not include mopeds.\u201d 1992 Va. Acts, ch. 273. This amendment does not support the result appellant seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u201cWhen interpreting statutory language, we must assume that the legislature chose with care the words it used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>and, where it includes specific language in one section but omits that language from another section, we presume that the exclusion of the language was intentional.\u201d <em>7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Environmental Quality, </em>39 Va.App. 377, 397, 573 S.E.2d 289, 299 (2002). In amending Code \u00a7 46.2-301 in 1992 to exclude mopeds from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment,\u201d the legislature specifically provided that the exclusion is \u201c[f]or the purposes of this section,\u201d which can only be held to mean it is limited to Code \u00a7 46.2-301, the statute proscribing driving on a suspended or revoked license. <em>See Gilmore v. Landsidle, </em>252 Va. 388, 398, 478 S.E.2d 307, 313 (1996) (\u201cThe word \u2018section\u2019 is generally defined as the smallest distinct subdivision of a legislative act. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1353.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The General Assembly has made no similar amendments to Code \u00a7 46.2-357 or to any definitional sections affecting Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Thus, we conclude the General Assembly meant what it said when, in 1990, it <em>added </em>to Code \u00a7 46.2-357 the term, \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment,\u201d already interpreted in <em>Diggs </em>to include mopeds, and then, in 1992, specifically <em>excluded </em>mopeds from the scope of this same term \u201cfor purposes of [Code \u00a7 46.2-301]\u201d only. <em>See </em>1994 Op. Atty. Gen. 78 (concluding that 1992 amendment to remove operation of mopeds from the prohibition of Code \u00a7 46.2-301, without a corresponding change in Code \u00a7 46.2-357, indicates General Assembly\u2019s intent that Code \u00a7 46.2-357 continue to prohibit a person who has been adjudged a habitual offender from operating a moped); <em>see also Browning-Ferris, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 157, 161-62, 300 S.E.2d 603, 605-06 (1983) (\u201cThe legislature is presumed to have had knowledge of the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statutes, and its failure to make corrective amendments [for a period of five years] evinces legislative acquiescence in the Attorney General\u2019s view.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Finally, we cannot conclude the legislative choice to permit those with suspended or revoked licenses to operate mopeds while preventing habitual offenders from doing so produces an incongruous result. <em>See Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995) (\u201c \u201cWhere a particular construction of a statute will result in an absurdity, some other reasonable construction which will not produce the absurdity will be found.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>180 Va. 36, 41, 21 S.E.2d 721, 723 (1942))). The General Assembly could rationally have concluded that someone with a suspended license poses a lesser threat to others on the road, and should, therefore, be allowed to operate a moped, than someone who has been adjudicated a habitual offender. <em>See United States v. Fox, </em>60 F.3d 181, 185 (4th Cir.1995) (noting purposes served by the two statutes are different in that gravamen of driving on suspended license is disobedience of court order whereas gravamen of violation of Habitual Offender Act is act of operating motor vehicle \u201cby a driver who has been formally adjudged to be a danger to others using the highway\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Thus, we hold a moped is self-propelled machinery or equipment for purposes of Code \u00a7 46.2-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Appellant argues the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because it failed to prove he operated a motor vehicle or self-propelled machinery or equipment <em>after having been forbidden to do so. </em>He correctly notes that the order declaring him a habitual offender tracked the language of the relevant code section, \u00a7 46.2-355, which has since been repealed, in that it prohibited him from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth but made no reference to his inability to operate self-propelled machinery or equipment. He argues that the absence in the order of language prohibiting him from operating self-propelled machinery or equipment is fatal to the Commonwealth\u2019s case against him. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-355, which was in effect when appellant was declared a habitual offender in 1995 but which has since been repealed, provided in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>If the court finds[, <em>inter </em>alia,] that the person is the same person named in the transcript or abstract, [and] that the person is an habitual offender ..., the court shall so find and by appropriate order direct the person not to operate a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth and to surrender to the court all licenses or permits to drive a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">1994 Va. Acts, ch. 871; <em>see </em>1999 Va. Acts, chs. 945, 987 (repealing Code \u00a7 46.2-355).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">We held in <em>Reed v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 467, 468, 424 S.E.2d 718, 718 (1992), that, based on the language of Code \u00a7 46.2-355, \u201c[a]n essential element of the offense of driving after having been declared an habitual offender [in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357] is that the operator knew at the time he operated <em>a motor vehicle </em>in Virginia that he was doing so after he had been declared an habitual offender and ordered not to drive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468, 424 S.E.2d at 718 (emphasis added). The Virginia Supreme Court subsequently approved this decision as applied to habitual offender adjudications issued when Code \u00a7 46.2-355 remained in effect, holding that \u201can \u2018incomplete\u2019 order which adjudicates a person as an habitual offender, but \u2018erroneously\u2019 fails to [actually revoke the person\u2019s license and] impose the required prohibition against that person[\u2019s] operating <em>a motor vehicle, </em>does not satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof in a subsequent trial charging that person with violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357.\u201d <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 430, 433, 434, 578 S.E.2d 758, 759, 760 (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In appellant\u2019s case, it is undisputed that the 1995 order declaring him a habitual offender also ordered that he was \u201cprohibited from operating <em>a motor vehicle </em>on the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia\u201d for a specified period of time, as required by former Code \u00a7 46.2-355. (Emphasis added). Thus, the order did not run afoul of the holdings in <em>Reed </em>and <em>Rose. </em>Further, neither Code \u00a7 46.2-355 nor any other statute ever required that an individual declared a habitual offender be informed that this status prohibited him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>from operating <em>\u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment </em>on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357 (emphasis added). As the Commonwealth argues on brief, no need existed for Code \u00a7 46.2-355 to address \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment\u201d because the purpose of Code \u00a7 46.2-355 was the revocation of a driver\u2019s license, and a driver\u2019s license was not required for operation of any self-propelled machinery or equipment that did not qualify as a motor vehicle. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-100 (defining \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d); Code \u00a7 46.2-300 (requiring driver\u2019s license for operation of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d); <em>see also Diggs, </em>6 Va.App. at 303, 369 S.E.2d at 201 (noting specific \u201cexclusion of bicycles and mopeds from the definition of \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 eliminated the requirements of registration and operators\u2019 licenses for mopeds\u201d). <em>But see </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-301(B) (although Virginia Code does not require license to operate self-propelled machinery or equipment that does not qualify as a motor vehicle, providing that one who has a driver\u2019s license and has that license suspended or revoked may not \u201cthereafter drive any motor vehicle or any self-propelled machinery or equipment[, with certain exceptions including, <em>inter alia, </em>mopeds,] on any highway\u201d until his license has been reinstated).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Thus, we hold the existence of an order notifying appellant he could not operate \u201cself-propelled machinery or equipment [i.e., a moped,] on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect\u201d was not an element of the offense of driving after having been declared a habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Accordingly, we hold the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">To the extent appellant\u2019s argument may raise due process notice issues, he did not include a due process claim in his petition for appeal, and no appeal was granted on this issue. Thus, we may not consider such a claim in this appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:12(c); <em>see also Thompson v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 620, 626, 500 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1998) (noting that Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>5A:12, unlike Rule 5A:18, contains no \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201cends of justice\u201d exceptions).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">For these reasons, we hold a moped is self-propelled machinery within the meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-357 and that no applicable statute required appellant to be instructed he could not operate a moped or other self-propelled machinery before he could be convicted for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Thus, we affirm the challenged conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-12\">. At trial, the parties engaged in discussion regarding whether the device appellant operated was a moped, which is expressly excluded from the definition of \"motor vehicle\u201d in Code \u00a7 46.2-100, or a motorcycle, which is included in that definition. The Commonwealth moved to amend the indictment to allege operation of \"self-propelled machinery or equipment <em>or a motor vehicle </em>\u201d in order to cover either scenario. Appellant objected to the amendment but declined the court\u2019s offer of a continuance. On brief on appeal, appellant concedes the device was a moped, and thus, we do not revisit this issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">.
