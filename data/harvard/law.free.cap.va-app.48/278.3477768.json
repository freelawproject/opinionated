Billips contends the trial judge erred at sentencing in (1) refusing to recuse himself after inappropriately receiving a sentencing verdict from the jury, (2) admitting the sentencing guidelines portion of the presentence report into evidence even though Billips was a juvenile when the offenses were committed, and (3) admitting the risk assessment portion of the presentence report into evidence without first determining that the scientific evidence contained therein concerning a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>plethysmograph examination was reliable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Billips\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, <em>see Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975), the evidence presented at trial established that, on May 10, 2003, Billips was living with his aunt and uncle, Wanda and Wayne Wood, in Tazewell County. The Woods\u2019 step-grandsons, C.H. and S.H., were also spending the night with the Woods on that date. That evening, while the Woods were downstairs watching television, Billips, whose date of birth was November 15, 1985, went upstairs to his bedroom where C.H. and S.H. were playing video games. Shortly after entering the room, Billips asked S.H., who was ten years old, to perform oral sex on him. After S.H. refused, Billips persuaded C.H., who was nine years old, to perform oral sex on him. Billips then performed oral sex on C.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">On June 3, 2003, Billips was charged with feloniously sodomizing C.H., a child less than thirteen years of age, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1. On June 26, 2003, the juvenile and domestic relations district court found probable cause and certified Billips\u2019s case to the trial court. On August 12, 2003, a grand jury indicted Billips on two counts of forcible sodomy, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1, and one count of criminal solicitation, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-29. A trial by jury was held on April 20, 2004. At the conclusion of the evidence and argument by counsel, the jury found Billips guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The trial then proceeded to the sentencing phase. Without objection by either party, the jury continued to sit in the trial. The Commonwealth introduced evidence of Billips\u2019s prior convictions as a juvenile for grand larceny of a motor vehicle, felony escape, abduction, carjacking, and malicious wounding. After hearing the defense\u2019s evidence in mitigation and the argument of counsel, the jury fixed Billips\u2019s sentence at twenty-five years for each of the sodomy convictions and five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>for the solicitation conviction, for a total sentence of fifty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">After the jury was excused, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, at this time we have a motion to set aside the verdict rendered by the jury as well as in the alternative a motion to stay the imposition of the sentence until after a presentence report can be considered by the Court along with a set of sentencing guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">THE COURT: Ah right. I\u2019ll tell you what the Court would do. The Court will order that a presentence report be prepared prior to sentencing. And will order also as part of that presentence report that a psychosexual evaluation be performed of Mr. Billips. And the Court will also give you, if you desire, ten days to file any written post-trial motions that you desire to file. And I will give the Commonwealth, if they desire, ten days to respond in writing to those motions. And we can set any motions that you want to file for hearing at the same time we set a sentencing [hearing]. Is that satisfactory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The trial judge then ordered that a presentence report, including a sentencing guidelines report and a psychosexual evaluation report, be \u201cprepared for the court\u2019s consideration prior to sentencing,\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-299, 19.2-298.01, and 19.2-300. Jennifer Helbert, the probation officer who prepared Billips\u2019s presentence report, referred Billips to Counseling and Consultation Services, Inc., a local non-profit corporation specializing in the \u201cassessment and treatment of sexual offenders,\u201d for evaluation. Cheryl Clayton, the corporation\u2019s Director of Virginia Services, and Dr. Ronald J. Ricci, Ph.D., examined Billips and performed a \u201cRisk Assessment designed to address present risk to reoffend and to generate treatment recommendations.\u201d Following preparation of the presentence report, including the sentencing guidelines report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>and the risk assessment report, the trial judge held a sentencing hearing on October 4, 2004.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the trial judge heard argument on Billips\u2019s motion to have the trial judge recuse himself and allow another judge to do the sentencing. After pointing out that, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-272, the jury should not have been allowed to recommend a sentence in this case, Billips argued that, in order to avoid the perception that the trial judge may have been influenced by the jury\u2019s \u201charsh\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d sentencing verdict, the trial judge should recuse himself and allow another judge to determine Billips\u2019s sentence or preside over a new trial, if appropriate. The trial judge denied the motion, stating that he was able to \u201cset aside the [jury\u2019s] recommendation\u201d in determining an appropriate sentence and that the jury\u2019s recommendation would have no \u201cgreater effect\u201d on him than on \u201canother sentencing judge who would be aware [from the record] of ... what the jury had done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Thereafter, Helbert recounted Billips\u2019s juvenile criminal record and testified regarding a psychological assessment of Billips conducted in 1997. Helbert recommended that Billips be incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">When the Commonwealth sought to introduce the presentence report into evidence, Billips initially objected to the admissibility of the sentencing guidelines report included in the presentence report. Billips argued that the sentencing guidelines, which recommended an incarceration range of twenty years and five months to fifty-nine years and nine months, were geared to adults and should not apply in this case because he was a juvenile at the time the offenses were committed. Citing the defense\u2019s failure to provide any authority supporting its position, the trial judge denied Billips\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Billips then objected to the admissibility of the risk assessment report included in the presentence report, arguing that the risk assessment report was impermissibly based on the results of a polygraph examination and a penile plethysmograph examination. A plethysmograph, Billips argued, is as unreliable as a polygraph in that they both measure a person\u2019s physical response to certain stimuli and, thus, should be similarly inadmissible. Sustaining Billips\u2019s objection with regard to the risk assessment report\u2019s reliance on a polygraph examination, the trial judge directed that a new risk assessment report be prepared \u201cwithout any consideration of any type of polygraph examination.\u201d However, noting that \u201c[tjhere is some difference\u201d between polygraphs and plethysmographs and that, unlike polygraphs, there is no \u201cspecific case law\u201d in Virginia dealing with plethysmographs, the trial judge denied Billips\u2019s objection with regard to the risk assessment report\u2019s reliance on a plethysmograph examination. The trial judge continued the sentencing hearing to allow for revision of the risk assessment report.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Following completion of the revised risk assessment report, the sentencing hearing recommenced on October 26, 2004. Clayton testified regarding the various factors she and Dr. Ricci used to assess the risk that Billips would re-engage in similar deviant sexual behavior. Discussing those factors, Clayton testified that Billips admitted during an interview that he had sexual contact when he was twelve years old with one of the victims but denied he committed the crimes for which he was convicted. Likewise, Clayton testified, Billips exhibited no signs of empathy toward the victims. Clayton explained that Billips\u2019s denial of culpability and his lack of empathy indicated he did not believe he had \u201ca problem with sexual offending,\u201d which suggested \u201ca poor treatment outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Clayton further testified that Billips and his parents claimed the charges against him had been fabricated because he would not obtain drugs for members of the victims\u2019 family. Such a belief on the part of the parents, Clayton opined, indicated they did not believe Billips had a sexual offense problem and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>suggested they would be unlikely to provide adequate supervision within the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Clayton also testified that, using a \u201ccomprehensive risk to reoffen[d] scale\u201d to assess Billips\u2019s likelihood of reoffending, she and Dr. Ricci determined that Billips posed \u201ca moderate reoffense risk.\u201d Clayton explained that Billips\u2019s score was based on a \u201cvariety of different factors,\u201d including the nature of the offenses he committed; the age and sex of the victims; the number of victims; the length of time he knew the victims; the means by which he gained access to the victims; the length of time he had been engaging in deviant sexual behavior; his social and familial relationships; his employment, criminal, and mental health histories; his substance abuse issues; and the results of his penile plethysmograph examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Clayton testified, over Billips\u2019s objection, that the plethysmograph examination administered to Billips indicated he had five primary areas of elevated deviant arousal response, including \u201cclinically significant deviant arousal\u201d to various sexual scenarios involving young boys and girls. Clayton further testified that, with respect to assessing a person\u2019s risk to reoffend based on a plethysmograph examination, \u201cindividuals who have three or more areas of elevated deviant response ... are in the highest reoffense category.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Over Billips\u2019s objection, the trial judge then admitted the revised risk assessment portion of the presentence report into evidence. In describing the purpose of the risk assessment performed on Billips, the report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">Our responsibility is two-fold. First and foremost is the protection of the community from further sexual assault. The second responsibility is the rehabilitation of the offender so that the risk to reoffend is minimized. Our assessment is not designed, nor is an assessment available, that can \u201cprove\u201d guilt or innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The risk assessment report listed the various sources of information used to prepare the assessment\u2014including \u201cCollateral Information\u201d from the probation officer, a \u201cClient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Social History Questionnaire,\u201d \u201cIntake\u201d and \u201cClinical\u201d interviews, a \u201cCognitive Distortion Scale,\u201d a \u201cSexual Scenario Rating Scale,\u201d a \u201cFamily Assessment,\u201d and a \u201cPenile Plethysmograph Assessment\u201d\u2014and detailed the factors cited by Clayton that were used to assess Billips\u2019s risk of reoffending under the \u201cComprehensive Risk to Reoffend Scale.\u201d With regard to the penile plethysmograph examination, the risk assessment report stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">A Penile Plethysmograph Assessment evaluates the presence or absence of deviant sexual arousal. Research has demonstrated that deviant sexual arousal is one of the best indicators of risk to sexually reoffend. As used by our agency, the pende plethysmograph is designed to measure sexual responsiveness to a variety of stimuli. Males and females ranging in age from infant to adult are represented in the stimuli. Visual stimuli are accompanied by audio stimuli describing behavior across a range of different sexual activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">... Mr. Billips\u2019[s] response pattern represents elevated responses to three or more categories across gender[, which] places Mr. Billips in the highest reoffense risk category. Deviant arousal to children has been shown to be the strongest indicator of recidivism.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Upon consideration of the presentence report, including the sentencing guidelines report and the risk assessment report included therein; the Commonwealth\u2019s victim-impact evidence from the victims\u2019 mother; and Billips\u2019s evidence in mitigation, the trial judge found that \u201cthe nature of [Billips\u2019s] offenses warranted deviation from the [sentencing] guidelines,\u201d which \u201cwere too low under the circumstances ... of these cases.\u201d Accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s recommendation, the court imposed life sentences for the two forcible sodomy convictions and a five-year sentence for the criminal solicitation conviction. In announcing the sentences, the trial judge stated that he could not imagine a more \u201cheinous offense\u201d than that committed by Billips. The trial judge further stated that he could \u201csee no expression by [Billips] of any type of true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>empathy or remorse or understanding of the consequences of [his] crimes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The trial judge entered the sentencing order on January 4, 2005, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">II. RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Although tried as an adult, Billips was seventeen years old when he was indicted for the instant offenses. Thus, the trial judge should have fixed Billips\u2019s sentence \u201cwithout the intervention of [the] jury.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A). However, the jury continued to sit in the penalty phase of the trial and recommended a total prison term of fifty-five years. Neither party objected to the jury\u2019s participation in the penalty phase, and Billips does not challenge his sentence on that ground, on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Instead, Billips contends that, having received the jury\u2019s inappropriately rendered sentencing verdict, the trial judge should have recused himself from the case so that a new judge, untainted by the jury\u2019s sentencing decision, could have been appointed to impose sentence. Such a recusal was necessary, Billips argues, because the trial judge\u2019s knowledge of the jury\u2019s \u201charsh\u201d sentencing verdict gave rise to the perception that the judge\u2019s imposition of sentence would be influenced by that verdict. That perception, Billips adds, was borne out by the severe sentence imposed by the trial judge, which clearly demonstrates the judge was \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict and had an \u201cinflamed bias\u201d against Billips as a result. Thus, Billips concludes, the trial judge\u2019s refusal to recuse himself violated Billips\u2019s due process right to be sentenced by an impartial judge and constituted an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The law governing this issue is well settled. \u201cA fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.\u201d <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.Ct. 623, 625, 99 L.Ed. 942 (1955). The due process right to a fair tribunal applies to both the guilt and sentencing phases of a criminal trial, <em>see Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 518, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1775, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), and requires the trial judge to be \u201cneutral and detached,\u201d <em>Ward v. Village of Monroeville, </em>409 U.S. 57, 61-62, 93 S.Ct. 80, 84, 34 L.Ed.2d 267 (1972). Indeed, the judge \u201cmust possess neither actual nor apparent bias against a party, and \u2018in the most extreme of cases\u2019 of bias, where, for example, a judge has a personal stake in the outcome of litigation, the judge\u2019s recusal will be required.\u201d <em>United States v. Cherry, </em>330 F.3d 658, 665 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, </em>475 U.S. 813, 821, 106 S.Ct. 1580, 1585, 89 L.Ed.2d 823 (1986)). \u201c[T]he inquiry must be not only whether there was actual bias on [the judge\u2019s] part, but also whether there was \u2018such a likelihood of bias or an appearance of bias that the judge was unable to hold the balance between vindicating the interests of the court and the interests of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 501, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 2704, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974) (quoting <em>Ungar v. Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 588, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">Of course, most questions concerning a judge\u2019s qualifications to hear a case are not constitutional ones, because the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment establishes a constitutional floor, not a uniform standard. Instead, these questions are, in most cases, answered by common law, statute, or the professional standards of the bench and bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASq\"><em>Bracy v. Gramley, </em>520 U.S. 899, 904, 117 S.Ct. 1793, 1797, 138 L.Ed.2d 97 (1997) (citation omitted); <em>see also FTC v. Cement Institute, </em>333 U.S. 683, 702, 68 S.Ct. 793, 804, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948) (noting that \u201cmost matters relating to judicial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The Canons of Judicial Conduct for the Commonwealth of Virginia provide that \u201c[a] judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Canon 3(E)(1). Accordingly, \u201ca judge must diligently avoid not only impropriety but a reasonable appearance of impropriety as well.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 587, 591, 466 S.E.2d 741, 743 (1996). The question, therefore, \u201cwhether a trial judge should recuse himself or herself is measured by whether he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>harbors [or reasonably appears to harbor] \u2018such bias or prejudice as would deny the defendant a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welsh v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 300, 314, 416 S.E.2d 451, 459 (1992) (quoting <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 667, 673, 283 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1981)), <em>aff'd, </em>246 Va. 337, 437 S.E.2d 914 (1993) .</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u201c[T]he party moving for recusal of a judge has the burden of proving the judge\u2019s bias or prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Jackson, </em>267 Va. 226, 229, 590 S.E.2d 518, 519-20 (2004). \u201cA purported violation of the Canons alone is not enough to mandate recusal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 590 S.E.2d at 519; <em>see Davis, </em>21 Va.App. at 591, 466 S.E.2d at 743 (noting that a judge is not required \u201cto recuse himself or herself and disrupt the orderly flow of the docket at the whim or unsupported suggestion of a party\u201d). \u201cIn the absence of proof of actual bias [or prejudice], recusal is properly within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>267 Va. at 229, 590 S.E.2d at 520; <em>see Davis, </em>21 Va.App. at 591, 466 S.E.2d at 743 (\u201cExactly when a judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be called into question is a determination to be made by that judge in the exercise of his or her sound discretion.\u201d). \u201cIn exercising his [or her] discretion in this regard, the judge must be guided not only by the true state of his [or her] impartiality, but also by the public perception of his [or her] fairness, in order that public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary may be maintained.\u201d <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 707, 722, 324 S.E.2d 682, 686 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Examining the instant record with these considerations in mind, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s knowledge of the jury\u2019s improperly rendered sentencing verdict did not require his recusal. Acknowledging at the sentencing hearing that consideration of the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict was inappropriate in this case, the trial judge explicitly indicated that he could, and would, disregard the jury\u2019s recommendation in determining Billips\u2019s sentence. We find no reason to disbelieve \u201cthe court\u2019s unequivocal statement,\u201d <em>Overton v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 599, 604, 539 S.E.2d 421, 424 (2000), or to question the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>judge\u2019s ability to do what he said he could and would do. Likewise, we find no reason to believe that a reasonable member of the public would have cause to doubt the judge\u2019s assurance that he would disregard the jury\u2019s recommendation or his ability to do so. It is widely accepted that \u201c[a] judge, unlike a juror, is uniquely suited by training, experience and judicial discipline to disregard potentially prejudicial comments and to separate, during the mental process of adjudication, the admissible from the inadmissible, even though he has heard both.\u201d <em>Eckhart v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 213, 216, 279 S.E.2d 155, 157 (1981); <em>see Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 391, 397, 404 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1991) (holding that a trial judge, unlike a juror, has the ability at sentencing to disregard an inadmissible inculpatory statement by the defendant). In fact, trial judges are routinely required to disregard \u201cmatters that would be prejudicial if considered when deciding the case.\u201d <em>Farren v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 234, 239, 516 S.E.2d 253, 256 (1999). Consequently, we have held that, notwithstanding a trial judge\u2019s knowledge of evidence that is immaterial and incompetent, the judge is presumed to have correctly disregarded such evidence, absent \u201cclear evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Cole v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 113, 116, 428 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1993). There is nothing in the record that rebuts that presumption here.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Moreover, we find nothing in the record that indicates the trial judge harbored any actual or apparent bias or prejudice against Billips as a result of the judge\u2019s awareness of the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict. Billips argues that the harsh sentence imposed by the trial judge indicates the trial judge\u2019s objectivity was tainted by the jury\u2019s recommendation. This argument is without merit. The jury recommended a sentence of twenty-five years for each of Billips\u2019s two forcible sodomy convictions. In sentencing Billips to life imprisonment for each of the two forcible sodomy convictions, the trial judge imposed the maximum sentence permitted by law. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1(B) (\u201cForcible sodomy is a felony punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility for life or for any term not less than five years.\u201d). Plainly, had the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>judge\u2019s objectivity been influenced by the jury\u2019s recommendation, as Billips claims, the trial judge would have imposed a sentence more in keeping with the jury\u2019s recommended sentence, rather than the maximum possible. In addition, the imposition by the trial judge of the maximum sentence permitted by law is not, by itself, sufficient to show that the trial judge harbored actual or apparent bias or prejudice against the defendant. <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 408, 430, 617 S.E.2d 431, 442 (2005) (plurality opinion), <em>petition for appeal granted, </em>No. 051968 (Va. Sup.Ct. Order of December 21, 2005); <em>see Abdo v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 473, 479, 237 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1977) (\u201cWhen a statute prescribes a maximum imprisonment penalty and the sentence does not exceed that maximum, the sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion.\u201d); <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 540, 542, 413 S.E.2d 661, 662 (1992) (\u201c \u2018If the sentence is within the range set by the legislature, an appellate court will not interfere with the judgment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 158, 160-61, 390 S.E.2d 509, 510 (1990))). Billips points to no other evidence as proof of the trial judge\u2019s actual or apparent bias or prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Because the record is devoid of any indication that the trial judge\u2019s sentencing determination was affected by the judge\u2019s knowledge of the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict, and because the judge\u2019s impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned on that basis, we hold that the trial judge did not violate Billips\u2019s right to due process or abuse the judge\u2019s discretion in refusing to recuse himself and appoint another judge to determine Billips\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">III. SENTENCING GUIDELINES</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">In his second claim of error, Billips contends solely that \u201c[t]he sentencing guidelines in this case should not have been prepared [by the probation officer] or considered by the trial court\u201d in determining his sentence because the guidelines are geared to adults and penalize juvenile offenders. Because the court actions challenged by Billips on appeal arose from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Ms own conduct at trial, we need not address the merits of Ms claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The record demonstrates that, after the jury found Billips guilty and fixed Ms sentence, Billips\u2019s counsel specifically moved \u201cto stay the imposition of the sentence until after a presentence report [could] be considered by the Court along with a set of sentencing guidelines.\u201d In response, the trial judge informed the parties that, <em>inter alia, </em>he was going to \u201corder that a presentence report be prepared prior to sentencing.\u201d Asked by the judge if that was \u201csatisfactory,\u201d Billips\u2019s counsel responded that it was. The trial judge then set the case for sentencing and ordered that a presentence report be prepared for the court\u2019s consideration prior to sentencing. At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge admitted the completed presentence report, including the sentencing guidelines report, into evidence. In other words, the trial judge did exactly what Billips requested he do.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It is well settled in Virgima that an appellate court will not \u201cnotice error [that] has been invited by the party seeking to take advantage thereof on appeal.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 399, 400, 177 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1970); <em>see also Buchanan v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 389, 400-01, 384 S.E.2d 757, 764 (1989) (holding that a party may not be heard to complain on appeal where the record shows the lower court took the very action requested or agreed to by that party); <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 214, 257 S.E.2d 784, 792 (1979) (\u201cThe defendant, having agreed upon the action taken by the trial court, should not be allowed to assume an inconsistent position.\u201d); <em>McClain v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 847, 856, 55 S.E.2d 49, 53 (1949) (\u201cThe defendant, having taken Ms chance on a favorable report, ought not to be heard to object later if he considered it unfavorable.\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[n]o litigant, even a defendant in a criminal case, will be permitted to approbate and reprobate\u2014to invite error ... and then to take advantage of the situation created by Ms own wrong.\u201d <em>Fisher v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 403, 417, 374 S.E.2d 46, 54 (1988). Accordingly, Billips will not now be heard to complain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>actions by the trial judge that he himself asked the judge to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">We hold, therefore, that the trial judge did not err in ordering the preparation of the sentencing guidelines in this case or in considering those guidelines in determining Billips\u2019s sentence. <em>See Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 141, 146, 607 S.E.2d 719, 721 (2005) (noting that \u201cthe judgment of the trial court is presumed to be correct unless and until reversed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">IV. PLETHYSMOGRAPH</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Lastly, Billips challenges the admissibility of the results of his penile plethysmograph examination<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the opinions based on those results on the ground that the trial judge failed to make a threshold finding that a penile plethysmograph examination is a reliable scientific method of determining a convicted sex offender\u2019s risk to reoffend, as required by <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 97, 393 S.E.2d 609, 621 (1990). Absent such a threshold finding, Billips argues, the trial judge erred in receiving and considering the risk assessment portion of the presentence report, which contained those results and opinions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Decisions regarding the admissibility of evidence presented during sentencing proceedings lie \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial court\u201d and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Runyon v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 573, 576, 513 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1999); <em>see Commonwealth v. Shifflett, </em>257 Va. 34, 45, 510 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1999) (holding that a trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence at sentencing will not be reversed unless the court clearly abused its discretion). \u201cHowever, \u2018by definition, when the trial court makes an error of law, an abuse of discretion occurs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzales v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 375, 380, 611 S.E.2d 616, 618 (2005) (en banc) (quoting <em>Bass v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 373, 382, 523 S.E.2d 534, 539 (2000)). \u201cAbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied.... \u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">As we noted in <em>Cotton v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 306, 310, 451 S.E.2d 673, 676 (1994), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>20 Va.App. 596, 459 S.E.2d 527 (1995) (en banc), the Supreme Court of Virginia \u201cset forth explicitly the standard for determining the competence of scientific evidence\u201d in <em>Spencer </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">When scientific evidence is offered, the court must make a threshold finding of fact with respect to the reliability of the scientific method offered, unless it is of a kind so familiar and accepted as to require no foundation to establish the fundamental reliability of the system, such as fingerprint analysis; or unless it is so unreliable that the considerations requiring its exclusion have ripened into rules of law, such as \u201clie-detector\u201d tests; or unless its admission is regulated by statute, such as blood-alcohol test results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">In making the threshold finding of fact, the court must usually rely on expert testimony. If there is a conflict, and the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by credible evidence, it will not be disturbed on appeal. Even where the issue of scientific reliability is disputed, if the court determines that there is a sufficient foundation to warrant admission of the evidence, the court may, in its discretion, admit the evidence with appropriate instructions to the jury to consider the disputed reliability of the evidence in determining its credibility and weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-8\"><em>Spencer, </em>240 Va. at 97-98, 393 S.E.2d at 621 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\"><em>Spencer </em>and <em>Cotton, </em>however, each involved scientific evidence offered by the Commonwealth during the guilt phase of a jury trial to prove the identity of the criminal agent. <em>Spencer, </em>240 Va. at 84, 393 S.E.2d at 613; <em>Cotton, </em>19 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>at 309, 451 S.E.2d at 675. Here, the challenged scientific evidence concerning the penile plethysmograph examination administered to Billips was contained in the risk assessment portion of the presentence report, which was presented to the trial judge at the sentencing hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-299 and 19.2-300. The evidence went explicitly to Billips\u2019s risk of reoffending and indirectly to his amenability to treatment, subjects plainly relevant to sentencing. <em>See Merritt v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 506, 508, 528 S.E.2d 743, 744 (2000) (\u201c \u2018The sentencing decision ... is a quest for a sentence that best effectuates the criminal justice system\u2019s goals of deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. 726, 729 (E.D.Va.1993))); <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 524, 465 S.E.2d 592, 595 (1996) (noting that evidence bearing on a defendant\u2019s \u201ctendency to commit offenses\u201d and \u201cthe probabilities of rehabilitation\u201d is \u201cindispensable to the determination of an appropriate sentence\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Billips offers, and we are aware of, no authority requiring a trial judge to apply the evidentiary standard set forth in <em>Spencer </em>to relevant scientific evidence offered in a presentence report pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-299 and 19.2-300. Nor do we perceive a good reason to require a trial judge to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">It is well settled in Virginia that the rules governing the admissibility of evidence in sentencing hearings are more relaxed than those applied during the guilt phase of trial. <em>See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 794, 808, 497 S.E.2d 165, 171 (1998) (noting that the evidentiary restrictions imposed at sentencing hearings are \u201csignificantly relaxed\u201d). As the Supreme Court of Virginia said in <em>McClain, </em>189 Va. 847, 55 S.E.2d 49:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cTribunals passing on the guilt of a defendant always have been hedged in by strict evidentiary procedural limitations. But both before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 859-60, 55 S.E.2d at 55 (quoting <em>Williams v. People of State of New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949) (footnote omitted)). This evidentiary distinction between the guilt and penalty phase proceedings exists, the Court explained, because, in the guilt phase of trial, \u201cthe rules of evidence are designed to prevent the introduction of collateral issues and to prevent tribunals concerned solely with the issue of guilt of the particular offense from being influenced to convict for that offense by evidence\u201d not strictly admissible on that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 860, 55 S.E.2d at 55. Conversely, at a sentencing hearing, \u201cthe task of the judge, within fixed statutory or constitutional limits, is to determine the type and extent of punishment after the issue of guilt has been determined, to the end that punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">This distinction is particularly pronounced when it comes to the admissibility of information contained in a presentence report prepared by a probation officer pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-299. For example, \u201c[a] sentencing judge may consider hearsay contained in a probation report.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 656, 659, 446 S.E.2d 469, 471 (1994) (en banc). This is a significant difference from the standard generally applied at trial because, as we said in <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 197, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987), \u201c[t]he strongest justification for the exclusion of hearsay evidence is that the trier of fact has no opportunity to view the witness on cross-examination and to observe the demeanor of the out-of-court declarant to determine reliability.\u201d Similarly, a sentencing judge may consider a presentence report that contains evidence of the defendant\u2019s unadjudicated criminal conduct, <em>Wolfe v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 136, 142-43, 554 S.E.2d 695, 698-99 (2001), including evidence obtained from unnamed confidential informants regarding the defendant\u2019s involvement in illicit drug operations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 303, 498 S.E.2d 451, 456 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Justification for this less strict application of the rules of evidence at sentencing hearings is found in Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A)\u2019s mandate that the probation officer preparing the presentence report for the trial judge include \u201cthe history of the accused ... and all other relevant facts\u201d in the report \u201cso the court may determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed,\u201d and in the established principle that a judge charged with the responsibility of determining the appropriate punishment for a convicted defendant \u201cis entitled to know as much relevant information about the defendant as possible,\u201d <em>Beaver v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 521, 529, 352 S.E.2d 342, 347 (1987) (citing <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 276, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2958, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976) (\u201cWhat is essential is that the [sentencer] have before it all possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine.\u201d)); <em>see Shifflett, </em>257 Va. at 43, 510 S.E.2d at 236 (holding that the need for a fully informed sentencer is \u201cno less essential\u201d in cases involving noncapital offenses than it is in cases involving capital offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The relaxed standard of admissibility at sentencing hearings is also reflective of the fact that the sentencing judge alone, and not the jury, receives and considers the presentence report, and any reports included therein, in determining the appropriate sentence to impose. <em>See Harris, </em>26 Va.App. at 807, 497 S.E.2d at 171 (\u201cUnder Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A), a probation officer who has been ordered to prepare a presentence report is required \u2018to fully advise the court\u2019 of [the relevant information]. The <em>trial court, </em>in turn, is required to read and consider the content of the presentence report when \u2018determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted) (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 19.2-298.01(A) (providing that \u201cthe <em>court </em>shall (i) have presented to it the appropriate discretionary sentencing guidelines worksheets and (ii) review and consider the suitability of the applicable discretionary sentencing guidelines\u201d and that, \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>cases tried by a jury, the jury shall not be presented any information regarding sentencing guidelines\u201d (emphasis added)); Code \u00a7 19.2-300 (providing that the sentence will be deferred until the mental examination report \u201ccan be secured to guide the <em>judge </em>in determining what disposition shall be made of the defendant\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>cf. </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B) (\u201cIn cases of trial by jury, ... reports under the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-299 ... shall not be admitted into evidence.\u201d). As alluded to earlier, it is widely accepted that a sentencing judge, unlike a lay juror, has the ability to disregard evidence in a presentence report that may not properly be relied upon in determining a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 385-86, 484 S.E.2d 898, 905-06 (1997) (noting that, unlike a juror, the sentencing judge was able to assess the propriety of the victim impact evidence in the presentence report and disregard any such evidence that did not warrant his consideration) (citing <em>Eckhart, </em>222 Va. at 216, 279 S.E.2d at 157); <em>Johnson, </em>12 Va.App. at 397, 404 S.E.2d at 387 (holding that a sentencing judge, unlike a juror, has the ability to disregard a statement in the presentence report that was not admissible at the sentencing hearing).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Thus, \u201c \u2018a sentencing judge [may typically] exercise wide discretion in the sources and types of evidence used to assist him in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

For this reason, the admissibility of evidence during sentencing proceedings does not necessarily turn on whether that same evidence was admissible during the guilt phase of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Brown v. City of Danville, </em>44 Va.App. 586, 611, 606 S.E.2d 523, 536 (2004) (alterations in original).

Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983). Addressing the question in that case whether potentially unreliable psychiatric evidence about \u201cfuture dangerousness\u201d was constitutionally admissible at sentencing in a capital murder trial, the Court held that, because it was not \u201calmost entirely unreliable,\u201d such \u201cscientific proof\u2019 was admissible as long as it was relevant and helpful to the sentencer. <em>Id. </em>at 896-903, 905-06, 103 S.Ct. at 3396-3400, 3401 (citing <em>Jurek, </em>428 U.S. at 274-76, 96 S.Ct. at 2957-58).

As the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">[T]he rules of evidence generally extant at the federal and state levels anticipate that relevant, unprivileged evidence should be admitted and its weight left to the factfinder, who would have the benefit of cross-examination and contrary evidence by the opposing party.

The Court reaches this result\u2014even in a capital case\u2014because, it is said, the testimony is subject to cross-examination and impeachment----One may accept this in a routine lawsuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>for money damages, but when a person\u2019s life is at stake\u2014no matter how heinous his offense\u2014a requirement of greater reliability should prevail. In a capital case, the specious testimony of a psychiatrist, colored in the eyes of an impressionable jury by the inevitable untouchability of a medical specialist\u2019s words, equates with death itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 916, 103 S.Ct. at 3406-07 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). Justice Blackmun further pointed out that, \u201c[t]o obtain a death sentence in Texas, the State [had] to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u2018there [was] a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 916-17, 103 S.Ct. at 3407 (citing Tex.Code Crim.

North Carolina, </em>428 U.S. 280, 305, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he penalty of death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment, however long. Death, in its finality, differs more from life imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from one of only a year or two.\u201d). Nor was the Commonwealth required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt Billips\u2019s future dangerousness to obtain the sentence imposed in this case. Unlike death penalty cases, the level of punishment imposed in a case like this is not contingent upon a finding of future dangerousness; thus, proof, by any standard, of Billips\u2019s risk of reoffending was not essential to imposition of the penalty imposed. <em>See Walker v.

Moreover, as previously mentioned, the scientific evidence challenged in this case was not presented to a jury, but to a judge, who presumably was able, based on his \u201ctraining, experience and judicial discipline,\u201d <em>Eckhart, </em>222 Va. at 216, 279 S.E.2d at 157, to ascribe the appropriate weight to the specialists\u2019 evidence without giving undue deference to it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clearly, then, if reliance on the adversarial process to assess the reliability of scientific evidence was sufficient to satisfy the due process concerns in <em>Barefoot, </em>the same must be true in this case, as long as the relevant scientific evidence in dispute here had some indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Applying the aforementioned considerations to the specific question before us, we find it clear that neither due process nor Virginia evidentiary law requires a sentencing judge to make a threshold finding that relevant scientific evidence offered in a presentence report pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-299 and 19.2-300 is based on a reliable scientific method. Indeed, all that is manifestly required is that the evidence have \u201csome indicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Alger, </em>19 Va.App. at 258, 450 S.E.2d at 768. We hold, therefore, that, to the extent it required the sentencing judge to do anything more than ensure the plethysmograph evidence had some indicia of reliability before relying thereon, the evidentiary standard set forth in <em>Spencer </em>did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The question remains, however, whether that evidence bore the requisite indicia of reliability to permit the sentencing judge to receive and consider it at the sentencing hearing. To make that determination, we must examine the circumstances surrounding the challenged evidence. <em>See Wolfe, </em>37 Va.App. at 142-43, 554 S.E.2d at 698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Charged with the responsibility of determining an appropriate sentence for Billips, the trial judge ordered the preparation of a presentence report under Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A) and a psychosexual evaluation under Code \u00a7 19.2-300. The probation officer responsible for preparing the presentence report referred Billips to a corporation specializing in the \u201cassessment and treatment of sexual offenders\u201d for evaluation. As part of that evaluation, Billips underwent a penile plethysmograph examination. The risk assessment report prepared by the two specialists who examined Billips stated that a \u201cPenile Plethysmograph Assessment evaluates the presence or absence of deviant sexual arousal. Research has demonstrated that deviant sexual arousal is one of the best indicators of risk to sexually reoffend.\u201d The report further stated that \u201cMr. Billips\u2019[s] response pattern represents elevated responses to three or more categories across gender[, which] places Mr. Billips in the highest reoffense risk category. Deviant arousal to children has been shown to be the strongest indicator of recidivism.\u201d Relying on the plethysmograph results and numerous other sources of information, circumstances, and factors, the specialists who prepared the risk assessment report determined that Billips posed a moderate risk to sexually reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Billips argued at the sentencing hearing that penile plethysmograph examinations are as unreliable as polygraph examinations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, despite having had ample opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>do so, he offered no evidence to support that claim or to counter the implicit declaration in the risk assessment report that a penile plethysmograph examination is a rehable method of determining a sex offender\u2019s risk of reoffending. Nor did he offer any evidence to show that the particular results of the plethysmograph examination administered to him were unreliable indicators of his risk to reoffend. Indeed, Billips\u2019s claims of unreliability are whohy unsupported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Upon these circumstances, we conclude that the information in the risk assessment report concerning Billips\u2019s penile plethysmograph examination had the requisite indicia of reliability to permit the sentencing judge to receive and consider that information at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Accordingly, we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the risk assessment portion of the presentence report without making a threshold finding that a penile plethysmograph examination is a reliable scientific method of determining a convicted sex offender\u2019s risk to reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>V.

Under the evidentiary standard for scientific evidence set forth in <em>Frye, </em>293 F. at 1014, expert testimony based on a scientific principle is admissible only if the principle is \"sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.\u201d Although the <em>Frye </em>admissibility standard has been superseded by the federal rules of evidence and the reliability-assessment factors propounded in <em>Daubert v.

Indeed, it is worth noting that the sentencing judge in this case made no mention of the penile plethysmograph in sentencing Billips. Instead, the judge referred solely to the \"heinous\" nature of the crimes committed and Billips\u2019s lack of remorse and empathy for the victims as the bases for the sentences imposed. Thus, although it is impossible to conclude, as the Supreme Court was able to in <em>Saunders v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 107, 115-16, 406 S.E.2d 39, 44 (1991), that the sentencing judge did not rely at all on the challenged evidence in determining an appropriate sentence, it is clear that the evidence regarding the plethysmograph examination was not of primaiy concern to the sentencing judge in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">. Addressing the reliability of polygraph examinations, in <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 142, 341 S.E.2d 159 (1986), our Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">In a long line of cases, spanning almost thirty years, we have made clear that polygraph examinations are so thoroughly unreliable as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>be of no proper evidentiary use whether they favor the accused, implicate the accused, or are agreed to by both parties.

Addressing the same subject in <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. at 312, 118 S.Ct. at 1266, the United States Supreme Court stated that, \"[ajlthough the degree of reliability of polygraph evidence may depend upon a variety of identifiable factors, there is simply no way to know in a particular case whether a polygraph examiner\u2019s conclusion is accurate, because certain doubts and uncertainties plague even the best polygraph exams.\u201d Neither Court, however, has addressed the subject of the reliability of plethysmograph examinations. Given the paucity of evidence on that subject in the present record, we leave for another day the question whether, in the context of this case, a penile plethysmograph examination is trustworthy enough in general to be \"considered or treated as a reliable scientific technique,\" <em>Satcher v.

Indeed, the Supreme Court of Virginia repeatedly has predicated the trial judge\u2019s admission of scientific evidence upon the proponent of the evidence establishing its reliability. <em>See Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 275, 290, 384 S.E.2d 775, 783 (1989) (ruling that DNA testing was admissible because evidence established the scientific technique\u2019s reliability); <em>O\u2019Dell v.

Plethysmographs are a phallometric test conducted by placing a metal gauge over the subject\u2019s penis that measures variations in the penis\u2019s size. During the session, the subject is exposed to a variety of visual and audio sexual depictions of males and females of different ages, in both consenting and non-consenting situations. The theory behind the plethysmograph is that it directly measures erotic response to the different stimuli, indicating what the subject finds sexually exciting. <em>See </em>Judith V. Becker &amp; William D. Murphy, <em>Sex Offenders: Scientific, Legal, and Policy Perspective: The Science of Sex Offenders: Risk Assessment, Treatment, and Prevention: What We Know and Do Not Know About Assessing and Treating Sex Offenders, </em>4 Psych.

Powers, </em>59 F.3d 1460, 1471 (4th Cir.1995), the court noted that \u201cthe scientific literature addressing penile plethysmography does not regard the test as a valid diagnostic tool because, although useful for treatment of sex offenders, it has no accepted standards in the scientific community.\u201d <em>See also Berthiaume v. Clark, </em>142 F.3d 12, 14-15 (1st Cir.1998) (examining the apparent scientific debate over the usefulness of plethysmographs). In <em>North Carolina v. Spencer, </em>119 N.C.App. 662, 459 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1995), the government\u2019s expert explained that although the plethysmograph accurately measures the increase of blood to the penis, there was \u201csubstantial disagreement\u201d over whether the physical reaction directly correlates to sexual behavior. The North Carolina Court of Appeals rejected the use of the plethysmograph, noting that \u201cthere is a substantial difference of opinion within the scientific community regarding the plethysmograph\u2019s reliability to measure sexual deviancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>e.g., </em>James G. Barker &amp; Robert J. Howell, <em>The Plethysmograph: A Review of Recent Literature, </em>20 Bull. Am. Acad, of Psychiatry &amp; L. 13 (Mar. 1992) (identifying several problems with the reliability of the plethysmograph, namely \u201clack of standards for training and interpretation of data, lack of norms and standardization and susceptibility of the data to false negatives and false positives,\u201d and concluding that \u201cdespite the sophistication of the current equipment technology, a question remains whether the information emitted is a valid and reliable means of assessing sexual preference\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">An expert testified in another case that \u201cthe penile plethysmograph, though it can be helpful in treating sexual deviance, is not a reliable means of assessing sexual deviance.\u201d <em>Nelson v.

One study reported that \u201conly 50% of child molesters display deviant arousal patterns on the test,\u201d and another found that \u201ca large percentage of non-sex offenders display some degree of arousal to stimuli involving young children.\u201d Jason R.

An additional concern about the plethysmograph\u2019s reliability and accuracy is that the subject can manipulate the results. <em>See In the Interest of A.V., </em>849 S.W.2d 393, 399 (Tx.App.1993) (the expert attempting to validate the method \u201cadmitted that a person of high intelligence ... can easily manipulate the results\u201d); <em>see also United States v.

Spencer, </em>459 S.E.2d at 815 (noting that a study indicates penile response is subject to voluntary control). Some subjects can exhibit responses to non-preferred stimuli as well as reduce response to preferred stimuli. Grant T. Harris, Marnie E. Rice, &amp; Vernon L.

The studies of plethysmographs vary drastically in their conclusions. Some reports show an extremely fallible method, susceptible to manipulation from the subject and often misidentifying the subject as a sex-offender or as a non-offender, while other studies report high accuracy rates. In this respect, plethysmographs and polygraphs, both of which measure physiological responses, are similar. Both require an <em>assumption </em>that the physiological response measured directly reflects the emotion and behavior purportedly being measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">For these reasons, I believe that plethysmographs, like polygraphs, \u201care so thoroughly unreliable as to be of no proper evidentiary use.\u201d <em>See Robinson, </em>231 Va. at 156, 341 S.E.2d at 167. Like polygraphs, the plethysmograph \u201chas an aura of authority while being wholly unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is well established that reliability of evidence offered in a criminal proceeding is a due process concern. <em>See Chambers v.

After decades of debate, the scientific community still has not agreed on the reliability of polygraphs, despite numerous studies on the question. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 309, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 1264-65, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998); <em>see also 4 </em>David L.
