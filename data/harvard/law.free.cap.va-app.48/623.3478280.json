For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and remand solely for the purpose of correcting a clerical error in the sentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party that prevailed below.\u201d <em>Banks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 539, 543, 586 S.E.2d 876, 877 (2003). So viewed, the evidence established that, around noon on June 2, 2004, appellant stopped his Mercedes SUV at a stoplight in the right southbound lane of Gordon Road in Spotsylvania County. While appellant waited for the light to turn green, Christie Antonuccio stopped her red Mustang in the left southbound lane beside appellant\u2019s SUV. Antonuccio\u2019s four-year-old son was in the backseat of her car in a child safety seat. Appellant\u2019s SUV and Antonuccio\u2019s car were the first vehicles in their respective southbound lanes. Signs at the intersection indicated that the left southbound lane ended ahead and that the traffic in that lane was to merge into the right southbound lane. The two lanes began to gradually merge into a single lane approximately one tenth of a mile south of the stoplight. The posted legal speed limit for that portion of the southbound roadway, which had a four percent downhill grade, was forty miles per hour. The roadway was dry and free of imperfections in the road surface, and the weather was clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>When the light turned green, both vehicles quickly accelerated side-by-side toward the merge area. For some time, neither vehicle slowed to allow for the merge. After reaching a speed of approximately 50 miles per hour, appellant eventually slowed down \u201c[a]s they approached the spot where the two lanes merge[d]\u201d into one and allowed Antonuccio to go in front of him. Moments after merging into the lane ahead of appellant, Antonuccio lost control of her car and went off the roadway. Gravel thrown up by Antonuccio\u2019s car as it slid across the shoulder of the road pitted the front of appellant\u2019s SUV and cracked his windshield. Antonuccio\u2019s car then slammed broadside into a tree on the right side of the road. The police determined the car was traveling approximately seventy-six miles per hour at the time of the impact. The distance from the end of the merge to the impact was one tenth of a mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">After finding a safe place to stop, appellant proceeded to the accident scene and helped Kenneth Phillips, a local resident who had heard the crash, clear tree limbs from Antonuccio\u2019s car in an attempt to extricate its two occupants. A short time later, emergency personnel arrived. Antonuccio\u2019s son was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Soon thereafter, police officers arrived on the scene. After observing a police officer give another person who had stopped near the accident scene permission to leave the area, appellant left without speaking to any of the law enforcement officers present.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Ninety minutes after the accident, emergency personnel were successfully able to extricate Antonuccio from her car. However, she was pronounced dead on arrival at an area hospital emergency room.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Acting on an anonymous tip received by the police, Deputy Franklin McNeal Fleming contacted appellant the next day, and appellant agreed to speak with him. Upon arriving at appellant\u2019s home, Deputy Fleming explained why he was there and notified appellant that there had been two fatalities in the accident. Appellant became \u201cvery upset and emotional\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>stated that he had not been aware anyone had died. Appellant then told Deputy Fleming about the events surrounding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Appellant admitted that, even though he knew Antonuceio was accelerating in order to merge into the right lane ahead of him, he continued to accelerate in an attempt to reach the merge area first. Appellant explained that \u201c[h]e was in the proper lane. The red car had to merge\u201d into his lane. Appellant further explained that, \u201chaving lived in the area for 17 years, he had seen other cars in the left lane cut off drivers in that right lane\u201d and that, \u201cafter 30 years in the Marine Corps, [he] wasn\u2019t backing down.\u201d Asked specifically why he did not simply slow down earlier and allow Antonuceio to go ahead of him, rather than try to prevent her from merging in front of him, appellant stated that \u201che was frustrated about people cutting others off all the time when they tried to merge at that location.\u201d Appellant also told Deputy Fleming that he ultimately \u201cbaek[ed] down,\u201d diminishing his rate of acceleration to allow Antonuccio\u2019s car to merge into his lane just before the southbound lanes finally merged, because \u201cthe red car had too much horsepower for his vehicle, and if he hadn\u2019t slowed down he would have crashed.\u201d \u201c[H]e knew,\u201d appellant explained, that \u201che couldn\u2019t beat the red car.\u201d Appellant also stated that he left the scene when he heard an officer gave another driver permission to leave the area because \u201che did not want any part of what had happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Appellant was subsequently charged with reckless driving and felony leaving the scene of an accident. A bench trial commenced on April 13, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">At trial, appellant testified that, when the light turned green, he \u201cintenfded] to lead in such a way that she could come in behind [him].\u201d \u201cWhen [he] saw that wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d he further testified, he \u201cbacked down because both lives were endangered ... the cars would have collided.\u201d Appellant also stated that, after doing all he could to assist after the accident, he \u201cbacked out of the way\u201d of the emergency personnel and left the scene \u201cthe first chance [he] got to leave.\u201d On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>cross-examination, appellant admitted that he accelerated \u201cmore briskly\u201d than he would have ordinarily, had there been no car in the left lane, in order to prevent Antonuccio from merging in front of him. Appellant further admitted that, despite knowing Antonuccio \u201cwanted to go in front of [him],\u201d he did not \u201cimmediately just slow down and let her by\u201d but continued to \u201caccelerate briskly ... [w]ithin [the] distance of the merge.\u201d By the time he backed down, appellant acknowledged, Antonuccio \u201cwas going pretty fast.\u201d Appellant also acknowledged that his vehicle was \u201cclose behind\u201d Antonuccio\u2019s vehicle \u201cwhen she lost control.\u201d He further explained that he left the scene after the accident without speaking to a law enforcement officer not because he felt guilty for what he had done but because he \u201cwasn\u2019t involved in the accident\u201d and \u201cchose not to get [him]self involved.\u201d Questioned by the court, appellant explained that he was in tears when informed that both occupants of Antonuccio\u2019s car had died \u201cbecause there [were] deaths\u201d and because he had \u201ctried to assist\u201d after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion to strike and finding appellant guilty of leaving the scene of an accident, the trial court determined that, although appellant was not the cause of Antonuccio\u2019s accident, he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the accident, as that term is used in Code \u00a7 46.2-894. In reaching that decision, the trial court reasoned that \u201cthe incident was a continuum from the time the cars left the intersection\u201d until Antonuccio\u2019s car \u201cended up against that tree.\u201d The court further reasoned that appellant\u2019s \u201cemotional response\u201d to the news that the occupants of the red car had died indicated that appellant knew he was \u201cinvolved in something that he should be talking to law enforcement about.\u201d The court found that, although appellant satisfied the statute\u2019s requirement that a driver of a \u201cvehicle involved in an accident\u201d stop and render assistance, he failed to comply with the statute\u2019s requirement that the same driver also report his name and information to a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The trial court also found appellant guilty of reckless driving, specifically basing the conviction on the uncontested fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>that, when appellant saw Antonuccio\u2019s car beside him accelerating toward the merge area \u201cat a high rate of speed,\u201d his \u201creaction [was] to accelerate.\u201d The court further noted that, although appellant eventually \u201cbacked down,\u201d by the time he did so \u201che had already accelerated and engaged in some very foolish conduct,\u201d which constituted reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The trial court sentenced appellant to two years in prison, all suspended, for the leaving the scene of an accident conviction and six months in jail for the reckless driving conviction. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">On appeal, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. \u201c When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the Commonwealth, and the reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence support each and every element of the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crest v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 165, 174, 578 S.E.2d 88, 92 (2003) (quoting <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 145, 149-50, 521 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1999)). \u201c \u2018In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998)). \u201c \u2018[I]t is our duty to look to that evidence which tends to support the [conviction] and to permit the [conviction] to stand unless plainly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 752, 767, 589 S.E.2d 444, 451 (2003) (en banc) (quoting <em>Snyder v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 1009, 1016, 121 S.E.2d 452, 457 (1961)), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 040019 (Va.Sup.Ct. Order of 10/15/04). Indeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 153, 163, 515 S.E.2d 808, 813 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>A. Reckless Driving</p>\n<p id=\"Afk\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for reckless driving, appellant contends the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a disregard for the consequences of his acts and an indifference to the safety of life, limb or property. To the contrary, he argues, the evidence showed that, unlike Antonuccio, he \u201cwas conscious of and attempted to protect their safety.\u201d He asserts he merely attempted to exercise his right of way and, when he \u201crecognized that Antonuccio would not follow proper traffic rules, he ... \u2018back[ed] down\u2019 and slowed to allow Antonuccio to enter the right lane.\u201d Thus, he concludes, the evidence failed to show he drove recklessly and the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support a determination of guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-852 states that, \u201c[i]rrespective of the maximum speeds permitted by law, any person who drives a vehicle on any highway recklessly or at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person shall be guilty of reckless driving.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">The word \u201crecklessly\u201d as used in the statute imparts a disregard by the driver of a motor vehicle for the consequences of his act and an indifference to the safety of life, limb or property. Speed alone is not a violation of this statute, but only becomes so when it endangers life, limb or property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-7\">The essence of the offense of reckless driving lies not in the act of operating a vehicle, but in the manner and circumstances of its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-8\"><em>Powers v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 386, 388, 177 S.E.2d 628, 630 (1970) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In this case, the trial court found that, although appellant did not directly cause Antonuccio\u2019s accident, his accelerating to prevent Antonuccio from merging into the right lane ahead of him in the moments before her accident constituted reckless driving. Credible evidence in the record supports this finding, and the finding is not plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The evidence established that, when the traffic light turned green, appellant accelerated faster than he would have had Antonuccio\u2019s car not been in the left lane beside him, for no other reason than to keep her from merging into the right lane ahead of him. Having lived in the area for many years and \u201cfrustrated about people cutting others off all the time when they tried to merge at that location,\u201d appellant continued to \u201caccelerate briskly\u201d and drive alongside Antonuccio, despite knowing that Antonuccio wanted and intended to merge in front of him. Unwilling to fall behind Antonuccio, appellant continued to accelerate \u201c[w]ithin [the] distance of the merge,\u201d reaching speeds in excess of the speed limit. Only upon realizing as he approached the end of the merge that \u201che couldn\u2019t beat the red car\u201d did he \u201cback down\u201d and let Antonuccio go ahead of him. By then, Antonuccio\u2019s car \u201cwas going pretty fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">From this evidence, the trial court could reasonably conclude that, in continuing to accelerate through the merge area at a high speed despite knowing Antonuccio intended to merge in front of him, appellant drove with disregard for the consequences of his actions and an indifference to the safety of life, limb, or property. Appellant\u2019s familiarity with the road and his awareness that drivers in the left lane often cut off drivers in the right lane at the merge further support the finding that appellant was fully aware of the potential danger and, for the relevant period of time, disregarded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Appellant argues his conduct was not reckless because, \u201c[al]though he initially set out to maintain his right of way, he [eventually] recognized the potential for a dangerous situation and he acted in a manner to prevent a collision.\u201d In making such an argument, appellant seems to suggest that his conduct cannot constitute reckless driving because he avoided a collision. However, the reckless conduct for which appellant was convicted occurred not when he recognized and avoided the dangerous situation, but earlier when he helped create that situation. The fact that appellant ultimately considered the consequences of his actions and avoided a collision does not negate the fact that he was indifferent to the consequences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>his actions moments before when he was accelerating to prevent Antonuccio from merging in front of him. The commission of the crime of reckless driving was complete at that point, and the cessation of the offending conduct did not purge appellant\u2019s culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Appellant also argues that, unlike Antonuccio\u2019s driving, his driving was not reckless because he \u201chad the right of way and had the right to expect that Antonuccio would merge into the right lane behind him.\u201d In support of this argument, appellant cites the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Harris Motor Lines, Inc. v. Green, </em>184 Va. 984, 992, 37 S.E.2d 4, 6 (1946), that \u201c[a] person has the right to assume that everyone else will obey the law and perform his duty and to act upon that belief until the contrary appears.\u201d Thus, he argues, he may not be held criminally liable under <em>Harris Motor Lines </em>for assuming, as he continued to accelerate toward the merge with Antonuccio by his side, that Antonuccio would yield the right of way to him and properly merge behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">This argument is without merit. Even were we to assume <em>arguendo </em>that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Harris Motor Lines, </em>a case involving civil negligence rather than criminal recklessness,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is not misplaced, <em>see generally Morris v. Dame\u2019s Ex\u2019r, </em>161 Va. 545, 569, 171 S.E. 662, 671 (1933) (noting that the term \u201creckless driving\u201d as it appears in the criminal statute \u201cis not used with reference to the law of torts\u201d), appellant\u2019s own admissions belie his implicit claim that he expected Antonuccio to dutifully merge behind him. Indeed, appellant admitted the day after the accident and again at trial that he continued to accelerate in an attempt to reach the end of the merge first, even though he knew Antonuccio was accelerating in order to merge into the right lane ahead of him. Such knowledge renders appellant\u2019s argument and his reliance on <em>Harris Motor Lines </em>irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>We hold, therefore, that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">B. Failure to Report to a Law Enforcement Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for feloniously leaving the scene of an accident without reporting his identifying information to a law enforcement officer, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894, appellant contends the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in Antonuccio\u2019s accident and thus subject to the statute\u2019s mandate. Thus, he concludes, the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support a determination of guilt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 46.2-894 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">The driver of any vehicle <em>involved </em>in an accident in which a person is killed or injured or in which an attended vehicle ... is damaged shall immediately stop as close to the scene of the accident as possible without obstructing traffic ... and report his name, address, driver\u2019s license number, and vehicle registration number forthwith to the State Police or local law-enforcement agency....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-10\">Any person convicted of a violation of this section is guilty of ... a Class 5 felony if the accident results in injury to or the death of any person, or if the accident results in more than $1000 of damage to property____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, a conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894 requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the accident whose scene he is charged with leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">Appellant concedes, on appeal, that he left the scene of Antonuccio\u2019s accident without reporting his identifying information to a law enforcement officer. He contends, however, that he was not legally required to so report because, as the trial court found, he did not cause the accident. Thus, appellant argues, he was not \u201cinvolved\u201d in the accident within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. He was, he claims, nothing more than a witness who had no part in the accident. Accordingly, he concludes, he had no obligation to report to a law enforcement officer at the scene of the accident under Code \u00a7 46.2-894 and, thus, may not be held criminally liable for failing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Commonwealth contends that, although appellant may not have legally caused the accident, the record makes it absolutely clear that he was \u201cinvolved\u201d in it, given the plain meaning of that term. Appellant\u2019s actions, the Commonwealth asserts, had an effect on Antonuecio\u2019s actions and their combined conduct led to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">At issue, therefore, is whether appellant was \u201cinvolved\u201d in Antonuceio\u2019s accident within the contemplation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. \u201cBecause this is a question of law involving statutory interpretation, we review the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Schwartz v. Commonwealth, 45 </em>Va.App. 407, 424, 611 S.E.2d 631, 640 (2005) (citing <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998) (\u201cAlthough the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact are binding on appeal unless plainly wrong, we review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u201cIt is well established that, \u2018when, as here, a statute contains no express definition of a term, [we] infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used,\u2019 in light of the context in which the term at issue is used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425, 611 S.E.2d at 640 (quoting <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Partnership, 255 Va. </em>335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998)); <em>see also Sansom v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>257 Va. 589, 594-95, 514 S.E.2d 345, 349 (1999) (\u201cAn undefined term must be \u2018given its ordinary meaning, given the context in which it is used.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Taxation v. Orange-Madison Coop. Farm, Serv., </em>220 Va. 655, 658, 261 S.E.2d 532, 533-34 (1980))). \u201cInvolve\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cto draw in as a participant,\u201d to \u201cimplicate,\u201d \u201cto relate closely,\u201d to \u201cconnect,\u201d \u201cto have an effect on,\u201d to \u201cconcern directly,\u201d to \u201caffect.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1191 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Nothing in these definitions suggests that, for purposes of determining criminal liability under Code \u00a7 46.2-894, a driver must have legally caused an accident in order to be considered \u201cinvolved\u201d in the accident. Indeed, the various definitions make it clear, given the breadth of their scope, that a driver need only be \u201cimplicated in or connected with the accident in a substantial or logical manner\u201d to be \u201cinvolved\u201d in an accident under the statute. <em>People v.

Kerger, </em>191 Ill.App.3d 405, 138 Ill.Dec. 806, 548 N.E.2d 36, 39 (1989) (holding that \u201cinvolved\u201d means \u201cimplicated in an accident or connected with the accident in a substantial manner\u201d and that the defendant was \u201cinvolved\u201d in an accident when she swerved to miss a pedestrian who was then struck by the vehicle behind the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We hold, therefore, that the application of the statute is not exclusively limited to those drivers who legally cause an accident. Accordingly, a conviction under Code \u00a7 46.2-894 does not require proof that the defendant legally caused the accident. <em>See Sell, </em>215 P.2d at 772 (\u201cThe [failure to stop after an accident] statute ... is in no way made dependent upon ... who may ultimately be found to have been ... at fault.\u201d); <em>Kerger, </em>138 Ill.Dec. 806, 548 N.E.2d at 39 (\u201c[I]t is not necessary to determine, for purposes of deciding whether defendant was involved in a motor vehicle accident, whether defendant caused or was at fault for the accident....\u201d); <em>Oliver, </em>617 N.W.2d at 724 (noting that the defendant\u2019s \u201cacquittal of [involuntary manslaughter and negligent operation of a vehicle causing homicide] charges is not inconsistent with a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>that he was involved in the accident for the purposes of [the failure to stop after an accident statute]\u201d). Thus, we reject appellant\u2019s claim that he was not \u201cinvolved\u201d in the subject accident because the trial court found he did not cause it.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The question remains, however, whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient, as a matter of law, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the subject accident. The evidence established that, when the traffic light turned green, appellant and Antonuccio both drove from the intersection determined to be first through the merge. Resolute in his desire to prevent Antonuccio from cutting him off, appellant continued to accelerate despite knowing that Antonuccio was trying to pass him. Reaching a speed of approximately 50 miles per hour, appellant kept pace with Antonuccio as they neared the end of the merge. Moments before the merge ended, appellant \u201cbacked down\u201d and let Antonuccio merge in front of him. By then, Antonuccio\u2019s car \u201cwas going pretty fast\u201d on the downhill road. Almost immediately after merging, Antonuccio lost control of her car, left the road, and crashed into a tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">This evidence plainly shows that, regardless of whether he actually caused the accident, appellant had a substantial part in Antonuccio\u2019s accident. It is clear from the evidence that Antonuccio\u2019s high speed after completing the merge led to her losing control of her vehicle. It is also clear that appellant\u2019s conduct in accelerating through the merge area, despite knowing that Antonuccio was trying to pass and merge into his lane in front of him, contributed in a substantial way to Antonuccio\u2019s high speed. Plainly, had appellant stopped accelerating and allowed Antonuccio to pass him when he first became aware that she intended to merge in front of him, Antonuccio\u2019s speed would not have been as high following the merge and the accident may have been avoided. We conclude, therefore, that, as a participant in the uninterrupted chain of events that logically culminated in Antonuccio\u2019s accident, appellant was implicated in or connected with the accident in a substantial or logical manner and was thus \u201cinvolved\u201d in the accident within the contemplation of Code \u00a7 46.2-894. Accordingly, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>required to stop at the scene of the accident and report his identifying information to a law enforcement officer. Although he stopped and rendered aid at the scene of the accident, appellant failed to report to an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">We hold, therefore, that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient, as a matter of law, to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction for feloniously leaving the scene of an accident without reporting his identifying information to a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient, as a matter of law, to support appellant\u2019s convictions. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and appellant\u2019s convictions and remand to the trial court to correct the code reference in the sentencing order for the conviction of reckless driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">.
