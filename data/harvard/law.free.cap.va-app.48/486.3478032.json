Washington of rape. On appeal, Washington contends the trial court erred in permitting the victim to testify during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief of the sentencing phase of his trial. He asserts Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 only permitted the Commonwealth to introduce prior convictions during its case-in-chief and the trial judge should have permitted the victim impaet testimony, if at all, as rebuttal evidence. After applying basic rules of statutory construction, we disagree with Washington\u2019s interpretation of the statute; hence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Washington and a codefendant, Rayshod Martin, were indicted and tried jointly by a jury for the rape of a Hampton University student. The jury found Washington guilty of rape.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before the sentencing phase of the trial began, Washington\u2019s attorney informed the court of his intent to call witnesses during the sentencing phase. Similarly, the Commonwealth informed the court that it would call the victim to testify during its case-in-chief of the sentencing phase. Washington objected, and argued Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 only permitted the Commonwealth to present prior criminal convictions during its case-in-chief. Relying upon Code \u00a7 19.2-295.3, the court overruled the objection and permitted the victim to testify about the impact of the rape during the Commonwealth\u2019s ease-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">In deciding this appeal, the Court must review and consider the plain language set forth in Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-295.1 and 19.2-295.3. This initial step is necessary because \u201c \u2018[wjhere the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>has actually expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, after a jury has found a defendant guilty of a felony, the defendant is afforded a separate sentencing proceeding before the same jury to determine punishment. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP6\">At such proceeding, the Commonwealth shall present the defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions .... After the Commonwealth has introduced such evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Commonwealth or the defendant from introducing relevant, admissible evidence in rebuttal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The other provision at issue, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.3, concerns victim impact testimony. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.3 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">[U]pon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, the court shall permit the victim, as defined in \u00a7 19.2-11.01, upon motion of the attorney for the Commonwealth, to testify in the presence of the accused regarding the impact of the offense upon the victim .... In the case of trial by jury, the court shall permit the victim to testify at the sentencing hearing conducted pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-295.1 ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAe\">Recognizing this qualified right, we have held that \u201cvictims who wish to offer impact testimony at the sentencing hearing of a defendant found guilty of a felony have a statutorily protected right to testify in the presence of the jury.\u201d <em>Rock v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 254, 259, 610 S.E.2d 314, 316 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Washington contends that by the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, the Commonwealth is limited to introducing evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal convictions in its casein-chief of the sentencing proceeding and that any victim impact testimony presented pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.3 must be limited to rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In our prior opinions, this Court has described Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 as \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d and \u201cnot convey[ing] any substantive right.\u201d <em>Lebedun v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 697, 717, 501 S.E.2d 427, 437 (1998); <em>cf. Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 803, 805, 553 S.E.2d 729, 730 (2001) (providing that substantial compliance with the notice provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is sufficient absent any prejudice demonstrated by the defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We are guided by principles requiring that \u201cthe plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is always preferred to any curious, narrow or strained construction; a statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992). \u201cWhen one statute speaks to a subject in a general way and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more specific manner, the two should be harmonized, if possible, and where they conflict, the latter prevails.\u201d <em>Tharpe v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 37, 43-4, 441 S.E.2d 228, 232 (1994) (quoting <em>Virginia Nat\u2019l Bank v. Harris, </em>220 Va. 336, 340, 257 S.E.2d 867, 870 (1979)). Moreover, \u201ca fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d <em>Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 67, 480 S.E.2d 139, 144 (1997) (quoting <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In <em>Rock, </em>this Court recognized the General Assembly has \u201cexpanded the permissible scope of the [Crime Victim and Witness Rights] Act by establishing the victim\u2019s right to present victim impact <em>oral testimony </em>during the sentencing proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 45 Va.App. at 258, 610 S.E.2d at 316. Additionally, this Court examined key provisions of the Act where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>in the General Assembly utilized mandatory language concerning victim impact testimony, and, in particular, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3k\">The pertinent language of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2\u201411.01 (A)(4)(c) and 19.2-295.3 is mandatory. By explicitly providing that victims <em>shall </em>be allowed to testify regarding the impact of the offense on them when the defendant is found guilty of a felony, Code \u00a7 19.2-295.3 establishes the victim\u2019s right to testify without interference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Once it is determined that the persons who offer their impact testimony are \u201cvictims\u201d within the meaning of the statute, the court <em>shall </em>permit the victims to testify regarding the impact of the <em>offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 259, 610 S.E.2d at 316 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">If we were to accept Washington\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.3 as correct and agree that victim impact testimony should be permitted only during the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal, the result would nullify Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-11.01(A)(4)(c), 19.2-264.4, and 19.2-295.3. At a defendant\u2019s election, he or she could simply choose <em>not </em>to present evidence during the sentencing phase and thus preclude the Commonwealth from introducing victim impact testimony. Washington cites <em>Sheikh v. Buckingham Corr. Ctr., </em>264 Va. 558, 566, 570 S.E.2d 785, 789 (2002), as authority for his position. Although the Supreme Court recognized this to be a legitimate strategy to bar rebuttal evidence at the sentencing phase, the issue in <em>Sheikh </em>did not involve a victim\u2019s right to testify or the application of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-11.01(A)(4)(c), 19.2-264.4, or 19.2295.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Washington\u2019s analysis runs contrary to the mandatory nature of these statutes. His interpretation would defeat the obvious intent of the General Assembly and eviscerate the statutory right of victims \u201cto have the impact of those crimes upon their lives considered as part of the sentencing process, if that is their wish.\u201d <em>Beck v. Commonwealth, </em>253 Va. 373, 384, 484 S.E.2d 898, 905 (1997). It also ignores the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>rebuttal evidence. <em>See Byrd v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 371, 374 n. 1, 517 S.E.2d 243, 244, n. 1 (1999) (finding that \u201c[t]he admissibility of rebuttal evidence is generally restricted in scope to refuting matters brought out by its proponent\u2019s adversary\u201d). The statutes do not relegate victim impact testimony to rebuttal evidence; they provide the victim a qualified right to testify concerning the impact a particular crime has had on the victim\u2019s life. Pursuant to the mandatory requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-11.01(A)(4)(c), 19.2-264.4, and 19.2-295.3, the trial court was required to allow the victim to testify upon motion of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We believe a more logical interpretation of the reference to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, as set forth in \u00a7 19.2-295.3, is simply to identify the sentencing hearing as the phase of the trial during which victim impact testimony shall be admitted. In doing so, the General Assembly clarified that evidence pertaining to the extent of physical, psychological, or economic harm the crime has had on the life of the victim, while relevant to punishment, is not relevant to the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Finally, in criminal cases the trial court has discretion to determine the order of proof, and its ruling will not be reversed on appeal, absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>See Quintana v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 127, 142, 295 S.E.2d 643, 650 (1982). Here, the victim had a qualified, statutorily protected right to be heard at sentencing, and it was within the trial judge\u2019s ultimate discretion to decide <em>when </em>she would be heard pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">After applying fundamental rules of statutory construction, we find the reference to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, as set forth in \u00a7 19.2-295.3, is not intended to limit victim impact testimony but merely identifies the sentencing phase of the trial as the appropriate forum for victim impact testimony. In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the rape victim to testify during the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief of the sentencing phase of Washington\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>For these reasons we affirm Washington\u2019s conviction for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-10\">. Martin was convicted of attempted rape. He raises identical issues on appeal in Record Number 0413-05-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-7\">.
