Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 460, 618 S.E.2d 347 (2005). The trial court convicted appellant of drunk driving in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. The question presented by appellant to the panel read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">Is the certificate of breath analysis produced specifically for use at trial to prove the guilt of the accused testimonial evidence and thus constitutionally inadmissible when the analyst is not unavailable and there had not been a prior opportunity for cross-examination by the accused?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">The panel affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress (1) a written breath test analysis result and (2) an accompanying certificate which verified both the operability of the testing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>machine and the validity of the machine operator\u2019s license. The panel held that neither was \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence proscribed by the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution as addressed in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">By order dated September 12, 2005, we granted appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction on grounds more narrow than, and independent of, the panel decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Pursuant to Rule 5A:8(c), the parties presented an agreed statement of facts, in lieu of a transcript, of the trial court proceedings. The following summary of the evidence contains quotations from that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">On November 25, 2003, Officer Darren Day was on patrol on Richmond Highway in Fairfax County.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">[H]e observed the three cars in front of him brake abruptly, in order to avoid an accident. Officer Day noticed a white station wagon had pulled onto Richmond Highway from a parking lot and was perpendicular to the lanes of travel. That vehicle remained in the road a few seconds and then made a slow right turn. The station wagon was weaving, and at one point missed hitting the curb by approximately two inches. The vehicle made a slow left turn into a shopping center, causing the vehicles approaching it to brake to avoid a collision. Those vehicles flashed their lights and honked their horns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">Officer Day effected a traffic stop and identified the driver as the appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">Officer Day detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage about the defendant. The defendant\u2019s eyes appeared glassy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>and bloodshot. Mr. Luginbyhl\u2019s face was red, and he exhibited sluggish motor skills. When asked how much he had to drink, Mr. Luginbyhl responded, \u201cI had a lot.\u201d He indicated that he had had approximately six to eight vodka drinks. The defendant began to fall forward as he stepped from his vehicle, so Officer Day put his hand on defendant\u2019s chest to steady him. The officer directed Mr. Luginbyhl to lean against the car for support. The defendant stated that he had consumed \u201c6, 7 or 8 vodka drinks\u201d which were of the size of a 12-ounce cup inside the vehicle. The defendant was cooperative in performing field sobriety tests. In performing the finger-to-nose test, the defendant attempted to touch his nose four times. He succeeded one time, and touched his cheek and forehead on other attempts. Which attempting to perform a one-legged stand test, the defendant stopped, began to cry, and stated: \u201cI\u2019m drunk; I\u2019m an alcoholic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Officer Day conducted a preliminary breath test at the scene. Subsequently, Mr. Luginbyhl agreed to take a breath analysis at the police station. Officer Caine, who was not present at trial, performed that analysis while Officer Day observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The analysis showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.24%. Officer Caine executed the accompanying certificate. The certificate read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">ATTEST:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS AN ACCURATE RECORD OF THE TEST CONDUCTED; THAT THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE METHODS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, DIVISION OF FORENSIC SCIENCE; THAT THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIVISION\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS; THAT THE EQUIPMENT ON WHICH THE BREATH TEST WAS CONDUCTED HAS BEEN TESTED WITHIN THE PAST SIX MONTHS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>AND FOUND TO BE ACCURATE; THAT PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST THE ACCUSED WAS ADVISED OF HIS RIGHT TO OBSERVE THE PROCESS AND SEE THE BLOOD ALCOHOL READING ON THE EQUIPMENT USED TO PERFORM THE BREATH TEST, AND THAT I POSSESS A VALID LICENSE TO CONDUCT SUCH TEST, GIVEN UNDER MY HAND THIS 25TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Over objection, the trial court admitted the analysis and certificate pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court convicted appellant of driving while intoxicated in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 and sentenced him to 180 days in jail and a fine of $350. The entire fine and 170 of the days of the jail sentence were suspended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">DECISIONAL BASIS</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Appellant maintains we should substantively address the <em>Crawford </em>issue decided in the panel opinion. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201cIt is a well recognized principle of appellate review that constitutional questions should not be decided if the record permits final disposition of a cause on non-constitutional grounds.\u201d <em>Keller v. Denny, </em>232 Va. 512, 516, 352 S.E.2d 327, 329 (1987). <em>See also Volkswagen of America v. Smit, </em>266 Va. 444, 454, 587 S.E.2d 526, 532 (2003) (\u201c[A] court will not rule upon the constitutionality of a statute unless such a determination is absolutely necessary to decide the merits of the case.\u201d). A congruent principle is one that an appellate court decides cases \u201con the best and narrowest ground available.\u201d <em>Air Courier Conference v. Am. Postal Workers Union, </em>498 U.S. 517, 531, 111 S.Ct. 913, 922, 112 L.Ed.2d 1125 (1991) (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Coupled with these principles of judicial prudence is the proposition that an appellate court may structure a decision upon an \u201cassuming but not deciding\u201d basis. Such a basis does not foreclose a future review of a constitutional issue and, moreover, does not bind those\u2014here, potentially the Commonwealth\u2014subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to the effect of a decision. Finally, the \u201cassuming but not deciding\u201d basis is useful for a \u201charmless error\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Thus, and as specifically applicable to the instant case, the Court in <em>United States v. McClain, </em>377 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir.2004), held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">It is well established that violations of the Confrontation Clause, if preserved for appellate review, are subject to' harmless error review, however, and <em>Crawford </em>does not suggest otherwise. <em>See, e.g., Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 1021, 108 S.Ct. 2798, [2803,] 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988) (holding that denial of face-to-face confrontation is subject to harmless error review); <em>United States v. Tropeano, </em>252 F.3d 653, 659 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[H]armless error analysis applies to evidentiary errors and to violations of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 76, 124 S.Ct. at 1378 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the judgment) (noting that the <em>Crawford </em>majority \u201cimplicitly] recogniti[zed] that the mistaken applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tion of its new rule by courts which guess wrong as to the scope of the rule is subject to harmless-error analysis\u201d); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>429 F.3d 767, 774 (8th Cir.2005) (assuming \u201cthat a Confrontation Clause error occurred,\u201d but holding \u201cthat the error in admitting [the hearsay] statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d reasoning that \u201c[t]he independent evidence ... was so overwhelming\u201d that the defendant\u2019s \u201cconviction cannot be attributed to [the inadmissible] statement\u201d (internal quotations omitted)); <em>see also Pitt v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 692, 696, 539 S.E.2d 77, 79 (2000) (assuming that the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the hearsay statement of a co-conspirator violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, but then holding that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because \u201cthe evidence as a whole, excluding [the hearsay] statement, overwhelmingly proved that [the defendant] is guilty,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthere was no reasonable possibility that [the] statement might have contributed to [the defendant\u2019s] conviction\u201d); <em>Dearing v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 671, 674, 536 S.E.2d 903, 904 (2000) (holding that, although the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by admitting the hearsay statement of a co-conspirator, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Therefore, we assume without deciding that (1) the breath analysis result and (2) the accompanying certificate were \u201ctestimonial\u201d and their introduction in evidence, despite Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9, was constitutional error under <em>Crawford. </em>Our decision thus relies upon the applicable \u201charmless error\u201d standard of review alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">In <em>Corado v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 315, 623 S.E.2d 452 (2005), we addressed the standard of review for harmless constitutional error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-9\">We begin our analysis by reiterating the heightened standard under which we review constitutional error for harm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>lessness. \u201cWhen a trial court admits evidence in violation of the United States Constitution, the court\u2019s error is a constitutional one.\u201d \u201cBefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u201cWe decide whether the erroneous admission of evidence was sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal on the basis of our own reading of the record and on what seems to us to have been the probable impact on the fact finder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 323, 623 S.E.2d at 456 (quoting <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 378, 383, 517 S.E.2d 246, 249 (1999) (additional citations omitted)). <em>See also Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 259, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731 (2001) (\u201cWhen a federal constitutional error is involved, a reviewing court must reverse the judgment unless it determines that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-266 makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to drive ... a motor vehicle ... while such person is under the influence of alcohol.\u201d The agreed statement of facts recites that \u201cthe driver of the vehicle was identified as the defendant\u201d and that the defendant told Officer Day, \u201cI\u2019m drunk.\u201d This confession is corroborated, again quoting from the agreed statement of facts, because appellant \u201chad a strong odor of alcohol,\u201d \u201cglassy and bloodshot\u201d eyes, and a \u201cred face\u201d; \u201cexhibited sluggish motor skills\u201d; and \u201cfell forward as he stepped from his vehicle.\u201d Appellant told Officer Day he had \u201ca lot to drink\u201d and defined \u201ca lot\u201d as \u201c6, 7 or 8 vodka drinks\u201d the size of a 12-ounce cup in his vehicle. Appellant \u201cattempted to touch his nose four times ... [but only] ... succeeded one time.\u201d While failing a one-legged stand test, the appellant began to cry and told Officer Day, \u201cI\u2019m an alcoholic.\u201d This evidence, without the breath analysis, proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Upon this record, assuming but not deciding that the trial court committed constitutional error by admitting the breath test analysis and its accompanying certificate, we conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Thus, appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"An\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-14\">. 46 Va.App. 545, 620 S.E.2d 125 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9 states in relevant part: \"This certif\u00edcate, when attested by the individual conducting the breath test, shall be admissible in any court in any criminal ... proceeding as evidence of the facts therein stated and of the results of such analysis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">. At oral argument appellant maintained for the first time that the breath test analysis of 0.24% may have caused the trial court to enhance appellant\u2019s punishment to an effective jail sentence of 10 days. On the day of the offense, November 25, 2003, the penally provisions of Code \u00a7 18.2-270, as applicable to Code \u00a7 18.2-266, provided for a mandatory minimum incarceration of 5 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">That issue was not presented to the trial court and, accordingly, was not preserved for appeal as required by Rule 5A:18. Also, appellant does not ask this Court to invoke the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18, and \"[tjhis Court will not consider, <em>sua sponte, </em>an ends-of-justice argument under Rule 5A:18.\u201d <em>Widdifield v.

Moreover, even if the appellant had preserved this issue below, it was not a question presented in the petition for appeal as required by Rule 5A:12(c), nor was the issue briefed as required by Rule 5A:20. Accordingly, the issue is defaulted, and we do not consider it. <em>See Gregory v.

Commonwealth, </em>46 Va.App. 460, 478-85, 618 S.E.2d 347, 357-60 (2005) (Benton, J., dissenting), I would hold that admission of the evidence violated Alan Luginbyhl\u2019s rights as protected by the Confrontation Clause and, further, that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">This appeal challenges the admissibility of a certificate of breath analysis containing the attestation of a government employee who did not testify at trial. Luginbyhl contends that by admitting the certificate into evidence, the trial judge violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The certificate of analysis, which the trial judge admitted in evidence over a hearsay objection, is signed by a \u201cbreath test operator\u201d under the following attestation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">I CERTIFY THAT THE ABOVE IS AN ACCURATE RECORD OF THE TEST CONDUCTED; THAT THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE METHODS APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES, DIVISION OF FORENSIC SCIENCE; THAT THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIVISION\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS; THAT THE EQUIPMENT ON WHICH THE BREATH TEST WAS CONDUCTED HAS BEEN TESTED WITHIN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND FOUND TO BE ACCURATE; THAT PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION OF THE TEST THE ACCUSED WAS ADVISED OF HIS RIGHT TO OBSERVE THE PROCESS AND SEE THE BLOOD ALCOHOL READING ON THE EQUIPMENT USED TO PERFORM THE BREATH TEST, AND THAT I POSSESS A VALID LI<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>CENSE TO CONDUCT SUCH TEST, GIVEN UNDER MY HAND THIS 25TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">These assertions were made to satisfy Code \u00a7 18.2-268.9. The record establishes, however, that Luginbyhl did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the breath test operator to test the veracity of his statements. Without dispute, the operator\u2019s attestation statements constitute hearsay. The issue in this case is whether that hearsay was testimonial and thus barred by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d The United States Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), recently interpreted the requirements of the Sixth Amendment by reviewing its text and the historical record.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Examining the historical background of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, the Court held that \u201chistory supports two inferences about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d 541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1363. The Court identified those inferences as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">First, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused____ The Sixth Amendment must be interpreted with this focus in mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-11\">The historical record also supports a second proposition: that the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. The text of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest any open-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement to be developed by the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 50, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1363, 1365. In view of this historical analysis, the Supreme Court overruled the reliability test set forth in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), because of \u201cits demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63, 124 S.Ct. at 1371. The previously accepted reliability test allowed hearsay evidence to be admitted as long as it had \u201cadequate \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 \u201d and the witness was unavailable. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539. As the Court explained in <em>Crawford: </em>\u201cWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u201d 541 U.S. at 68-69, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. Thus, the Sixth Amendment gives a criminal defendant the right to confront testimonial evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">In plain terms, <em>Crawford </em>describes a \u201ccore class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d as including \u201caffidavits,\u201d any \u201csimilar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d and \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. When governmental agents are involved, this concern is heightened. As the <em>Crawford </em>Court noted, the \u201c[ijnvolvement of government officers in the production of testimony with an eye toward trial presents unique potential for prosecutorial abuse\u2014a fact borne out time and again throughout a history with which the Framers were keenly familiar.\u201d 541 U.S. at 56 n. 7, 124 S.Ct. at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The operator conducted the breath analysis and prepared the attestation solely to provide evidence in court to prove the facts necessary to convict Luginbyhl. This cannot be fairly disputed. Indeed, the attestation statement asserts the existence of seven facts or circumstances said to be true by the \u201cbreath test operator.\u201d Simply put, the certificate of blood analysis that was admitted in evidence in this case is testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>nial under the narrowest of the <em>Crawford </em>definitions and, thus, falls squarely within the <em>Crawford </em>bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Luginbyhl accurately asserts that the \u201ccertificate ... was a formalized, <em>ex parte </em>statement made by a government agent for the sole purpose of being used prosecutorially in court in lieu of his live testimony.\u201d It seems to me that the use of this type of statement was the paradigmatic violation the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Crawford. </em>As the Court discussed in its historical analysis, the judges at a treason trial against Sir Walter Raleigh permitted the prosecution to read to a jury an affidavit or letter from an alleged co-conspirator, Cobham, in \u201c[t]he most notorious instance of civil-law examination\u201d in a criminal trial. 541 U.S. at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360. This was an abuse the Confrontation Clause was enacted to end.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">The Raleigh trial itself involved the very sorts of reliability determinations that <em>Roberts </em>authorizes. In the face of Raleigh\u2019s repeated demands for confrontation, the prosecution responded with many of the arguments a court applying <em>Roberts </em>might invoke today: that Cobham\u2019s statements were self-inculpatory, that they were not made in the heat of passion, and that they were not \u201cextracted from [him] upon any hopes or promise of Pardon.\u201d It is not plausible that the Framers\u2019 only objection to the trial was that Raleigh\u2019s judges did not properly weigh these factors before sentencing him to death. Rather, the problem was that the judges refused to allow Raleigh to confront Cobham in court, where he could cross-examine him and try to expose his accusation as a lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370-71 (citations omitted). The Supreme Court observed that despite Raleigh\u2019s freedom to confront in court those who read Cobham\u2019s letter, this was an insufficient protection of a right to confrontation because \u201c[l]eaving the regulation of out-of-court statements to the law of evidence would render the Confrontation Clause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. In other words, to protect the right of confrontation, Cobham\u2019s letter would be inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment because the Confrontation Clause \u201cre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>fleets a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The Commonwealth suggests that the certificate is not \u201ctestimonial\u201d because <em>Crawford </em>limits the definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements to \u201c(1) \u2018prior testimony at preliminary hearings, before a grand jury, or at a former trial,\u2019 and-(2) statements garnered from witnesses during \u2018police interrogations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>however, expressly includes other formulations of \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, such as \u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions, ... [and] statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citations omitted). As the Court noted, \u201c[t]hese formulations all share a common nucleus\u201d because they are statements reasonably expected to be used at trial. <em>See id. </em>at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. The Court did not just focus on the \u201cform\u201d of the evil but, rather, upon the substance: depriving a defendant of the opportunity to meaningfully confront the state\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The certificate of analysis does not evade the definition of hearsay by reporting statements generated by a machine. It clearly comprises information supplied by a person and an attestation by a person of facts. Indeed, even a cursory review of the seven facts the operator certifies demonstrates they are not mere statements generated by a machine. For example, the operator attests \u201cthat prior to administration of the test the accused was advised of his right to observe the process and see the blood alcohol reading on the equipment used to perform the breath test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Assertions that the breath test operator was not an \u201caccuser\u201d and that this evidence is somehow \u201cneutral\u201d presupposes that cross-examination of the blood test operator could not serve any valid purpose, when, in fact, there were a number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>effective means to cross-examine the operator concerning each of the attestations in the certificate. The certificate proclaimed that the equipment, the record it generated, the breath test, and the operator of the equipment all yielded a result that conformed to statutory requirements and that incriminated Luginbyhl. Without cross-examination, the certificate had the effect of reinforcing the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of prosecution. The \u201ccrucible of cross-examination\u201d could have exposed any weaknesses in the operator\u2019s qualifications, his perception, the state of the equipment, or the test protocol.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s characterizations of the operator\u2019s statements as \u201cneutral\u201d and \u201cnon-accusatory\u201d also suggest a type of safeguard that is intended to render the statements more reliable or trustworthy as evidence. Nothing in <em>Crawford </em>declares that the hearsay statement must accuse Luginbyhl of wrongdoing to be testimonial or that statements which appear neutral in character are nontestimonial. Indeed, nothing within the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d equates with \u201caccusatory.\u201d Furthermore, it is a dubious conclusion that evidence created for use by the prosecutor at trial could ever be \u201cneutral\u201d in the context of the adversarial system in a criminal proceeding. \u201cThe Framers would be astounded to learn that <em>ex parte </em>testimony could be admitted against a criminal defendant because it was elicited by \u2018neutral\u2019 government officers.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 66, 124 S.Ct. at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Giving a trial judge the discretion to determine whether a statement is \u201caccusatory\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d smacks of the \u201copen ended balancing\u201d reliability analysis the Court rejected in <em>Crawford: </em>\u201cThe <em>Roberts </em>test allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability ... [and] replaces the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. The Supreme Court warned that these were the very kinds of \u201cvague\u201d and \u201cmanipulable\u201d standards the Framers \u201cwere loath to leave ... in judicial hands.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 124 S.Ct. at 1373. Thus, the Court rejected the general concept of \u201creplacing categorical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>constitutional guarantees with open-ended balancing tests\u201d and held that those tests \u201cdo violence to [the Framers\u2019] design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 124 S.Ct. at 1373. According to the Supreme Court, the Confrontation Clause \u201ccommands, not that evidence be rehable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Thus, the Supreme Court explicitly and \u201conce again rejected] the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its own force only to in-court testimony, and that its application to out-of-court statements introduced at trial depends upon \u2018the law of Evidence for the time being.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citation omitted). These rulings perforce reject injecting a manipulable evidentiary standard to avoid the constitutional command of <em>Crawford </em>under the guise of characterizing the evidence as \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cnot accusatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Simply put, \u201c[admitting statements deemed rehable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Whether the evidence is accusatory or neutral, it does \u201cbear testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. It was prepared for use at trial by a government agent; it was a substitute for an actual witness; it was admitted in evidence without the opportunity of cross-examination. The relevant factors under <em>Crawford </em>are that the evidence in the certificate was generated to discover and report evidence against Luginbyhl, the accused, and was later used at trial for that purpose without the opportunity of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The Commonwealth cites several appellate courts that have ruled affidavits to be nontestimonial. Other appehate courts, however, addressing this precise issue, have ruled that similar affidavits are testimonial and barred by <em>Crawford. See, e.g., Shiver v. State, </em>900 So.2d 615, 618 (Fla.App.2005) (holding that a breath test affidavit \u201ccontained statements one would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially, ... was made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness to reasonably believe the statements would be available for trial,\u201d and was testimonial); <em>City of Las Vegas v. Walsh, </em>120 Nev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>392, 91 P.3d 591, 595 (2004) (holding that an affidavit \u201coffered to prove certain facts concerning use of certain devices ... related to determining presence of alcohol\u201d is one prepared for use at trial and is testimonial); <em>People v. Rogers, </em>8 A.D.3d 888, 780 N.Y.S.2d 393, 397 (2004) (holding that a blood test report \u201cgenerated by the desire to discover evidence against defendant\u201d was testimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In any event, to decide this case, we need not go beyond the text of <em>Crawford. </em>Plainly understood, the language in <em>Crawford </em>leads to the conclusion that this certificate of analysis is testimonial just as \u201caffidavits ... the defendant was unable to cross-examine.\u201d 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. As the Supreme Court noted, \u201c[w]here testimonial statements are involved, we do not ... leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. In other words, \u201c[dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty. This is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Without addressing the substantive issue on appeal, the majority concludes that any alleged error in admitting the certificate was harmless. The majority bases this on Luginbyhl\u2019s statement to the officer that he was \u201cdrunk\u201d and an alcoholic and on the officer\u2019s observations of his demeanor and conduct. I would hold, however, that the record fails to demonstrate that the trial judge\u2019s decision was not affected by the statutory presumption of intoxication triggered by the certificate of analysis. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We succinctly addressed in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 395, 528 S.E.2d 166 (2000), the contours of the analysis required when a Confrontation Clause error occurs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMD\">Constitutional error is harmless ... only if \u201cthe beneficiary of the constitutional error ... proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>verdict obtained.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24[, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705] (1967). \u201cThe test, therefore, is not whether laying aside the erroneously admitted evidence there was other evidence sufficient to convict beyond a reasonable doubt ..., but, more stringently, \u2018whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompson v. Leeke, </em>756 F.2d 314, 316 (4th Cir.1985) (citation omitted). In other words, even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the ... verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed testimony may well have affected the ... decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">An \u201cemphasis and perhaps overemphasis, upon the [concept] of \u2018overwhelming evidence\u2019 \u201d has the effect of clouding the relevant question \u201c \u2018whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23[, 87 S.Ct. at 827] (footnote and citations omitted). As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cthe correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the [evidence] were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>[Delaware v.] Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. [673,] 684[, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986) ]; <em>see also Olden v. Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 232[, 109 S.Ct. 480, 483, 102 L.Ed.2d 513] (1988). Thus, \u201ca harmless error analysis ... [is not] simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\"><em>Williams, </em>32 Va.App. at 399-400, 528 S.E.2d at 168-69 (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">When the trial judge admitted the certificate of analysis, its statement that Luginbyhl\u2019s blood alcohol level reached .24% triggered the statutory presumption of intoxication. Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A)(3) provides that if a chemical analysis of the accused\u2019s blood shows that the blood alcohol level was .08% or more, \u201cit shall be presumed that the accused was under the influence of alcohol.\u201d It is reasonably possible that the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>attached significant weight to the incriminating evidence in the certificate in spite of strong independent evidence of Luginbyhl\u2019s intoxication. <em>See Thomas v. Town of Marion, </em>226 Va. 251, 254, 308 S.E.2d 120, 122 (1983); <em>Castillo v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 482, 487-91, 465 S.E.2d 146, 148-50 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Indeed, in <em>Thomas, </em>where the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence a certificate of analysis showing the accused had a blood alcohol content of .17% by weight by volume, the evidence proved the accused was unsteady on his feet, \u201chad a strong odor of alcohol about his person, his speech was slurred, and his face was flushed,\u201d and, further, the accused \u201cadmitted consuming two beers and a shot of whiskey.\u201d 226 Va. at 253, 308 S.E.2d at 121. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled that the non-constitutional error was not harmless because it was \u201cprobable\u201d the trier of fact \u201cattached great weight to the incriminating information in the certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 308 S.E.2d at 122. This ruling, using the less exacting non-constitutional error standard, <em>see Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 260, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731-32 (2001), <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005-06, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991), renders it more than probable in this case that evidence of similar quality was, likewise, not harmless when viewed under the standard required for constitutional error. <em>See Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 23, 87 S.Ct. at 827 (adopting the standard in <em>Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230-31, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963), \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction\u201d); <em>see also Long v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 223, 227, 456 S.E.2d 138, 140 (1995) (holding that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proving that the error in severing charges for trial did not affect both the verdict and sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Likewise, <em>Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 333, 492 S.E.2d 131 (1997), demonstrates the strictness of the constitutional error standard, which requires the Commonwealth to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous admission of the evidence was harmless regarding punishment as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>well.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In that case, the trial judge allowed a clinical psychologist to testify that based on his ten meetings with a child that \u201cthe child \u2018had been sexually abused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336, 492 S.E.2d at 132. The jury convicted the defendant of aggravated sexual battery, recommending a twenty-year sentence, the maximum under the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 492 S.E.2d at 132. Although this Court ruled that the trial judge deprived the defendant of his constitutional right to a jury trial by allowing an expert to testify on the ultimate issue, this Court held the error to be harmless in light of the defendant\u2019s confession. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court disagreed and reversed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 492 S.E.2d at 133. The Supreme Court held that although the defendant\u2019s admission of a single episode of abuse sufficiently supported a finding of guilt, the expert testimony \u201cwas prejudicial for purposes of fixing the quantum of punishment imposed\u201d because the expert testimony alluded to repeated abuse. <em>Id. </em>The Court could not find that the trial judge\u2019s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 492 S.E.2d at 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Significantly, the psychologist did not directly testify in <em>Jenkins </em>that the abuse was ongoing or otherwise particularly severe. Yet, the possibilities that the trier of fact inferred the severity of the abuse from the inappropriate testimony and that the verdict could have been affected by that inference were enough to keep the error from being harmless. The error in Luginbyhl\u2019s case is more harmful than the error in <em>Jenkins </em>because Code \u00a7 18.2-269(A)(3) essentially required that the trial judge consider the certificate of analysis as presumptive of guilt. In view of this statutory presumption of guilt, this record in this case does more than merely raise the possibility that the fact finder was swayed by a possible inference drawn from the improperly admitted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">I believe we cannot reasonably conclude from the circumstances of this case that the government has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error could not have affected the verdict or the sentence. For these reasons, I would hold that the admission of the document violated Luginbyhl\u2019s rights as protected by the Confrontation Clause and that a reasonable possibility exists that the error did affect the verdict and the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b125-5\">. I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that Rules 5A:18, 5A:12(c), and 5A:20 preclude consideration of whether the alleged error could have affected Luginbyhl\u2019s sentence. <em>See supra </em>note 3. Luginbyhl properly objected when the evidence was offered at trial. Luginbyhl had no obligation to ask the trial judge to conduct a harmless error review of the judge's own error when the judge admitted the evidence. <em>See Hackney v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 288, 295-96, 504 S.E.2d 385, 389 (1998) (holding that a trial judge may not consider the possible harm of an error as a basis of an initial decision to admit improper evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The harmless error inquiry is the process by which a reviewing court identifies trial error and then determines whether that error affected the judgment. <em>See Sochor v. Florida, </em>504 U.S. 527, 539-40, 112 S.Ct. 2114, 2122-23, 119 L.Ed.2d 326 (1992); <em>Pope v. Illinois, </em>481 U.S. 497, 504, 107 S.Ct. 1918, 1923, 95 L.Ed.2d 439 (1987). This is so because the purpose of the harmless error rule \"is 'to conserve judicial resources by enabling appellate courts to cleanse the judicial process of prejudicial error without becoming mired in harmless error.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (citation omitted). Furthermore, the principle is well established that the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving the error was harmless. <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828; <em>see also Joyner v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 471, 476-78, 65 S.E.2d 555, 558-59 (1951). Thus, although Luginbyhl is obligated to raise the alleged error on appeal, he is not obligated to raise the harmless error doctrine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
