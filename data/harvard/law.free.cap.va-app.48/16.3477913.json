She argues that on appeal of her contempt conviction in juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court), the circuit court erred in admitting into evidence a Certificate of Conviction (certificate) prepared by the JDR judge pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459. The certificate outlined the circumstances that led the JDR judge to hold Gilman in contempt. Gilman claims the admission of the certificate violated her Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. We disagree and affirm her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The facts involved in this appeal are not in dispute. Gilman was convicted of contempt in the Henry County JDR Court and appealed to the Henry County Circuit Court. The circuit court admitted and considered the certificate prepared by the JDR judge pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The certificate indicates that appellant was convicted of contempt for \u201c[misbehavior\u201d and \u201c[disobedience or resistance.\u201d More specifically, the certificate states that the JDR judge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">certifies pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-459 that the defendant named herein is IN CONTEMPT under Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u00a7 18.2-456 and is punished summarily for contempt under Code \u00a7 18.2-458 for the following: Misbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice; ... [and] Disobedience or resistance of ... [a] person to any lawful process, judgment, decree or order of the court, including failure to appear or intentional obstruction of a witness under Code \u00a7 19.2-267.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE\">The certificate also sets forth the \u201ccircumstances\u201d of the conviction. Gilman was before the court because her daughter was in foster care, and the \u201cevidence\u201d showed that Gilman tested positive for illegal drugs two months earlier. Thus, \u201cthe court ... ordered a drug screen. [Gilman] said she needed something to drink and then left the building.\u201d For this contempt, Gilman was fined by the JDR court twenty-five dollars and sentenced to ten days in jail. The certificate is signed by the JDR judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The circuit court judge admitted the certificate over Gilman\u2019s Sixth Amendment objection. Gilman presented no evidence in her defense. Accordingly, the circuit court convicted Gilman of contempt and sentenced her to five days in jail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Gilman argues she was entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court on her appeal from the JDR court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-136, and the circuit court\u2019s admission of the certificate, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459, over her objection, violated her right to confront witnesses as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Specifically, Gilman maintains she was \u201cnot afforded an opportunity to confront the [JDR] judge who prepared the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>certificate. Without an opportunity to cross-examine [the judge], this testimonial hearsay should have been excluded\u201d based on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court held that the Confrontation Clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not permit the introduction of out-of-court testimonial evidence at trial unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1373-74.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In this case, the circuit court admitted into evidence the certificate setting forth the circumstances of Gilman\u2019s contempt in accordance with the express terms of Code \u00a7 18.2-459. Challenging the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-459, Gilman contends that the certificate constituted out-of-court testimonial evidence in violation of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In our analysis of Gilman\u2019s constitutional challenge to Code \u00a7 18.2-459, we are guided by basic principles of judicial review. \u201c[A]ll actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional.\u201d <em>Etheridge v. Medical Ctr. Hosps., </em>237 Va. 87, 94, 376 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1989). \u201cThis presumption is \u2018one of the strongest known to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyd v. County of Henrico, </em>42 Va.App. 495, 507, 592 S.E.2d 768, 774 (2004) (quoting <em>Harrison v. Day, </em>200 Va. 764, 770, 107 S.E.2d 594, 598 (1959)). \u201cUnder it, courts must \u2018resolve any reasonable doubt\u2019 regarding the constitutionality of a law in favor of its validity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Phillips, </em>265 Va. 81, 85, 574 S.E.2d 270, 272 (2003)). \u201c \u2018To doubt is to affirm.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Peery v. Bd. of Funeral Dirs., </em>203 Va. 161, 165, 123 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">It is well established that the Confrontation Clause is limited to trials in criminal prosecutions, whereas a summary proceeding for a petty direct contempt is neither a trial nor a criminal prosecution within the scope of the Sixth Amendment. Nor is there a constitutional right of appeal from such a proceeding. In this instance, however, the General Assembly has created a statutory right of appeal from JDR court to circuit court, where the certificate from the JDR court is allowed into evidence and the JDR judge is prohibited from being called as a witness. The proceeding in circuit court is thus a unique statutory hearing requiring a <em>de novo </em>determination, not a trial <em>de novo, </em>as in other appeals from district courts. As such, the admission of the certificate pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459 did not implicate any of Gilman\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights, and we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\n<em>JDR Court Proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The common law is clear that \u201c[cjontempt proceedings are <em>sui </em>generis.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 318, 323, 477 S.E.2d 7, 9 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As explained in <em>Myers v. United States, </em>264 U.S. 95, 104-05, 44 S.Ct. 272, 273, 68 L.Ed. 577 (1924), \u201c[wjhile contempt may be an offense against the law and subject to appropriate punishment, certain it is that since the foundation of our government proceedings to punish such offenses have been regarded as <em>sui generis </em>and not \u2018criminal prosecutions\u2019 within the Sixth Amendment or common understanding.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The \u201cconfrontation\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>confrontation at trial,\u201d <em>Nelson v.

Bagwell, </em>512 U.S. 821, 832, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 2559-60, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Appellant was convicted in the JDR court under Code \u00a7 18.2-456 for a direct summary contempt.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The maximum punishment for a violation under this statute is a f\u00edne of $250 or imprisonment for 10 days,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> thus constituting a petty criminal contempt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In such a petty direct summary contempt, \u201c \u2018[w]here the contempt is committed in the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the court, it is competent for it to proceed upon its own knowledge of the facts, and to punish the offender without further proof, and without issue or trial in any form.\u2019 \u201d <em>Davis v.

This is due to the fact that \u201c[c]ontempt is a singular proceeding in our jurisprudence which implicates the trial court itself in both the offense and its adjudication and requires treatment suitable to this anomaly.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 368, 372, 417 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1992).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That a court may punish one who commits a direct contempt of court without the rights and benefits accorded a defendant in a trial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">is ... settled doctrine in the jurisprudence both of England and of this country, [and] never supposed to be in conflict with the liberty of the citizen____ [S]uch power, although arbitrary in its nature and liable to abuse, is absolutely essential to the protection of the courts in the discharge of their functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-7\"><em>Ex Parte Terry, </em>128 U.S. 289, 313, 9 S.Ct. 77, 83, 32 L.Ed. 405 (1888).

The United States Supreme Court has never held that the states are constitutionally required to establish avenues of appellate review of criminal convictions. <em>M.L.B. v. S.L.J., </em>519 U.S. 102, 110, 117 S.Ct. 555, 560-61, 136 L.Ed.2d 473 (1996); <em>Rinaldi v. Yeager, </em>384 U.S. 305, 310, 86 S.Ct. 1497, 1500, 16 L.Ed.2d 577 (1966); <em>Griffin v.

That statute provides that any final order or judgment of a JDR court may be appealed to the circuit court. <em>See Walker v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 562-63, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982). Where that appeal is taken by an adult on a conviction of an offense within the jurisdiction of the JDR court, the appeal shall be dealt with as an appeal from a general district court,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> except as limited by Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-459 and 19.2-271.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In contempt cases, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-136 and 18.2-459 explain and establish the rights of the appellant in the circuit court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 16.1-136 provides that the appeal \u201cshall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>heard de novo in the appellate [circuit] court and shall be tried without formal pleadings in writing----\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-459 provides that the circuit court judge \u201cmay hear the case upon the certificate and any legal testimony adduced on either side____\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And finally, Code \u00a7 19.2-271 specifically prohibits the calling of a judge as a witness. <em>Epps v.

Code \u00a7 18.2-459, the right of appeal to the circuit court allowing the use of the JDR certificate, was amended by the General Assembly as recently as 1975, twenty-five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>after Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-136,16.1-296(A), and 19.2-271 were included in the Code of 1950. \u201cIt is elemental that the legislature is presumed to know the law in effect when it enacts subsequent laws.\u201d <em>Tharpe v.

If either party objects to the findings and recommendations, the report is reviewed <em>de novo </em>by the district court judge. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(C). In doing so, the district court judge \u201cmay accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate [judge],\" and \"may also receive further evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, an appeal of a contempt conviction is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and \u00a7 18.2-459 does not require the circuit court to accept the certificate of conviction as fact; it merely allows the certificate to be considered by the court, just as a certified prior conviction, DMV record, or court order would be considered. The circuit court judge can certainly ignore the judgment of the JDR court in his <em>de novo </em>determination. The statute simply allows the circuit court judge to consider the certificate in his own <em>de novo </em>determination of the legal question. <em>Cf. United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 683-84, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 2416-17, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980) (affirming federal district court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>determination of federal magistrate\u2019s recommendation regarding a suppression motion). A defendant has the opportunity to present his or her own evidence, as in any other proceeding. There is nothing in the statement of facts before this Court to suggest that Gilman offered any evidence to the trial court or in any way contradicted or challenged the substance of what was set forth in the JDR certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Such limited procedures have been used in other <em>\"de novo </em>\u201d determinations. <em>See, e.g., Grogg v.

Thus, its admission in appellant\u2019s circuit court trial <em>de novo </em>violated appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The Supreme Court of the United States first made the distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial hearsay in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). While the Court declined \u201cto spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d it offered guidance as to what should be considered \u201ctestimonial\u201d in that opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. The Court found that the Confrontation Clause \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 against the accused\u2014in other words, those who \u2018bear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citation omitted). The Court defined testimony as a \u201c \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The affidavit prepared by the JDR judge, the only evidence presented at appellant\u2019s circuit court trial, is the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201ctestimonial hearsay.\u201d We have noted earlier that one reason for entering such a certificate is because the trial judge \u201cis an <em>indispensable witness </em>to the contemptuous event and his or her testimony is essential to prosecution of the offense on an appeal.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 368, 372, 417 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1992) (emphasis added). Because the trial judge\u2019s testimony is essential to the <em>de novo </em>appeal, and in this case was the only evidence against appellant, the judge himself is the defendant\u2019s \u201caccuser\u201d\u2014the very individual that the Constitution ensures that a defendant will be able to confront. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43, 124 S.Ct. at 1359 (\u201cthe right to confront one\u2019s accusers is a concept that dates back to Roman times\u201d); 541 U.S. at 46, 124 S.Ct. at 1361 (\u201cour constitution [requires] that the person shall see his accuser\u201d (citation omitted)); 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (\u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony\u201d). The statements at issue here are completely accusatory, as they detail the judge\u2019s recitation of the facts that support his conclusion that appellant was in contempt of court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Additionally, other courts have also determined that if the declarant is aware or expects that his statements may later be used at trial, this is a \u201cdeterminative factor\u201d in whether the statements are testimonial. <em>United States v. Saget, </em>377 F.3d 223, 228-29 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that the possible formulations set forth by the Supreme Court of what is \u201ctestimonial\u201d all share that common feature). <em>See also United States v. Arnold, </em>410 F.3d 895, 903-04 (6th Cir.2005) (\u201cthe decisive inquiry should be \u2018whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting the crime\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>United States v. Manfre, </em>368 F.3d 832, 838 n. 1 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The manner of presenting this testimony, in a document certified by a judge that is analogous to an affidavit, bears a striking resemblance to the practice sanctioned by the Marian bail and committal statutes identified by <em>Crawford </em>as a specific example of abuse of the Confrontation Clause protections. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Under the Marian bail and committal statutes, justices of the peace were directed to \u201cexamine suspects ... in felony cases and to certify the results [of that examination] to the court.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360. The Supreme Court specifically noted that the practice sanctioned by the Marian statutes was an abridgement of the right to confrontation that the Sixth Amendment was designed to prohibit. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1363. Here, the JDR judge \u201ccertified\u201d his recollection of appellant\u2019s acts to the circuit court, and that certification constituted the only basis for appellant\u2019s conviction in his trial <em>de novo </em>in circuit court. The certificate\u2019s resemblance to the reports issued under the Marian statutes, coupled with the Supreme Court\u2019s reliance on such historical abuses in defining the word \u201ctestimonial,\u201d leads to the inescapable conclusion that the certificate is testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Because the certificate is testimonial, its admission into evidence is proper only if the Commonwealth proved that the JDR judge was unavailable to testify at the circuit court trial and that appellant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him. It is undisputed that the JDR judge was unavailable to testify. Code \u00a7 19.2-271 prohibits any judge from testifying as a witness to matters that come before him in the course of his official duties. However, it is also undisputed that appellant did not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine the JDR judge and test the reliability of the certified testimony in the \u201ccrucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Both parties concede that after appellant left the courthouse and failed to take a drug test, she had no opportunity to confront the JDR judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Although Code \u00a7 18.2-459 allows a circuit court judge to consider the certificate in the <em>de novo </em>contempt appeal, \u201c[o]urs is a government whose powers are limited by the Constitution. Where statutory enactments and common-law rules come into conflict with constitutional principles, the latter must prevail.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>238 Va. 595, 600, 385 S.E.2d 865, 868 (1989). <em>See Powell v. Pennsylvania, </em>127 U.S. 678, 686, 8 S.Ct. 992, 996-97, 32 L.Ed. 253 (1888) (\u201cif the incompatibility of the Constitution and the statute is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>clear or palpable, the courts must give effect to the former\u201d). While actions of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional, as the majority emphasizes, courts will declare legislation invalid when it is \u201crepugnant to some provision of the state or federal constitution.\u201d <em>Etheridge v. Medical Center Hospitals, </em>237 Va. 87, 94, 376 S.E.2d 525, 528 (1989) (citation omitted). Because I would find that admission of the judge\u2019s certificate violates a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, the authorizing state statute cannot override the constitutional requirement as outlined in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Additionally, I disagree with the majority\u2019s contention that the appeal to circuit court was something less than a \u201ctrial <em>de novo.\u201d </em>An adult convicted of an offense in a juvenile and domestic relations court has the right to a trial <em>de novo. </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-296(E), 16.1-136. The procedural mandates set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-459 do not alter the fundamental <em>de novo </em>nature of the trial. <em>Baugh, </em>14 Va.App. at 373, 417 S.E.2d at 894 (the admission of the certificate of the lower court judge \u201cdoes not effect the <em>de novo </em>nature of the trial\u201d). An appeal to a circuit court \u201cfrom a court not of record under Code \u00a7 16.1-136 annuls the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.\u201d <em>Walker v. Department of Public Welfare of Page County, </em>223 Va. 557, 563, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982); <em>see Austin v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 33, 38, 590 S.E.2d 68, 71 (2003). Thus an appeal of appellant\u2019s contempt conviction is a trial <em>de novo </em>with its attendant procedural and substantive protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">For the reasons stated, I dissent and would reverse appellant\u2019s conviction for contempt.</p>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b78-10\">. As an initial matter, I would hold that appellant's right of confrontation is ensured in a criminal contempt proceeding as a matter of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>process. While not all constitutional rights apply to contempt proceedings, courts have afforded litigants being charged with contempt a broad panoply of rights to ensure that they receive due process, and there is no logical reason to fail to apply the rights secured by the Confrontation Clause to a contempt proceeding. <em>Levine v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 610, 616, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 1042, 4 L.Ed.2d 989 (1960) (\"[pjrocedural safeguards for criminal contempts do not derive from the Sixth Amendment\u2019\u2019); <em>Davis v.

Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 392, 396, 345 S.E.2d 5, 8 (1986) (deciding that the rules of evidence apply to a criminal contempt trial and requiring the prosecution to prove contempt beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Courts have long noted the potential for abuse that accompanies contempt proceedings, because \"contemptuous conduct, though short of a personal attack, may still provoke a trial judge and so embroil him in a controversy that he cannot \u2018hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Hayes, </em>418 U.S. 488, 501, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 2704, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974) (citation omitted). Thus, ensuring that individuals charged with contempt receive the benefit of Sixth Amendment protections \"accords with our historic notions of elementary fairness. While we have no desire \u2018to imprison the discretion of judges within rigid mechanical rules,\u2019 we remain unpersuaded that 'the additional time and expense possibly involved ... will seriously handicap the effective functioning of the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 500, 94 S.Ct. at 2704 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
