Shropshire, appellant, appeals from a judgment of the trial court which affirmed the decision of the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) denying survivor and/or other retirement benefits upon the death of her husband, Jonah Thomas Shropshire, retiree. Appellant contends that VRS, disregarding its own policies and procedures, violated the spousal notice provisions of Code \u00a7 51.1-165.1 and that the trial court erred in finding appellant\u2019s requested relief to be speculative and unattainable. For the reasons stated, we affirm the decision of the trial court denying appellant the survivor and retirement benefits she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">The relevant facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Appellant and retiree married on August 18, 1964. Although the couple separated in 1990, neither party filed divorce proceedings, nor had the parties entered into a property settlement agreement. Appellant and retiree remained married until retiree\u2019s death on May 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Retiree began employment with the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1971. At that time, retiree submitted to VRS a \u201cMember Informational Report\u201d in which he indicated that he was married to appellant and designated appellant as the beneficiary of his retirement benefits in the event of his death. The beneficiary designation allowed the individual selected by retiree to receive the amount of contributions accumulated in the retiree\u2019s retirement account upon retiree\u2019s death before or after the time of retirement. In 1992, while still actively employed with the Commonwealth, retiree submitted a \u201cBeneficiary Change Form\u201d to VRS. On that form, retiree changed the primary beneficiary of his accumulated retirement benefits to his adult son.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">On November 21,2000, retiree applied to VRS to receive his retirement benefits. Retiree completed, under oath, an \u201cApplication for Service Retirement.\u201d On that application, retiree misrepresented his marital status as \u201cDivorced.\u201d When selecting a \u201cRetirement Payment Option,\u201d retiree chose the \u201cBasic Benefit,\u201d which is a lifetime retirement benefit paid only to retiree. This selection does not provide for any payments to designated beneficiaries or survivors upon retiree\u2019s death.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph 21 of the application requires spousal acknowledgement, where applicable, of the payment option selected by retiree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This section of retiree\u2019s application was blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Appellant was not aware that retiree had applied for retirement benefits from VRS, that retiree had misrepresented his marital status on his application, or that retiree had selected a payment option that did not provide for survivor benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Shortly after retiree\u2019s death, appellant sought to claim survivor and/or any other benefits from VRS. In response, VRS summarily denied her claim. Appellant appealed this denial to VRS, which conducted a fact-finding proceeding before a hearing officer. Appellant argued that, as a result of the failure to notify her of retiree\u2019s selection of a payment option that provided no survivor benefits, she was denied a portion of the retirement benefits to which she had marital rights. Appellant contended that VRS, by falling to require retiree to provide proof of divorce or proof of notice to appellant, failed to follow its own policies and procedures. The hearing officer recommended the following action be taken by VRS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">The VRS had documentation in the file that [retiree] was married. VRS policies and procedures required either spousal acknowledgment or proof of divorce before the application could be approved. Being such, [appellant\u2019s] marital rights were not protected as a direct result of the VRS failing to follow its policies and procedures. Therefore, [retiree\u2019s] application should be reviewed as if [appellant] is entitled to a survivor benefit option.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">VRS, in its final case decision dated July 8, 2005, rejected the recommendation of the hearing officer and denied benefits to appellant. VRS noted that the statute requiring spousal acknowledgement of a retiree\u2019s selected retirement payment option, Code \u00a7 51.1-165.1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> does not provide for spousal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>sent, but only spousal acknowledgement. VRS stated that, whether or not such spousal acknowledgement is secured, \u201c[t]he spouse cannot override the payment option selected by the member.\u201d In its decision, VRS stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">In the situation that occurred in this matter, where the member indicates on the retirement application that the marital status is divorced, signs the statement that all information contained on the application is true and no conflict exists which would cause a delay in the processing of the retirement application and payment of benefits, the existing policies and procedures (contrary to the independent fact finder\u2019s assertion) do not require the retirement analyst processing the retirement application to review the VRS record to verify the marital status. Specifically, in this matter, a review of the VRS record supports the indicated marital status of \u201cdivorced\u201d in that [retiree\u2019s] original beneficiary designation named [appellant] (as spouse) in 1971. [Retiree] changed the beneficiary designation in 1992 from his spouse to his son. This is not inconsistent with a marital status of \u201cdivorced\u201d and VRS relied reasonably on the information contained in [retiree\u2019s] service retirement application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Appellant appealed the VRS decision to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond pursuant to the Virginia Administrative Process Act (VAPA), Code \u00a7 2.2-4000, <em>et seq. </em>Appellant argued that she had been prejudiced by the lack of notice, i.e., that had she been told that retiree was not providing her with a survivor benefit, she would have pursued divorce or separation proceedings to protect her marital interest in retiree\u2019s retirement benefits. The trial court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the VRS decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> finding that a spouse has no interest in the retirement account of the retiree except that which is allowed by the retiree. Accordingly, the trial court held that appellant was not entitled to survivor benefits. The trial court also ruled that any remedy available to appellant would be speculative, as it is uncertain how much of her husband\u2019s retirement account she would have received in an equitable distribution proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Appellant concedes on brief that a spouse cannot override the retiree\u2019s selection of a retirement payment option. However, appellant argues that, if she had been provided the notice required by Code \u00a7 51.1-165.1, she would have \u201cprotect[ed] her marital interest in her husband\u2019s retirement account\u201d before his death, namely by filing for divorce or by entering into a property settlement agreement. Appellant contends that VRS is responsible for the lack of notice, as it did not resolve the conflict between the marital status indicated on the initial \u201cMember Informational Report\u201d and that indicated on the \u201cApplication for Service Retirement.\u201d Appellant urges that VRS should have required retiree to produce proof of divorce or spousal acknowledgement before paying any benefits to retiree. Lastly, appellant maintains that, while the relief she seeks may be speculative as no equitable distribution proceeding occurred to determine her marital interest in the retirement account, any such speculation result<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ed solely from VRS\u2019s failure to notify appellant of retiree\u2019s selected retirement payment option and that VRS should not be entitled to benefit from this failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">VRS argues that Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> prevents appellant from attacking the assets of VRS, as she is not a member of VRS or a beneficiary selected by retiree to receive benefits upon his death. As such, VRS maintains that appellant cannot recover for her claim against retiree\u2019s retirement benefits. We agree with VRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The issue presented by this appeal is one of law, namely the interpretation of applicable statutes. As such, we review the agency decision <em>de novo. Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 243-44, 369 S.E.2d 1, 8 (1988).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">The sole issue involves a question of statutory interpretation. The issue does not involve \u201cthe substantiality of the evidential support for findings of fact,\u201d which requires great deference because of the specialized competence of the agency. Instead, when, as here, the question involves a statutory interpretation issue, \u201clittle deference is required to be accorded the agency decision\u201d because the issue falls outside the agency\u2019s specialized competence. In sum, pure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Sims Wholesale Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">When examining the wording of statutes, this Court considers the plain meaning of a word rather than an obscure or strained definition. <em>See Rasmussen v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 233, 238, 522 S.E.2d 401, 403 (1999). It is clear upon reading Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A) that the legislature intended VRS to hold its assets in the form of a public trust, for the sole benefit of retirees and their designated beneficiaries. It is for this reason that the legislature has shielded these funds from virtually all legal attacks, save those expressly exempted within the statute. <em>See Crawford v. Haddock, </em>270 Va. 524, 530, 621 S.E.2d 127, 130 (2005) (indicating that the language of Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4 evinces an intent by the General Assembly to insulate VRS assets from certain types of \u201clegal process\u201d). The Supreme Court of Virginia recently reached the same conclusion when interpreting Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4 in <em>Sexton v. Cornett, </em>271 Va. 251, 623 S.E.2d 898 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">In <em>Sexton, </em>the Court considered whether a wife was entitled to her deceased husband\u2019s retirement benefits, where the husband had died intestate. The retiree and his wife had separated and were in the midst of divorce proceedings at the time of his death. <em>Id. </em>at 254, 623 S.E.2d at 900. Initially, the retiree had designated his wife as the beneficiary of his retirement benefits. <em>Id. </em>Two months before his death, the retiree designated his sister and her daughter as the sole beneficiaries of his retirement benefits. <em>Id. </em>The retirement benefits, along with a state life insurance policy that had the same beneficiary designation, made up the retiree\u2019s entire estate. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 623 S.E.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">After retiree\u2019s death, his wife filed a petition to determine her elective marital share of the retirement benefits, arguing that they should be included as part of his augmented estate. <em>Id. </em>The wife relied on a Virginia law that was enacted \u201cto preclude one spouse from disinheriting the other by transferring his property to third parties during his lifetime and thus depleting his estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court agreed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>this estate law, when read in isolation, would clearly make the retirement benefits subject to the wife\u2019s claim. <em>Id. </em>However, the Court ruled that it could not read the estate law in isolation, but had to consider the impact of Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4. \u201c[T]he General Assembly has, for many years, maintained a legislative policy of exempting YRS ... retirement benefits, in the hands of their designated beneficiaries, from attack of any kind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Supreme Court denied the wife in <em>Sexton </em>any relief under the estate laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A) does provide for two limited exceptions to the prohibition on legal attacks as it pertains to a spouse\u2019s right to retirement benefits and assets, namely (1) a court process to enforce spousal support obligations or (2) a division or transfer of these assets that are deemed to be marital property in an equitable distribution proceeding under Code \u00a7 20-107.3. No such proceedings ever took place between appellant and retiree, as they remained legally married at retiree\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Appellant argues that, because it is \u201cundisputed that the Shropshire retirement account was marital property that would have been subject to equitable distribution in a divorce proceeding,\u201d her claim falls into the statutory exception noted above. Assuming that appellant is correct, which is not apparent from the record, it is evident that the exception applies only to those assets deemed to be marital property <em>in an equitable distribution proceeding, </em>not those assets that <em>would have been </em>deemed marital property. It is clear that the statute contemplates only those proceedings that have already occurred, not those that \u201cmay\u201d occur in the future.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Further, retiree selected the \u201cBasic Benefits\u201d payment option when applying for his retirement benefits, which provides for payment only during retiree\u2019s lifetime. Retiree reserved nothing for his survivors or designated beneficiaries. Appellant, in requesting the payment of survivor benefits from VRS despite retiree\u2019s selection, seeks to collect on what she believes to be her marital share from the monies held in trust for other state employees, not the monies held by retiree or his estate. Appellant is not asking to share in any portion of her husband\u2019s retirement funds. Indeed, given retiree\u2019s selection of payments only during his lifetime, there are no \u201cretirement funds\u201d left after his death from which appellant could collect. Once retiree died, his retirement account ceased to exist. Instead, appellant is asking to share in the funds belonging to other state employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is this very legal attack that Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A) was designed to prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We need not address appellant\u2019s argument that VRS violated its own policies by not ensuring that appellant was informed of retiree\u2019s selection of a payment option as required by Code \u00a7 51.1-165.1. Assuming without deciding that VRS violated its policies, the plain language of Code \u00a7 51.1-165.1 requires only <em>acknowledgement </em>by a spouse of a retiree\u2019s benefit selection. Spousal <em>consent </em>is not required. As appellant concedes on brief, a spouse is not permitted to override a retiree\u2019s benefit selection if the spouse disagrees with the retiree\u2019s choice. Nothing in that statute gives appellant a vested or an enforceable interest in retiree\u2019s retirement benefits. Thus, the most appellant was entitled to under Code \u00a7 51.1-165.1 was notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>With this notice, appellant may have been able to file for divorce and to seek equitable distribution of the retirement account before retiree\u2019s death. However, any award made by a trial court would have been granted from retiree\u2019s account alone, not from the funds held in trust by VRS for other state employees. Once retiree died, his retirement account ceased to exist. As we concluded above, appellant is precluded from seeking the remedy she requests because this would require the trial court to award appellant a portion of the funds held in trust for other state employees. Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A) bars such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Thus, we hold that the prohibition set out by the legislature in Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A), shielding VRS assets from legal process outside of the limited circumstances noted above, controls in this case. Accordingly, appellant cannot recover against VRS, and the decision of the trial court is affirmed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Appellant is barred by Code \u00a7 51.1-124.4(A) from subjecting the assets of VRS to legal attack, as her claim does not fall under one of the exceptions provided by the statute. The decision of the trial court upholding the VRS denial of survivor benefits to appellant is affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">.
