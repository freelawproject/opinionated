Anderson of rape, robbery, and forcible sodomy. On appeal, Anderson argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-15\">\u2022 DNA was seized from him in violation of the Fourth Amendment and then used as a basis for seeking a search warrant to confirm the DNA match,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u2022 the delay between the crime and his arrest was so long as to violate his due process rights,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">\u2022 the DNA test results should not have been admitted because the Commonwealth\u2019s chain-of-custody proof violated his confrontation rights and, in any event, was factually inadequate, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">\u2022 he should not have been convicted of robbery because no facts suggested he intimidated the victim into giving him her money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">Disagreeing with each of these assertions, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Under settled principles, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Early one morning in 1991, Laura Berry was walking to an elementary school in Fairfax where she worked as an administrative assistant. While walking through a wooded area near the school, a man appeared and grabbed her from behind by the throat and face. The attacker pulled her to the bottom of the ravine, raped and sodomized her, and then robbed her of $63.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">At a local hospital, Berry was examined by an emergency room physician who used a Physical Evidence Recovery Kit (PERK) to obtain specimens for evidence. The investigating officer forwarded the specimens to the Virginia Department of Forensic Science (DFS). DFS scientists isolated a sperm fraction on the vaginal swabs collected from Berry. Given the limits of DNA technology at that time, however, they were unable to identify the attacker\u2019s DNA from that sperm frac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>tion. Because Berry did not know her attacker, the crime remained unsolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Ten years later, in 2001, after advancements in DNA technology, the investigating officer requested a new test on Berry\u2019s PERK specimen. Using newly developed techniques, the forensic scientists extracted the attacker\u2019s DNA from the sperm fraction and entered the results into the Virginia Forensic Laboratory\u2019s DNA databank.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In 2003, Anderson was arrested in Stafford County on unrelated rape and sodomy charges. Upon being arrested, Anderson\u2019s DNA was obtained and entered into the DNA databank. Shortly thereafter, the investigating officer handling Berry\u2019s case learned that the DNA taken from Anderson matched the DNA of the man who attacked Berry in 1991. Based on this match, the investigating officer obtained a search warrant to secure additional saliva swabs from Anderson. Tests of the DNA from those samples confirmed Anderson as the man whose sperm had been found in Berry after the 1991 attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Presented with this evidence, a jury found Anderson guilty of raping, sodomizing, and robbing Berry. From these convictions he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">A <em>DNA Samples &amp; Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1 authorizes law enforcement officers to obtain a sample of \u201csaliva or tissue\u201d for DNA testing from anyone arrested for certain violent felonies. The testing is meant to isolate genetic \u201cidentification characteristics specific to the person.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1. After a magistrate or grand jury confirms that probable cause exists for the arrest, <em>id., </em>the sampling logistics are coordinated by the \u201claw-enforcement agency responsible for arrest booking in the jurisdiction.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-310.3:1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">On appeal, Anderson argues that the statute violates the Fourth Amendment because it authorizes what amounts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>a \u201csuspicionless search\u201d unrelated to any effort by law enforcement to obtain evidence for the specific charge justifying the arrest. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">A search of an arrestee requires no independent legal justification apart from the arrest itself. \u201cA custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 235, 94 S.Ct. 467, 477, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973). \u201cIt is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Upon a \u201clawful custodial arrest, a full search of the person is not only an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but is also a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search under that Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018With the person\u2019s loss of liberty upon arrest comes the loss of at least some, if not all, rights to personal privacy otherwise protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Jones v. Murray, </em>962 F.2d 302, 306 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">That is particularly true when the search merely seeks to identify the arrestee. When a person is \u201carrested upon probable cause, his identification becomes a matter of legitimate state interest and he can hardly claim privacy in it.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Smith v. United States, </em>324 F.2d 879, 882 (D.C.Cir.1963) (recognizing as \u201celementary\u201d the proposition that arrestees may be fingerprinted and photographed \u201cas part of routine identification processes\u201d). The state\u2019s interest in the arrestee\u2019s identity, moreover, \u201cis relevant not only to solving the crime for which the suspect is arrested, but also for maintaining a permanent record to solve other past and future crimes.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>962 F.2d at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Though the probable cause justifying an arrest likewise justifies a search incident to an arrest, it does not follow that the Fourth Amendment has no further role in limiting the manner of the incidental search. In this case, however, Anderson does not challenge the specific manner in which his DNA sample was taken or the nominal degree of physical invasiveness it may have involved. <em>See id. </em>at 307 (finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>even the DNA blood test sampling procedure involves \u201cvirtually no risk, trauma, or pain\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, this case does not require us to determine at what point a search incident to an arrest becomes unreasonable due to the manner in which it is performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the collection of a DNA sample from Anderson under Code \u00a7 19.2-310.2:1 did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures. The procedure involved a permissible application of law enforcement\u2019s authority to search an arrestee incident to an arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">B. <em>Preindictment Delay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Anderson also claims it took too long for law enforcement to solve the crime and to arrest him on the 1991 Fairfax charges. Due process principles, Anderson contends, bar any criminal prosecution of him at this late date. We find no support for this argument, however, under governing precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The common law imposed no time limitation on the state\u2019s initiation of felony prosecutions. <em>See </em>1 Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 92, at 628 (15th ed.1993); Joel Prentiss Bishop, <em>Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes </em>\u00a7 257, at 243 (2d ed. 1883). The imposition of a specific preindictment time limit on such prosecutions remains solely a matter of \u201clegislative grace.\u201d Torcia, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 92, at 629. Consistent with the common law, Virginia has no general statute of limitation on felonies. <em>See Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 574, 576, 606 S.E.2d 518, 519 (2004), <em>aff'd, </em>271 Va. 235, 623 S.E.2d 902 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Even in the absence of a statutory limitations period, the Constitution plays a \u201climited role\u201d in situations alleging preindictment delay. <em>Morrisette v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 386, 393, 569 S.E.2d 47, 52 (2002) (citing <em>United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 789, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 2048, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977); <em>Hall v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 526, 528-29, 383 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1989)). \u201cThere is,\u201d after all, \u201cno constitutional right to be arrested.\u201d <em>Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. at 792 n. 13, 97 S.Ct. at 2050 n. 13 (quoting <em>Hoffa v. United States, </em>385 U.S. 293, 310, 87 S.Ct. 408, 417, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Due process principles bar a prosecution for preindictment delay only when the \u201cdefendant incurred actual prejudice as a result of the delay\u201d and the \u201cprosecutor intentionally delayed indicting the defendant to gain a tactical advantage.\u201d <em>Morrisette, </em>264 Va. at 393, 569 S.E.2d at 52 (citations and brackets omitted). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of proving both actual prejudice and improper purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 192, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 2299-2300, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984); <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 465, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In this case, we need not examine in any detail Anderson\u2019s claim of actual prejudice. Anderson admits he cannot prove the prosecutor intentionally stalled the indictment in an effort to obtain some tactical advantage, a necessary showing under the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morrisette. </em>Anderson acknowledges his due process challenge fails under <em>Morrisette, </em>but urges us to abandon that precedent and to adopt the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach in <em>Howell v. Barker, </em>904 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.1990), which, instead of examining prosecutorial misconduct, focuses more broadly on \u201cfundamental conceptions of justice\u201d and the \u201ccommunity\u2019s sense of fair play and decency.\u201d We decline the invitation to adopt the <em>Howell </em>standard, as we have neither the power<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>inclination<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Applying the standard for preindictment delay recognized by the Virginia Supreme Court in Morrisette\u2014-which requires proof that the \u201cprosecutor intentionally delayed indicting the defendant to gain a tactical advantage,\u201d <em>Morrisette, </em>264 Va. at 393, 569 S.E.2d at 52 (brackets omitted)\u2014we hold that Anderson\u2019s concession that he cannot make that showing necessarily defeats his due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">C. <em>Certificate of Analysis\u2014Chain of Custody</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Anderson next argues the Commonwealth failed to prove the chain of custody for the PERK samples tested by DFS. Any use of Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01\u2019s inference violates his confrontation rights, Anderson contends. He also claims the lack of testimony from the emergency room nurse and law enforcement personnel likewise renders inadmissible the certificate of analysis and accompanying expert testimony. Disagreeing with both assertions, we find the statutory inference constitutional and the remaining chain-of-custody proof sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>(i) <em>The Statutory Chain-Of-Custody Inference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We begin with Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01, which \u201cauthorizes a trial court to receive a certificate of analysis as evidence of the chain of custody of the material tested.\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 185, 188, 541 S.E.2d 547, 548 (2001). An authenticated certificate of analysis creates a <em>prima facie </em>inference that DFS maintained a proper chain of custody at all times while the samples were \u201cin the laboratory.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 13-5, at 529 (6th ed.2003). Relying on <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), Anderson argues that this statutory inference violates the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Like the trial court, we too reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The Sixth Amendment limits a defendant\u2019s confrontation right to \u201cwitnesses against him.\u201d <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI). In this way, \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is aimed at protecting criminal defendants from those people making <em>accusations </em>against them.\u201d <em>Michels v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 461, 466, 624 S.E.2d 675, 678 (2006) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43, 46, 124 S.Ct. at 1359-60, 1361). This \u201cagainst him\u201d qualification narrows the class of out-of-court statements subject to the Confrontation Clause to those of an inherently testimonial nature\u2014quite unlike typical \u201cbusiness records,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. at 1367, or routine \u201cofficial records\u201d maintained by government officials, <em>id. </em>at 76, 124 S.Ct. at 1378 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">We recently emphasized this point in <em>Michels, </em>holding that an official record from an out-of-state agency was not testimonial hearsay. We reasoned that <em>Crawford, </em>as many courts have held, did not extend the Sixth Amendment to \u201cdocuments establishing the existence or absence of some objective fact, rather than detailing the criminal wrongdoing of the defendant,\u201d particularly affidavits used merely \u201cto verify the chain of custody and authenticity of the underlying documentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>evidence\u201d or to certify the \u201cresults of laboratory tests\u201d performed by scientific personnel. <em>Michels, </em>47 Va.App. at 467, 624 S.E.2d at 678 (citations omitted). Such documents \u201cdo not resemble <em>ex parte </em>examinations, \u2018the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 624 S.E.2d at 680 (quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1368).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01\u2019s inference serves merely to verify the chain of custody of the samples while being tested by DFS scientists. It codifies\u2014in this limited context\u2014the accepted maxim that, in the \u201cabsence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts may presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 854, 856-57, 406 S.E.2d 417, 418 (1991) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As such, the chain-of-custody verification provides only foundation evidence that cannot be fairly characterized as accusatorial. <em>See Commonwealth v. Walther, </em>189 S.W.3d 570, 575 (Ky.2006) (holding that foundation evidence does not \u201caccuse\u201d the defendant or fall within the <em>Crawford </em>definition of testimonial evidence); <em>State v. Carter, </em>326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001, 1007 (2005) (holding that \u201ccertification reports are nontestimonial in nature in that they are foundational, rather than substantive or accusatory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Consistent with our reasoning in <em>Michels, </em>we hold the chain-of-custody inference supplied by Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 constitutes nontestimonial evidence outside the protective \u201cperimeter\u201d of the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Davis, </em>\u2014 U.S. at \u2014, 126 S.Ct. at 2274. We thus reject Anderson\u2019s Sixth Amendment challenge to the statutory chain-of-custody inference recognized by Code \u00a7 19.2-187.01 while the samples were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>being tested at the DFS laboratory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">(11) <em>Remaining Chain-Of-Custody Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">As for Anderson\u2019s challenge to the chain of custody of the samples while in the hands of the medical personnel assembling the PERK and the investigating officer relaying the samples to and from the DFS laboratory, we review that evidence in the \u201clight most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 768, 776, 485 S.E.2d 646, 650 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">So viewed, the record amply supports a reasonable inference that the \u201cevidence obtained by the police was the same evidence tested.\u201d <em>Jeter v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 733, 737, 607 S.E.2d 734, 735 (2005) (citation omitted). The emergency room physician testified that, with the help of a nurse, he collected vaginal swabs from Berry (from which the sperm fraction containing Anderson\u2019s DNA was later isolated) and placed them in a sealed envelope. The investigating officer\u2019s testimony then traced his steps as he retrieved the vaginal swab samples, transported them to and from the receiving clerks at DFS, and stored the samples in a secure property room during the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Anderson complains about the absence of any testimony from the emergency room nurse or any law enforcement officer familiar with the storage protocols of the secure property room. A court need not hear, however, from every witness who physically handled the samples for the certificate to be admissible. Nor must the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence \u201cexclude every conceivable possibility of substitution, alteration, or tampering.\u201d <em>Pope v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 114, 121, 360 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987) (citation omitted). It need only provide \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that the evidence obtained by the police was the same evidence tested. <em>Vinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 459, 469, 522 S.E.2d 170, 177 (1999) (citation omitted). And where \u201cthere is mere speculation that contamination or tampering could have occurred, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit the evidence and let what doubt there may be go to the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Jeter, 44 </em>Va.App. at 739, 607 S.E.2d at 737 (citation omitted); <em>see also Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 552, 556, 466 S.E.2d 116, 117 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In short, Anderson\u2019s real complaint goes not to the chain-of-custody requirement for admissibility (determined by the trial judge as evidentiary gatekeeper), but to the debate over the weight of such evidence (determined by the jury as factfinder). Either way, we come to the same conclusion: A <em>prima facie </em>showing supported the trial judge\u2019s decision to admit the DNA evidence, and the testimony at trial provided the jury with a sufficient factual basis for finding it persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">D. <em>Sufficiency of Evidence\u2014Robbery Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Virginia law defines robbery as stealing the personal property of another, from her person or in her presence, against her will \u201cby violence or intimidation.\u201d <em>Seaton v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 739, 748, 595 S.E.2d 9, 13 (2004) (citations omitted). Relying on this definition, Anderson argues that no evidence proved he intimidated Berry into giving him her money. Anderson explains his position this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">Ms. Berry testified that when the perpetrator had finished the rape and sodomy he asked if she had any money. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>then handed him her purse. The perpetrator asked her to remove the money from her purse and Ms. Berry complied. The perpetrator never yelled at Ms. Berry or touched her in any manner with regards to the taking of her money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 33. From there, Anderson argues that he could not be convicted of robbery because of the mere \u201ctemperamental timidity of the victim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">In other words, Anderson ended his violent rape of Berry with a demand for her money, yet claims to be innocent of robbery because nothing he did <em>intimidated </em>her into complying with his demand. Under this theory, a thief who threatens to shoot a victim before taking her money commits robbery. But a thief who first shoots the victim and then asks for her money does not, apparently because the inherent intimidation of being asked for money by someone who has just shot you should be dismissed as a matter of mere timidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Suffice it to say, violence immediately preceding a demand for money has always been understood as sufficient to convert mere thievery into robbery. <em>See generally </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 20.3(d), at 184 (2d ed. 2003) (\u201cOne may commit robbery by striking his victim with fist or weapon and then, having thus rendered the victim dead or unconscious or dazed or unwilling to risk another blow, taking his property away from him.\u201d). The jury in Anderson\u2019s case had ample reason to conclude that his rape and forcible sodomy of Berry intimidated her into submitting to his demand for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">Finding no merit in any of Anderson\u2019s arguments, we affirm his convictions for rape, forcible sodomy, and robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b759-9\">. At oral argument, Anderson asserted that the Fourth Amendment applies to each computerized \u201csearch\" of DNA records <em>within </em>the state's DNA databank. We find this assertion meritless. <em>See Johnson v.

Anderson also suggests that the expert testimony of Karen Ambrozy, a DFS scientist, relied in part on preparatory work performed by a lab assistant, Kari Yoshida. This reliance, Anderson contends, violates <em>Crawford </em>because Yoshida did not appear at trial. Assuming without deciding this specific point was preserved for appeal under Rule 5A:18, we nonetheless find it unavailing. <em>Crawford </em>applies to testimonial hearsay <em>statements </em>by declarants who do not later appear at trial to expose their prior statements to the crucible of cross-examination.
