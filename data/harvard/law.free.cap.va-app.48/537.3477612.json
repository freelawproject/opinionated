For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">On June 10, 2003, Butler gave birth to a baby boy, A.L. A subsequent test of his meconium was \u201cpositive for cocaine metabolites.\u201d On September 5, 2003, the Culpeper County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court granted temporary legal custody to the Culpeper County Department of Social Services (\u201cDepartment\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 29, 2003, the Department filed an initial foster care plan, and, on November 20, 2003, the Culpeper County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court found that A.L. was abused and neglected. Thus, the court transferred custody to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>On April 23, 2004, the Department transferred custody back to Butler, ordering that both she and A.L.\u2019s father \u201ccomplete current substance abuse treatment and counseling, complete current psychological counseling and treatment, comply with all terms of existing probation, [and] apply for Family Support management and assistance.\u201d On May 27, 2004, Butler tested positive for cocaine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That same day, Culpeper Family Guidance notified Butler\u2019s probation officer that she failed to make several appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Because Butler continued to miss her appointments, the probation officer visited Butler\u2019s home. Butler\u2019s father notified the officer that Butler was in Maryland with A.L. On June 17, 2004, Butler contacted the Department to place A.L. back in foster care.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, because she was wanted for violating the terms of her probation, she had a friend take A.L. to the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On January 26, 2005, the Department received a phone call stating that Butler was in George Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C.,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after delivering a baby girl, V.L.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Department contacted Butler at the hospital to offer her the option of signing an entrustment agreement for A.L., as the Department would be seeking involuntary termination on Feb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ruary 10, 2005. Butler agreed to sign the entrustment agreement, so long as she could place her newborn child, V.L., with the same foster and adoptive family that had been caring for A.L. Thus, on January 26, 2005, Butler executed an entrustment agreement for each child,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> thereby voluntarily transferring permanent custody of A.L. and V.L. to the Department.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The Department filed petitions with the Culpeper County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court to terminate Butler\u2019s parental rights to A.L. and V.L. The juvenile and domestic relations district court ultimately terminated Butler\u2019s rights, and Butler appealed to the Culpeper County Circuit Court. On November 30, 2005, the Culpeper County Circuit Court entered a final order terminating Butler\u2019s residual parental rights to A.L., pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-277.01,16.1-283(B), 16.1-283(C)(1), and 16.1-283(0(2). On the same day, the trial court also entered a final order terminating Butler\u2019s residual parental rights to V.L., pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-277.01 and 16.1-283(B). Butler now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On appeal, Butler contends the trial court erred in three respects. First, Butler contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying her motion for a continuance. Second, Butler contends that the trial court erred in relying on en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>trustment agreements entered into between Butler and the Department. And third, Butler argues that even if the entrustment agreements were properly before the trial court, the court erred in determining that clear and convincing evidence supported its decision to terminate Butler\u2019s parental rights to her two children. For the following reasons, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Butler\u2019s request for a continuance, that the trial court properly relied upon valid entrustment agreements for purposes of terminating Butler\u2019s parental rights to each child, and that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate Butler\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">A. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err In Denying Butler\u2019s Motion For A Continuance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Butler argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a continuance. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\u201cThe decision whether to grant a continuance is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Venable v. Venable, </em>2 Va.App. 178, 181, 342 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1986). This decision will not be reversed on appeal unless the trial court abused its discretion and the moving party was prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision. <em>Id.; see also Butler v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 614, 621, 570 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2002); <em>Silcox v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 509, 513, 528 S.E.2d 744, 746 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Here, Butler contends that, because she \u201cwas not in a position to go forward with the hearing at that time,\u201d the trial court abused its discretion in denying her request for a continuance. However, even assuming this denial to be error, Butler failed to provide any evidence to the trial court, or this Court, that she was prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision. In fact, the only statement in the proffered Statement of the Case<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> regarding the denial of the motion is as follows: \u201cMs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Butler\u2019s counsel moved for a continuance, which was denied.\u201d Therefore, \u201cabsent a showing of prejudice to [Butler] by the denial of a continuance,\u201d we cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>See Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 509, 450 S.E.2d 146, 151 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">B. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err In Terminating Butler\u2019s Parental Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Butler also argues that the trial court improperly relied upon the entrustment agreements to terminate her residual parental rights. Butler further contends that, even if this Court finds that \u201cthe entrustment agreements] w[ere] properly used,\u201d the trial court erred in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the termination, as required by Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">1. <em>Reliance Upon the Entrustment Agreements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">According to Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(B), a court may terminate the residual parental rights of a parent or parents whose child has been placed in foster care as a result of an entrustment agreement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court may do so if it finds</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">1. The neglect or abuse suffered by such child presented a serious and substantial threat to his life, health or development; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">2. It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the child\u2019s safe return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>to his parent or parents within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination, the court shall take into consideration the efforts made to rehabilitate the parent or parents by any public or private social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies prior to the child\u2019s initial placement in foster care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Butler contends that, according to Code \u00a7 63.2-1223, an entrustment agreement is revocable until the child is placed with adoptive parents. Specifically, Butler contends that terminating her parental rights \u201cprior to adoption renders the \u2018revocation prior to adoption\u2019 \u201d language of Code \u00a7 63.2-1223 and the entrustment agreements \u201cutterly meaningless.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, Butler argues that because the children had not yet been placed with adoptive parents<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and she still retained the right to revoke the entrustment agreements, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>could not rely upon the entrustment agreements to terminate her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">However, we need not construe the statutory language cited by Butler as the basis for the trial court\u2019s alleged error because Butler failed to comply with a crucial statutory requirement. Specifically, Code \u00a7 63.2-1223 requires delivery of a \u201cwritten revocation\u201d to the \u201cchild-placing agency ... in accordance with the applicable time period\u201d set out in Code \u00a7 63.2-1223. Because Butler did not provide the Department with a written revocation of the entrustment agreements, the agreements were properly before the trial court. Thus, we hold that the trial court properly relied upon the entrustment agreements to terminate Butler\u2019s residual parental rights to both A.L. and V.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">2. <em>Whether Clear and Convincing Evidence Supported the Termination of Parental Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Although the entrustment agreements were properly before the trial court, we must also determine whether the trial court erred in finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that Butler\u2019s parental rights should be terminated. We hold that the record supports that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">On appeal, \u201c[a] trial court is presumed to have thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990). \u201cIn matters of a child\u2019s welfare, trial courts are vested with broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests,\u201d <em>id., </em>and, thus, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s judgment, \u2018when based on evidence heard <em>ore tenus, </em>will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it,\u2019 \u201d <em>Logan v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991) (quoting <em>Peple v. Peple, </em>5 Va.App. 414, 422, 364 S.E.2d 232, 237 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>In order to terminate residual parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), the court must make \u201cthree statutorily-required findings\u201d based upon \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Kaywood v. Halifax County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>10 Va.App. 535, 538, 394 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1990); Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). First, the termination of the parents\u2019 residual rights must be in the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d <em>Kaywood, </em>10 Va.App. at 538, 394 S.E.2d at 494 (citing Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)). \u201cSecond, the neglect or abuse suffered by the child must present a \u2018serious and substantial threat to his life, health or development.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(1)). And \u201c[t]hird, the court must find that \u2018it is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the child\u2019s safe return to his parent or parents within a reasonable period of time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2)). Thus, \u201cCode \u00a7 16.1-283(B) speaks prospectively, as to the ability of the parent or parents to \u2018substantially\u2019 remedy, \u2018within a reasonable period of time,\u2019 the conditions which led to the foster care placement.\u201d <em>City of Newport News Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Winslow, </em>40 Va.App. 556, 562-63, 580 S.E.2d 463, 466 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In this case, Butler contends the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights to both A.L. and V.L., pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">a. <em>Termination of Parental Rights to A.L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The trial court terminated Butler\u2019s rights to A.L., pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-277.01, 16.1-283(B), 16.1-283(0(1), and 16.1-283(C)(2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, on appeal, Butler only chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>lenges the trial court\u2019s determination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). Because the trial court also terminated Butler\u2019s rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(1) and 16.1\u2014283(C)(2),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>we need not address the sufficiency of the evidence pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). <em>See Fields v. Dinwiddie County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>46 Va.App. 1, 8, 614 S.E.2d 656, 659 (2005). In other words, because the evidence is sufficient to support termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(1) and 16.1\u2014 283(C)(2), Butler\u2019s appeal as to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">b. <em>Termination of Parental Rights to V.L.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The trial court also entered a final order terminating Butler\u2019s residual parental rights to V.L., pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-277.01 and 16.1-283(B). The trial court found that Butler (1) \u201cadmitted to continued drug use, including the use of drugs and alcohol shortly before the child\u2019s birth,\u201d (2) \u201cchose to leave the hospital after the birth of the child without taking the child with her and without providing care and comfort for the child,\u201d (3) \u201csuffers from drug addiction, and has failed to follow through on repeated attempts at treatment,\u201d (4) \u201chas been incarcerated due to her own conduct,\u201d and (5) is not reasonably likely to \u201csubstantially correct\u201d or \u201celiminate\u201d the conditions which led to her child\u2019s placement in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Although Butler argues that \u201cthe only condition that presented a harm to the children was [her] drug use\u201d and that \u201c[s]he is a good mother, who is being prevented from raising her children successfully only by virtue of her present incarceration,\u201d we disagree. The record indicates that Butler\u2019s drug use is pervasive. Butler\u2019s first child, A.L., was born with cocaine in his system, and, even after the Department removed him from her care, Butler continued to use illegal narcotics. In fact, after a dirty urine screen in mid-2004, Butler was incarcerated for violating her probation. Indeed, although the Department made reasonable efforts to provide Butler with resources to help with her addiction, Butler failed to take advantage of the services. Specifically, Butler was admitted to Bethany Hall in October 2004, but left the program prior to completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Moreover, Butler continued to use drugs knowing that she was pregnant, and she intentionally remained in Maryland to avoid prosecution for violating her probation. Neither pregnancy nor incarceration deterred Butler from continuing to abuse drugs. Thus, we cannot say that the trial court erred in finding that it was not reasonably likely that Butler would correct the conditions leading to V.L.\u2019s placement with the Department. Accordingly, based on this record, the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate Butler\u2019s parental right to V.L., pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), is not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Because Butler did not allege prejudice, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying her motion for a continuance. We also hold that, because Butler failed to comply with a statutory requirement of Code \u00a7 63.2-1223, the entrustment agreements were properly before the trial court. Moreover, we hold that Butler\u2019s appeal regarding A.L. is moot. Specifically, although Butler challenges the termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), she failed to challenge the termination under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C). Lastly, we hold that the trial court did not err in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>to support the termination of Butler\u2019s parental rights to V.L. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-12\">. The Guardian <em>ad litem </em>contends that the appeal as to V.L. should be dismissed, as there is no notice of appeal in the record. To the contrary, there is a notice of appeal for each termination order, and, thus, the appeals for both children are properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-13\">. At this time, A.L. was placed in foster care with the Martinez family.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\">. Butler also tested positive for cocaine on a prior occasion, February 26, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b589-7\">. At this time, the Department notified Butler that she needed to sign an entrustment agreement for the Department to maintain custody of A.L. If not, the Department would have to file a petition for emergency removal. Butler did not sign an entrustment agreement at this time. On June 21, 2004, the court entered an emergency placement order, placing A.L. back in the custody of the Department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b589-8\">. Prior to her admission, Butler had been receiving court-ordered substance abuse treatment at Bethany Hall. However, prior to Thanksgiving 2004, Butler left Bethany Hall, and her whereabouts were unknown.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b589-9\">. At the time of V.L.\u2019s birth, Butler tested positive for cocaine. A test of V.L.'s meconium was pending at the time of Butler's test. She also admitted to using cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, and alcohol while pregnant with V.L.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\">. Each agreement states that Butler, after having been provided the opportunity for counseling, and after \"due consideration of alternative plans\u201d for the child, \"surrender[ed] all legal custody of and to the aforesaid child to [the Culpeper Department of Social Services].\u201d Each agreement further states that Butler acknowledged, by signing the agreement, that the Agreement \"constitute^] [her] permanent separation from and termination of all of [her] rights and obligations to said child from the effective date of such Agreement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b590-8\">. In her brief, Butler alleges that she was not aware of the permanent nature of the agreements at the time she signed them. In fact, she alleges that the Department \"misrepresented\u201d the nature of the agreement. However, the trial judge \"found no evidence that Ms. Butler did not know exactly what she was signing with the entrustment agreement.\" Accordingly, there was an explicit finding that there was no evidence of fraud, duress, or misrepresentation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">.

The court shall take into consideration the prior efforts of such agencies to rehabilitate the parent or parents prior to the placement of the child in foster care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. Although \"[bjoth subsection (B) and subsection (C)[ ] of Code \u00a7 16.1-283 address substantially similar grounds for the termination of parental rights,\u201d this Court has \u201cpreviously upheld terminations under both subsections of Code \u00a7 16.1-283, as well as under one or either of the individual subsections.\u201d <em>Winslow, </em>40 Va.App. at 562-63, 580 S.E.2d at 466 (citing <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Stafford County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>14 Va.App. 333, 340, 417 S.E.2d 1, 5 (1992) (upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate residual parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 283(B) and (C)(1)); <em>Lowe v. Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 281-82, 343 S.E.2d 70, 73 (1986) (upholding termination of residual parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(B)(2)); and <em>Lecky v. Reed, </em>20 Va.App. 306, 313-14, 456 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1995) (ordering termination of residual parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(C))). Specifically, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C) focuses on whether the parent or parents \u201chave been [jwilling or [jable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months,\u201d to \"remedy substantially\u201d the conditions which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>led to the foster care placement. <em>Id..; see also Ward v. Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>13 Va.App. 144, 150, 408 S.E.2d 921, 924 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In this case, the trial court found that (1) Butler \"has habitually abused or is addicted to intoxicating liquors, narcotics, or other dangerous drugs,\u201d (2) Butler \"has not responded to or followed through with recommended and available treatment,\u201d (3) Butler \"has failed to maintain contact with and to provide or substantially plan for the future of the child for a period of six months after the child\u2019s placement in foster care notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies,\u201d (4) Butler \"without good cause, has been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months from the date the child was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement,\u201d (5) and that it is in the best interest of the child to terminate Butler\u2019s residual parental rights. Given that Butler admitted to continual drug use while pregnant with V.L., to leaving Bethany Hall before finishing treatment, and to remaining in Maryland to avoid prosecution for a probation violation, we cannot say that the trial court erred in finding that there was clear and convincing evidence to support terminating Butler\u2019s parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
