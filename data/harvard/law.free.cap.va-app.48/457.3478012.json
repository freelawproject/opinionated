We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">On August 8, 2004, Officer Rigney went to 62 Fairfield Avenue in Danville to investigate a shooting. There, Palmer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>told Rigney, \u201cthat he was taking his handgun out of the dresser drawer and he was going to move it to a different location in the residence and when he took it out of the drawer it discharged and shot him in the foot.\u201d Palmer told Rigney \u201cit was a .380 caliber automatic pistol.\u201d Searching a totebag inside Palmer\u2019s bedroom closet, Rigney recovered \u201ca Bryco Arms .380 Caliber handgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced a juvenile adjudication from the Danville Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (\u201cjuvenile court\u201d) dated February 4, 1999, convicting Palmer of breaking and entering. Palmer was sentenced to serve sixty days in a detention home with thirty days suspended. The juvenile court ordered Palmer to attend substance abuse treatment, obtain a GED, and submit reports to the juvenile court every sixty days. It also ordered Palmer to be of \u201cgood behavior and not violate any laws for 12 months.\u201d The order did not place Palmer on supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Danville Probation Officer Craig Saunders testified that Palmer \u201ccame through our Court on some charges [and] was placed on probation and we transferred supervision to the state of North Carolina.\u201d Saunders recalled giving Palmer \u201cprobation rules for the charges not related to the felony,\u201d and testified that the transfer to North Carolina was not in reference to the breaking and entering adjudication, but \u201cwas on other charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Danville Probation Officer Mick Crews testified that Palmer \u201cmoved to North Carolina, so we did interstate transfer.\u201d Crews recalled that Palmer \u201cwas placed on probation by the [juvenile] Court on May the 7th, 1998,\u201d almost six months before the breaking and entering and nine months before the juvenile court adjudication of February 4, 1999. According to Crews, Palmer would not have had a probation officer for the felony breaking and entering adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Palmer testified that he met with a probation officer in North Carolina and discussed his breaking and entering con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>viction. He could not remember the probation officer\u2019s name. Palmer testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">I asked [him] specifically [about guns] because we had, I mean, it was guns everywhere in the house. Like I said, my stepfather was a hunter, a private gun owner, and that was one of the specific topics that me and my parents asked him, and you know, like I said, they said when I turned twenty-one that everything that\u2014you know, a juvenile record is a juvenile record, you know, and when you turn twenty-one it\u2019s supposed to be erased. That\u2019s what the guy\u2014the probation officer told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">At the time he shot himself, Palmer was twenty-two years of age. He testified that he believed he could lawfully possess a firearm at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On cross-examination, Palmer testified that his attorney for the 1999 trial in juvenile court told him that the breaking and entering \u201cwas dropped down to a lesser charge.\u201d The juvenile court records refer to breaking and entering only and do not indicate conviction of a lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Palmer admitted he did not consult with a Virginia probation officer or attorney after arriving in Virginia with a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The trial court reviewed our decision in <em>Miller v. Commonwealth </em>25 Va.App. 727, 737, 492 S.E.2d 482, 487 (1997), and found the facts in that case distinguishable from Palmer\u2019s situation. It declined to \u201caccept the notion that Virginia is bound by what a North Carolina probation officer may say.\u201d Accordingly, it rejected Palmer\u2019s due process defense, holding that Palmer had failed to carry his burden of establishing an affirmative defense. It made no finding as to the identity and status of the person in North Carolina of whom Palmer inquired, of what, if anything, Palmer was told by that person, or of the reasonableness of Palmer\u2019s reliance on that advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Our inquiry in this case is whether a North Carolina probation officer may be an officer upon whose advice, depending on its substance and circumstances, a person under his supervision may rely sufficiently to satisfy the conditions of <em>Miller.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>LEGAL AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 prohibits \u201cany person under the age of 29 who was adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile 14 years of age or older at the time of the offense of a delinquent act which would be a felony if committed by an adult ... to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In <em>Miller, </em>we recognized a due process defense available to a defendant who is on trial \u201cfor reasonably and in good faith doing that which he was told he could do,\u201d <em>Miller, 25 </em>Va.App. at 737, 492 S.E.2d at 487, by \u201ca public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for defining permissible conduct \u25a0with respect to the offense at issue,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 739, 492 S.E.2d at 489. Miller, a convicted felon, testified that he asked representatives of the federal government (ATF), officers of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF), and his Virginia probation officer whether he could lawfully possess a muzzle-loading rifle for hunting. <em>Id. </em>at 730, 492 S.E.2d at 484. All advised him he could possess and use such a rifle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cThe trial court believed Miller\u2019s testimony concerning the content of the information he received but concluded that the sources of Miller\u2019s information were not sufficient to preclude his conviction on due process grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731, 492 S.E.2d at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">On appellate review, we explained that the defense is \u201c \u2018a narrow exception to the general principle that ignorance of the law is no defense,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 741, 492 S.E.2d at 489 (quoting <em>United States v. Etheridge, </em>932 F.2d 318, 321 (4th Cir.1991)), and is grounded on the premise that \u201cconvicting an individual who has reasonably relied on the advice of a state actor is so fundamentally unfair as to raise due process concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, 492 S.E.2d 482, 492 S.E.2d at 488. In raising such a defense, \u201c[t]he defendant bears the burden of establishing the affirmative defense,\u201d and of establishing \u201cas a threshold matter, the legal sufficiency of the content and source of the information received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 737, 492 S.E.2d 482, 488. \u201cThe application of the defense then requires a factual deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>mination whether the defendant\u2019s reliance upon the information received was reasonable and in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 737, 492 S.E.2d at 487-88.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Of course, the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s reliance is inextricably linked to the content of the information received and its source. <em>See, e.g., [United States v.] Howell, </em>37 F.3d [1197,] 1204 [(7th Cir.1994)] (Reliance must be reasonable \u201cin light of the identity of the agent, the point of law represented, and the substance of the misrepresentation.\u201d). Ultimately, however, \u201creasonableness\u201d can be determined only after a finding that the content and source of the information are legally sufficient to invoke due process concerns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 737 n. 5, 492 S.E.2d at 488 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We held \u201cthat the sources upon which [Miller] relied\u2014a federal ATF agent, a VDGIF agent, and his probation officer\u2014were \u2018state actors.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 742, 492 S.E.2d at 490. However, with respect to the ATF and VDGIF agents, \u201cMiller\u2019s case fail[ed] as a matter of law,\u201d because \u201c[n]either of those agents was charged by law with responsibility for defining permissible conduct under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">As to Miller\u2019s probation officer, we disagreed with the trial court and explained that his probation officer \u201cwas charged by the Commonwealth with responsibility for defining Miller\u2019s permissible conduct with respect to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 743, 492 S.E.2d at 491 (citing Code \u00a7 53.1-145). We reversed Miller\u2019s conviction, holding that \u201cMiller\u2019s probation officer was ... a source legally sufficient to invoke the Due Process Clause as a bar to his prosecution and conviction,\u201d and his \u201creliance on the advice of his probation officer was reasonable and in good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, 492 S.E.2d at 491. We contrasted Miller\u2019s situation to those cases involving \u201ca defendant who seeks to invoke the defense as a bar to prosecution by one sovereign for advice received from an official of another sovereign,\u201d and noted that \u201c[t]he defense has been nearly universally rejected in this dual-sovereign context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740, 492 S.E.2d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>To successfully assert the due process defense discussed in <em>Miller, </em>a defendant must prove three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">(1) that he was assured that the conduct giving rise to the conviction was lawful; (2) that the assurance was given by a \u201cgovernment official,\u201d i.e., \u201ca public officer or body charged by law with responsibility for defining the permissible conduct with respect to the offense at issue\u201d; and (3) that, based on the totality of the circumstances, reliance upon the advice was reasonable and in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 665, 671, 593 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2004) (quoting <em>Miller, </em>25 Va.App. at 738-39, 492 S.E.2d at 488-89, 491).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-295 prescribes the procedure for transferring supervision of a juvenile from a Virginia city or county to another state and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">The Director of the Department of Juvenile Justice may make provisions for the transfer of a juvenile placed on probation in this Commonwealth to another state to be there placed on probation under the terms of Article 4 (\u00a7 53.1-166 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 53.1 [the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Code \u00a7 53.1-166 authorizes the governor to enter into prescribed supervisory compacts with other states. Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 323 sets forth the provisions of the \u201cInterstate Compact Relating to Juveniles\u201d which the Governor of Virginia executed and entered into with the fifty states and the District of Columbia, including North Carolina, <em>see </em>N.C. GemStat. \u00a7\u00a7 7B-2800\u20147B-2827 (2005) (containing the provisions for their interstate compact). Article I of Virginia\u2019s compact provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">The cooperation of the states party to this compact is therefore necessary to provide for the welfare and protection of juveniles ... with respect to (1) cooperative supervision of delinquent juveniles on probation or parole----In carrying out the provisions of this compact the party states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>shall be guided by the ... policies which guide their laws concerning delinquent, neglected or dependant juveniles generally____The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-323.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Article VII(b) directs \u201ceach receiving state\u201d to \u201cassume the duties of ... supervision over any such delinquent juvenile and in the exercise of those duties will be governed by the same standards of ... supervision that prevail for its own delinquent juveniles released on probation or parole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">The trial court recognized \u201cthat probation had been transferred,\u201d however, it refused to \u201caccept the notion that Virginia is bound by what a North Carolina probation officer may say.\u201d In other words, it concluded that a North Carolina probation officer to whom Palmer\u2019s case had been transferred \u201cwas not a source legally sufficient to invoke the Due Process Clause as a bar to his prosecution and conviction\u201d in Virginia. <em>Miller, </em>25 Va.App. at 745, 492 S.E.2d at 491. It reasoned that firearm laws in North Carolina are \u201cmuch more liberal in allowing individuals who\u2019ve committed or [been] adjudicated of certain crimes to possess firearms, particularly in their homes. Virginia\u2019s laws are materially different in that regard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The trial court tied its ruling not to an analysis of the substance or reasonableness of the advice given Palmer, but to the legal authority of a North Carolina probation officer to give such advice. The interstate compact foreclosed that holding. It constituted the North Carolina officer an adjunct officer of the Virginia probation system. Thus, under <em>Miller, </em>Palmer was authorized to seek advice from his supervising North Carolina probation officer. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion if the Commonwealth be so advised. If on remand Palmer again asserts the due process defense, the trial court shall make the threshold determination that a North Carolina probation officer may be a person charged by the Commonwealth with defining appellant\u2019s conduct. It shall then consider the tendered proofs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>identity and status of the person from whom Palmer contends he sought advice and the substance of any advice given, and shall determine whether Palmer\u2019s alleged reliance on that advice was reasonable and satisfied the conditions set forth in <em>Miller.
