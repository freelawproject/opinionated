The District Court affirmed a final order of the co-respondent Board of Personnel Appeals (Board) which granted retroactive pay to the co-respondents Community Corrections Specialists II, employees of the Department of Institutions (employees). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">The issue we address on appeal is whether the District Court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s order granting retroactive pay to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-15\">The employees initiated a classification appeal by filing a petition with the Board on April 24,1987. They sought a classification review of their Community Corrections Specialist II (CCS II), grade 12, classification. The Board designated the classification appeal a group classification appeal pursuant to 24.26.513, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-16\">The Division submitted a Step III response to the group classification appeal on August 31,1987. The response included the Division\u2019s findings that the employees\u2019positions were properly classified as CCS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>II, grade 12. The Division also found that while the appeal investigation did not yield a more appropriate class for the employees, comparisons to other positions, including Community Corrections Specialist III (CCS III), grade 13, indicated a need for a series review; complicating the classification appeal was a reassignment of some employees to the then newly-created Department of Family Services. The Division further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">The State Personnel Division shall conduct a review of the Community Corrections Specialist Series to determine whether 1) the reassignment of some [of the employees] to the Department of Family Services will affect their position classifications; 2) a grade level distinction exists between the [CCS II and CCS III] classes; and 3) the appropriate grade levels have been assigned to Community Corrections Specialists Series.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">On September 15, 1987, the parties stipulated that, pending the series review, the employees\u2019 classification appeal would remain in full force and effect; the stipulation specifically preserved the established date of filing. The stipulation also waived the time requirement for appealing the Step III decision until the series review was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Division completed its series review on June 3, 1988. It developed a new classification for positions assigned adult case supervision under the Department of Institutions. All positions at grades 11 and 12 were reclassified to Probation and Parole Officer, grade 13. Positions assigned juvenile case loads, under the Department of Family Services, were reclassified as Family Services Specialists II, grade 13. The reclassification and resultant upgrade became effective on July 1, 1988. The Division determined that the employees were not entitled to retroactive pay because they were properly classified when they filed their classification appeal, based on the standards then in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">On June 10, 1988, the employees advanced their classification appeal to Step IV of the grievance procedure. The parties stipulated to the issues to be presented to the hearing examiner at a hearing which was held on January 13, 1989. The issues were whether the CCS III class specification was a better description of the employees\u2019 position duties than CCS II and whether the employees\u2019 position duties were more similar to those positions assigned to CCS III.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The hearing examiner issued his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended order on April 7,1989. He found that the CCS III class was distinguished from the employees\u2019 class only by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>addition of special assignments. However, he denied the employees\u2019 request to be reclassified on the grounds that they did not demonstrate that they performed the additional duties assigned to the higher class, that they were improperly classified, or that the Division failed to comply with the established methods or standards when considering their classification appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The hearing examiner also found that the Division\u2019s investigation resulting from the employees\u2019 classification appeal indicated a need for a classification series review and that \u201c[a]ny upgrade resultant from that series review must be retroactive.\u201d He concluded that the employees were aggrieved when their reclassification was not made retroactive. He recommended an order that those employees reclassified as a result of the series review be paid the difference between what they had been paid and what they would have been paid had the results of the series review been made retroactive to thirty days prior to the date of their classification appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The Division filed exceptions to the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended order. The Division asserted that because the hearing examiner found against the employees on the two issues stipulated to by the parties prior to the hearing, the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation that the employees be awarded retroactive pay was improper. After oral argument, the Board remanded the case to the hearing examiner for further proceedings pursuant to the stipulations in effect at the time of the previous hearing, together with the issue of retroactive pay. The Board\u2019s order did not address the question of retroactivity other than setting the cause for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Another hearing was set for September 26, 1989. At a prehearing conference on September 5,1989, the parties agreed that the hearing examiner would not hear additional evidence on the two previously stipulated issues. The sole issue presented to the hearing examiner was whether there was \u201clinkage\u201d between the employees\u2019 classification appeal and the series review and, if so, whether that linkage provided a basis for retroactive pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The hearing examiner issued his second findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended order on March 14, 1990. He reaffirmed his earlier findings on the original two issues and further found that there was linkage between the employees\u2019 classification appeal and the series review. He found that the Division recognized the need for a series review prior to the employees\u2019 classification appeal and, while the classification appeal may not have been <em>the </em>motivating factor for the series review, it was <em>a </em>factor which, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>with others, accelerated that review to correct a recognized need. The hearing examiner again recommended retroactive pay based on his conclusion that the linkage between the employees\u2019 classification appeal and the series review \u201c[m]eans that the [employees] were aggrieved when their resultant reclassification and upgrade was not made retroactive to thirty (30) days prior to the date of their Wage and Classification Appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">The Division again filed exceptions to the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended order. The matter was argued to the Board on June 6, 1990. The Division argued that the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation of retroactive pay was improper because the employees were not found to be aggrieved on the two original stipulated issues. It further argued that, because the employees were properly classified at the time they brought their appeal, any link between the employees\u2019 appeal and the Division\u2019s series review was not sufficient to provide a basis for retroactive pay. The Board adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended order on June 28,1990. The Division\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The Division filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision and order in the District Court on October 5,1990. The court determined that the Board\u2019s decisions were substantially supported by the record. It further determined that the award of retroactive pay to the employees was proper and affirmed the Board\u2019s decision and order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Did the District Court err in affirming the Board\u2019s order granting retroactive pay to the employees?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact, the standard of judicial review used is whether the findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence in the whole record. Section 2-4-704, MCA; <em>Dept. of Revenue v. UPS, Inc. </em>(Mont. 1992), [252 Mont. 476,] 830 P.2d 1259, 49 St.Rep. 20. An agency\u2019s conclusions of law will be upheld if the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The Division contends that the District Court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s order granting retroactive pay because the order was contrary to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of the Classification Appeal of Warren C. Mead v. Board of Personnel Appeals </em>(1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>235 Mont. 08, 766 P.2d 1300. A review of <em>Matter of Mead </em>is necessary for resolution of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><em>Matter of Mead </em>involved a classification appeal by Highway Patrol Officers. Employees in the positions of Sergeant, Lieutenant and Captain initiated a grievance before the Board seeking to compel the Division to adopt new position descriptions, develop new class specifications and reclassify their respective positions. New position descriptions were submitted to, and adopted by, the Division. The Division then reclassified the positions. The new classification resulted in an assignment of the same grades to the officers. The officers appealed the assignment of grades to the Board. A hearing examiner found that the officers were aggrieved and recommended that they be reclassified by raising their grade levels one pay grade. The Board amended the recommended order by requiring the Division to conduct a classification series review.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The Division conducted a series review and recommended that the officers retain the original grade assigned to their class. The Board rejected the recommendation and adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s original findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended order. The district court reversed the Board\u2019s order on the basis that it violated Section 2-18-203(2), MCA, which prohibits an appeal of the grade assigned to a class.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">On appeal, the Board argued that under Section 2-18-1012, MCA, and our decision in <em>Hutchin v. State </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 15, 688 P.2d 1257, it had authority to resolve any grievance even if resolution of the classification appeal resulted in reallocation of the grade assigned to a class. Section 2-18-1012, MCA, provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">If upon the preponderance of the evidence taken at the hearing the board is of the opinion that the employee is aggrieved, it may issue an order to the appropriate agency or agencies of state government requiring such action as will resolve the employee\u2019s grievance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AML\"><em>Hutchin </em>involved a wrongful discharge grievance \u2014 rather than a classification appeal under Section 2-18-203 \u2014 by a former employee of the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. Under Section 87-1-205, MCA, grievances against that Department are governed by Sections 2-18-1011 through 2-18-1013, MCA. The Board found the employee aggrieved, ordered reinstatement and denied an award of back pay. In affirming the Board\u2019s decision, we stated that \u201c[i]t is apparent from section 2-18-1012, MCA, that if the Board of Personnel Appeals determines that the employee is aggrieved, it has full discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tion to resolve the employee\u2019s grievance.\u201d <em>Hutchin, </em>213 Mont. at 19, 688 P.2d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">We rejected the Board\u2019s contention in <em>Matter of Mead </em>that, based on our holding in <em>Hutchin, </em>it had the authority to resolve any grievance. We affirmed the district court\u2019s reversal of the Board\u2019s decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">Contrary to [the Board\u2019s] contention, the District Court found that the Board is limited in a classification appeal by Section 2-18-203(2), MCA, to determining whether a position has been properly classified by the Division. The court held that the Board was without authority to create new classifications or to assign grades to classifications, and it distinguished <em>Hutchin </em>by stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac7e\"><em>\u201cHutchin </em>involved the discharge of a state employee for personal use of state owned property. In <em>Hutchin </em>the board directed that the discharged employee \u2018be reinstated as of the date of this final order to the position he held with the department\u2019 at the time of his termination. That is the type of remedy that is uniquely within the discretion of the board. However, the board\u2019s order here usurps a function that has been delegated exclusively to the division.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s holding that the board is limited to determining whether a position is properly classified. If a position is improperly classified, the Board may then order the Division to reclassify the position in accordance with its existing policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>Matter of Mead, </em>235 Mont. at 215-16, 766 P.2d at 1304-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Thus, under Section 2-18-203(2), MCA, and <em>Matter of Mead, </em>the Board in a <em>classification appeal </em>is limited to determining whether a position is properly classified. <em>If </em>the Board determines that the position is improperly classified, and the employee is, therefore, aggrieved, the Board can resolve the grievance under Section 2-18-1012, MCA, by ordering the Division to reclassify the employee\u2019s position and, as appropriate, ordering other remedies such as retroactive pay. In contrast, because no classification appeal was involved in <em>Hutchin, </em>the Board was not limited by Section 2-18-203, MCA, and was free to fashion an appropriate remedy under Section 2-18-1012, MCA, upon finding that an employee was aggrieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">We conclude that, under the circumstances presented in the present case, the Board exceeded its legal authority when it granted retroactive pay to the employees. Prior to the first hearing before the hearing examiner, the parties stipulated that the issues were whether the employees were improperly classified as CCS II and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>whether they should have been classified as CCS III. The employees were not found to be aggrieved on either issue. The hearing examiner, and ultimately the Board, found that the employees were properly classified as CCS II based on the class specifications that were in place at the time the employees brought their classification appeal. These findings remained unchanged throughout the subsequent history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Even though the Board found that the employees were properly classified at the time they brought their classification appeal, it awarded the employees the increase in pay which resulted from their reclassification, retroactive to thirty days before they brought their appeal. This grant of retroactive pay was based on a finding of \u201clinkage\u201d between the employees\u2019 classification appeal and the Division\u2019s series review. While linkage between the classification appeal and the series review existed, we conclude that that linkage was not legally sufficient to provide a basis for retroactive pay. Under Section 2-18-203, MCA, and <em>Matter of Mead, </em>a determination by the Board that the employees were improperly classified was a prerequisite to granting a remedy to the employees. Having found the employees to be properly classified, the Board exceeded its statutory authority in granting retroactive pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In addition, because the employees were found to be properly classified as CCS II, grade 12, at the time they brought their appeal, the <em>effect </em>of the award of retroactive pay was to upgrade the employees\u2019 positions to a higher pay grade during the very time period that they were found to be properly classified. As such, the Board\u2019s order was tantamount to an assignment of a new grade to the employees\u2019 class in violation of Section 2-18-203(2), MCA. <em>Matter of Mead, </em>235 Mont. at 217-18, 766 P.2d at 1306. Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the Board incorrectly concluded that the employees were entitled to retroactive pay and exceeded its authority in granting such pay. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The Division raises additional arguments in support of its position that the District Court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s order granting retroactive pay to the employees. In light of our holding in this case, these arguments need not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b537-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, McDONOUGH and WEBER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b537-3\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"Arh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The majority is correct that pursuant to our decision in <em>Matter of Mead </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 208, 766 P.2d 1300, the Board of Personnel Appeals cannot review and correct the grade assigned to a particular class. However, the majority opinion is incorrect when it concludes that our decision in <em>Mead </em>and Section 2-18-203, MCA, requires a determination by <em>the Board </em>that employees were improperly classified before retroactive pay can be awarded. Our decision in <em>Mead </em>did not deal with the circumstances under which retroactive pay can be awarded, and there is nothing in Section 2-18-203, MCA, which specifically links an award of retroactive pay to <em>the Board\u2019s </em>decision on the issue of classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Furthermore, I disagree that the employees were found to be properly classified at the time they brought their appeal. The State Personnel Division\u2019s investigation found that based upon the classes then available, Community Corrections Specialist II, Grade 12, was as good as any. However, the Department went on to acknowledge that its investigation indicated that a complete review of the classifications was necessary. That review resulted in the employees\u2019 reclassification. It was in that reclassified posture that this case came before the Board. The Board simply determined whether the Department\u2019s reclassification of the employees was a result of their appeal. No one has challenged the Board\u2019s finding that there was in fact linkage between the appeal and the reclassification by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The facts in this case are not similar to the facts in <em>Mead. </em>In that case, the hearing examiner for the Board of Personnel Appeals recommended raising the employees\u2019 grade level by one pay grade. The Board issued findings and conclusions adopting that recommendation and we held that the Board was without authority to entertain an appeal of a pay grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In this case, the Board did not issue an order changing the employees\u2019 pay grade. No action of the Board resulted in a change in the employees\u2019 pay grade. The employees appealed their classifications to the State Personnel Division. As a result of that appeal, the Division concluded that the classifications in question should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>reviewed. As a result of that review, the employees were reclassified by the Department and assigned a different grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">All the Board did in this case was determine that based upon the employees\u2019 reclassification, they were entitled to retroactive pay for 30 days prior to the date their appeal was filed. This is the exact relief authorized by Section 2-18-203(3), MCA. The majority opinion has placed qualifications on the award that are not found in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Our specific holding in <em>Mead </em>was that the Board of Personnel Appeals could not create classifications, nor assign grades within classifications. In this case, the Board\u2019s decision to award retroactive pay was not based on its creation of any new classification. Nor was it based on the Board\u2019s assignment of any new grade to the employees. It was based on the Board\u2019s determination that the Division\u2019s review of the employees\u2019 classifications, and the Department\u2019s subsequent reclassification of the employees, was linked to the employees\u2019 original classification appeal to the Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">On appeal, the Division argues, and the majority concludes, that the only issue before the Board was whether the employees should have been classified CCS III, rather than CCS II. The majority concludes that since the employees did not prevail on this issue, they were not aggrieved. However, limiting the issue presented to the Board in that manner is incorrect. At the second hearing before the Board\u2019s hearing examiner, the parties stipulated that the issue to be decided by the hearing examiner would be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">Whether there is linkage between the wage and classification appeal of the Community Corrections Specialist II class and the class review of the Community Corrections Specialist series, and if so, does that linkage provide a basis for awarding retroactive pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAu\">After considering the evidence, the hearing examiner found that there was linkage. There was substantial evidence to support that finding on appeal, and no one contends that it was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Therefore, I conclude that it was not the Board which changed the employees\u2019 grade. That grade was changed by the Department in response to the employees\u2019 appeal. The Division, however, refused to award the retroactive pay to which the employees were entitled, based upon that reclassification. Therefore, the Board was within its authority when it considered the issue of retroactive pay on appeal. For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-9\">JUSTICE HUNT concurs in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE TRIEWEILER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
