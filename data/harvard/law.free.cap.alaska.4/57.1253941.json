Tliey were docketed in the district court and became a lien upon Barnes\u2019 real property. Thereafter plaintiff Decker brought another action against Barnes on a note and attached the same real property. Subsequently the marshal sold the real property on executions' on the two justice\u2019s judgments, and the property was purchased by the plaintiff Decker. After paying the two justice\u2019s judgments, there was a surplus of $1,350.20 in the registry of the court. Barnes demanded the surplus, and this suit was brought to restrain him and an assignee from securing it. <em>Held, </em>that, where a greater amount was bid and paid than was necessary to satisfy the two justice\u2019s judgments, the surplus amount would in equity stand in the place of the property sold, and be subject to the attachment lien; restraining order issued.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-9\">[Ed.

M. Barnes in the justice\u2019s court, one in J. P. T. No. 20 for $115.32 and one in J. P. T. No. 21 for $454.65; that they were docketed in this court, becoming liens on certain real property of the defendant, E. M. Barnes; that executions were issued thereon; that thereafter, on June 2, 1909, in cause No. 720A, an attachment was issued and levied upon said, real property to secure the payment to Elizabeth Decker of $1,350.20; that said attachment lien was subject to the liens of the before-mentioned executions; that thereafter, on July 3, 1909, the marshal of this court under said executions sold said premises to the plaintiff, Elizabeth Decker, for $2,000; that after satisfying such judgments there remained in the marshal\u2019s hands $1,350.20; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the plaintiff, Elizabeth Decker, has an attachment lien thereon in cause No. 720A to answer any judgment she may obtain therein; that the defendant, E. M. Barnes, is seeking to have the said $1,350.20, which has been paid into the registry of the court by the marshal, paid to him, thereby defeating plaintiff\u2019s lien. Plaintiff further alleges the insolvency of the said E. M. Barnes. Plaintiff prays that such money remain in the registry of the court pending the termination of cause No. 720A, and prays further an injunction to restrain the defendant, E. M. Barnes, and all persons claiming under him, from interfering in any way with said money, and that the said money be decreed subject to said attachment lien and paid in satisfaction of any judgment plaintiff may recover in said cause No. 720A and for general equitable relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">The defendant, E. M. Barnes, by his amended answer to the amended complaint, admits the recovery of the judgments, their docketing, and the issuance of execution thereon as alleged. Defendant further admits the suing out and levy of the writ of attachment in cause No. 720A, and alleges that the executions were not levied until the day following the levy of the attachment. Defendant further admits the sale of said premises under the executions for $2,000 to the plaintiff, Elizabeth Decker, and her payment of that amount, but denies that the sale passed full title, and alleges that the premises remained subject to the attachment lien. Defendant further admits that the surplus of $1,530.20 remains after satisfying such judgments, and :the same has been paid by the marshal to the clerk of this court, but denies that the same is subject to the attachment lien or otherwise subject to the control of the court, save to pay the same over to the defendant, E. M. Barnes. Defendant, Barnes, alleges that by the levy of said- writ of attachment on the 2d day of June,- 1909, the plaintiff, Elizabeth Decker, obtained a lien upon the property, subject to the existing lien created by the judgments upon which said executions were issued, for any judgment she might obtain in said cause wherein said attachment had been sued out; that said attachment lien still continues to exist; that, should plaintiff recover judgment in said cause, the same may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>be satisfied by the sale of said real property. The defendant further admits that he has demanded and sought to obtain as alleged the $1,350.20 surplus held in the registry of the court, and still seeks to obtain the same; that he has assigned said money to his attorney, G. C. Israel, who appears for him in his amended answer, seeking to litigate and settle all rights therein without any change in the parties to this litigation. The defendant denies his insolvency.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-4\">J. F.

These judgment liens were prior and superior to the lien of the subsequent attachment sued out of the district court, although the levy of the attachment might be prior to the levy of the executions upon the judgments. The liens of the judgment being prior and paramount liens, the holder of these judgments had a right to sell, in satisfying them, the entire title in this property, which would necessarily wipe out the lien of the subsequent attachment. If a greater amount was bid and paid than was necessary to satisfy the judgments, the surplus amount would in equity stand in the place of the property sold, and the surplus money remaining, into which the property had been converted, vfould be subject to this attachment lien; this notwithstanding the fact that the remedy of an attachment is a creature of the statute. 3 Am. &amp; Eng.

Barnes, upon a promissory note dated April 1, 1906, the sum of $850, with interest at the rate of one per cent, per month from May 1, 1906, and an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>torney\u2019s fee of $100. The defendant by his amended answer puts in issue only the reasonableness of the attorney\u2019s fee of $100. I find that $50 would be a .reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in cause No. 720A. This cause having been submitted upon the pleadings to the court, judgment will be awarded plaintiff for the face of said note, interest, and the attorney\u2019s fee indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">The defendant, E. M. Barnes, G. C. Israel, and all persons claiming through or under said E. M. Barnes are restrained from seeking to obtain or recover said $1,350.20 in the registry of the court, and the same will be applied upon and in satisfaction of the judgment to be rendered in 720A.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
