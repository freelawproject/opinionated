Oscar Fish, 4 Alaska, 427. The court has carefully considered the opinion of- Judge Cushman and the authorities therein cited, as well as the authorities submitted by' T. M. Reed, attorney for the town, and feels that the decision of Judge Cushman is undoubtedly right under the law and will therefore follow that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">The town should accept the tender of Mr. Orland of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>amount of his tax, plus 8 per cent, interest, and the costs of this proceeding should be borne by the town. Let findings and judgment in accordance with these views be prepared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
