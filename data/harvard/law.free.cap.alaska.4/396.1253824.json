Admittedly no objections to the complaint were filed in the justice\u2019s court, either by demurrer or motion in arrest of judgment. However, such waiver does not prejudice the rights of the defendant in this court, upon the grounds mentioned, in the demurrer filed herein. State v. Mack, 20 Or. 234, 25 Pac. 639. Nor is it deemed necessary to cite authority to the effect that a defendant in a criminal action cannot waive a constitutional guaranty, or right, such at least as is in question here. Nor can it be seriously contended that a constitutional provision granting to an accused person the right \u201cto demand the nat\u00fare and cause of the accusation against him\u201d can be waived or surrendered by him; and, if an indictment (complaint) does not contain such a description of the offense as to notify the accused of the nature or cause of the accusation against him, it is a nullity and may be objected to at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">It cannot be seriously contended that the facts set out in the complaint filed herein upon the appeal from the justice\u2019s court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>informed the accused in any way of the crime against him other than by reference to the Codes of Alaska, or other publications provided by the government for use in the territory of Alaska, and which in effect could no more than direct the accused to seek the Code or such publications as are mentioned above to discover of what crime he was accused; and, should he have been fortunate enough to have secured a copy of the law, he would have found section 25 to have contained provisions for. assault by a person armed with a dangerous weapon, or being armed with a dangerous weapon, for the crime of threatening another or for unlawfully striking or unlawfully wounding another; of which particular crime he was being accused, and for which he was to prepare for trial, he could but guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">The accused has been deprived of a constitutional guaranty and an express right provided under the Code of Alaska. Such a defect appearing upon the face of the complaint cannot be corrected by amendment in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The demurrer is sustained upon both grounds, and. the accused ordered discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
