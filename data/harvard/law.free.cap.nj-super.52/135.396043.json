A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ARM\">O\u2019Dowd\u2019s Dairy (hereafter called O\u2019Dowd\u2019s) appealed \u201cfrom the whole of the final decision, determination and order of the Director of the Office of Milk Industry dated February 13, 1958.\u201d That order followed a hearing before the Director, held pursuant to an order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>show cause issued by him, which called upon O\u2019Dowd\u2019s to show cause why its license to engage in the milk business should not be suspended or revoked. It was charged in that order to show cause that O\u2019Dowd\u2019s had violated various sections of the milk control law (N. <em>J. S. A. </em>4:12A-1 <em>et seq.) </em>and two \u201cofficial orders\u201d of the Office of Milk Industry (OMI) adopted pursuant thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">At the hearing before the Director OMI was represented by a deputy attorney general, and O\u2019Dowd\u2019s by its counsel. Each side called witnesses who were examined and cross-examined. The Director then rendered the decision appealed from. In it he concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201cAfter consideration of the facts presented at the hearing, I find O\u2019Dowd\u2019s guilty of violating Order 1 and Order 56-2. I impose a penalty on it of $50 plus the cost of the hearing. In addition, I order it to pay all producers at least the minimum price for the period of February, 1957 as indicated on the auditor\u2019s report it received with the Order to Show Cause in this case within 30 days of receipt of this determination, or in the alternative, its license will be revoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Said Order 1 requires dealers to account to producers on a monthly basis, and Order 56-2 fixes a minimum price to be paid to producers for Class I milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">O\u2019Dowd\u2019s appealed on the grounds that (a) the Director had no jurisdiction to order appellant to pay money to the farmer producers; (b) the Director had no authority to impose a penalty of $50, and (e) the Director had no authority to assess the cost of the hearing upon appellant. After oral argument the parties amicably agreed upon the amount to be paid to the producers and ground of appeal (a) above mentioned was withdrawn. Therefore this opinion will deal only with the remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">In <em>Sherry v. Schomp, </em>31 <em>N. J. Super. </em>267 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), this court held the Director has no authority to impose the monetary penalties fixed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:12A-39. The Director says that holding was not necessary for the decision in the <em>Sherry </em>case and therefore was <em>dictum, </em>and he asks us to reconsider and reverse that holding. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>advances the arguments which will he dealt with hereafter, which he says he was not afforded an opportunity to present in the <em>Sherry </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201cAny person who shall violate any of the provisions of this act or the orders, rules and regulations of the director as adopted from time <em>to </em>time shall be deemed guilty of a violation of the provisions of this act and shall pay a penalty of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) for the first offense and not more than two hundred dollars ($200.00) for the second, or each subsequent offense, and such penalty when collected shall be paid to the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey and become a part of the general fund of the State of New Jersey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>4 424-41 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cThe County Courts and the county district courts shall have jurisdiction of actions for penalties under this act and such penalties shall be collected and enforced in a summary manner pursuant to the \u2018penalty enforcement law\u2019 (Sec. 2A:58-1 <em>et seq.). </em>If judgment be rendered for the plaintiff and the defendant fail forthwith to pay the amount of the judgment and the costs and charges incident thereto, said defendant may be committed to the county jail for any period not exceeding one hundred days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The Director argues \u201cthat section 39 intends that the finding whether a regulation has been violated, and if so, the determination of the amount of the penalty within the statutory limits, are to be made by the Director with the aid of his expertise. The grant of jurisdiction to the county and district courts under <em>section </em>41 merely provides machinery for collection, a means of getting a writ of execution into the sheriff\u2019s hands. In such an action, the only issue should be the regularity of the proceeding before the Director.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">No authority is cited to support this argument, and the analogies the Director seeks to draw from other sections of this and other statutes are not convincing. The Penalty Enforcement Law (N. <em>J. S. A. </em>24:58-1 <em>et seq.) </em>governs the enforcement of penalties under all statutes similar to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39. <em>Dept. of Labor &amp; Industry v. Rosen, </em>44 N. <em>J. Super. </em>42, 48 <em>(App. Dw. </em>1957). The annotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>under <em>N. J. S. A. 2A</em>:58-1 <em>et seq. </em>lists 15 other statutes which provide for the collection of penalties for their violation by proceedings under this law, yet not one of them has been construed as the Director would construe <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39, even though the language in those statutes is quite similar. Counsel for the Director admitted at the oral argument that he knew of no statute which gave any administrator or board the power contended for here, to compel a court to enter judgment, issue execution, and jail defendant for a penalty the amount of which is fixed by the complainant, and to forbid the court from inquiring into defendant\u2019s guilt or the reasonableness of the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">OMI is an arm of the executive. Laying aside the constitutional and other difficulties which a court would have with a statute that so provided in unmistakable terms (cf. <em>Wilentz ex rel. Golat v. Stanger, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>606-608 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943)) it goes without saying that we should not by way of construction add such extraordinary limitations upon freedom to a statute that does not expressly contain them.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Whatever inferences can be drawn from the history of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39 and 41 are against rather than for OMI\u2019s position. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39 was adopted as <em>section </em>39 of the <em>Laws of </em>1941 (c. 274, <em>p. </em>732), and has remained unchanged since that time. <em>Section </em>41 of that same act provided that the courts therein specified were empowered \u201cupon the filing of a complaint, in writing, duly verified * * * that any person has violated any of the provisions of this act, to issue process at the suit of the director of milk control as plaintiff, * * * such process shall state what provisions of the law and orders and rules and regulations are alleged to have been violated by the defendant or defendants, and on the return of such process or at any time to which the <em>trial </em>should bo adjourned, the said court shall proceed in a summary manner, without a jury, <em>to hear testimony and to determine and give judgment in the matter </em>* * * either for the <em>plaintiff, for the recovery of such penalty, with costs, or for the defendant.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number><em>Section </em>43 of the same act <em>(L. </em>1941, <em>c. </em>274, <em>p. </em>734) set forth the form of conviction. That section required that the form recite \u201cthat the witnesses in said proceeding who testified for the plaintiff were (name them), and the witnesses who testified for the defendant were (name them).\u201d Said <em>section </em>43 also provided <em>(L. </em>1941, c. 274, <em>p. </em>39) \u201cThe costs recoverable in any such proceeding shall be the same as costs taxed in actions in said courts and shall be recovered in the event of the <em>conviction </em>of the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In 1953 <em>section </em>41 was amended by <em>L. </em>1953, c. 5, <em>p. </em>39, <em>sec. </em>36 <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>4:134-41) to read as quoted above. This act was one of the many passed by the Legislature to conform old statutes to the new court system, and to relegate as many procedural matters as possible to the rules. That amendment eliminated all the procedural details from <em>section </em>41, and those details have since been supplied by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:58-1 and the <em>rules </em>\u2014 R. <em>R. </em>7:13-1 to 17; <em>R. R. 5:2-6; </em>County District Court Forms 11, 13 and 13. <em>Clapp, </em>8 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>30, 31. The provisions of these rules are substantially similar to the procedural provisions that were eliminated from <em>section </em>41.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><em>Chapter </em>5 of the <em>Laws of </em>1953, which amended <em>section </em>41 in the manner above set forth, also amended numerous sections of other penalty statutes concerning agriculture and domestic animals to make the procedure thereunder the same as under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:58-1, to be enforced at the suit of administrators who have as much right to claim expertness as the Director. There is no reported instance in which any such administrator has ever claimed, under <em>chapter 5 </em>of the <em>Laws of </em>1953, or under any other statute before or since, the power demanded here by the Director. Though that, of course, is not conclusive, it does suggest that the construction argued for here is contrived rather than ingenious.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">We therefore adhere to <em>Sherry v. Schomp </em>and hold that the Director has no power, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:134-39, to impose the penalty of $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>If \u201cthe cost of the hearing\u201d which the Director ordered O\u2019Dowd\u2019s to pay was intended by the Director as an incident of the imposition of that penalty, it falls with the penalty, for if the Director had no authority to assess the penalty he had no authority to assess costs as an incident thereof. In 1941 said <em>section </em>41 <em>(L. </em>1941, <em>c. </em>274, <em>p. </em>733) provided that the <em>\u201ccourt </em>shall * * * give judgment * * * with costs,\u201d and <em>section </em>42 provided that the costs \u201cshall be the same as costs taxed in actions in said <em>courts.\u201d </em>As we have seen, said <em>chapter </em>5 of the <em>Laws of </em>1953 repealed <em>section </em>42 of the 1941 act altogether, but other statutes were enacted to provide for the imposition of costs by the <em>courts, </em>in proceedings under <em>section </em>41. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-41, 45; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>224:2-44; <em>R. R. </em>7:13-16. <em>Cf. </em>N. <em>J. S. A. </em>4:124-18. No statute gives such power to the Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The Director contends that even if he has no right to impose costs under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39 he does have the right to do so as a \u201creasonable condition on the renewal of a license\u201d under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124 \u2014 35. He cites no authority for this proposition. In every case that has been brought to our attention in which the costs or expenses of an investigation by an administrative body have been assessed against the corporation involved it has been done under the express terms of a statute. 73 <em>C. J. S. Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure </em>\u00a7 24, <em>p. </em>318; \u00a7 91, <em>p. </em>410. <em>Cf. Maltbie v. Comprehensive Omnibus Corp., </em>190 <em>Misc. </em>1017, 75 N. <em>Y. S. 2d </em>260 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947). The Director admits the statute does not expressly give him this authority, but he argues that he has it by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Even under the most liberal construction of the broad and potent powers given the Director under this statute <em>(Lane v. Holderman, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>304, 315 (1957); <em>In re Port Murray Dairy Co., </em>6 <em>N. J. Super. </em>285, 301 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950)), no right to impose costs can be implied therefrom. The power to impose costs is not \u201cfairly and reasonably necessary or appropriate\u201d to make the Director\u2019s express powers effective. <em>Cf. Lane v. IIolderman, supra. </em>It can not be argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>these costs axe necessary to help defray the expenses of the Director\u2019s investigations and hearings, for the costs are paid to the State Treasurer and become part of the general revenues of the State. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-39, 45. Nor is the collection of such costs necessary to enable the Director to carry out his functions other than investigatory. He has drastic powers with which to enforce the law \u2014 far more compelling than penalties under <em>section </em>39. He may suspend or revoke a license. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>4:124-35. He may seize products produced or handled in violation of the law (N. <em>J. S. A. </em>4:124-39), and he may proceed in the Superior Court against chronic violators by injunction. N. <em>J. S. A. </em>4:124-44.. On the other hand, he may informally adjust violations (N. <em>J. S. A. </em>4:124-43), in which case he may collect the sum the violator agrees to pay. If these powers are not sufficient, the remedy lies with the Legislature. The Director may not impose as a condition of renewal that which he has no power to demand during the life of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Eor the foregoing reasons so much of the order appealed from as imposes a penalty of $50 and costs is set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
