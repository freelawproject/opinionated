On the same day Brolaskey, the appellant, was appointed in his place, and as trustee he receipted for the cash and certificate. An auditor was appointed. Brolaskey produced two receipts, one dated January 2, 1836, for $710.58 in cash, signed Mary Harrison, and another dated June 2, 1836, for $330.78 in full of the trust, also signed by her. This last was composed of cash $61.25, and of a bill for $269.53, making $330.78.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">The auditor was of opinion that the payments to Mrs. Harrison were in violation of the instrument of trust, and were no discharge to Brolaskey. He, however, declined to charge interest, except from July 10, 1850, as no claim had been made upon Brolaskey for-principal or interest till application to him on July 10, 1850, a period of more than fourteen years from the receipt. He was charged with the cash balance received from the former trustee, and with the certificate, the expenses of the audit, &amp;c., amounting to $1075.69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-8\">Exceptions to such report were filed, but they were dismissed by the Court, and Brolaskey appealed. Exception was taken to the confirmation of the report, and to the overruling of the exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-9\"><em>Lex </em>and <em>B.

R. </em>367; 5 <em>Id. </em>142-3-4; 11 <em>Beav. </em>483. That according to the terms of the instrument treating the trust, she was to have the disposal of the trust fund by will, and it was submitted whether the payment to her was not an investment of the fund, and producing no interest, that none should be recovered from the trustee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-11\"><em>Chase </em>and McAllister, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0p\">It was contended that Mrs. Harrison was not <em>the absolute owner </em>of the trust property; that she had no power over it except what was given to her by the trust instrument: 1 <em>Rawle, </em>247, Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan. That the trust- deed provided that the $1000 should not in any event be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>paid to her, and in every event should be subject to the trusts expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">It was further contended that the payment to her was not <em>an investment </em>of the fund at her request. That there was a clause in the deed against permitting the <em>cestui qui trust to anticipate </em>the interest. Also, that the accountant should be charged with the expenses of the audit.

Is she entitled to this ?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">It is sought to found the demand on a valuable principle \u2014 that a married woman has no power over her separate estate, other than what is given to her in the trust deed. But we discover no evidence anywhere that she was a married woman at the time she demanded and received payment. If it is material whether her husband was then living or not, she should have proved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Is this material? The plaintiff would say, No; because the declaration of trust restricts her power over the fund, even if she should become sole. True, it does, but the whole profit of it is hers, she may dispose of it by will, and if she die intestate it is to go to her representatives. These rights indicate an absolute estate, and such, in equity, it was, and such it was, at law, with us, unless there was some sufficient reason for preserving the distinction between the legal and the equitable title. It is preserved during the life of the husband in order to save it from him. But when he is dead, she is freed from the law of her husband, and stands <em>sui juris, </em>and has a right to demand the control of what in equity is absolutely hers. Restraints upon an absolute title are not allowed except for good and apparent reasons. No one would doubt these principles as applied to an estate in trust for a man; and the law has no different rules for a woman who is unmarried ; see <em>Atherley on Marr. Sett. </em>333. When this plaintiff became sole she had a right to demand and receive the trust funds, because the entire equitable title was hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">But if she had proved that she was not sole at the time she received the fund, that would not have changed the result; for then it would also have been proved, as it was admitted on the argument, that her husband died in June, 1836, that is, very shortly after the receipt of the money. According to the foregoing principles, she was then entitled to demand the custody of tho fund as her own, if she had not already properly received it. Could she have sued for it at common law ? It is difficult to doubt it; for the amount was clearly defined, having been paid to him for her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>but a few days before, and the purpose of the trust was satisfied, and there remained no need of the supervision of a ehanc.ellor. It was therefore a common debt; vesting without any payments of principal or interest, and supposed to have been properly paid more than fourteen years before suit brought, and it, is plainly barred by the statute of limitations. This decree must therefore be reversed, and the plaintiff\u2019s petition dismissed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Decree.-March 21, 1853. This cause came on to be heard at December Term, 1852, in the appeal of Simon Brolaskey, the defendant, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of .Philadelphia county, and was argued by counsel, and now on consideration thereof it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the decree of the said Orphans\u2019 Court be reversed and set aside, and that the plaintiff\u2019s petition be, and the same is hereby dismissed out of this Court with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
