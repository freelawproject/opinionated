It is not necessary that, in an account for materials furnished for the erection of a house, they should be charged in the precise words of the Mechanics' Lien Act of 1836, viz., as furnished, \u201c for or about the erection or construction of the same.'' \u2014 Equivalent words are sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-6\">2. An account stating the materials to have been delivered to the contractor named <em>\u201c </em>for John Brown's house on Delaware Twelfth street, below Bedford street,'' was admissible in evidence in support of the claim.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-7\">3. Even though the materials furnished have been charged by the seller to the contractor individually, it is competent to show that they were furnished on the credit of the building sought to be charged.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-8\">Error, to the Common Pleas, <em>Philadelphia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">This was <em>scire facias, </em>under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act, by John Kelly against John Brown, owner, and William G-.

The claim filed was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">John Kelly, of the county of Philadelphia, lumber merchant, files this his claim to secure payment of the sum of seventy-three dollars and twenty-five cents against a three-story brick house on, the west side of Delaware Twelfth street, thirty-four feet six inches south of Bedford street, containing in front sixteen feet six inches, and in depth seventeen feet six inches, and the lot of ground extending in depth sixty-five feet. The said claim is for lumber furnished by the said John Kelly on the credit of the said house and ground within the last six months, at the instance and on the request of the said William Gr. Marshall, he being the contractor and builder off the said house, and the said John Brown being the owner of said house and ground. The said John Kelly annexes a bill of particulars of his said claim, <em>as a part hereof, </em>and claims a lien on the said house and ground, for the said sum of seventy-three dollars and twenty-five cents, from the commencement of the said house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-11\">Signed, \u2018 John Kelly.

Kelly, J., charged that the claim was defective, in not setting forth that the materials were furnished for or about the erection and construction of the building, and, therefore, that the verdict must be for defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">Such charge was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-8\"><em>Robb, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANYj\">A substantial compliance with the 12th section of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act of 1836, is all that is necessary: 2 <em>Barr </em>77; <em>Id. </em>76; 6 <em>Id. </em>191; 8 <em>Id. </em>478; 9 W. &amp; <em>Ser. </em>186. Reference also made to 10 <em>Barr </em>188, Knabb\u2019s Appeal; 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">The 1st section of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act of 1836, is, that every building erected, &amp;c., \u201cshall be subject to a lien for the payment of all debts contracted for work done, or materials furnished for, or about the erection or construction of the same.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVm\">April 21,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b449-11\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">The lien filed in this ease, beside describing the building with more particularity than is demanded by the Act of Assembly, contains a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s account for materials, showing that they were charged to the contractor <em>\u201cfor John Brown\u2019s house.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The plaintiff offered evidence in support of his lien, and it ought to have been received. Even if the materials had been charged to the contractor individually, it would have been competent to show that they were furnished on the credit of that particular building: Presbyterian Church <em>v. </em>Allison, 10 <em>Barr </em>413. Obviously, then, an account, which, on its face, recognised the building to be charged, was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">It is not necessary that the account should contain the very words of the statute, <em>\u201cfor or about the ereetion or construction of the building.\u201d </em>Any equivalent words are sufficient. <em>\u201cBor John Brown\u2019s house\u201d </em>is as good a designation as the more tautological phrase of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">The judgment is reversed and a <em>venire de novo awarded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
