The tax deed to James Jordan is dated 3d February, 1806. The assignment from him to William Jordan is dated 25th September, 1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-8\">\u201cThis deed is for 200 acres of land in Hopewell township, assessed as the property of John M. Stillman, and for taxes of the year 1800,1, 2, and 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-9\">\u201cThe only assessment proved was for the road-tax of 1803. The sale-was for $38, and there is a surplus bond for $25.69, dated May 5, 1806, and marked, filed 8th June, 1806. As to the identity of the land assessed, with that patented to John Morgan as 300 acres, and called <em>\u2018 </em>Shrewsbury,\u2019 you have first the evidence of Mr. Potter, one of the Commissioners of the county, that he could find no assessments for Hopewell township earlier than the year 1803; also of Mr. McCallister, who says that Hopewell township was formed during the last war. Daniel Leieh says the <em>\u2018 </em>Shrewsbury\u2019 tract went by the name of the Stillman tract. This, then, in connection with the fact that no tract in either Moon or Hopewell was assessed as the Shrewsbury tract, would be, perhaps, satisfactory to the jury, that the tract assessed in the name of John M. Stillman was the Shrewsbury tract. The fact that the assessment is made for but 200 instead of 300 acres, may be accounted for by the evidence of such witnesses as Rpbert Hood and others, that the father of Robert Hood purchased, at an ea.rly period, 100 acres off the Shrewsbury tract. It is true, some of the witnesses are unable to say when the purchase was made precisely. Leich recollects that Hood was there as early as 1810. The lines are found separating the 100 acres from the other portion of the tract, and it appears to have been assessed to Hood as early as 1802. It is further in evidence, that the duplicates containing the assessments cannt be found in the office prior to 1802.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-10\">\u201c It does not appear by what authority the 100 acres was stricken off to Hood; but we are of opinion that a transaction so ancient as this was, and not questioned for fifty years, is sufficient from which to presume authority. This, then, would validate the assessment. It is not questioned but that the title is, and was out of the Commonwealth. And as to the 200 acres assessed, they must be considered as unseated, unless some other person than Hood was in possession of the tract; and if there was, we have failed to perceive the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>\u201c Many things required by the Act of 1804, under which the sale was made, have not been complied with, and one in particular has been complained of by the defendants \u2014 that there is no evidence that the sheriff had any warrant to sell. But we are of opinion that if the jury believe that the land was unseated, the title out of the Commonwealth and that an assessment was made, all pther irregularities or omissions are cured and barred after the expiration of five years from the sale, if the purchaser, or his assignee, or those claiming under them, were in possession for that length of time. The evidence is that <em>William Jordan, </em>according to the recollection of Leich, <em>tools possession as early as </em>1810; in this he is corroborated by the assessments. James Jordan is assessed as early as 1806, 7, and 9. It also appears that this possession has been continued ever since. Dolen did not come on earlier than 1829, according to the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">\u201c The next, and perhaps the most important inquiry for the jury, will be, whether this land is covered by the Shrewsbury survey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">The Court, explained the general principles which govern with respect to surveys, and referred to portions of the evidence as to the surveys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-7\">\u201cBut the .defendants say if the jury should find against them on every other point, still they have a, good title by virtue of the statute of limitations of 1785.' How is this? Jordan went into possession in 1809, and has been in possession ever.since. It is probable from the evidence that Dolen took possession in the year 1829. He is first assessed in 1880; this suit was brought in the beginning of 1850; Dolen\u2019s article is dated 1st December, 1828; so that [if he was in possession 21 years before the bringing of this suit, it is as much as can be said. But if the plaintiffs were in possession before this, claiming the whole, and their title was perfect before Dolen entered, the defendants would be confined in their defence to the part enclosed or cultivated for 21 years before the bringing of this suit. As <em>to the part, if any, cleared or enclosed more than </em>21 <em>years before the commencement of this suit, </em>we have no evidence of either its position or quantity; no surveyor has marked it, no witness has designated it with certainty, no evidence was offered to you from which you could form or dictate any description. If therefore you find for the plaintiffs it must be <em>general;\u25a0 </em>and if they choose to take possession of any improvement made more than 21 years before this suit was brought, the defendants may regain possession by bringing ejectment against them.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-8\">November 25, 1851, verdict was rendered \u201cfor the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-9\">It was assigned for error, 1. That the Court below erred in charging the jury that \u201c the plaintiffs have shown a good title, and a right to recover, unless the locality in dispute is not comprehended in their tax deed,\u201d and \u201c that if the jury believe that tho <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>land was unseated, the title out of the Commonwealth, and an assessment was made, that all other irregularities or omissions are cured and barred after the expiration of <em>five years from the sale, </em>if the purchaser or his assignee, or those claiming under them, <em>were in possession for that length of time.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\"><em>2. </em>Error was also assigned to the portions of the charge last before recited, and enclosed in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-7\"><em>Cunningham, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azs\">It was contended that there was no such assessment as authorized the sale in question. That there was no evidence of a warrant by the county commissioners to the sheriff to sell, and that such omission was not a mere irregularity, which would be cured by the lapse of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-8\">Sheik came into possession under at least <em>color of title </em>from the Commonwealth, and was not to be regarded as an intruder. To give effect to the statute of limitations, the possession of an occupant by a colorable title is coextensive with his title; but the possession of an avowed intruder is confined to the land actually occupied by him: 3 <em>Watts </em>70. An entry is <em>by color of title </em>when made under a <em>bond fide </em>and not a pretended claim: <em>Id. </em>72.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-9\"><em>Fetterman, </em>with whom was <em>Roberts, </em>for defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aph\">It was said that the controversy in this case was not between the holders of the tax title and the owners of the legal title under the patent to Morgan; but between the holders of the tax title and those claiming under one who entered as <em>an intruder, </em>and afterwards became a purchaser of the O\u2019Hara title. It was submitted whether, as the owners of the title under Morgan had not' complained of any defect in the tax sale, strangers to that title have the right to object to the sale as defective: 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>197.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\">William Jordan was in the undisturbed possession of the land from 1809 till the purchase by Dolen from Giles in 1828.- During that time Jordan had his family on it, and had made valuable improvements, and paid the taxes, and no one claimed under the Morgan patent adversely to him. It was contended that the title of the owners of the land was barred by non-claim for five years after a sale for taxes; and that since the Act of 1824 the limitation commenced from <em>the day of sale: </em>9 <em>Barr </em>71, Robb <em>v. </em>Bowen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">Ip the sheriff\u2019s deed was recited a sale for the county and road taxes of 1800-1-2, and the road tax for 1803; and it was contended that if a tract of land be sold for the payment of the taxes of several years, and there be a sufficient assessment for any one of the years, the sale is good: 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>259, Bratton <em>v. </em>Mitchell. In Dikeman <em>v. </em>Parish, 6 <em>Barr </em>211, it was held that the sheriff\u2019s deed was admissible without the warrant from the commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-12\">As to the 2d assignment. On the 1st December, 1828, Dolen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>purchased from Giles. Before that, he had erected his cabin and cleared the three acres for which he paid taxes on part of the Hood 100 acres in the Shrewsbury survey, and which was not within the survey of the O\u2019Hara tract. At the time of such purchase Jordan was residing with his family on the 200 acres, and it was improved and cultivated by him till his death, and afterwards by those claiming under him. He and they had actual possession of all the land they had cleared and enclosed, and constructive possession of all the residue within the lines of the tract; and if Dolen cleared and cultivated land within the interference of the surveys, the statute of limitations would apply only to. that part he actually occupied by clearing and cultivation. \u201cWhen there are interfering surveys, the statute of limitations protects only to the extent actually improved:\u201d 4 <em>Barr </em>111, Hatch <em>v. </em>Smith; 5 <em>Barr </em>490, Seigle <em>v. </em>Louderbach.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">Where the defendant sets up the statute of limitations as a defence for part of the land in dispute, he must designate it by a draft or marks upon the ground, so as to enable the jury to describe it in their verdict: 2 <em>Watts </em>28.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AE\">October 11,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b33-8\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGq\">The plaintiff below claimed under James Jordan, and recovered upon a tax sale of what was called \u201c Shrewsbury Survey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The sheriff\u2019s deed under the sale for taxes was executed to James Jordan, on the 3d February, 1806, and in 1809 possession was taken under that title, which has been continued ever since, without any action or claim on the part of the original owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">By the Act of 3d April, 1804, it was declared that no action for the recovery of lands sold under that Act, should lie, \u201c unless the same be brought within five years after the <em>sale.\u201d </em>By reason of the supposed difficulty in bringing an action of ejectment against a purchaser who had not taken actual possession, it was 'held, in opposition to the previous decision in Parish <em>v. </em>Stevens, 3 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>298, that the limitation did not commence until <em>possession </em>was taken under the sale, and that the original owner might bring his action within five years after possession was taken: Waln <em>v. </em>Shearman, 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>357; Cranmer <em>v. </em>Hall, 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>36. In consequence of the decision in Wain <em>v. </em>Shearman, the Act of 29th March, 1824, made provision for bringing an ejectment against a purchaser who had not taken possession, and gave to any person \u201c then having a right of entry because no actual possession had been taken of the land so sold,\u201d a right of action within two years from the date of the Act. In this case no action was brought within the two years prescribed, or at a.ny time. Since the Act of 1824, the limitation commences to run <em>from the delivery of the deed to the purchaser: </em>Robb <em>v. </em>Bowen, 9 <em>Barr </em>71. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>It is not necessary in this case to decide that the action of the original owner would have been barred even in the absence of possession under the sale; but, under the uncontradicted evidence of actual possession, taken in 1809, and continued till this time without interruption, his action is clearly barred, and the title under the sale for taxes is perfect.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The statement that \u201cif Dolen was in possession twenty-one years before the bringing of this suit, it is as much as can be said,\u201d was an intimation of the opinion of the Court on a question of fact, which did not take its ultimate decision from the jury. It is therefore not ground for reversal. Rut the error did the defendants below no harm, for it conceded to them a possession of sufficient duration for their purposes. A longer possession than twenty-one years, under the circumstances of this case, would not have secured to the plaintiffs in error any material advantages on the trial; for there is no evidence whatever to show that their possession was taken before that of the defendants in error, which, as already stated, commenced in 1809. This is a case of interfering surveys or titles with each party in actual possession under his own title, but neither party enclosing, or cultivating, or otherwise actually occupying the part included in the interference. Under such circumstances, the law adjudges the possession of it <em>to be </em>in the rightful owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">It is complained that the Court stated in its charge that, \u201c as to the part, if any, cleared or enclosed more than twenty-one years before the commencement of the suit, we have no evidence of either its position or quantity. No surveyor has marked it; no witness has designated it with certainty; you have no evidence; none was offered you from which you could form or dictate any description. If, therefore, you find for the plaintiffs, it must be generally; and if they choose to take possession of any improvements made more than twenty-one years before the suit was brought, the defendant may regain possession by bringing ejectment against them.\u201d We perceive nothing in the evidence to justify any complaint against this instruction. If the plaintiffs in error relied upon their deed from Dolen as fixing the boundaries of their possession, this will not enable them to hold by constructive possession any part of the older and better title in the actual possession of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">To disseise the rightful owner in actual possession, an actual occupancy within his lines by the disseissor is indispensable. In such a. case the statute of limitations will have no effect, except as to the part which is actually enclosed: Cluggage <em>v. </em>Duncan, 1 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>111. If the plaintiffs in error relied upon such actual enclosure, it was their duty to show, by a draft, supported by the evidence, or by other means perfectly satisfactory, the extent, location, and duration of such enclosure. It is peculiarly incum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>bent upon a party, claiming, to hold land by virtue of such- an occupancy, to furnish the means of setting it off to him with certainty. In such a matter there should be no guess-work. Where the claimant of such a possession occupies the attention of a jury with the extent of his <em>present </em>enclosures, 'instead of distinctly defining their extent and location <em>as existing </em>21 <em>years before the suit was brought, </em>he is pursuing the shadow and forgetting the substance. The directions of the Court on this part of the case meet our cordial approbation.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The errors assigned are not sustained, and the judgment is to <em>be </em>affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Note. \u2014 In a late case from Jefferson county, viz., that of Burd\u2019s Executors v. Patterson, in which the opinion of the Court was delivered in December, 1853, by Lewis, J., it has been again decided that under the Act of 29th March, 1824, the limitation of five years begins to run against the former owner, not from the time when possession was taken in pursuance of the sale for taxes, but from the delivery of the treasurer\u2019s deed to the purchaser.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
