At the time of the testator\u2019s death the Act of 8th April, 1833, was in force. The 8th section of that Act provides that \u201cthere shall <em>heno representation </em>admitted among collaterals <em>after brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children.\u201d </em>This provision, and in these words, is found in the Justinian Code, the English Statute of distributions (22 and 23 Charles 2, ch. 10), and in an Act of Assembly of l705. It is supposed to have been omitted accidentally in the engrossment of the Act of 1794. The Act of 1833 has restored it. The words used have long since received judicial interpretation. Beeton <em>v. </em>Darkin, 2 <em>Vernon, </em>170, (n. 1,) Trin. Term, <em>1690; </em>Maw <em>v. </em>Harding, <em>Pr. in Ch. 28, 2 Vernon, </em>33, Trin. T. 1691; and in Pett\u2019s case, 1 <em>Peere Williams, </em>25, intestate died leaving a deceased brother\u2019s <em>child, and a </em>deceased brother\u2019s <em>grandchild, </em>and the <em>grandchild was not admitted to any distributive share. </em>The clause in the statute which says that there.shall be no representation amongst collaterals after brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children, being to be intended that none shall take by representation but the <em>children of brothers and sisters to the intestate, </em>Holt, C. J., Trin. T. 1700 \u2014 and this decision was adverted to and reaffirmed in the case of Bowers <em>v. </em>Littlewood, 1 <em>Peere Williams, </em>593, by Parker, Ld. Ch. Mich. T. 1719 \u2014 and the same was held in Widmore <em>v. </em>Woodruff, <em>Ambler, </em>636, 595. See 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-13\">2. Had this Act not been in force at the decease of the testator, it still would have governed the case, because he postpones the operation of this clause of the will to a period subsequent to his death by the use of the word \u201c <em>then.\u201d </em>He says \u201c <em>after </em>the decease of both my said sisters, I <em>give and </em>bequeath the remainder of said property to my <em>then </em>heirs at law, or their legal representatives, to them, their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-14\">There was no bequest to a person to be ascertained at all until <em>after </em>the death of the sisters. Nothing vested until the termina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tion of the life estates: Archer <em>v. </em>Jegon, 8 <em>Simon, </em>448; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, <em>Id. </em>353; Hetherington <em>v. </em>Oakford, 7 <em>Jurist, </em>571.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">The latter part of the clause, to wit: \u201c or their legal representatives, to them, their heirs and assigns for ever,\u201d contains no qualification of the former, for the sense is the same without as with it, and the whole clause conveys the same idea as if he had said that those persons were to take under the will at the time appointed, who would have taken had he lived until that time and then died intestate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-7\"><em>H. M. Phillips, </em>with whom was <em>Page, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apkq\">The testator\u2019s <em>intention </em>must govern: <em>Swinburne on Wills, </em>part 1, 29; 10 <em>Barr </em>498, Johnson <em>v. </em>Currin; <em>V. &amp; B. </em>272; <em>1 Burr. </em>38; 4 <em>Id. </em>2581.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-8\">_ Applying the rule of intention, it was contended that the testator intended to divide his property so as to make distribution according to the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court in this case; that the will was to this effect, \u201c I give all my property (my homestead excepted) to my two unmarried sisters, Mary and Sarah, to my other sister, Mrs. Hergesheimer, and to my niece, Ann Stook (my brother\u2019s daughter), they being my heirs at la,w; and the homestead I give to my .unmarried sisters during their lives, and the life of the survivors, and <em>then </em>it shall be sold, and the proceeds be divided among <em>mg remaining </em>heirs;\u201d the word \u201cthen\u201d signifying \u201cremaining\u201d after the death of two of those whom .he recognised as his heirs at law. The words \u201cheirs at law\u201d are but words of description; but if intended to cast the estate, as though in case of intestacy, it is obvious that, as the law stood (which the testator is presumed to have known), the property would have been divided as it has been. The then existing law of 1794 (the will being made in 1832) describes who shall be heir at law, and the testator uses the same words of description with the same meaning. This is known by his adding the words \u201c <em>or their legal </em>representativesfor\" if a contrary construction of his language 'be adopted, the death of Mrs. Stook, the present appellant, would' have barred her representatives, if there had been any of a nearer generation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-9\">It was submitted, that the testator used the words as words of participation, and not of exclusion, and that he had so declared his purpose in the entire will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-10\">The Act of 8th April, 1833, was reported to the Legislature in 1832, by the Commissioners of the Civil Code, who, in their report (p. 483, <em>Report on Revised </em>Code), justify the introduction of the 8th section upon grounds of policy, and attribute its repeal in 1794 to accident. But it is a \u201c Statute\u201d relating to the descent and distribution of the estates of \u201c <em>Intestates,\u201d </em>and the clause relied upon is a proviso to the 7th section, admitting collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>relatives, in default of certain others named in a preceding section. <em>This </em>is not a case of <em>intestacy, </em>nor does it relate to the distribution of the estate of <em>an intestate, </em>and therefore the 8th section does not apply; for the only intestacy would be that of Mrs. Tlergesheimer, whose lineal descendants are the appellees.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-6\"><em>Oadwalader, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AQQ\">March 21,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b354-8\">Lowrie, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEM\">Many persons write their wills with such an undefined conception of what they wish, especially in their substitutionary provisions, and with such little carefulness that their intentions shall be understood by others, that judicial interpretation must very often be a mere systematic mode of guessing at what the intention would have been, or how it would have been expressed, had the testator taken the trouble to think more accurately about the subject. The present will is of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The testator gives to his two maiden sisters a life estate in land, and then provides that, after their death, it shall go to his \u201c then heirs at law or their legal representatives, to them, their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d At the death of his sisters, the next of kin of the testator were Ann C. Stook, a brother\u2019s daughter, and several grandnephews and grandnieces, the grandchildren of a sister, who was living at his death, but died afterwards. The question is, does Ann O. Stook take the\u2019whole as his \u201cthen heir;\u201d or does she take only the one-half, and the grandnephews and grandnieces the other half?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Our law does not look for collateral heirs beyond brothers\u2019 and sisters\u2019 children (see Act relating to descents, 1833, s. 8); and, therefore, the grandnephews and grandnieces cannot take strictly as heirs. But, if their grandmother took a vested estate under this will, they can take as her heirs; or they can take as devisees, if they are described as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">Their grandmother did not take a vested estate, if the testator meant to give it to those only of his heirs who should be living at the expiration of the life estate. Is this his meaning ? He gives it to his \u201c then heirs at law or their legal representatives.\u201d Why shall we reject this last part of the expression? It may indeed be redundant, if the former part be taken strictly; but, if it be itself taken strictly, it throws back the redundancy upon the word \u201cthen.\u201d We therefore gain nothing by this suggestion; for we know not which to reject or modify. But is the expression not rather elliptical than redundant? Is it not equivalent to saying \u2014I give it to my heirs, or to the legal representatives of such as would have been heirs if then living ? A man is quite as apt to be elliptical as redundant, in writing his will, if not much more so. If the reading just suggested is the true one, then the grandmother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>of the Hergesheimers took a vested estate, and they take as her heirs. And the law leans in favor of this construction, by favoring, in doubtful cases, the claim of the heir who was such at the death, and by preferring a vested to a contingent estate, where the intention is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The circumstances show that the use of the word \u201cthen\u201d can be very easily accounted for, and that it is possibly misplaced. He provides that the old homestead of the family, which he had obtained from his father, shall remain during life with his two old maiden sisters, and it was perfectly natural that he should next provide that it should then go (as we read it) to his other heirs or their legal representatives; in other words, to the remaining descendants of his father. Following this construction, we retain the words \u201cor their legal representatives;\u201d and it is certainly much more probable that the word \u201cthen\u201d should have been misplaced than tha,t these other words should have been used without any corresponding idea in the mind of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Let it be granted that the foregoing exposition is not entirely satisfactory; it becomes so when we view this clause in another aspect. Who are described as devisees? His \u201cthen heirs at law or their legal representatives.\u201d This description is peculiar, and it is very hard to believe that it was used except to convey the idea that, if any of- his heirs should die before the estate should vest in possession, then the heirs or devisees of such heirs should take. He could not have meant to provide for their assigns, for, in another clause, he attempts to exclude the power of assignment as to one of them, even after the vesting in possession. Then he intended, as we have supposed; or he intended nothing by the words \u201clegal representatives,\u201d which we cannot suppose. These words are truly descriptive of the devisees, and not words of limitation ; otherwise we fall into another difficulty; for he uses words of limitation immediately afterwards, \u201cto them, their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d It follows, therefore, that the Qourt below was. right in decreeing one-half to Mrs. Stook and the other half to theHergesheimers.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
