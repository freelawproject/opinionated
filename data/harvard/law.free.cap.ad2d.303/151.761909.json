Each was a 50% stockholder of the closely held corporation. In 1997, Che Choi died, and his wife, plaintiff Shui Kam Chan (Shui Kam), allegedly inherited her husband\u2019s interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In 1999 Shui Kam, individually, and as administratrix of her husband\u2019s estate, commenced an action against Kwak Yak and Heep Cheung. Plaintiff alleged that since her husband\u2019s death, Kwak Yak had assumed total control over the corporation, and was operating it for his personal benefit, using corporate funds for personal purposes, without consulting her, without holding shareholders\u2019 and/or directors\u2019 meetings, or providing for elections of officers and directors. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on a number of different grounds, including failure to state a claim. The court granted defendants\u2019 motion, without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to replead.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Plaintiff then commenced, by service of an amended complaint, a shareholder\u2019s derivative action, \u201con behalf of all the shareholders of Heep Cheung Corporation, and in the right of Heep Cheung Corporation,\u201d against Kwak Yak, for breach of fiduciary duty and failure to follow corporate formalities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Plaintiff requested an accounting, an order compelling Kwak Yak to repay Heep Cheung improperly diverted funds, and a direction that Kwak Yak promptly call directors\u2019 and shareholders\u2019 meetings. Plaintiff also sought the appointment of a permanent receiver to determine whether or not Heep Cheung should be dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\">Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The Court granted this motion, \u201cwithout prejudice to the Estate of Che Choi Chan\u2019s right to commence a corporate dissolution proceeding.\u201d It stated that plaintiff lacked standing to bring a shareholder\u2019s derivative action. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">On a CPLR <em>3211 </em>(a) (7) <em>motion </em>to dismiss a complaint, we must accept all of the factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all inferences favorably to the plaintiff <em>(see Barr v Wackman, </em>36 NY2d 371, 375 [1975]). Applying this standard, Shui Kam\u2019s uncontroverted allegation that, as administratrix of her husband\u2019s estate, she has a 50% interest in Heep Cheung, is sufficient to give her standing to bring the instant derivative suit <em>(Law v Smith &amp; Sons Carpet Co., </em>271 App Div 705, 706 [1947]). Moreover, plaintiffs allegations of self-dealing and corporate waste, if ultimately proven, would justify an accounting, reimbursement, and the appointment of a receiver <em>(Blank v Schafrann, </em>70 NY2d 887 [1987]). Plaintiff is not relegated to a corporate dissolution proceeding to enforce her rights, and may properly bring a derivative action against Kwak Yak for mismanagement and waste <em>(see Lincoln First Bank v Sanford., </em>173 AD2d 65 [1991]; <em>Abelow v Grossman, </em>91 AD2d 553, 554 [1982], <em>appeal dismissed </em>58 NY2d 1112 [1983]; <em>Kruger v Gerth, 22 </em>AD2d 916 [1964], <em>affd </em>16 NY2d 802 [1965]).
