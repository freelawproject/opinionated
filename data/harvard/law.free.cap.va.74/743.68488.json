Mr. Taylor\u2019s failure to pay sooner, was pure negligence, as he is a man of property, but engrossed in farming, forgot to pay.

I believe from the papers I have seen of the defendant, that the assessment was not made to pay for expenses and losses of the defendant. I am able and willing to pay any proper assessment on the deposit note held by the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b775-9\">On his cross-examination he makes the following among other statements: \u201c This company is a banding-together of citizens for mutual protection, by which perfect security is guaranteed, and no money is required when losses are sustained above the bare expenses of the company. The reasons for insuring by the mutual plan, and in this company, may be briefly summed up: The insured retain the control of their own money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>and are required to pay no assessment on their notes,, except when actual losses render it necessary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b776-9\">He exhibited a printed pamphlet to the jury in which, among other things not material to be here repeated, the following statement is made concerning the \u201cPlan of business and resources of the Southern Mutual Insurance Company:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b776-10\">\u201c This company, chartered by the Commonwealth of Virginia, insures property against loss or damage by fire or lightning, and does business on the mutual and joint stock plan. Policies are issued for a term not to exceed five years. Every person insuring on the mutual plan becomes a member of the company, is entitled to vote at elections for directors, has access to the books of the company, and pays only what is absolutely necessary to keep him insured, and thus saves what is paid to stockholders in the way of dividends, &amp;c., when insured on the stock plan. Each person insuring on the mutual plan, before obtaining his policy, is required to deposit with the company his deposit note and pay a certain amount in cash. This deposit note is not negotiable, but merely assessable when, at any time during the life of applicant\u2019s policy, the cash means of the company are inadequate for the payment of its liabilities. So long as the company is enabled.to discharge its liabilities, nothing will or can be collected on its notes, and they will be returned to the insured at the expiration of their policies, together with their proportionate share of the surplus cash earnings then in the hands of the company, determined by the amount of cash each has paid in virtue of his policy.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b776-11\">The testimony of the plaintiff as a witness, after embracing some other matters not material to be noticed here, was then closed, when H.

Davidson was examined as a witness in behalf of the plaintiff, having been summoned under a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>describing him as \u201csecretary of the Southern Mutual Insurance Company of Richmond, Virginia,\u201d and commanding him to bring to court with him such of accounts or other writings of the said company, or exact copies of such parts thereof as show the finandal condition of said company on the 10th day of October, 1873, and particularly all the assets of said company, and in what they consisted, and all the liabilities of said company, how they arose and to whom due; also all such books of account or other writings of said company, or exact copies of such parts of such books and writings as show the financial condition of said company on the 15th day of January, 1872, and particularly all the assets of said company and in what they consisted, and all the liabilities of said company,, how they arose, and to whom due; and also all books of accounts or other writings, or such parts or exact copies thereof as show the amount of losses and expenses of every kind paid by said company for the year ending the 10th day of October, 1873, to whom due and in what amount such losses were paid, and to whom and for what and in what sums such losses were paid; all of the said books and writings now remaining with the said Davidson, as it is said, then and there to testify in behalf of said Taylor in a certain matter of controversy in the said court depending between the said Taylor, plaintiff, and the said company, defendant..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b777-6\">The said Davidson being sworn said, among other things: \u201cI was formerly president of the defendant corporation and am now a director in the corporation, superintendent of agencies and one of the executive committee of the corporation,\u201d &amp;c. \u201cWilliam C. Carrington is the president of the company. I think he was elected president the 8th of October, 1873.\u201d \u201cI have no books or papers of the company to show its financial condition on the 10th of October, 1873. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number><em>subpoena duces tecum </em>was served on me as the secretary of the company, to produce certain books and papers of the company. I am not the secretary of the company. I did not bring any such books or papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b778-8\">On his cross-examination he said: \u201c It would have required a wagon to transport these books from the railroad here, and would have required an expert to have explained them. The books called for in the <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>would have filled an immense goods box. The withdrawal of these books from the office of the company would have caused a suspension of its business during their absence. I presume it would have taken all the clerks the company had, several weeks or longer, to make the extracts from the books called for by the <em>subpoena. </em>That is the reason I did not bring these books or make the extracts. \u2018 The term cash premiums,\u2019 referred to in the card spoken of as one of the papers issued by the company, embraces all premiums in cash or in notes, or still in hands of agents not paid over. I do not know what is the usual proportion of cash and cash premium notes. The policy-holders usually avail themselves of the privilege of giving notes for the cash premiums. I have here the minute book of the board of directors of the defendant company.

Taylor, G-ogginsville, Ya. This was the second assessment made on this note, the first one having been paid.

After stating the case, he proceeded:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The only question of controversy in this case is, whether the policy is void by reason of the failure of' the insured to pay the amount of the second and last assessment on his premium note; as \"required by the hoard of directors of the company?</p>\n<p id=\"AtTW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>There is no question whatever but that, by the express terms of the policy, it was stipulated and agreed by and between the parties thereto, that in case ^oss or c^amage by or lightning to the property therein insured, and the note given for the cash premium or any part thereof, or any assessment or assessments on the premium note of the assured shall remain unpaid and past due at the time of such loss or damage, the said policy shall be void and of no effect; and that, by the express language of the application on which said policy was issued, which said application was subscribed by the plaintiff, James S. Taylor, the applicant, it was agreed by and between the parties, that in case of loss or damage by fire or lightning to the said property, and the note given for the cash premium or any part thereof, or any assessment as aforesaid shall remain unpaid and past due at the time of such loss or damage, the said policy shall be void and of no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Hor is there any question whatever but that, by a resolution of the board of directors of said company-held October 10th, 1873, it was, among other things, resolved, that a second and further assessment of twenty-five <em>per cent, </em>was made on the said plaintiff\u2019s deposit note of one hundred and ten dollars; that on the 25th day of May, 1874, a letter was addressed and sent by the secretary of said company to the said plaintiff, James S. Taylor, at G-ogginsville, enclosing a copy of the said resolution and other proceedings of the said board, the commencement of which letter was in these words: \u201c In accordance with the resolutions appended, you are requested and required to remit to this office (of Southern Mutual Insurance Comp\u2019y, Ho. 11, Main street, Richmond, Ya.,) $27.50, net amount) levied by second assessment on your deposit note, Ho. 5014, given for policy of same number for $110. Please <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>remit by cheek; draft, postal order, registered letter or express, prepaid, and receipt therefor will be forwarded to you;\u201d in which letter also were included these words: \u201cyour attention is hereby called to the following provisions of the charter and conditions of your policy: then followed copies of sections 5 and 6 of the charter, and that condition of the policy which declares as aforesaid that, \u201cit is hereby expressly stipulated and agreed by and between the parties, that in case of loss or damages by fire or lightning to the property hereby insured, and the note given for the cash premium or any part thereof, or any assessment or assessments on the premium note of the assured, shall remain unpaid and past due at the time of such loss or damage, this policy shall be void and of no effect;\u201d and the conclusion of which letter was in these words: \u201cto avoid the penalties above set forth you are advised and requested to remit at once the amount required of you. bio agent is authorized to collect any assessment except on receipt signed by the secretary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aml7\">blor is there any question but that the said letter was duly received by the said Taylor, and that he did not comply with the request therein contained; his testimony before the jury on that subject being in these words: \u201cI received it (the letter aforesaid) by due course of mail. More than 30 days elapsed after I received the notice before my house was burned. I never did pay the amount of this assessment. I did not offer to pay it at any time within thirty days after I received the notice of the assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">blor is there any question but that the said Taylor was fully informed that it was the duty of the board of directors to make assessments on the deposit notes of the insured to meet the expenses and losses of the company; that two such assessments had been so made on the said note of the said Taylor, one of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>assessments liad been actually paid by him, and the other had never been objected to by him before the of this suit; but on the contrary he had always before that time assented to its binding obligation on him, and been willing to pay it; a letter having been written at his request, on the 8th day of July, 1874, by G. H. T. Greer, cashier of the Franklin bank, Rocky Mount, Va., to the Southern Mutual Insurance Company, Richmond, Va., which letter was read in evidence to the jury on the trial of this cause, and is in the words and figures following, to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201c Dear Sir :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">\u201cAt request of Mr. James S. Taylor, I enclose check on Planter\u2019s Rat. Bank for $30, to pay assessment on his policy. In doing so, I have to say that Mr. Taylor\u2019s house was burned on the 5th instant, but I hope that the payment of the amount of assessment, even at this time, will be all right, as the company loses nothing thereby, as it had the payment of the premiums perfectly assured, and by the payment of the amount above, it gets all it could have gotten. Mr. Taylor\u2019s failure to pay sooner, was pure negligence, as he is a man of property, but engrossed in farming forgot to pay. He does not know the exact amount of the assessment, but I suppose the $30 will be enough. Please answer as soon as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">\u201cVery resp\u2019y,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">\u201cG. II. T. Greer, <em>Gas\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">The company refused to receive the money thus sent to it, and insisted that the said policy had become void and of effect by the default of the said Taylor in complying with its terms and conditions, and refused to pay to him the amount of the insurance or any part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>thereof. He therefore brought this action to recover the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">The case was tried upon the general issue. There was a demurrer to the evidence by the defendant, in which the plaintiff joined. The jury found a conditional verdict, in the usual form in such cases; and the court rendered judgment thereon in favor of the plaintiff, for the amount of the insurance with interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Is there any error or not in that judgment? \"Whether there be or not depends upon whether the second assessment of twenty-five <em>per centum, </em>made by the board of directors on the plaintiff\u2019s premium note of one hundred and ten dollars, in the payment of which assessment default was made by him, was made by the .said board <em>fraudulently </em>or not; or with or without power to make it; and whether the fact so appears in the record ?</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">If it appear in the record that the said assessment was made by the said board fraudulently, or without power to make it, then there is no error in the judgment, and it must be affirmed. But if it do not so appear, then there is error in the said judgment, and the same must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The court is of opinion that it does not so appear, and therefore that the judgment must be reversed and judgment rendered for the defendant upon the demurrer and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">There is not a particle of evidence in the record tending to show that there was any fraud on the part of the said board of directors or any of them in making the said assessment. The board which made it consisted of W. C. Carrington, president, and Dr. H. G. Davidson, J. H. Martin, Dr. J. G. Cabell, Dr. Hunter McGuire, and the secretary. They constituted the board on the 10th day of October, 1873, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>said second assessment was originally made; and also on the 7th day of February, 1874, when the order made on the subject was altered and amended. If it be proper for us to speak from our personal knowledge of the character of these gentlemen, we express the opinion that they were incapable of acting fraudulently as members of the said board. Hor does it appear from the record that the said assessment was improperly made, or made when there was no occasion therefor, in the execution of the purposes for which the said company was chartered and organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The company was a \u201c Mutual Insurance Company,\u201d composed of the insured themselves, each one of whom was a member of the company. The directors are the representatives of the members of the company, being elected by them. The presumption therefore is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the acts of the board of directors are free from any just ground of objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The property in this case was insured for the sum of $2,200; two thousand being for the building and two hundred for the piano. The judgment recovered was for the whole sum, with interest and costs. The insurance was on the 1st day of March, 1871, and for five years therefrom. The insured understood perfectly the charter of the company and the terms of the policy of insurance and the conditions thereto annexed. He made no objection to any of them, but elected to have his property insured by that company, and thus to become a member of it. The consideration of the insurance was, the payment of a policy fee of $2.50, and a cash premium of $44, and the execution and delivery of a deposit note for $110, which was subject to the assessments of the board of directors to meet the losses and expenses; any surplus of which that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>might remain at the expiration of the term of the insurance was to he returned to the insured. One assessment was afterwards made and paid, being 25 <em>per centum </em>of the deposit note, amounting to $27.50. Another assessment of the same amount was after-wards made by the board of directors, of which due notice was given to the assured, who made not the slightest objection thereto, but failed to pay it in due time, though he was warned in writing by the secretary of the company at the time of making the demand, of the consequences of default. After setting forth all the particulars of the demand in the body of his letter, the secretary thus concludes it: \u201cTo avoid the penalties above set forth, you are advised and requested to remit at once the amount required of you,\u201d &amp;c. Notwithstanding which he failed to remit it, and even failed to make any reply, written or oral, to the demand. Had he complied with the request and paid the second assessment, his whole payments on account of the insurance would together have amounted to about one hundred dollars; in consideration of which he would at once have received the whole amount insured, two thousand two hundred dollars. After the loss of the property insured, he offered to pay the amount of the second assessment, and in the letter of Mr. Greer enclosing a check for the money, he said: \u201cMr. Taylor\u2019s failure to pay sooner was pure negligence, as he is a man of property, but engrossed in farming forgot to pay.\u201d The company refused then to accept the payment and insisted that the policy had, by its express terms, become void and of no effect, by the failure of the insured to pay in due time.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The present suit was therefore then brought by the insured against the company; and was brought not in the city of Richmond where the company was located, and where all their books were, and where they trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>acted all their business, but in the distant county of Franklin, the place of residence of the insured, in \u25a0 which by law, the action could be brought. In that action the assured, for the first time, raised the objection that the assessment was not duly made; that there was no occasion for it to raise the means for payment of the losses and expenses of the company; and raised it under the general issue. He might at any time, if he had any doubt about the correctness of the assessment, have called at the office of the company in Richmond, examined their books and papers, and satisfied himself therefrom, and from explanation, if necessary, by the officers of the company, of the correctness of the assessment. But he failed to do so; and the company could not of course carry all their books and papers from Richmond to Franklin county, and produce them on the trial, with somebody to explain them\u2014and all this for the purpose of showing their right to the amohnt of the second assessment of $27.50. There were two trials of the case. On the first there was a hung jury\u2014on the second there was a verdict for the plaintiff; or rather a special verdict, on which judgment was ultimately rendered for the plaintiff, and that is the judgment to which the writ of error in this case was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">A great many books and cases were referred to by the learned counsel in the argument of the case before this court, which or most of which we have examined; hut we do not deem it necessary to notice them in detail in this opinion. There are few or no cases on the subject in this court, and those decided by the courts of other States, are generally affected, more or less, by the legislation of the States in which they occurred. It is perhaps enough to say on this subject, that we have seen no case which can' he considered as authority in conflict with the foregoing opinion, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>part thereof. We are therefore for reversing the judgment of the court below, as before stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Anderson, J., was not prepared to concur in or dissent from the opinion of Moncure, P.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The judgment was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">This day came again the parties by their counsel, and the court having 'maturely considered the transcript of the record of the judgment aforesaid, and the arguments of counsel, is of opinion, for reasons stated in writing and filed with the record, that the said judgment is erroneous. Therefore it is considered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the plaintiff in error recover against the defendant in error its costs by it expended in the prosecution of its <em>supersedeas </em>aforesaid here; and this court proceeding to give such judgment as the said circuit court ought to have given, is further of opinion that the law arising upon the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the defendant\u2019s evidence is for the plaintiff, and that the said evidence is not sufficient in law to maintain the issue joined on the part of the defendant. Therefore it is further considered that the defendant take nothing by his bill; that the plaintiff go thereof without day and recover against the defendant in error (the plaintiff in the court below) its costs by it about its defence in the said circuit court expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
