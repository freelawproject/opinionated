The case was once before in this court, when the judgment was reversed, on the ground that an incompetent juror had been admitted to serve on the jury. On the second trial of the prisoner there was a verdict of murder in the first degree, and the court sentenced him to be hung.

A petition was presented by the said plaintiff in error to the judge of the circuit court of said county for a writ of error to the said judgment of the said county court, which was denied by the said judge. And thereafter a petition was presented by the said plaintiff in error to the judges of this court for a writ of error to said judgment, which writ of error was thereupon awarded. The question presented to this court by the said petition to the judges thereof, and the record of the proceedings in the case of which a copy accompanies the said petition, is whether there be error in the said judgment or not, for which the same ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">There are two, and only two, assignments of error in the said petitions, which will he considered and disposed of in the order of the said assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The first is, <em>in refusing to grant said petitioner a change of venue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">The following appeal\u2019s from the record to be the state of the case in regard to this assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-11\">\u201cAt the county court continued by adjournment and held for Bedford county at the courthouse on Wednes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>clay the 25th day of February, A.

Morton Speece, <em>D. Clerk.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-13\">This court is of opinion that the said county court did not err in overruling the motion of the prisoner for a change of <em>venue </em>as aforesaid. It does not appear from the record, nor from anything therein contained, that he did not 'have a perfectly fair and impartial trial on the occasion when the verdict and judgment were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>rederecl against him as aforesaid, to which judgment the writ of error was awarded in this case as aforesaid, to-wit: the judgment rendered on the 27th day March, 1880. There had been a former trial in the case, in which a verdict and a judgment in the same words or to the same effect had been rendered in the same county against the same prisoner for the same offence; and that judgment had been reversed by this court upon the ground, and only upon the ground, that one of the veniremen on the said former trial, to-wit: Charles W. Hardy, was not a competent juror for the trial of the plaintiff in error, and that therefore the county court erred in overruling his objections to said Hardy, based upon said incompetency. It was therefore considered by the court that the said judgment of the county court for the error aforesaid be reversed and annulled, the verdict of the jury set aside, and a new trial awarded the plaintiff in error; on which new trial in the same case and in the same coui\u2019t, another verdict and judgment were rendered in the same words or to the same effect; the said judgment being the same to which the writ of error in this case was awarded as aforesaid. That there was one incompetent juror on the first trial of the case, was no good ground, in itself, for considering that a competent jury could not be obtained in the case in the said county of Bedford. If it had been, the difficulty might no doubt .have been removed, by summoning from another county so many duly qualified jurors as could not be found in the county in which the trial occurred. There was no such attempt made thus to remove such a supposed difficulty, but instead of that, there was a motion- for a change of the <em>venue. </em>The facts of the case as they appear in the record, show that a perfectly competent jury could be, as one such was in fact, summoned in the county and empaneled for the final trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>of the ease. To not one of the twelve jurors who v finally tried it, was the slightest objection assigned, in this court or in the court below. The con\u00b0fi'is^ve presumption therefore is, that there was no ground for any such objection, and that the ground now taken by the plaintiff in error, that his motion to change the <em>venue </em>ought to have been sustained, is wholly unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The only evidence introduced by the prisoner in support of his motion for a change of <em>venue </em>as aforesaid, consisted of three affidavits, two of which were those of the prisoner himself, and the third that of the prisoner\u2019s counsel. It is not stated in the said affidavit of the said counsel, that he believed the prisoner could not obtain a fair trial in the said county. Even if it had been so stated, there is nothing in the record to show that any difficulty which might have existed in obtaining a fair and impartial jury in the county might not have been removed by causing so many jurors as might have been necessary to be summoned from any other county or corporation. If such difficulty could have been, so removed, there was, of course, no necessity for a change of <em>venue. </em>But no motion was made by the prisoner for a <em>venire facias </em>to summon jurors from another county or corporation; and indeed there was no occasion, so far the record shows, for any such <em>venire facias. </em>On the contrary it appears that a fair and impartial jury was actually obtained in the said county.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">The court below therefore clearly did not err in refusing to grant the plaintiff in error a change of <em>venue. '</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">The second and only remaining assignment of error is, that \u201cthe verdict of the jury should have been set aside and a new trial granted, because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b913-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Another bill of exceptions was made a part of the record in this case, which states \u201cthat upon the trial of this cause and after the jury had rendered verdict, the prisoner by his counsel, moved the court to set aside the verdict of the jury and grant the prisoner a new trial upon the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence; but the court overruled the said motion and refused to set aside the verdict and grant the prisoner a new trial. To which opinion of the court so overruling said motion, the prisoner by counsel excepts, and prays that his bill of exceptions may be signed and sealed by the court and made a part of the record; which is accordingly done. And to save the prisoner the benefit of the exception, the court certifies that the following is the evidence and the whole of the evidence which was produced upon said trial by witnesses introduced by the Commonwealth :</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The first witness, Carr Maupin, said: \u201c I am the father of the deceased. I live in Bedford county, about 3-J miles south of Liberty. Peter Wright, the prisoner, who was a tenant of mine, under our contract he was to have one-half of the crop of oats, corn and tobacco. I was to furnish one mule and he one\u2014he to haul and sell the wood from the new ground and to pay me one-half of the proceeds every night. Peter Wright had been hauling wood out of my new ground and pocketing all the money. I went over to the new ground in the afternoon. I told him he must stop; that he was neglecting his crop and keeping the money; if he didn\u2019t I would get some one to work his crop for him. He replied, <em>\u2018 </em>I will haul the last stick away.\u2019 I observed to him that he would have to haul it without my mule. I started home and the prisoner said, \u2018 God d\u2014n your old soul, I intend to kill you anyhow.\u2019 He then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>knocked, me down with his fist and beat me as long as he saw proper. The prisoner\u2019s son, a boy about years old, hollowed to prisoner \u2018 not to beat me any l\u00b0n\u00a7er; he had beat me enough\u2019\u2014he stamped me just below the stomach. I went to the wagon to unhitch the breast chain of my mule and saw my son, (the deceased,) coming through the tobacco, and as he came up said, \u2018 Peter what in the world are you beating my father this way for?\u2019 Prisoner then turned round and snatched the standard from the wagon and struck me and knocked me down, and then whirled and knocked my son down. \u2019When he struck me I caught the lick with my hand, but the lick struck me on the head and knocked me down. I lay on the ground, I do not know how long, and when I got up I said, \u2018Peter you have killed my son,\u2019 and prisoner replied, I am glad of it, (or damn glad of it, I don\u2019t know which). Peter then unhitched his mule and gave the-harness to his daughter and went down the branch towards Liberty, Va., and gave himself up. This is the standard with which he struck me and with which he killed my son. (Here the standard was produced, which is a dogwood standard, 2\u00a3 or 3 feet long, 1|-inches in diameter.) This was the last of June or 1st July, 1879, in the county of Bedford. Neither of us. struck him or offered to strike him. I was not able to do so. We made no resistance or offered to make any. I know of no personal ill-feelings up to that time between me and prisoner or between the prisoner and deceased. I was unarmed when the difficulty occurred. The prisoner was also unarmed, but if I had had a pistol I would have killed him, if I had been able to do him justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">The second witness, Lydia Early (a woman of color), said: \u201cI live about 100 yards from the place where the difficulty occurred. I had two little children over there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>where difficulty occurred. My little girl who was in the yard came into the house and said that Mr. Carr Maupin and Peter were quarreling at the I went out doors and sat down by the table, and heard Carr Maupin say, you pocket all my money and pay me none. Peter says, \u00a3 I am going to haul that stack of wood.\u2019 Carr Maupin says, \u00a3I am going to take out my mule.\u2019 Peter said, \u00a3Let that mule alone.\u2019 Carr Maupin went to unhitch his mule. Peter knocked him down and stamped him, and says, \u2018Damn your old soul, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019 By this time Eobert Maupin (the deceased) came running up with open hands, and says: \u2018Hey there; don\u2019t you hit my father any more.\u2019 Peter\u2019s little boy says, \u2018Father, don\u2019t fight; you can do without all that fighting.\u2019 As Eobert Maupin ran up Peter snatched the wagon standard and knocked old Mr. Maupin down, and turned and knocked Eobert Maupin down. Mr. Carr Maupin lay there from 4 to 5 minutes before he got up. Eobert Maupin did not get up at all. Peter \"Wright stayed long enough to divide his gear from Mr. Carr Maupin\u2019s; he gave his harness and his horse to his girls who had come up at that time. Peter then went down the creek towards town. Neither of the Maupins as far as I saw had any rock or stick. I did not see the beginning of the difficulty. I was in my house when the difficulty commenced. They were talking very loud. Maupin generally talks loud. The whole fight from beginning to end was in less time than ten minutes. Eobert Maupin, the deceased, was a grown man, and about as stout as the prisoner. I had never heard of any ill-feeling between Peter and Eobert Maupin. They all thought a great deal of Eobert Maupin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The third witness, Dr. \"Walter Izard, said: \u201cI was the physician called to see the deceased; arrived on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>ground about an hour or two after the difficulty, and found him insensible and speechless; bad bled freely \u2022 from the wound on his head, and might have - produced by the stick here produced. I had him removed to his father\u2019s house, and did not see him again until the next morning when I found him dead (about 9 A. M.) Upon making a <em>post mortem </em>examination I found the skull badly fractured, the fracture extending some three inches. The wound inflicted was the cause of his death. I regard the standard used a deadly weapon in the hands of a man like the prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">This court is of opinion that the said county court did not err in overruling the motion of the prisoner to set aside the verdict of the jury and grant the prisoner a new trial upon the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence. There is no doubt but that the killing in this case was murder; and the only question is, was it murder in the first degree, as it was found by the jury upon the evidence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b916-13\">\u201cMurder by poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, or any willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or in the commission of, or attempt to commit arson, rape, robbery or burglary, is murder of the first degree. All other murder is murder of the second degree.\u201d Code of 1873, p. 1188, ch. 187, \u00a7 1. The killing in this case was not \u201cby poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving,\u201d \u201cor in the commission of, or attempt to commit arson, rape, robbery or burglary\u201d; and the only question therefore is, whether it was a \u201c willful, deliberate and premeditated killing ? \u201d If it was, it was murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">The court is of opinion that it was a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, and therefore it was murder in the first degree. At all events, the jury were war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>ranted by the evidence in so finding, whatever the judge of the county court or of the circuit court or the judges of this court might have found if they been on the jury. To constitute a willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, it is not necessary that an intention to kill should exist for any particular length of time prior to the actual killing; it is only necessary that such intention should come into existence for the first time at the time of such killing or any time previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">How in this case, we must regard the evidence as facts, as the jury might have regarded it. The parlies when the altercation commenced were all unarmed; and Carr and Kobert Maupin remained unarmed to the end of the transaction.. Ho attempt or threat was made by either of them to do violence to the prisoner. Ho harsh word was spoken by either of them to him. Carr Maupin testified: \u201c I started home, and the prisoner said, \u2018 God damn your old soul, I intend to ldll you anyhow.\u2019 He then knocked me down with his fist and beat me as long as he saw proper. The prisoner\u2019s son, a boy about 13 year\u2019s old, hollowed to prisoner \u2018not to beat me any longer, he had beat me enough;\u2019 he stamped me just below the stomach. I went to the wagon to unhitch the breast chain of my mule, and saw my son, the deceased, coming through the tobacco, and as he came up said, \u2018 Peter, what in the world are you beating my father this way for ? \u2019 Prisoner then turned round and snatched the standard from the wagon and struck me and knocked me down, and then whirled and knocked my son down. \"When he struck me, I caught the lick with my hand, but the lick struck me on the head and knocked me down. I lay on the ground, I do not know how long, and when I got up I said, \u2018Peter you have killed my son,\u2019 and prisoner replied, \u2018 I am glad of it (or damn glad of it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>I don\u2019t know which).\u2019 \u2018 This is the standard with which he struck me, and with which he killed my (Here the standard was produced which is a dog-woo&lt;^ standard, 2J or 3 feet long, 1J inches in diameter). \u2018Heither of us struck him or offered to strike him. I was not able to do so. We made no resistance or offered to make any. I know of no personal ill-feelings up to that time between me and the prisoner, or between the prisoner and deceased. I was unarmed when the difficulty occurred. The prisoner was also unarmed, but if I had had a pistol I would have killed him, if I had been able to do him justice.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Lydia Early\u2019s testimony was strongly confirmatory of that of Carr Maupin and need not be here repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Hr. Walter Izard testified; \u201cI was the physician called to see the deceased; arrived on the ground about an hour or two after the difficulty, and found him insensible and speechless; had bled freely from the wound on his head, and might have been produced by the stick here produced. I had him removed to his father\u2019s house, and did not see him again till the next morning, when I found him dead (about 9 A. M.) Upon making a <em>post mortem </em>examination I found the skull badly fractured, the fracture extending some three inches. The wound inflicted was the cause of his death. I regard the standard used a deadly weapon in the hands of a man like the prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">It seems plain enough, without any further comment, that the evidence warranted the jury in finding the verdict they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-9\">The court is therefore of opinion that there is no error in the judgment and that the same ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">It is unnecessary to review the cases and the authorities referred to by the counsel for the plaintiff in error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Tliere is nothing in them in conflict with the conelnsion at which the court has arrived in this case. There is one very recent decision of this court in which five judges thereof were unanimous, in a case very similar to the present in most of its facts, which is conclusive upon the question that the court below did not err in overruling the motion of the prisoner to set aside the verdict of the jury and grant the prisoner a new7 trial upon the ground that the verdict ivas contrary to the law and the evidence. That case ivas <em>Nelson Mitchell </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth, supra </em>872.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">There is an important difference between that case and this in the fact that in that case the killing w7as preceded by an assault and battery committed by the deceased upon the accused just before the former was killed by the latter. Whereas in this ease, the deceased made no assault on the accused at or about the time of the killing or any other; made no threat against him; had no weapon in his hand; and merely enquired, \u201cPeter, what in the world are you beating my father this way for?\u201d It appears that there never had been any ill-feeling between Peter and Robert Maupin, and that all thought a great deal of Robert Maupin. The killing then was an act of wanton cruelty; in effect \u2022without any provocation at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">There is no doubt but that the prisoner intended to kill the deceased; and that he had not the least ground of justification or excuse for doing so. The act of killing vms done with a deadly weapon, which is fully described in the evidence. With it he badly fractured the skull of the deceased, giving to it a fracture extending some three inches, which was certainly the cause of the death \u00f3f the deceased; and it must have been known to the prisoner that the blow thus given by him would be the cause of the death of the deceased. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>was no personal ill-feeling up to that time between Carr Maupin, the father of the deceased, and the pris-oner, or between the prisoner and deceased. Both Carr Maupin and his son, the deceased, were then unarmed, and neither of them made an assault upon, or attempted or made any threat to assault the prisoner. Carr Maupin started home and the prisoner said, \u201cGod damn your old soul, I intend to kill you anyhow.\u201d The prisoner then knocked the father down with his fist and beat him as long as he saw proper; he stamped the father just below the stomach. The latter went to the wagon to unhitch the breast chain of his mule, and saw his son (the deceased) coming through the tobacco, who, as he came up, said, \u201cPeter, what in the world are you beating my father this way for?\u201d Prisoner then turned round and snatched the standard from the wagon and knocked the father down; and then whirled and knocked the son (the deceased) down. The father lay- on the ground some time. <em>He </em>would, no doubt-, have been killed if he had not caught the lick with his hand. \"When he got up he said, \u201cPeter, you have killed my son\u201d; and prisoner replied, \u201cI am glad of it (or damn glad of it, the witness did not know which).\u201d It appears that there never had been any ill-feeling between the prisoner and the deceased, and that all who knew the deceased thought a great deal of him. It was certainly the duty of the deceased to interpose and save his father from death or great bodily harm. He indicated no purpose to do anything else, but the contrary. He had no weapon, made no assault upon or threat against the prisoner, but only enquired as he came up, \u201cPeter, what in the world are you beating my father this way for?\u201d and then without any further provocation the prisoner killed the deceased with a deadly weapon! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>\"We say that the jury were warranted by the evidence in finding this to be murder in the first degree, as they did; and that the judgment of the court below not to he reversed, hut ought to be affirmed, which is adjudged accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
