There shall also be exempted from and not subject to the provisions of this act personal property other than money or securities bequeathed to a corporation or association organized exclusively for the moral or mental improvement of men or women or for scientific, literary, library, patriotic, cemetery or historical purposes or for the enforcement of laws relating to children or animals or for two or more of such purposes and used exclusively for carrying out one or more of such purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Prior to this amendment \u201ccharitable, educational and benevolent corporations,\u201d with many others, were found in the second sentence among those entitled to partial exemption. By their transfer to the first sentence they would seem to have been added to the class previously represented by religious corporations and those organized for bible or tract purposes, to which a complete exemption was accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">In Matter of Francis, 121 App. Div. 129, there was presented a corporation which was in fact comprehended within the class designated broadly <em>as </em>\u201c educational,\u201d but was in its name, organization and use a \u201clibrary corporation.\u201d It was held by the court that, unless the use of the broad, general term \u201ceducational\u201d was by the statute itself limited in its application, the corporation was entitled to.complete exemption. In the application of the rule that where exemption from taxation is claimed the statute is to be strictly construed against the claimant, the court found that the corporation in question was so obviously within the specific definition \u201clibrary corporation\u201d that the legislative intent, expressed in the whole statute, was to exclude it from the broad generalization, \u201c educational.\u201d This means that where a given institution may grammatically be referred to either class, but cannot belong to both, construction will array it under the description which fits it so closely and so completely enfolds it that the other description is excluded from contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The Young Men\u2019s Christian Association must be regarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>as belonging to the class indicated in the first sentence under examination as \u201ceducational, charitable, benevolent,\u201d unless there be found in the latter sentence a definition of a class to which it more aptly and distinctly belongs. There is no such definition in the second sentence quoted, unless it be found in the clause \u201corganized exclusively for the moral or mental improvement of men or women * * * and used exclusively for carrying out one or more of such purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">While the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association may well be comprehended within the language last quoted, it is probable that the Legislature has intended by the new act to confer the complete immunity prescribed in the first sentence to institutions which, although they may generally partake of the character of corporations designed for the \u201cmoral or mental improvement of men or women,\u201d are more specifically and precisely defined by one or more of the words found in the first sentence quoted. Where the Legislature has assigned for partial exemption a class described by the general words \u201c exclusively organized for moral or mental improvement,\u201d and in another part of the same enactment has selected from this general class, by specific and distinctive appellations, a class of corporations which .are described by reference to their peculiar activities toward the \u201cmoral or mental improvement \u201d of humanity, the construction must be that the institutions thus particularized have been removed from the general class and given the privileges which pertain to the corporations specifically described. Can it be doubted that, if in the Francis case the words \u201clibrary corporation\u201d had been found in the first sentence and the words \u201ceducational corporation\u201d had been in the second, the subject of the discussion would have been given the exemption ?</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Moreover, the Legislature has adopted well defined meanings which must have been within its contemplation when in the same enactment it has employed in contrast the words found in these two sentences. It has created for itself a distinction between these two sets of terms, by which a corporation, whether \u201c religious, educational, charitable or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>benevolent \u201d is, within the purview of the act, not a corporation \u201c exclusively organized for moral or mental improvement.\u201d However much these two classes of corporations may in fact comprehend the same institutions \u2014 for in the general use of language a \u201c religious \u201d or \u201c educational \u201d \u25a0corporation is-one organized for \u201cmoral or mental improvement\u201d\u2014 the Legislature has conceived and appreciated a \u25a0distinction between these two contrasting terms which, though concealed from the common mind, is seen by the Legislature and is to be interpreted as the Legislature has chosen to use it.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In the earlier act the contrast was instituted between \u201creligious corporations and corporations exclusively organized for bible or tract purposes \u201d in one class, and, on the other part, the class in which were enumerated, with others, corporations organized and used \u201cexclusively for moral or mental improvement.\u201d In the former act, for the purpose of distinguishing between the degrees of exemption accorded to the classes named in the\u201dfirst and second sentences, respectively, it was intended and recognized that neither the \u201creligious,\u201d the \u201cbible\u201d nor the \u201ctract\u201d corporation was one organized and used for \u201cmoral or mental improvement.\u201d Thus, in uniform practice before the amendment, \u201c religious \u201d corporations, as well as corporations for \u201c bible or tract \u201d purposes, enjoyed an immunity which could not \u2022be theirs if in the act in question they could be regarded as falling within the definition \u201c exclusively organized for moral or mental improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In Matter of Watson (171 N. Y. 256), the former statute was applied to a money legacy to the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, and it was held not to be entitled to the exemption which belonged to a \u201c religious corporation,\u201d upon reasoning which indicates that, had it been found to be within the act a \u201c religious corporation,\u201d it would not h'ave been a corporation \u201c exclusively organized for the moral or mental improvement \u201d of its men.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">By the act of 1905, \u201ceducational, benevolent and charitable\u201d corporations were taken from the class entitled to the lower exemption and were put in association with \u201c religious, bible and tract\u201d corporations, in the class which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>at that time was already constituted as a class in which, under the contrasts of this statute, no corporation \u201c exclusively organized or used for the moral or mental improvement of men or women\u201d could be included. Unless the <em>the </em>educational \u201d corporation, upon this transfer from the second sentence to the first sentence, is to receive the advantages provided for the corporations described in the first sentence, it is difficult to assign any meaning or intention to the legislative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">While the affidavit presented in behalf of the Young Women\u2019s Christian- Association of Brooklyn would tend to assign it to the second' general class of corporations, as one designed and applied to the.\u201cmoral and mental improvement of- women,\u201d it, nevertheless, must be referred to the first collocation of institutions, as an \u201c educational, charitable and benevolent\u201d institution, because the Legislature has isolated it from the general class.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">As to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, its counsel has, upon examination of the law, consented to the entry of an order taxing the legacy to the society. But the question of its right to the exemption-survives, especially as under the will any tax upon the legacy is payable by the estate. This corporation is a \u201c charitable \u201d institution, belonging to the first class specified in the statute as entitled to complete exemption, and by no construction falling within any definition contained in the sentence relative to the lower order of exemption. It cannot be said to be among the corporations described as \u201c organized or used for the enforcement of laws relating to children.\u201d The proof in \u00abits behalf suggests no such design or application, and, on the contrary, declares that the society is organized under the \u201cAct for the incorporation of societies for the prevention of cruelty to children,\u201d and is \u201cmaintained to furnish aid to children who are not properly cared for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The finding of the appraiser is confirmed!</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Report of appraiser confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
