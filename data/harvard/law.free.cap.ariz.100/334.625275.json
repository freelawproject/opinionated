Justice..</author>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Appellant, hereinafter called defendant, appeals from the denial of a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty entered by the Superior Court of Yuma County. Defendant was charged with the crime of rape in violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 13-611 to which he entered a plea of guilty on May 19, 1965. He was. sentenced on May 28th and began serving his term on May 31st. Defendant was represented by counsel when the plea of guilty was entered and at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">On July 28, 1965, almost two months after the imposition of sentence and while he was imprisoned, defendant filed motions to withdraw his plea of guilty and for the appointment of counsel which motions were denied. The trial court then appointed counsel to perfect this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Counsel advises us. in. his brief that he is unable to find er-ror. A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1715 compels us to search the record for fundamental error. State v. Burrell, 96 Ariz. 233, 393 P.2d 921; State v. Hanshaw, 97 Ariz. 109, 397 P.2d, 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-13\">There are two r\u00e9\u00e1s\u00f3t\u00eds why the ' trial court properly denied defendant\u2019s\" motion to withdraw his plea. Rule 188, Rules of Criminal Procedure, 17 A.R.S., provides that the trial court may permit a ;plea of guilty to be withdrawn \u201cat any . time before sentence.\u201d In the case of State v. Telavera, 76 Ariz. 183, 261 P.2d 997 .this court had occasion - to . construe the .statute which preceded and -contained;the same language .as Rule 188. -Telavera had served less than one month of his sentence when he moved' to .withdraw his plea of guilty. We said: -</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-14\">\u201cIt will be seen that the authority of the court to permit a withdrawal of a plea of guilty is limited to the period <em>prior to the pronouncement' of sentence </em>and even then it is discretionary with the court.\u201d 76 Ariz. at 186, 261 P.2d at 999. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">In other words, the trial court cannot entertain a motion to withdraw a- plea of guilty after pronouncing sentence whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>or not defendant has started to serve his term.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The court in Telavera said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201c* * * in addition to the above statutory limitation upon the power of the court to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty it is enjoined from doing so after defendant had entered upon the execution of his sentence under the rule laid down in State v. McKelvey, 30 Ariz. 265, 246 P. 550.\u201d <em>76 </em>Ariz. at 186, 261 P.2d at 1000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In the McKelvey case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201cIt appears to be the almost universal rule that as a matter of common law, where a defendant has entered upon the execution of a valid sentence, the court has no jurisdiction, even during the term at which the sentence was rendered, to set it aside and render a new sentence, (citations omitted) Nor can it indefinitely suspend the execution of its sentence, after the same has been pronounced, either in whole or in part, and any such order, made either after judgment or as a part thereof, is wholly void, (citations omitted) Therefore, as a matter of common law, the order of the court suspending the further execution of the sentence after defendant had served a considerable period of the time set forth therein in jail was beyond its jurisdiction and void.\u201d 30 Ariz. at 267-268, 246 P. at 550. See also State v. Edge, 96 Ariz. 302, 394 P.2d 418.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">We have examined the entire record and find no fundamental error.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-12\">STRUCKMEYER, C.
