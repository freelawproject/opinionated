Rab\u00f3n, was charged with violation of A.R.S. \u00a7 36\u2014 1002.07, illegal sale of marijuana. The defendant pleaded not guilty, was tried by a jury and was found guilty. Thereafter the court sentenced him to a term of not less-than fifteen years nor more than twenty-years in the Arizona State Prison, the defendant having been convicted of a prior felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-27\">The relevant facts are substantially as follows: Undercover agent Thompson of the State Narcotic Bureau testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>'\u201chad an understanding\u201d that the defendant \u25a0was selling narcotics. Thompson met the \u2022defendant in early April of 1965, in company with another person suspected to be a \u25a0narcotics seller. Thompson associated with the defendant for a few weeks and bought 'him drinks and on many occasions discussed 'the subject of narcotics and marijuana with 'him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">On April 28, 1965 Thompson and his car \u25a0were searched by his superiors for narcotics. Thompson was provided with the $5.00 for a purchase of marijuana. He then drove to the Star Tavern where he met the defendant \u25a0and told the defendant he was ready to purchase some marijuana cigarettes. Defend-ant replied \u201cI have some but I will have to pick it up and I don\u2019t have any transportation.\u201d Thereupon, the defendant entered Thompson\u2019s car and directed Thompson to a home on East Burgess Lane where Thompson gave the defendant $5.00 to purchase marijuana. The defendant and Thompson some three minutes later drove to another address and entered a house wherein the defendant rolled seven marijuana cigarettes and gave them to Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Defendant presents one basic issue on appeal. The defendant contends that the undercover agent solicited and planted the seed for the commission of this crime and thereby entrapped him. Thus defendant contends that his motion for a directed verdict should have been granted as the state failed to Carry its burden that the intent to sell the marijuana originated with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The fact that government agents merely afforded opportunities or facilities to a suspected person for the commission of the offense does not constitute entrapment. See State v. Reyes, 99 Ariz. 257, 408 P.2d 400 (1965). Entrapment occurs only when the criminal conduct was the product of the creative activity of law enforcement officials. See State v. Saenz, 98 Ariz. 181, 403 P.2d 280 (1965); Sherman v. United. States, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958). Moreover, we stated in State v. Hernandez, 96 Ariz. 28, 391 P.2d 586:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201c * * * a crucial element of the defense of entrapment is that the intent to commit the. crime must not arise in the mind of the accused. * * * the defense of entrapment does not arise where one is ready to commit the offense given but the opportunity, * * *Id. at 31, 391 P.2d at 587-588.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Entrapment as a matter of law is established only where undisputed testimony makes it patently clear that an otherwise innocent person was induced to commit acts complained of by trickery, persuasion or fraud of government agent. See State v. Chavez, 98 Ariz. 236, 403 P.2d 545 (1965); State v. Gortarez, 98 Ariz. 160, 402 P.2d 992 (1965); Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932); United States v. Millpax, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>313 F.2d 152 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 903, 83 S.Ct. 1291, 10 L.Ed.2d 198 (1963). However the established facts do not constitute entrapment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">As the trial judge adequately instructed the jury on the law of entrapment the jury could and apparently did find that the defendant was merely afforded an opportunity to commit the offense charged. Cf. State v. Gortarez, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-6\">BERNSTEIN, V. C. J., and UDALL, J., concurring.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
