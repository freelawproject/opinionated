On March 23, 1965, he was sentenced to not less than five nor more than seven years in the Arizona State Prison. Defendant appeals therefrom and the only issue before this court is whether his conviction was based upon illegally obtained evidence. The disposition of this issue is dependent upon our determination as to whether there was cause, in view of the fact there was no search warrant, to detain defendant\u2019s vehicle upon the highway prior to the search which led to the discovery of incriminating evidence offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The facts establish that on the evening of October 31, 1963, the Four-Fifths Liquor Store at 7027 North 27th Avenue, Phoenix, was held up. The liquor store clerk, the lone night employee, testified that on the night in question a young man with an unusual sawed-off shotgun entered the store and at gunpoint tied him up. In addition to looting the cash register the robber took the clerk\u2019s billfold which contained, amongst other things, his social security card.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">At trial the liquor store clerk was unable to positively identify defendant as being the man who robbed him, but did identify the unusual sawed-off shotgun found in defendant\u2019s possession, as being the same weapon used on the night of the robbery. It was also brought out at trial that defendant was in possession of the liquor store clerk\u2019s social security card when he was taken into custody by the New Mexico State Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-13\">Two members of the New Mexico State Police appeared for the prosecution. They testified to the same facts based upon their actual involvement in the incident and defendant\u2019s oral confession. According to their testimony defendant had pulled into a gas station on November 3, 1963, and in an attempt to move his sawed-off shotgun from the car seat and hide it on the floor the gun discharged firing a shell into the car door. The station attendant called</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>i the police about the incident and described the car and reported its license number.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Officer Melvin L. West stopped defendant at 9:00 o\u2019clock on the morning of November 3, 1963, two miles west of Roswell, New Mexico on highway 70-380. Officers Jerry Wood and J. R. Funk arrived at the scene within a matter of seconds after Officer West arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">When Officer West immediately asked defendant for his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration card defendant answered he h\u00e1d none. When questioned about the bulge in his pockets defendant produced four 110 gauge shotgun shells.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The following are the relevant facts as to what transpired after the defendant was stopped;.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">*\u2018Q 'Now,- at this time was this person under arrest, Officer West?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-9\">\u201cA No, he wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-10\">\u201cQ Now, what, if anything, happened after he handed you' the shotgun shells ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-11\">\u201cA Captain Funk and Officer Wood walked up to the side of the car and I noticed they pulled out a gun, shotgun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-13\">. \u201cQ \u25a0 And then at- that. time did you place -him under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">\u201cA No we took him down to the S'tatfe\u2019 Police Office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-17\">\u201cQ How was this individual transported from the location on the highway to Roswell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-18\"><em>\u201cA </em>He was transported in my car, and Captain Funk drove the car that he had been driving down to the office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-20\"><em>\u201cQ </em>What did you book this individual for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-21\"><em>\u201cA </em>We booked him on not having a registration for the car proving ownership of the car and his driver\u2019s license at the time. We were primarily interested in ownership of the car and also the gun he had in the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">As to the discovery of the shotgun Officer J. R. Funk testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-23\"><em>\u201cA </em>Officer Wood went to one side of the car and I went to the other side of the car, the white car, and we observed the butt end of a gun partially under the seat; Officer Wood reached in the car, removed the gun, laid it on the hood of the white car and immediately unloaded the gun.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-25\">\u201cQ Now, could you see this gun from the outside of the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-26\"><em>\u201cA </em>Yes, sir. You could see the butt sticking out underneath the front, seat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-27\">Defendant assigned as- error that the New Mexico State Police had no right to stop and search- him \"without .obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>a warrant since in New Mexico there is no law making it a felony to carry a loaded weapon in an automobile. He further assigned as error that the carrying of a loaded weapon is only a misdemeanor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as is negligently discharging a weapon<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that before an arrest may be made for a misdemeanor it must be committed in the presence' of the arresting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">We are unable to find, and counsel has not called to our attention, any New Mexico statutes relating to arrest similar to our own A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1403.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, we are in agreement that our statute is a codification of the common law. On arrests the United States Supreme Court has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201cBut we are pressed with the argument that if the search of the automobile discloses the presence of liquor and leads under the statute to the arrest-of the person in charge of the automobile,the right of seizure should be limited-by the common-law rule as to the cir~cumstances justifying an arrest without\u2019 a warrant for a misdemeanor. The usual rule is that a police officer may arrest without warrant one believed by the officer upon reasonable cause to have been guilty of a felony, and that he may only arrest without a warrant one guilty of a misdemeanor if committed in his presence... Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U.S. 487, 6 S.Ct. 148, 29 L.Ed. 458; John Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529, 20 S.Ct. 729, 44 L.Ed. 874. The rule is sometimes expressed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">\u2018In cases of misdemeanor, a peace officer like a private person has at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>common law no power of arresting without a warrant except when a breach of the peace has been committed in his presence or there is reasonable ground for supposing that a breach of peace is about to be committed or renewed in his presence.\u2019 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, vol. 9, part. III, 612.\u201d Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">New Mexico follows the common law on arrests under its case law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cIt will thus be seen that the legislature has not broadened the power to arrest without warrant even in the presence of an officer for misdemeanors which are mere peccadillos.\u201d Cave v. Cooley, 48 N.M. 478, 152 P.2d 886.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As to the officers\u2019 reasons for stopping defendant upon the highway Officer Funk testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">\u201cQ Now, for the record, Captain Funk, why were you trying to stop this vehicle ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cA We had a radio message on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201cQ What was that radio message?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">\u201cA That there was a young man driving a car who discharged a shotgun in the front seat of the car some forty miles, approximately forty miles west at a service station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">\u201cQ And did your radio message give a description of that gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-12\">\u201cA Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-13\">\u201cQ What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-14\">\u201cA Said it was a short, shoulder gun ; all that we knew.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-15\">\u201cQ And did you have a description of the vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-16\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-17\">\u201cQ Did you have the license number ? \u201cA Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-18\">In Rios v. United States, 364 U.S. 253, 261, 80 S.Ct. 1431, 1436, 4 L.Ed.2d 1688, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-19\">\u201c[A] seizure can survive constitutional inhibition only upon a showing that the surrounding facts brought it within one of the exceptions to the rule that a search must rest upon a search warrant. Jones v. United States, 357 U.S. 493, 499, [78 S.Ct. 1253, 1257, 2 L.Ed.2d 1514]; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, [72 S.Ct. 93, 95, 96 L.Ed. 59].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-20\">Defendant fails to recognize the valid distinction between an arrest on the one hand and police investigation on the other. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 485, 492, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1762, 1766, 12 L.Ed. 977, 982, 987; Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 519, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1346, 10 L.Ed. 513; Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 327, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 1209, 3 L.Ed. 1265, 1274. We believe a police officer acting as a reasonable man under the circumstances may <em>detain and question </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>person when necessary to a proper discharge of his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">While it is often difficult to draw the line between investigation on the one hand and an arrest on the other, it will not suffice for an accused to contend that merely because investigation may lead to arrest the courts must surround investigations with the same requisites necessary for the arrest. Circumstances short of probable cause to make an arrest may still justify an investigation. Should the investigation then reveal probable cause to make an arrest, the officer may make an arrest and conduct a \u25a0reasonable search incidental thereto. It strikes a balance between the individual interest in immunity from police interference and the community\u2019s interest in law enforcement. It wards off pressure to equate reasonable cause to investigate with reasonable cause to arrest, thus protecting the innocent from the risk of arrest when no more than reasonable investigation is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">In the case before us the police had probable cause to seek out the defendant for an <em>explanation </em>as to his dangerous conduct in discharging a shotgun in a public place. Their initial conduct in halting him for investigation was not, therefore, improper. When defendant failed to produce a driver\u2019s license he had violated 64-13-49, New Mexico Statutes 1953.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">\u201c64-13-49. License to be carried and exhibited on demand. \u2014 Every licensee shall have his operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license in his immediate possession at all times when operating a motor vehicle and shall display the same upon demand of a justice of the peace, a peace officer, or a field deputy or inspector of the division. However, no person charged with violating this section shall be convicted if he produces in court an operator\u2019s or chauffeur\u2019s license theretofore issued to him and valid at the time of his arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">A violation of this section is a misdemeanor under 64-13-76, New Mexico Statutes 1953. Defendant thereby committed a misdemean- or in the presence of the police and at that moment was subject to arrest. A search incident to a lawful arrest was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b383-11\">STRUCKMEYER, C.
