Unless the court be convinced with reasonable certainty that the complainant must succeed at final hearing the writ should be denied.\u201d Hall Signal Co. v. General Ry. Signal Co., 2 Cir., 153 F. 907, 908. In this case the Maritime Commission has found \u201c * * * that concerted prohibition against the payment of brokerage results in detriment to the commerce of the United States in that it has had and will have a serious effect upon the forwarding industry.\u201d It has also found that \u201cforwarding activities have developed American commerce.\u201d These findings, the plaintiffs claim, are not supported by the evidence. It was stated on argument that there is \u201cno evidence at all\u201d on which they can rest. Upon even the limited inquiry appropriate to these preliminary proceedings, we are unable to agree with that claim. It would appear that there was at least some substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s findings and its resultant order. Plaintiffs\u2019 right to permanent relief is at this time, therefore, too much in doubt to warrant the issuance of an interlocutory injunction. See Madison Square Garden Corporation v. Braddock, 3 Cir., 90 F.2d 924, 927; Merchant Truckmen\u2019s Bureau of New York v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>United States, D.G.S.D.N.Y, 16 F.Supp. <em>998, 999.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">It must be borne in mind that the public interest, too, is a vital concern in this controversy. \u2019 If the Commission\u2019s, order were to 'be finally upheld after the granting of an interlocutory injunction, there would be no way to compensate for the interim injury to the commerce of the United States and, consequently, to the public interest. Such a consideration is an important factor militating against granting plaintiffs the relief they seek. Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 440-441, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834; Virginian Ry. Co. v. System Federation, 300 U.S. 515, 552, 57 S.Ct. 592, 81 L.Ed. 789.</p>\n<p id=\"AHS\">The application for an interlocutory injunction. is accordingly, denied. The plaintiffs can be adequately protected by paying, if they so desire, such brokerage as is 'earned into a depository,'to abide decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Submit order in conformance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
