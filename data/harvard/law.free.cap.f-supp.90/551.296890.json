Commodities Trading Corporation, 339 U.S. 121, 70 S.Ct. 547, the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial in the instant case must be allowed. In the Commodities case, the Supreme Court \u00a1held that in the absence of unusual circumstances the ceiling price determined the measure'.of <em>just </em>compensation for the requisitioning of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">In the instant case we- allowed plaintiff just compensation based upon 54.79 cents a pound for the 54,180 pounds of tin which defendant requisitioned. However, the ceiling price for tin to be exported was 53 cents a pound. It is, therefore, necessary that the conclusion of law heretofore filed on February 6, 1950, be vacated and withdrawn. In lieu thereof, judgment is now entered for plaintiff in the sum of $14,302.87, plus an amount to compensate plaintiff for the delay in <em>payment </em>.computed on $28,715.40 from September 10, 1942, to June 10, 1943, at 4 percent per annum, and plus an additional amount computed at the same rate on $14,628.60 from May 2, 1944, until paid. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-12\">JONES, Chief Judge, and HOWELL, MADDEN and LITTLETON, Judge, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
