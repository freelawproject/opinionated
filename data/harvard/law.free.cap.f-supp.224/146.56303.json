Being mindful of our limited powers of review in matters left to the expertise and discretion of the Commission, United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, Inc., 327 U.S. 515, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821 (1946) ; Stott v. United States, 166 F.Supp. 851 (S.D.N.Y.1961), we find that the Commission\u2019s conclusions were supported by substantial evidence and hence must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-16\">An examination of the record discloses ample justification for the Commission\u2019s findings. The total population of Nassau and Suffolk Counties had increased markedly in the years immediate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ly preceding the hearings, reaching approximately two million at the time of the decision in January 1963. Whereas neighboring New York City was serviced by upwards of 80 charter bus carriers, this large and rapidly expanding population was restricted to the two, admittedly small lines which instituted this action\u2014 Campus and Inter-County. Further, at least four of the intervenors had for many years prior to 1958 conducted considerable charter business on Long Island in the good-faith albeit mistaken belief that the right to do so was incident to their authorization to operate a similar service from New York City.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While this earlier activity may not conclusively establish the necessity for such service, cf. Inland Motor Freight v. United States, 60 F.Supp. 520, 526 (W.D.Wash.1945), it is certainly competent evidence of need. Crichton v. United States, 56 F.Supp. 876, 879 (S.D.N.Y.1944) and cases cited therein. In addition, the Commission could quite properly infer that the limited facilities of the existing carriers would be insufficient to meet the needs of the many residents of Nassau and Suffolk. In this connection, the ICC found that Inter-County owned but six buses of the deluxe over-the-road type, only one of which was air-conditioned. Campus could boast only ten deluxe buses, and like Inter-County, was often compelled to lease additional equipment from other carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Finally, the testimony of thirty-one public witnesses supported the applications of the intervenors. We need only consider the evidence supplied by one such witness here to manifest the correctness of the Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion. Stanley Parker, the president of a tour-brokerage business, testified that his business in booking charter bus tours from Nassau and Suffolk had increased 500% in the five years immediately preceding the hearing, and that he had had \u201ctrouble\u201d chartering buses in the year in which the field had been limited to Campus and Inter-County. This witness further noted that he had chartered as many as 59 buses at one time, and he insisted that no one company \u2014 or even two companies \u2014 could possibly fulfill this demand alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The plaintiffs make much of the fact that the Commission felt compelled to reverse itself in these proceedings\u2014 that the Commission originally rejected the trial examiner\u2019s recommendations and decided, over the strong dissent of Commissioner Webb, to deny the intervenors the requested authority. We cannot see how this in any way detracts from the deference we must afford the Commission\u2019s ultimate conclusion. For one thing the first determination was never reviewed by this court and might well have been as the Commission itself subsequently concluded, in error. More basically, \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d may well support two conflicting points of view. If we were to say that only one position in any given case could be supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d we would be depriving the Commission of the discretion afforded to it by law, and we would, in effect, be reviewing its determinations to see if the \u201ccorrect\u201d result had been reached. This we cannot and will not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Although it is not necessary to reach the point in view of our findings that <em>present </em>necessity has been established, and that the inadequacy of the existing carriers to meet the present need has been convincingly demonstrated, we question plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that the Commission is not empowered to grant the requested authority \u201cmerely\u201d because of a clear showing of future necessity without affording the existing carriers an opportunity to meet the increased demand. In Lang Transp. Co. v. United States, 75 F.Supp. 915, 929 (S.D.Cal.1948), the court emphasized that the \u201claw is clear that future public convenience and necessity, as well as present public convenience and necessity, suffice under the statute to warrant action by the Commission in authorizing new motor carrier operations.\u201d We should add, moreover, that it is by no means firmly established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that the Commission must make positive findings that the service provided by-existing carriers is inadequate before new authority may be granted. The Lang court thought otherwise, and the court in Convoy Company v. United States, 200 F.Supp. 10, 13 (D.Ore.1961), specifically noted that \u201cthe fact that there is no finding of inadequacy of existing service, or that the existing service would not be injuriously affected, does not invalidate the order of the Commission.\u201d Admittedly, the opinion in Robbins v. United States, 204 F.Supp. 78 (E.D.Pa. 1962) appears to hold that inadequacy is a prerequisite to a finding of public convenience and necessity. Yet as the court noted in Hudson Transit Lines v. United States, 82 F.Supp. 153 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d, 338 U.S. 802, 70 S.Ct. 59, 94 L.Ed. 485 (1948), a requirement of inadequacy \u201cdoes not mean that the holder of a certificate is entitled to immunity from competition under any and all circumstances. * * * The introduction of a competitive service may be in the public interest where it will secure the benefits of an improved service without being unduly prejudicial to the existing service.\u201d 82 F.Supp. at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In the present case, the Commission\u2019s findings were more than sufficient to support its conclusions that the requested authorization would greatly improve service without undue harm to the plaintiffs. Coupled with the findings that plaintiffs were inadequately equipped to meet the public need, this would appear to preclude the relief which is sought here.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Finally, at least one of the plaintiffs argues that the Commission erred in refusing a rehearing requested so that Campus and Inter-County could demonstrate that they had increased their facilities since the initial hearing to cope with the increase in potential demand. It has long been established that requests for rehearing are addressed to the sound discretion of the administrative body, and that a claim of new evidence will not justify a holding that the denial of a rehearing was an abuse of the agency\u2019s discretion. United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, 327 U.S. 515, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Jersey City, 322 U.S. 503, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 88 L.Ed. 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">No grounds having been shown for vacating and setting aside the order and findings of the Commission, we therefore dismiss the complaints. Judgment will be entered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-11\">. Intervenors Manhattan Transit Company and Cosmopolitan Tourist Co., Inc., were authorized to operate charter trips between Nassau and Suffolk Counties and all points in the continental United States. Intervenors Hudson Transit lines, Inc. and Orange and Black Bus Tines, Inc., were granted authority to carry charter passengers between Nassau and Suffolk and all states on the eastern seaboard, from Maine to Florida, including the District of Columbia. Intervenor Public Service Coordinated Transport was empowered to conduct charters between Nassau and Suffolk and points in virtually all states east of the Mississippi Bivor, again including the District of Columbia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-12\">. On January 18, 1961, the trial examiner issued a report after a week of hearings in which all parties to this action participated. <em>Inter alia, </em>he recommended that the five intervenors, see Note 1, supra, be granted limited authority to engage in interstate charter operations, in competition with plaintiffs Campus and Inter-County. On October 3, 1961, Division 1 of the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected these recommendations, and ordered that the applications of the intervenors be denied in their entirety. Upon reconsideration, Division 1, sitting as an appellate division, reversed the previous order and on January 16, 1963, granted the authority set forth in note 1, supra. This order of January 16, 1963, is challenged in the present action. On July 22, 1963, Division 1 reaffirmed its January order, denying the petitions of the plaintiffs herein for a rehearing. Finally, on September 6, 1963, the Commission refused to find that a question of \u201cgeneral transportation importance\u201d was involved in these proceedings and thus denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for a hearing before the full Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">.
