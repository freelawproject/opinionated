The plaintiff contends that after performing under the agreement for one and one-half years, it learned that the defendant breached by authorizing another company to act as a distributor of the merchandise within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The Supreme Court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment since the parties presented sharply conflicting versions of the facts surrounding the creation, nature and duration of their agreement. The trial court\u2019s role, of course, is limited to issue finding, not issue determination <em>(see, Sillman v Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>3 NY2d 395; <em>Sternklar v 19 E. 80th St. Assocs., </em>171 AD2d 528). By resolving the factual disputes in the defendant\u2019s favor prior to trial, the court usurped the jury\u2019s function.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Nor is there merit to the defendant\u2019s contentions that the distributorship and commission agreements were barred by the Statute of Frauds or that the commission agreement was invalid since it was without consideration.
