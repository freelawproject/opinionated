In reversing, we reject the argument that a party is required to exactly assert its \u201cdemand for a trial\u201d to nullify an award and conclude that, in these circumstances, the insurer\u2019s \u201crejection of the arbitration award\u201d was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">The record reveals that plaintiff Marleny Vega claimed to have been injured when her motor vehicle, which was insured by defendant 21st Century Insurance Company, was struck by a hit- and-run driver. She made a claim under the policy\u2019s uninsured-motorist (UM) endorsement, and the parties proceeded to arbitration, which resulted, on June 16, 2011, in an award of $87,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Because the award exceeded the minimum-liability coverage required by law, \u201ceither party\u201d had the right to \u201cdemand the right to a trial on all issues,\u201d provided that the demand was made in writing within thirty days of the arbitrators\u2019 decision. When this policy provision is properly triggered, the award is nullified and the claimant must resort to filing a complaint; without such a demand, the award becomes \u201cbinding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On July 8, 2011, within thirty days of the award, 21st Century\u2019s attorney wrote to Vega\u2019s attorney, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">Pursuant to the provisions of the 21st Century Insurance Policy ... the UM Arbitration Award of June 16, 2011 is hereby rejected. Kindly be guided accordingly and contact the undersigned to discuss possible settlement of this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">A few months later, Vega filed this action, not for damages, but for an order enforcing the arbitration award, claiming the July 8 letter did not \u201cdemand a trial\u201d and, thus, by operation of the insurance policy\u2019s terms, the award became binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The matter was summarily decided on the return date of an order to show cause. The judge found the language of the July 8 letter did not satisfy the requirements of the policy and entered judgment in Vega\u2019s favor. 21st Century appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Because there were no contested facts, the judge correctly determined that the matter could be decided summarily. Our review of the judge\u2019s legal decision, of course, is plenary. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>Polarome Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Greenwich Ins. Co., </em>404 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 260, 961 A.2d 29 (App.Div.2008), <em>certif. denied, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>133, 970 A.2d 1050 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">As suggested in this opinion\u2019s opening sentence, this is not the first time the sufficiency of a party\u2019s post-arbitration communication has been considered by our courts. We discern from the trial judge\u2019s reliance on the trial court decision in <em>LoBianco v. Harleysville Insurance Co., </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>515, 847 A.2d 584 (Law Div.2003), which we now overrule, that he believed the party seeking to nullify the award was required to invoke certain magic words, namely: \u201cWe demand a trial.\u201d Although there may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>times in which a party\u2019s written response to an arbitration award may require such a statement, <em>see Barnett v. Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 701 A.2d 732 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>610, 713 A.2d 502 (1998), we cannot agree there is only one way to trigger the policy language and nullify an arbitration award. In <em>Morag v. Continental Insurance Co. of New Jersey, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>56, 62, 866 A.2d 996 (App.Div.2005), we recognized that a party who fails to expressly demand a trial runs the risk that the demand will be found ambiguous, but we rejected in <em>Morag </em>\u2014 and reject here \u2014 the notion that a party must strictly invoke the policy\u2019s exact words to nullify the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">We commence our examination of prior related decisions in this arena with <em>Verbiest v. New Jersey Full Insurance Underwriting Ass\u2019n, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85, 606 A.2d 420 (App.Div.1992). <em>Verbiest </em>is not enlightening, however, because we were not then asked to determine the sufficiency of the aggrieved party\u2019s words. Instead, we considered whether it was the insurer\u2019s burden to institute the litigation and held it was not. <em>Id. </em>at 89, 606 A.2d 420. Notwithstanding <em>Verbiest\u2019s </em>inappositeness, we mentioned that the policy in question required that \u201cthe carrier ... reject the arbitrators\u2019 decision <em>and demand trial </em>[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not view this incidental comment as tantamount to a holding that only the utterance of the quoted and emphasized language will nullify an arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\"><em>Barnett </em>is similarly inapplicable. There, the insurer had two potential reasons for seeking a trial, a coverage dispute and the award\u2019s excessiveness. In what we assume was a less-than-precise post-arbitration letter \u2014 which we did not quote in the opinion \u2014 we noted that the insurer \u201cexpressed its rejection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>th[e] award ... on the sole basis of [the coverage dispute],\u201d <em>Barnett, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 577, 701 A.2d 732, and \u201cwas not focused upon the amount of damages ascertained by the arbitration,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 579, 701 A.2d 732. This circumstance is not presented here because there is only one reason why 21st Century would reject the arbitration award \u2014 its alleged excessiveness. The only light that <em>Barnett </em>may shed on the issue is its addition of emphasis to the following statement from <em>Verbiest, supra, </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 89, 606 A.2d 420: \u201c[s]ince the carrier [timely] notified the trial court and plaintiffs ... that it \u2018has <em>rejected the award </em>and is <em>demanding a trial,\u2019 </em>the arbitration award was a nullity.\u201d <em>Barnett, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 579, 701 A.2d 732 (alteration in the original). It has been argued, as also held in <em>LoBianco, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 520, 847 A.2d 584, that this statement suggests the sole method for nullifying an arbitration award. We reject the argument that our manner of citing <em>Verbiest </em>in <em>Barnett </em>is the equivalent of such a holding. The issue of what an insurer must utter to nullify an award was simply not before us in <em>Barnett, </em>and we find unavailing the attempt to wring some deeper meaning from the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Unlike these earlier cases, in <em>Morag </em>we actually considered whether the wording of an insurer\u2019s post-arbitration letter was sufficient to nullify an award. There, the insurer timely -wrote to \u201creject[] the underinsured motorist arbitration award,\u201d noting that \u201c[t]his method of rejecting the arbitration award is specifically provided for in Verbiest . . . .\u201d <em>Morag, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 58, 866 A.2d 996. The letter also asked the claimant to \u201cadvise when you file the appropriate [c]omplaint\u201d and contained counsel\u2019s representation to \u201caccept service on behalf of [the insurer].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The insurer, however, as here, never wrote: \u201cwe demand a trial.\u201d In considering whether this letter was sufficient, we determined that we were obligated to \u201cenforcefe] what we perceive to be the reasonable expectations of the insured,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 62, 866 A.2d 996, and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">Although insurance counsel\u2019s letter did not use the expressed words \u201cdemanding a trial,\u201d it sufficiently apprised plaintiffs counsel that the insurer was (1) requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the insured to file the necessary complaint and (2) waiving formal service of process. The words \u201cwhen you file the appropriate complaint\u201d used between lawyers following specific reference to <em>Verbiest, </em>together with acceptance of service, was equivalent to demanding that plaintiffs counsel proceed to litigate the issue of damages on behalf of his client. Simply stated, <em>the fair implication of the correspondence between the lawyers was that the carrier was demanding a damages trial </em>To hold otherwise would be placing form over substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">[16id (emphasis added) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We continue to adhere to this approach of determining \u201cthe fair implication\u201d of the wording of a post-arbitration letter in a manner that does not exalt form over substance. As a result, we reject the strict-compliance standard adopted by the trial judge, in reliance on <em>LoBianco, </em>in entering judgment in favor of plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">21st Century\u2019s letter \u201crejecting the arbitration award\u201d and directing plaintiff to be \u201cguided accordingly\u201d is only ambiguous if there is some plausible interpretation as to what 21st Century was conveying other than a demand for a trial; we discern no plausible alternative interpretation. In this context, the rejection of the award can only be interpreted as demanding a trial, as the additional invitation to discuss settlement further amplifies; that is, there was nothing to discuss if the letter did not intend to convey the insurer\u2019s demand for a trial. Vega could not have reasonably understood the letter to mean anything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Notwithstanding the absence of an alternative meaning to 21st Century\u2019s rejection of the award and invitation to discuss settlement, the trial judge held, in following <em>LoBianco, </em>that 21st Century\u2019s failure to talismanically express a demand for a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>was fatal and, therefore, the award remained binding. We reject such formalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">To be sure, the final sentences of our <em>Morag </em>opinion cautioned that parties would be better served by writing with greater clarity than the insurer in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">The proper and most direct manner to demand a trial is to do so expressly. To do otherwise invites ambiguity, which could, depending on the factual circumstances, lead to a different result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\"><em>[Morag, supra, </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 62, 866 A.2d 996]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">These comments did not, however, create a standard for all future cases. We simply advised \u2014 and advise again \u2014 how a litigant may best avoid similar litigation in the future. The failure to heed that advice may lead to similar expensive litigation, but neither <em>Morag </em>nor today\u2019s opinion should be viewed as insisting upon a literal \u201cdemand for a trial\u201d to trigger the policy language in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\"> In <em>Verbiest, </em>the insurer\u2019s letter notified the claimants that \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s awards are rejected\u201d and invited them to discuss \u201cpossible settlement,\" while also informing the claimants of the insurer\u2019s proper name if they \u201cdecide[d] to institute litigation.\" The insurer's letter to the trial court advised that \u201cthe insurance carrier has rejected the award and is demanding a trial.\" <em>Id. </em>at 87, 606 A.2d 420.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-10\"> In <em>LoBianco, supra, </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 847 A.2d 584, the trial court found an insurer's letter \"reject[ing] the award of the arbitration panel\u201d and advising the claimant to \"take any steps necessary to pursue a claim on behalf of your client,\u201d to be insufficient to nullify the arbitration award. The court also found irrelevant the fact that the claimant may have understood the insurer\u2019s letter as demanding a trial: \u201cIn sum, even if LoBianco somehow surmised that Harleysville wanted a trial de novo \u2014 as Harleysville alleges \u2014 that should be of no moment. LoBianco is entitled by the contract to insist on a formal trial demand, which Harleysville did not make.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526, 847 A.2d 584. This strict compliance standard is inconsistent with <em>Morag </em>and today\u2019s decision and, for that reason, <em>LoBianco </em>must be overruled.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
