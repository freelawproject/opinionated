They argue that before the State could wiretap cellphones used by Savoy, it had to show a special need because he is married. We reject that argument. Defendants also argue that their communications were protected by the marital communications privilege. The State contended that (1) the interception removed the communications from protection of the marital communications privilege, and (2) the court should create a crime-fraud exception to that privilege. The trial judge accepted those contentions, and found the conversations not privileged. We cannot accept the State\u2019s first contention, however. At oral argument on appeal, the State withdrew the second contention because it now believes that such an exception can be created only by legislation or rule-making, not by judicial decision-making by this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The State\u2019s brief in the trial court proffered the following alleged facts, which served as the basis for the judge\u2019s opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Law enforcement authorities were investigating Savoy, who was the leader of a network distributing drugs in Ocean and Monmouth Counties. In that network, Savoy directed multiple individuals, including Terry. The State obtained judicial orders authorizing wiretaps on two cellphones used by Savoy beginning around October 7, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The State alleged that as part of his drug operation, Savoy fronted heroin to Chardel Holman. Savoy told Holman to meet Terry and pay her the drug proceeds Holman owed Savoy. On October 17, 2010, in several intercepted communications, Savoy arranged with Terry to pick up the money from Holman.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The State also alleged that on October 17, the authorities stopped a Lexus vehicle occupied by Savoy, seizing three bags of heroin, $900, and two other cellphones from Savoy\u2019s person. The authorities seized the Lexus after a police canine indicated that there were drugs in the car. Later that day, in an intercepted communication, Savoy asked Terry to retrieve unnamed items from his seized Lexus. The next day, after obtaining a warrant, officials searched the Lexus and recovered nearly twelve grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The grand jury indicted Savoy, Terry, Holman, and twenty other persons. All defendants were charged with conspiracy to manufacture, possess with the intent to distribute, and distribute cocaine and heroin, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2 and 2C:35-5a and\u20145b(1). Savoy was also charged with being a leader of a drug trafficking network, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-3, and possession of heroin with intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(1) and -5b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The State indicated its intent to offer as evidence two or three phone conversations and five text messages between Savoy and Terry. Savoy and Terry filed motions in limine to exclude them as privileged under the marital communications privilege, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>509. The State\u2019s responsive brief pointed out the large number of courts which have adopted a crime-fraud exception to that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">On July 31, 2012, the trial judge issued a reasoned oral opinion. First, the judge ruled that <em>Rule </em>509 prevented only spouses from disclosing confidential communications, and that the wiretap officers who overheard the marital communications could testify to them. Second, the trial judge ruled that there was a crime-fraud exception to the marital communications privilege, \u201can issue of first impression in New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Accordingly, the trial judge denied defendants\u2019 motion to exclude these communications as privileged. We granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">On appeal, defendants raise the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">POINT [I]: DEFENDANTS!]] MOTION TO EXCLUDE CONFIDENTIAL MARITAL COMMUNICATION SHOULD BE GRANTED SINCE THE STATE VIOLATED THE NEW JERSEY WIRETAP ACT WHEN IT RECORDED THE COMMUNICATIONS WITHOUT A SHOWING OF \u201cSPECIAL NEEDS\u201d AND FAILED TO INFORM THE WIRETAP JUDGE OF SUCH RECORDINGS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">POINT [II]: THE PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS DO NOT LOSE [THEIR] PRIVILEGED CHARACTER BECAUSE THEY WERE OVERHEARD BY A THIRD PARTY. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>POINT [III]: NEW JERSEY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE \u201cCRIME FRAUD\u201d EXCEPTION TO THE MARITAL PRIVILEGE NOR IS APPLICATION TO <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504(c) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> APPROPRIATE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The issues raised on appeal are \u201clegal in nature, and thus our review is plenary.\u201d <em>State v. Schubert, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>295, 304, 53 A.3d 1210 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Defendants first argue that the State violated the New Jersey Wiretap and Electronic Surveillance Control Act (the Wiretap Act), <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:156A-1 to -34. Specifically, defendants assert that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11 required the State to show \u201cspecial need\u201d to monitor Savoy\u2019s cellphones, because the State knew that Savoy was married to Terry, and learned that he used his cellphone to communicate with Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Ordinarily, \u201cwe determine the meaning of statutes by looking to the Legislature\u2019s plain language.\u201d <em>State v. McDonald, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>4, 18, 47 A.3d 669 (2012). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\"><em>If </em>the facilities from which, or <em>the place where, the wire, electronic or oral communications are to be intercepted </em>are being used, or are about to be used, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by, a licensed physician, a licensed practicing psychologist, an attorney-at-law, a practicing clergyman, or a newspaperman, or <em>is a place used primarily for habitation by a husband and wife, no order shall be issued unless the court, </em>in addition to the matters provided in section 10 of P.L.1968, <em>c. </em>409 (C.2A:156A-10), <em>determines that there is a special need to intercept wire, electronic or oral communications </em>over such facilities or <em>in suck places. Special need as used in this section shall require </em>in addition to the matters required by section 10 of P.L.1968, c. 409 (C.2A:156A-10), <em>a showing that </em>the licensed physician, licensed practicing psychologist, attorney-at-law, practicing clergyman or newspaperman is personally engaging in or was engaged in over a period of time as a part of a continuing criminal activity or is committing, has or had committed or is about to commit an offense as provided in section 8 of P.L.1968, c. 409 (C.2A:156A-8) or that the public facilities or <em>the place used primarily for habitation by a husband and wife are being regularly used by someone who is personally engaging in or was engaged in over a period of time as </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>a part of a continuing cnminal activity or is committing, has or had committed or is about to commit such an offense. </em>No otherwise privileged wire, electronic or oral communication intercepted in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this act, shall lose its privileged character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Thus, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11, if the communications are to be intercepted at \u201ca place used primarily for habitation by a husband and wife,\u201d the State\u2019s application to intercept communications at that place must demonstrate \u201cspecial need,\u201d namely that the place is \u201cbeing regularly used by someone\u201d personally engaged in crime. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">This language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11 clearly requires that the State show a special need before using a \u201cbug\u201d or other electronic surveillance to intercept oral communications within a marital home. We note that it has been suggested in dicta that this language also encompasses interception of communications over a home phone of a married couple. <em>See State v. Catania, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>418, 438, 427 A.2d 537 (1981); <em>Sacci v. Metaxas, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 513, 810 A.2d 1119 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Defendants try to stretch <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:156A-11\u2019s plain language, \u201cplace used primarily for habitation by a husband and wife,\u201d beyond its generally accepted meaning to encompass cellphones wherever they may be located, if they are used by a married person. They argue that language should not be read to exclude cellphones because the Wiretap Act was written in 1968, before the advent of cellphones. To the contrary, \u201ccellular telephone calls\u201d that traveled in part over landlines were covered as \u201cwire communications\u201d under the 1968 federal wiretap act and thus under New Jersey\u2019s Wiretap Act, which was modeled on the federal wiretap act. <em>State v. Tango, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 418-20, 671 A.2d 186 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>585, 677 A.2d 758 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Because some cellphone calls travel purely by radio signals to other cellphones, Congress amended the federal wiretap act to cover them and other \u201celectronic communications\u201d in 1986, and the New Jersey Legislature did the same to the Wiretap Act in 1993. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number><em>Ibid.; see L. </em>1993, c. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 1-24. In particular, that 1993 act amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11 to cover \u201celectronic communications,\u201d <em>L. </em>1993, c. 29, \u00a7 10, but it did not amend the language requiring \u201cspecial need\u201d only for communications at \u201ca place used primarily for habitation by a husband and wife,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s choice to leave that limitation unchanged, while amending the section to address cellphones, indicates its intent not to expand the special need requirement beyond the marital home. <em>See Johnson v. Scaccetti, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>256, 277-78, 927 A.2d 1269 (2007) (the Legislature\u2019s amendment of other provisions in a statutory section indicates that its failure to override a judicial decision was probably purposeful). We see no basis to infer that the Legislature desired but failed to amend the \u201chabitation\u201d language. <em>See State v. Staten, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>435, 438, 303 A.2d 65 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Furthermore, there are sound reasons supporting the Legislature\u2019s choice to conf\u00edne the special needs requirement to the marital home. The marital home is the quintessential location for confidential communications between spouses, so protecting that \u201cplace\u201d focuses the special need, and provides clear guidance to law enforcement. Extending the statute to refer to any communication facility used by a person who happens to be married would vastly expand the scope of the special need requirement, and present serious difficulties and uncertainties for law enforcement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>We will not presume that the Legislature intended such a dramatic and problematic expansion \u201cwithout further direction from the Legislature.\u201d <em>Staten, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 438, 303 A.2d 65; <em>see State v. Haliski, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9, 656 A.2d 1246 (1995) (\u201cstatutory interpretations that lead to absurd or unreasonable results are to be avoided\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">For all these reasons, we reject defendants\u2019 argument. We hold that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11 does not require a showing of special need to wiretap a cellphone merely because it is registered to or used by a married person, even if the married person uses the cellphone to communicate with his or her spouse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Defendants cite a case suppressing monitored communications because the State improperly intercepted an attorney-client communication. <em>State v. Ates, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>614, 46 A.3d 605 (Law Div.2009), <em>affd o.b., </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>521, 534, 46 A.3d 550 (App.Div. 2012), <em>certif. granted, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>389, 63 A.3d 228 (2013). In <em>Ates, </em>however, the wiretap order \u201cclearly contained a restriction that \u2018no attorney client conversations may be intercepted,\u2019 \u201d and the intercepted conversation was indisputably protected by the attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 625-26. Defendants do not claim that the wiretap orders here contained a restriction forbidding the recording of marital communications, and the State disputes that the intercepted communications fall within the marital communications privilege.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Defendants also argue that allowing interception of privileged cellphone communications between spouses will chill marital communications, cause marital disharmony, and force spouses to testify. Those arguments all hinge on whether the communications were in fact protected by the marital communications privilege, the issue to which we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">rv.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The State first argues that the marital communications privilege does not apply to these communications because they were overheard by the wiretap, and will be testified to by an officer. We reject that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">The marital communications privilege was enacted in 1960 by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22, and is reprinted at <em>N.J.R.E. </em>509. It provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">No person shall disclose any communication made in confidence between such person and his or her spouse unless both shall consent to the disclosure or unless the communication is relevant to an issue in an action between them or in a criminal action or proceeding in which either spouse consents to the disclosure, or in a criminal action or proceeding coming within <em>Rule </em>23(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\n<em>[Ibid.] </em>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">The marital communications privilege \u201cstems from the strong public policy of encouraging free and uninhibited communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>between spouses, and, consequently, of protecting the sanctity and tranquility of marriage.\u201d <em>State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 414, 640 A.2d 817 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">In contexts outside the Wiretap Act, a marital communication loses its privilege if it is overheard \u201c\u2018either accidentally or by eavesdropping.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 640 A.2d 817 (quoting 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 82, at 302-03 (J.S. Strong, 4th ed.1992)); <em>see id. </em>at 418-20, 640 A.2d 817. \u201cNew Jersey law has long held that the marital-communications privilege does not prohibit disclosure by third parties who overhear spousal conversations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416, 640 A.2d 817. In <em>Szemple, </em>the Supreme Court reviewed several New Jersey cases, including eases where the spouses spoke in the presence of a neighbor, or where a spouse transmitted the communication to the other spouse through a third person. <em>Id. </em>at 416-17, 640 A.2d 817. \u201cThose cases establish that the involvement of a third party vitiates the requirement of confidentiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 417, 640 A.2d 817. Accordingly, the Court in <em>Szemple </em>held that \u201c[t]he confidential nature of a letter is destroyed just as readily when a third party obtains it as when someone overhears an oral communication.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">No New Jersey case, however, has held that interception under the Wiretap Act destroys the marital communications privilege. The State and the trial judge cite <em>State v. Sidoti, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 341 A.2d 670 (App.Div.1975), as holding that interception under the Wiretap Act removes the privilege. We do not read <em>Sidoti </em>as reaching that holding. The premise of <em>Sidoti\u2019s </em>discussion was that the defendant was \u201cconceding that the conversations [with his wife] thus admitted into evidence did not contain confidential communications,\u201d and <em>Sidoti </em>assumed that the marital communications privilege was \u201cnot applicable here, for defendant concedes the taped conversations were not confidential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430-31, 341 A.2d 670. Further, <em>Sidoti </em>concluded that \u201cthe admission of these conversations, even if error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 341 A.2d 670. Finally, no court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ever cited <em>Sidoti </em>as holding that interception under the Wiretap Act removes the privilege.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Even if <em>Sidoti </em>had held that interception under the Wiretap Act removes the privileged character of marital communications, we would decline to follow it because the Wiretap Act mandates the exact opposite ruling. The same section that protects communications in the marital home also provides: \u201cNo otherwise privileged wire, electronic or oral communication intercepted in accordance with, or in violation of, the provisions of this act, shall lose its privileged character.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11. The State\u2019s argument, that interception by wiretap destroys confidentiality, would remove the privilege from all of the privileged communications protected by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:156A-11, because all depend on confidentiality.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State\u2019s reading would thus render this key provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11 a nullity. <em>See Smith v. Director, Div. of Taxation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>19, 27, 527 A.2d 843 (1987) (\u201cit is well-established that a statute should not be construed in a manner that renders any portion of it a nullity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Even if <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:156A-11\u2019s language were ambiguous, the legislative history is inconsistent with the State\u2019s reading. <em>See McDonald, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 47 A.3d 669. The Legislature copied this provision directly from the essentially identical provision in the federal wiretap act, 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2517(4). The legislative history of \u00a7 2517(4) explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Traditionally, the interest of truth in the administration of justice has been subordinated in the law to the interest of preserving privileged communications where four relationships have been involved: physician-patient, lawyer-client, clergyman-confidant, and husband-wife. The scope and existence of these privileges varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The proposed provision is intended to vary existing law only to the extent it provides that an otherwise privileged communication does not lose its privileged character because it is intercepted by a stranger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">[S. Rep. No. 90-1097, at 100 (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>1968 <em>U.S.C.CAN. </em>2112, 2189.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHkJ\">Thus, this provision in both the federal and New Jersey wiretap acts was intended to defeat precisely the argument the State makes here, that interception by wiretap eliminates confidentiality and destroys the privilege. <em>See State v. Burstein, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>394, 412, 427 A.2d 525 (1981) (relying on the legislative history of the federal wiretap act to determine the meaning of a \u201cvirtually identical\u201d provision in New Jersey\u2019s Wiretap Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Because interception does not cause the marital communications to lose their privileged character, we must also reject the State\u2019s subsidiary argument, adopted by the trial judge, that the privilege is not violated because the intercepted communications will be testified to by an officer, rather than Savoy or Terry. The State conflates the marital communications privilege in <em>Rule </em>509 with the privilege against spousal testimony, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>501(2). <em>Rule </em>509 provides independent protections to confidential communications which do not vanish merely because there is no violation of <em>Rule </em>501(2). <em>State v. Mauti </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>519, 533-34, 33 A.3d 1216 (2012); <em>State v. Ospina, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>645, 651, 571 A.2d 1373 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>321, 604 A.2d 597 (1990); <em>see, e.g., Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 410-12, 414-20, 640 A.2d 817 (considering <em>Rule </em>509\u2019s protections for a marital communication even though it was admitted without spousal testimony).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In any event, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>reconcile the State\u2019s argument \u2014 that intercepting and having an officer testify to a marital communication defeats the privilege\u2014 with the Wiretap Act\u2019s explicit provision that \u201c[n]o otherwise privileged communication\u201d intercepted under the Act \u201cshall lose its privileged character.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11; <em>see State v. Mazzone, </em>336 <em>Md. </em>379, 648 A.2d 978, 983 (1994) (an officer\u2019s testimony to intercepted marital communications violates the essentially identical provision of Maryland\u2019s wiretap statute, <em>Md.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 10\u2014407(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">We hold that under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:156A-11, a privileged marital communication does not lose its privileged character because it is intercepted by a wiretap, or because the intercepted communication can be testified to by a third person. The issue then is whether these marital communications fall within a crime-fraud exception to the marital communications privilege. <em>See United States v. Kahn, </em>471 F.2d 191, 193-95 &amp; n. 8 (7th Cir.1972) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s reliance on 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2517(4) because the court found a crime-fraud exception to the federal marital communications privilege).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The State\u2019s second argument was that the intercepted communications do not fall within the marital communications privilege because they were made in aid of the commission of a crime. The State argued and the trial judge ruled that the crime-fraud exception, long applied to the attorney-client privilege, <em>see N.J.R.E. </em>504(2)(a), also applies to the marital communications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>privilege.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The judge correctly recognized that this presents an issue of first impression in New Jersey. Accordingly, we look at the origins of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege was recognized in New Jersey common law in the ease that first acknowledged the privilege itself. <em>Matthews v. Hoagland, </em>48 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>455, 465-70, 21 <em>A. </em>1054 (Ch. 1891). The initial justification for the crime-fraud exception was that the client\u2019s concealed or open involvement of counsel in crime destroyed the \u201cprofessional confidence and professional employment,\u201d respectively, that were the prerequisites for the privilege. <em>Ibid.; accord In re Stein, </em>1 <em>N.J. </em>228, 286, 62 A.2d 801 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Subsequently, the justification was refocused on \u201csound considerations of public policy.\u201d <em>In re Selser, </em>15 <em>N.J. </em>393, 403, 105 A.2d 395 (1954). In <em>Selser, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthe privilege is not absolute, but rather an exception to a more fundamental policy,\u201d namely \u201cthe full disclosure of all the facts in order that justice may prevail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405, 105 A.2d 395. \u201cIt is therefore to be strictly limited to the purposes for which it exists.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c <em>\u2018A </em>client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the truth be told.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 402, 105 A.2d 395 (quoting <em>Clark v. United States, </em>289 <em>U.S. </em>1, 15, 53 <em>S.Ct. </em>465, 469, 77 <em>L.Ed. </em>993, 1000 (1933)). The Court emphasized that given the increasing inroads of crime, the exception was necessary to avoid \u201cobvious detriment [to] the public welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 412, 105 A.2d 395. Thus, \u201c[t]he \u2018crime or fraud\u2019 exception to the privilege represents a statutory recognition of a situation in which the purpose of the privilege would not be served by its enforcement,\u201d <em>Fellerman v. Bradley, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>493, 503, 493 A.2d 1239 (1985), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>is necessary to protect \u201c[t]he fair administration of justice and the interests of the public,\u201d <em>In re Richardson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>391, 401, 157 A.2d 695 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Those same public policy concerns support applying the crime-fraud exception to the marital communications privilege. \u201c\u2018[Sjince the [marital communications] privilege has as its only effect the suppression of relevant evidence, its scope should be confined as narrowly as is consistent with the reasonable protection of marital communications.\u2019 \u201d <em>Szemple, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 415, 640 A.2d 817 (quoting 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 82, at 303). Further, it is not uncommon for spouses to be accomplices or co-conspirators, or for one spouse to use the other spouse to carry out a crime or fraud. To immunize spouse-to-spouse communications about committing ongoing crimes and frauds from interception, or admission into evidence, would encourage such spousal involvement, thwart law enforcement, and increase the risk to the public.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Numerous other jurisdictions, citing similar public policy concerns, have made the marital communications privilege subject to the crime-fraud exception. In <em>United States v. Kahn, </em>a wiretap intercepted the defendant calling his wife about his ongoing illegal gambling activities, and the wife calling a gambling figure. The Seventh Circuit held that \u201c[i]f the intercepted conversations had to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>do with the commission of a crime,\u201d the marital communications privilege \u201cmust give way to the public interest in discovering the truth about crime, and in enforcement of criminal law.\u201d <em>Kahn, supra, </em>471 <em>F.2d </em>at 194. The Third Circuit has agreed that \u201ccommunications between spouses pertaining to ongoing or future criminal activity, are not protected against disclosure by the privilege for confidential marital communications.\u201d <em>United States v. Ammar, </em>714 F.2d 238, 257-58 (3d Cir.) (the defendant\u2019s request to his wife to collect money owed him from heroin transactions is not privileged because \u201csuch communications are not worthy of protection\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>936, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>344, 78 L.Ed.2d 311 (1983); <em>see United States v. King, </em>541 F.3d 1143, 1146 (5th Cir.2008) (intercepted communications regarding hiding items fi\u2019om law enforcement are not privileged), <em>cert. denied, </em>555 <em>U.S. </em>1119, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>947, 173 L.Ed.2d 144 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Indeed, all eleven federal circuits that have faced the issue have concluded that communications between spouses jointly engaging in criminal activity are excluded from the marital communications privilege.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Numerous states have reached the same conclusion by statute,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> rule,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or case law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Thus, as the trial judge observed, \u201cnumerous State and Federal jurisdictions ... hold that there is a crime-fraud exception to the marital communication privilege.\u201d As the judge noted, moreover, New Jersey\u2019s attorney-client privilege contains a specific crime-fraud exception.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Before we can decide whether to follow those jurisdictions and adopt such an exception to the marital communications privilege, we must first determine whether we have the authority to add an exception to a privilege adopted by statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">To determine whether this court can adopt a crime-fraud exception to the marital communication privilege, we must first briefly examine the history and promulgation of privileges and rules of evidence in New Jersey. Prior to the Evidence Act of 1960, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A84A-1 to -49, the attorney-client privilege, like its crime-fraud exception, had \u201cnever been formally set forth in either constitutional or statutory provision.\u201d <em>Richardson, supra, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 396,157 A.2d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u201cBefore passage of the Evidence Act, the various branches of government made competing constitutional claims as to which branch had authority to enact and regulate evidence rules.\u201d <em>State v. Byrd, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>319, 343, 967 A.2d 285 (2009). The New Jersey Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall make rules governing the administration of all courts in the State and, subject to the law, the practice and procedure in all such courts,\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. VI, \u00a7 2, \u00b6 3, but the drafters deleted earlier drafts\u2019 references to rules of evidence because \u201cthe delegates to the 1947 Constitutional Convention were either unable or unwilling to classify rules of evidence as either procedural rules or substantive law,\u201d <em>Byrd, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 344, 967 A.2d 285; <em>see Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>240, 247-48, 255, 74 A.2d 406, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 <em>U.S. </em>877, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>638 (1950) (the Supreme Court\u2019s power to promulgate rules \u201cis confined to practice, procedure and administration,\u201d and does not include \u201csubstantive law\u201d). Apparently for that reason, the drafters \u201cdecided not to resolve the thorny question concerning whether the Supreme Court had exclusive rule-making power to enact evidence rules.\u201d <em>Byrd, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 345, 967 A.2d 285. \u201cThe Evidence Act was a \u2018pragmatic resolution\u2019 among the three branches of government, giving each branch a role in the process of enacting rules of evidence,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>and \u201caverting a conflict with the other branches of government.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In 1960, \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s statutory law governing testimonial privileges was adopted as part of\u2019 the Evidence Act. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>500 (historical note). Under the Evidence Act, the privileges were \u201ccodified as part of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:84A,\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>500 (committee comment), including the spousal testimonial privilege, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-17(2), the attorney-client privilege, <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:84A-20, and the marital communications privilege, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22. The Evidence Act expressly included the crime-fraud exception in the attorney-client privilege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">(2) Exceptions. Such privilege shall not extend (a) to a communication in the course of legal service sought or obtained in aid of the commission of a crime or a fraud____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-9\">[N.J.S.A 2A:84A-20(2)(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The Evidence Act did not include any such exception in the newly-enacted marital communication privilege. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The Evidence Act also provided that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court may adopt rules dealing with the admission or rejection of evidence, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this article.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-33. The Act permitted the Supreme Court to promulgate evidence rules, including rules revising or eliminating statutory evidence provisions, with notice to the Legislature and Governor, and subject to cancellation by a joint resolution of the Senate and General Assembly signed by the Governor. <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:84A-33 to -40. The Legislature also reserved its right to pass statutes changing or cancelling any such evidence rules. <em>N.J.SA. </em>2A:84A-37.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">In 1967, the Supreme Court\u2019s first \u201crules of evidence were adopted cooperatively by the three branches of government under the Evidence Act.\u201d <em>Busik v. Levine, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>351, 367-68, 307 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>571 (1973). \u201cUnder the statutory arrangement, some of the rules, notably those embodying privileges, were fixed in the statute itself while other rules, prepared by the Court after consideration at a Judicial Conference, were filed with the Legislature to become effective unless disapproved by a joint resolution signed by the Governor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 307 A.2d 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The Supreme Court utilized the same Evidence Act procedure to adopt the current 1993 Rules of Evidence, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>101 to 1103. <em>Byrd, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 343, 967 A.2d 285. \u201cThe revised rules adopted the numbering used in the Federal Rules of Evidence and followed those rules in many instances.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>431, 442, 38 A.3d 559 (2012). The Court\u2019s rules did not follow Federal Rule of Evidence 501, which left \u201cthe law of privilege to common-law development superseded only by the Constitution, Act of Congress, or Supreme Court rule.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>500 (committee comment). Instead, the Court simply adopted as rules the statutory privileges that already existed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">Privileges as they now exist or may be modified by law shall be unaffected by the adoption of these rules. For convenience in reference certain existing provisions of law relating to privileges are enumerated in Article V [the \u201cPrivileges\u201d Article], <em>[N.J.R.E. </em>500.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The Court\u2019s rules merely reprinted and \u201cassign[ed] a rule number to each of the statutory privileges, making no change in their present text.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>500 (committee comment). Thus, as set forth above, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>509 reprinted the marital privilege for confidential communications statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">In <em>Byrd, </em>the State requested that the Supreme Court issue a judicial opinion adopting a forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception to the Rules of Evidence. <em>Byrd, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 334, 342, 967 A.2d 285.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The Court concluded: \u201cAlthough we believe that the addition of a forfeiture-by-wrongdoing hearsay exception to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>evidence rules would be a positive development and promote the ascertainment of truth, we cannot accept the State\u2019s argument that this Court should act unilaterally and bypass the procedures of the Evidence Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348, 967 A.2d 285. The Court emphasized that \u201c[i]n New Jersey, the adoption of evidence rules is governed by statute \u2014 the Evidence Act, 1960, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-33 to -44 \u2014 and the process of adopting such rules involves all three branches of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342, 967 A.2d 285. The Court \u201cadhere[d] to the procedural requirements of the Evidence Act,\u201d and announced it would \u201csubmit the proposed rule to the Senate and the General Assembly for their approval by resolution, and to the Governor for his signature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 967 A.2d 285 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-38).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In <em>Mauti, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized the limited ability of judicial opinions to amend the statutory privileges. The State asked the Court to compel a wife\u2019s testimony against her husband, despite the statutory spousal testimonial privilege, because before marriage she had done her own investigation of his alleged sexual assault against her sister, and had testified before the grand jury. The State argued that permitting the wife to exercise the spousal testimonial privilege did nothing to further the purpose behind the privilege. The Court stressed that \u201c[t]he Legislature has spoken regarding the spousal privilege and, in so doing, has set forth the three specific circumstances in which it has concluded that application of the privilege would not advance the goals underlying it.\u201d <em>Mauti supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 540-41, 33 A.3d 1216 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-17(2)). \u201cThere is neither warrant nor right for us to <em>engraft </em>a new exception <em>onto the </em>privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 33 A.3d 1216. \u201cOur own conclusions about what would be better policy are simply of no consequence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We have expressed similar concerns about judicially modifying the statutory privileges. In <em>Ospina, </em>we noted that the federal courts had adopted a \u201c \u2018joint participants\u2019 \u201d exception to the spousal testimonial privilege. <em>Ospina, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 650, 571 A.2d 1373 (citation omitted). However, we stated that, because New Jersey\u2019s privilege \u201cwas statutorily adopted in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-17, we are reluctant to create the <em>Winberry v. Salisbury </em>confrontation that would be necessarily involved in judicial renovation of the privilege.\u201d <em>Ospina, supra, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 650, 571 A.2d 1373 (footnote omitted). We concluded that \u201c[w]e have no authority to narrow the ... privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651, 571 A.2d 1373. Similarly, in <em>State v. Baluch, </em>341 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141,172, 775 A.2d 127 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>89, 784 A.2d 721 (2001), we were \u201cmindful of our inability to unilaterally narrow the [spousal testimonial] privilege by judicial fiat.\u201d In <em>State v. Mauti, </em>416 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 191, 193 &amp; n. 7, 3 A.3d 624 (App.Div.2010), <em>affd, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>519, 33 A.3d 1216 (2012), we stressed that even though the spousal testimonial privilege had been criticized, and abandoned by nineteen states, \u201c[o]ur role as judges is not to question the wisdom of this public policy\u201d behind all privileges, but \u201cto ascertain and then enforce the intent of the Legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The trial judge, citing <em>Ospina, </em>noted that \u201cunlike federal law, the privileges in New Jersey are statutorily created and, therefore, should not be judicially modified.\u201d Nonetheless, the judge distinguished the spousal testimonial privilege at issue in <em>Ospina </em>from the marital communication privilege, which \u201cis akin to the attorney/client privilege.\u201d The judge reasoned that since the attorney-client privilege has a crime-fraud exception, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504(2)(a), and courts in other jurisdictions had applied that exception to the marital communications privilege, the same exception should apply to New Jersey\u2019s <em>Rule </em>509.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>We must disagree with the trial judge\u2019s reasoning. The fact that the spousal testimonial privilege was at issue in <em>Ospina, Baluch, </em>and <em>Mauti </em>does not mean that we are free to create exceptions to other privileges. The fact that the Legislature codified a crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege does not mean that we can add that exception to the marital communications privilege because the privileges are \u201cakin\u201d. <em>See Mauti, supra, </em>416 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 193, 3 A.3d 624. Rather, under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Mauti, </em>we may not engraft a crime-fraud exception onto the marital communications privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The trial judge added that \u201cany communication in the case made in furtherance of drug trafficking was [not] worthy of protection, nor does it fall within the public policy principles underlying the marital [communication] privilege in New Jersey.\u201d We agree, but \u201c[o]ur own conclusions about what would be better policy are simply of no consequence.\u201d <em>See Mauti, supra, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>at 541, 33 A.3d 1216. There were similarly compelling reasons to adopt the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing exception in <em>Byrd. Byrd, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 337-38, 967 A.2d 285. Nevertheless, as in <em>Byrd, </em>this court cannot \u201cact unilaterally and bypass the procedures of the Evidence Act.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 348, 967 A.2d 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Accordingly, under <em>Byrd </em>and <em>Mauti, </em>we hold that neither this court nor the trial judge has the <em>power </em>to add the crime-fraud exception to the marital communication privilege. Therefore, we reverse the trial judge\u2019s order denying the motion to exclude the intercepted privileged communications between Savoy and Terry.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-13\"> The State has been represented in these proceedings by the Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.

The State now informs us that the prosecutor inadvertently failed to submit the certification to the trial court until months after the ruling which we now review.
