We also consider whether the trial court was required to instruct the jury on the elements of attempted robbery even though such an instruction was not requested by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">After reviewing the record in light of the contentions advanced on appeal, we determine the police officer\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted and that the prosecutor\u2019s summation improperly bolstered the officer\u2019s testimony in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. We further conclude it was plain error to fail to instruct the jury on the elements of attempted robbery. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The State developed the following proofs at trial. Antoinette Boutros is the owner of a convenience store. On June 29, 2009, Boutros was working by herself at the cash register when she saw a man come into the store \u201cgoing like real fast in the back of the store.\u201d Boutros testified she had seen the man before in the store and his face looked familiar. However, she did not know his name. There were other customers in the store at the time and Boutros continued to assist them.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">When the other customers left, the man approached the register with a Reese\u2019s candy bar in his hand. He put his hand in his pocket and took out a \u201cgrey metal stick.\u201d Boutros testified the man shook the stick at her and told her to \u201copen the register, I\u2019m not joking, open the register, and don\u2019t you dare touch the phone. I\u2019m going to kill you, I\u2019m going to get you.\u201d Boutros had originally believed the man was joking, but after he threatened her, she \u201cpressed the panic button\u201d to alert the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Boutros testified she became flustered and she was unable to open the register. As the man continued to threaten her, Boutros told him she would \u201cunplug the register\u201d and that he should \u201ctake the whole store, leave me alone, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d She then ran out of the store. The man followed Boutros outside. He had not taken any money from the register and Boutros testified she did not know whether he had taken the candy bar from the store with him. Once outside, the man told Boutros \u201cI\u2019m going to come back and kill you if you call the police.\u201d The man then ran away \u201creally, really fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Detective Sergeant Robert Stettner arrived at the scene between five and fifteen minutes after receiving the call. Boutros\u2019 husband, Lenny, who was also an owner, was at the store when he arrived. Boutros told the detective there was a surveillance video. The detective reviewed it, but he testified the suspect\u2019s face was not visible in the footage.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Several days later, Lenny Boutros called Detective Sergeant Stettner. The detective testified Mr. Boutros told him \u201ca customer of his had either called or come in \u2014 I\u2019m not exactly sure what he said \u2014 but provided the name of [defendant] as the person who\u201d was involved in the incident. Defense counsel did not object to this testimony at trial. Based upon this information, Detective Sergeant Stettner testified he obtained a photo of defendant and included it with five photos of other suspects in a photo array. He then gave the photo array to Detective Teddy Garcia, who showed it to Boutros. When she got to defendant\u2019s photo, Boutros said \u201c[tjhat\u2019s him, oh my God.\u201d Defendant was then arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Tried before a jury on a two-count indictment, defendant was convicted of second-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a(2) (count one); and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-4d (count two). The trial court sentenced defendant to five years in prison, subject to the provisions of the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, on count one; and a concurrent three-year term on count two. Defendant was also assessed appropriate fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">On appeal, defendant has raised the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">THE <em>BANKSTON/BRANCH </em>ERROR, WHICH OCCURRED WHEN THE PROSECUTOR ASKED A DETECTIVE HOW HE \u201c[G]OT A NAME OF A POTENTIAL SUSPECT,\u201d AND THE DETECTIVE RESPONDED BY DETAILING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF HEARSAY IMPLICATING DEFENDANT IN THE CRIME, WAS SO HARMFUL TO THIS CASE \u2014 WHERE MISIDEN-TIFICATION WAS THE DEFENSE \u2014 THAT IT CONSTITUTES PLAIN ERROR, WORTHY OF REVERSAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">AS WAS THE BASIS FOR REVERSAL IN <em>STATE </em>V. <em>GONZALEZ, </em>THE TRIAL JUDGE CHARGED THE JURY ON ATTEMPTED THEFT AS A BASIS FOR ROBBERY, BUT DID NOT EVER DEFINE EITHER THE <em>ACTUS REUS </em>OR THE <em>MENS REA </em>OF A CRIMINAL ATTEMPT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED IN REFUSING THE REQUESTED INSTRUCTION ON THEFT AND/OR ATTEMPTED THEFT AS A LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">We first turn to defendant\u2019s Point I, where he argues that Detective Sergeant Stettner should not have been permitted to testify about his conversation with Lenny Boutros. The following colloquy took place during the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the detective sergeant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">Q: ... So did you at some point get a name of a potential suspect as the person who may have committed a crime against Ms. Boutros?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">Q: Okay. And how did that happen?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">A: Lenny Boutros had called me and said that a customer of his had either called or come in \u2014 I\u2019m not sure exactly what he said \u2014 but provided the name of [defendant] as the person who\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">Q: And now that \u2014 Strike that. Were you \u2014 Once you got that name, now [defendant] is from the Phillipsburg area, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-14\">A: Yes, he is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-15\">Q: Okay. And fair to say it\u2019s a small county?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-16\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-17\">Q: Small town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-19\">Q: So were you able to get a photo \u2014 a recent photo \u2014 a fairly-recent photograph of [defendant] from people in the area or anybody that knows him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-20\">A: I was able to get a photo, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-21\">The testimony provided by Detective Sergeant Stettner was clearly hearsay. He told the jury that Lenny Boutros told him that another individual, whom he did not name, told Mr. Boutros defendant was the person involved in the incident at the store. Relying upon <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 307 A.2d 65 (1973), defendant contends he was denied a fair trial as a result of Detective Sergeant Stettner\u2019s testimony because this testimony suggested he was the perpetrator and he had no opportunity to confront either Mr. Boutros or the unnamed informant to dispute this. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>The Confrontation Clause contained in the Sixth Amendment, which applies to the states by way of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]\u201d The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the Confrontation Clause bars the admission of \u201c[tjestimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial\u201d except \u201cwhere the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 <em>U.S. </em>36, 59, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 1369, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 197 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In <em>Bankston, </em>our Supreme Court confirmed that the hearsay rule is not violated when a police officer explains that he approached a suspect or went to a crime scene based \u201cupon information received,\u201d because such testimony explains his subsequent conduct and shows that the officer was not acting in an arbitrary manner. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 307 A.2d 65; <em>accord State v. Luna, </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>202, 217, 936 A.2d 957 (2007). However, the <em>Bankston </em>Court cautioned that both the hearsay rule and a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to be confronted by the witnesses against him or her are violated if the officer becomes more specific and repeats what another person told the officer linking the defendant to a crime. <em>Bankston, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 268-69, 307 A.2d 65. According to the Court, \u201c[wjhen the logical implication to be drawn from the testimony leads the jury to believe that a non-testifying witness has given the police evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt, the testimony should be disallowed as hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 307 A.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In <em>State v. Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 865 A.2d 673 (2005), the Court applied the <em>Bankston </em>rule to a police officer\u2019s explanation for why he included a defendant in a photo array. There, the defendant was convicted of burglary and robbery based on the identification evidence of two witnesses. <em>Branch, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 346-47, 865 A.2d 673. At trial, \u201ca police detective testified that he included defendant\u2019s picture in a photographic array because he had developed defendant as a suspect \u2018based on information received.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>at 342, 865 A.2d 673. Thus, the jury was left with the impression that the detective had some other knowledge implicating defendant in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 865 A.2d 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Court found \u201c[t]here was no legitimate need or reason for [the detective] to tell the jury why he placed defendant\u2019s picture in the photographic array. The only relevant evidence was the identification itself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, the jury heard irrelevant, \u201cgratuitous hearsay testimony\u201d that violated defendant\u2019s right to confrontation and the rules of evidence. <em>Ibid. </em>As a result, the Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 354, 865 A.2d 673. <em>See also State v. Lazo, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>9, 21-24, 34 A.3d 1233 (2012) (police officer\u2019s hearsay testimony of how he assembled a photo array violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">A similar result is required in this case. Although defendant did not object to the detective sergeant\u2019s testimony, its admission was not harmless error under the circumstances of this case. <em>State v. Castagna, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>293, 312, 901 A.2d 363 (2006) (an appellate court will disregard \u201c[a]ny error or omission [by the trial court] ... unless it is of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d). Here, defendant\u2019s identification, or misidentification, was the main issue at trial. The suspect\u2019s face was not visible on the surveillance video. While Boutros was able to give a description of the perpetrator, there was nothing linking defendant to the crime until an anonymous source told Mr. Boutros, who then told Detective Sergeant Stettner, that defendant was the culprit. Permitting this double hearsay into evidence deprived defendant of his right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Moreover, the prosecutor made full use of the hearsay testimony in his summation. The prosecutor told the jury Mr. Boutros had taken \u201ca still\u201d photo from the surveillance video. The prosecutor continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">[The victim\u2019s] husband took a still. That\u2019s his wife. That\u2019s his wife that this happened to. The husband took a still and showed it for a week and somebody said I know that face. I wasn\u2019t present for the \u2014 crime, I wasn\u2019t there, I\u2019m not a witness, but I know that face, and that face is [defendant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The State argues these comments were designed to respond to the argument made by defense counsel \u201cthat lazy police work, including that the police did nothing to further their investigation until Mr. Boutros called them with defendant\u2019s name, showed reasonable doubt.\u201d We disagree. Here, the prosecutor went well beyond arguing the detective sergeant had \u201creceived information\u201d that explained his actions. He provided an expanded description of what the anonymous source had told Mr. Boutros. In the process, the prosecutor provided specific information that another person, who was not called as a witness at trial, had linked defendant to the crime. <em>Bankston, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 268-69, 307 A.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s pointed comments improperly bolstered the victim\u2019s identification of defendant in a manner that violated his constitutional right of confrontation. That identification was the sole basis for defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Under those circumstances, we cannot conclude that the error in admitting this hearsay testimony was harmless. We are therefore required to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Although our resolution of defendant\u2019s right to confrontation argument is dispositive of this appeal, we also believe a reversal is required because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the law of attempt. While this failure primarily relates to the robbery charge, the flawed instruction on that charge also infected the instructions the court gave the jury on the weapons offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">The crime of robbery includes attempted theft. A person commits robbery if \u201cin the course of committing a theft\u201d the person inflicts bodily injury or uses force upon another, threatens another with or purposely puts the other in fear of immediate bodily injury, or commits or threatens immediately to commit a crime of the first or second degree. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a-(1)-(3). An act is <em>\u201cdeemed ... included </em>... <em>\u2018in the course of committing </em>a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>theft\u2019 if it occurs in an attempt to commit theft or in immediate flight after the attempt or commission.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Defendant did not request a charge on attempt and did not object when the court charged the jury. Consequently, defendant must demonstrate plain error, that is, error \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see also State v. Walker, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>73, 89-90, 999 A.2d 450 (2010). Defendant made that demonstration here.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Boutros testified she was not able to open the cash register and, when she ran out of the store, defendant followed her. She was not able to testify whether defendant took the candy bar he was holding with him when he left the store. Under these circumstances, the trial court recognized, and the State confirmed at trial, there was no competent evidence of a theft of money, the Reese\u2019s candy bar or any other item from the victim. Indeed, in denying defendant\u2019s motion for an acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s ease, the court found \u201c[i]t was an <em>attempted </em>robbery.\u201d (Emphasis added). Moreover, during the charge conference, the court also denied defendant\u2019s request that the jury be charged on a lesser-included offense of theft of the Reese\u2019s candy bar defendant allegedly held in his hand when he approached the cash register, because \u201cthere\u2019s no rational basis for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Under those circumstances, the court was required to instruct the jury on the law of attempt as an element of robbery. In accordance with its finding that this matter involved an \u201cattempted robbery\u201d because defendant had not taken anything from the store, the court instructed the jury that the State was required</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO0\">to prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">1) That the defendant was in the course of committing a theft;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-10\">2) That while in the course of committing a theft the defendant threatened another with, or purposely put another in fear, of immediate bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">... I had said the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in the course of committing a theft. In this connection],] you are advised that an act is considered to be in the course of committing a theft <em>if it occurs in an attempt to commit the theft </em>[,] during the theft itself, or in the immediate flight after the attempt or commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">At this point, the Model Jury Charge for \u201cRobbery in the Second Degree\u201d (2009) requires the trial court to \u201cdefine attempt\u201d for the jury \u201c[i]f attempt is involved.\u201d The criminal attempt statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">a. Definition of attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">(1) Purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person would believe them to be;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">(2) When causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing such result without further conduct on his part; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">(3) Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\">b. ... Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under subsection a.(3) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the actor\u2019s criminal purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-1(a)-(b); <em>see also </em>Model Jury Charge for \u201cAttempt\u201d (2009).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">However, the trial court did not provide the required instruction on attempt, with the accompanying definition of this term, to the jury. Instead, it omitted this part of the charge and only instructed the jury as follows on theft, rather than attempted theft:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">Theft is defined as the unlawful taking, or exercise of unlawful control, over <em>property </em>of another with purpose <em>to </em>deprive her thereof. I have used the phrase with purpose. You may hear me use that phrase, or word purposely, again. I shall now explain what it means. A person acts purposely with respect to the nature of his conduct, or as a result thereof, if it is a person\u2019s conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature, or to cause such a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">In addition to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in the course of committing a theft, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that while in the course of committing the theft the defendant threatened another, or purposely put another in fear of immediate bodily injury. The phrase bodily injury means physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition. Although no bodily injury need have resulted, the pi\u2019oseeution must prove that the defendant either threatened the victim with or purposely put the victim in fear of such bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">Should you find the State has failed to prove any of these elements of the crime of robbery beyond a reasonable doubt, you must return a verdict of not guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>robbery. If you find that [the] State has proved every one of these elements of the ciime of robbery then you must find the defendant guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The court did not instruct the jury on the elements of attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">It is well settled that \u201c[a]n essential ingredient of a fair trial is that a jury receive adequate and understandable instructions.\u201d Correct jury instructions are \u2018at the heart of the proper execution of the jury function in a criminal trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Alexander, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>563, 571, 643 A.2d 996 (1994) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">In assessing the propriety of a jury charge, an appellate court examines the entire charge to see whether it was ambiguous or whether it misinformed the jury of the law. <em>State v. R.B., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>308, 324, 873 A.2d 511 (2005). However, a trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to charge the jury on an element of an offense is presumed to be prejudicial error, even in the absence of a request by defense counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Federico, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>169, 176, 510 A.2d 1147 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Under the circumstances of this case, where there was no evidence of an actual theft, the court was required to instruct the jury on the law of attempt as an element of robbery. <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 532-37, 723 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>148, 735 A.2d 573 (petition for certification); <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>148, 735 A.2d 573 (1999) (cross-petition for certification), <em>abrogated on other grounds by State v. Hill, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>545, 565-66, 974 A.2d 403 (2009). The facts in <em>Gonzalez </em>are similar to the facts here. In <em>Gonzalez, </em>a witness testified that the defendant informed him that he intended to rob an \u201colder guy\u201d of his money, rings, and watch. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 723 A.2d 1278. There was conflicting witness testimony about whether the defendant had a gun when he entered an apartment building with the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 530-31, 723 A.2d 1278. The defendant gave an inculpatory statement to police which he recanted at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 531-32,723 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-11\">Despite \u201cthe compelling evidence presented by the State as to [the] defendant\u2019s involvement in this criminal episode, the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>was unable to offer any evidence that the victim ... was actually robbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532-33, 723 A.2d 1278. We held in <em>Gonzalez </em>that the failure to charge attempt in the context of a robbery, where no theft occurred, constituted plain error. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 723 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We perceive no reason to reach a different result here. There was no competent evidence defendant took anything from Boutros. Therefore, the trial court was required to instruct the jury on the elements of attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The State argues that, in view of what it perceives to be overwhelming evidence against defendant, the failure to charge attempt was not plain error. However, we rejected a similar argument in <em>Gonzalez. Id. </em>at 532, 723 A.2d 1278. Moreover, \u201c[ejrroneous instructions are poor candidates for rehabilitation as harmless, and are ordinarily presumed to be reversible error.\u201d <em>Afanador, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 54, 697 A.2d 529. Because the court failed to instruct the jury on a critical element of robbery, defendant\u2019s conviction under count one would need to be reversed even if his right to confrontation had not been infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The flawed instruction on robbery also requires that defendant\u2019s conviction for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose be reversed. We recognize a jury may render inconsistent verdicts so long as there exists a sufficient evidential basis in the record to support the charge on which a defendant is convicted. <em>State v. Banko, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>44, 46, 861 A.2d 110 (2004). In instructing the jury on the weapon charge, however, the judge stated that the State\u2019s contention was \u201cthat the defendant\u2019s unlawful purpose in possessing the weapon was his purpose to use it unlawfully against the person of the other <em>in the course of committing a theft </em>against Antoinette Boutros.\u201d (Emphasis added). As we have held, the court\u2019s instruction on the robbery charge was fundamentally flawed as it pertained to the definition of \u201cin the course of committing a theft.\u201d This error thus infected the court\u2019s subsequent instruction that defendant\u2019s \u201cunlawful purpose in possessing the weapon\u201d was to use it \u201cin the course of committing a theft\u201d against Boutros. Therefore, defendant\u2019s eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>viction on count two would also need to reversed, independent of the violation of defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In light of our disposition, we will not address defendant\u2019s remaining argument that a lesser-included offense should have been presented to the jury. Resolution of that issue is dependent upon the evidence presented at the time of retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
