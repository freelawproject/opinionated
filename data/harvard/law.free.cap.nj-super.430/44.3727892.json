The Legislature added the term by a 2010 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">Appellant Joan I. Silver appeals from a final decision of the Board of Review (Board), which affirmed an Appeal Tribunal determination that she was disqualified for benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(b) because her discharge from employment was for severe misconduct connected with the work. Appellant argues that the Board applied an incorrect legal standard and that, under the correct standard, her conduct did not constitute \u201cmisconduct,\u201d and therefore could not constitute \u201csevere misconduct.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with appellant and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">From February 2002 to February 2011, appellant was a full-time teacher at the Middlesex County Youth Facility. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>beginning of classes, teachers handed out pens to the students. Each pen contained a number and was checked out by a student with the corresponding number identified. At the end of the class, the teacher was required to collect all of the pens and return them to the designated container. As each student returned a pen, the student checked off the number corresponding to the student\u2019s name. The teacher was required to account for all of the pens before the students were released from the classroom. This was important for security purposes because the pens could be used as weapons. It was not uncommon for students to steal or attempt to steal the pens. If it were discovered that a pen was missing, the teacher was required to report this immediately to a security officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On February 23, 2011, appellant had two classes scheduled in the morning. The pen container had places for twelve pens. At the end of her second class, appellant watched the students return their pens and check off their names. She believed every student did so. Because a security officer was anxious to move the students to their next class in order to keep up with the schedule, appellant allowed the students to leave the room before she returned the pens to the container and counted them. When she did so, she realized that one pen was missing. She immediately notified security. The missing pen was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Over the years, appellant had committed this same infraction six previous times, most recently approximately six months before this incident. The record does not reveal the dates of the earlier infractions. After the sixth infraction, she was warned that if it happened one more time, she would be terminated, which she was for the February 23,2011 infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">The deputy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> determined that appellant was disqualified for benefits because her discharge was for severe misconduct. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>lant filed an administrative appeal, and a hearing was conducted by an Appeal Tribunal, at which appellant was the only witness. The appeals examiner upheld the deputy\u2019s determination. Appellant sought further administrative review before the Board. Without discussion, the Board expressed its agreement with the Appeal Tribunal based upon the record and affirmed its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Before setting forth the factual findings of the appeals examiner and the legal standard utilized for finding appellant guilty of severe misconduct, we emphasize that our discussion of the term \u201cmisconduct\u201d applies to unemployment compensation law. We are not defining the scope of \u201cmisconduct,\u201d \u201cgood cause,\u201d or other standard of behavior that may be relevant to termination of employment or other disciplinary action in public or private employment disputes. We deem some historical information necessary as the analytical basis for determining the correct legal standard by which \u201cmisconduct\u201d and \u201csevere misconduct\u201d should be defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">From its inception in 1936 until 2010, New Jersey\u2019s Unemployment Compensation Law has provided for disqualification for benefits for employees discharged for \u201cmisconduct\u201d or \u201cgross misconduct\u201d connected with the work. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21\u20145(b); <em>see L. </em>1936, c. 270, \u00a7 5. The statute defines \u201cgross misconduct\u201d as \u201can act punishable as a crime of the first, second, third or fourth degree,\u201d but it does not define the term \u201cmisconduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Appropriately, the sanctions for gross misconduct are greater than for simple misconduct. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In 2010, the Legislature added a third category in section 5(b), \u201csevere misconduct.\u201d <em>L. </em>2010, c. 37, \u00a7 2, eff. July 1, 2010. As we will explain, this was intended as an intermediate form of misconduct, requiring greater culpability than simple misconduct, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>less than gross misconduct, and with an intermediate level of disqualification from collecting unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The amendatory provision does not define severe misconduct, but contains a non-exclusive list of examples. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>43:21\u20145(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In 1956, our Supreme Court held that employees were guilty of misconduct for engaging in a work stoppage, in violation of a no-strike clause in their collective bargaining agreement, which provided that the employer shall immediately discharge any employee in violation of the clause. <em>Bogue Elect. Co. v. Bd. of Review, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>431, 433-34, 122 A.2d 615 (1956). Without attempting to define \u201cmisconduct\u201d broadly, the Court held that a deliberate breach of the collective bargaining agreement could not be deemed a circumstance causing involuntary unemployment, the hazard intended by the Legislature to be protected against, and thus, within the spirit and policy of the unemployment law, it constituted misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 436, 122 A.2d 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">A few months later, a panel of this court was confronted with a similar situation, in which employees were fired as a result of a work stoppage, but in which the collective bargaining agreement did not contain a no-strike provision. <em>Beaunit Mills, Inc. v. Bd. of Review, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 176-80, 128 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1956), <em>certif. denied, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>579, 130 A.2d 89 (1957). Because of that material factual distinction, the panel was required to define \u201cmisconduct\u201d within the meaning of the unemployment law. It did so thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">What does the statutory misconduct signify? Obviously it cannot mean \u201cmere mistakes, errors in judgment or in the exercise of discretion, or minor but casual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>unintentional carelessness or negligence, and similar minor peccadilloes.\u201d It cannot mean mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure of performance as the result of inability or incapacity, inadvertence in isolated instances, or good faith errors of judgment. <em>Boynton Cab Co. v. Neubeck, </em>237 <em>Wis. </em>249, 296 <em>N.W. </em>636 (1941); <em>Kempfer, \u201cDisqualifications for Voluntary Leaving &amp; Misconduct,\u201d </em>55 <em>Yale Law J. </em>147, 162-166 (1945). In our opinion, the statement in <em>48 Am.Jur., Social Security, Unemployment Compensation, etc., </em>\u00a7 38 at 541 (1943), suggests the fair intendment of the statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cMisconduct within the meaning of an unemployment compensation act excluding from its benefits an employee discharged for misconduct must be an act of wanton or willful disregard of the employer\u2019s interest, a deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s rules, a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or negligence in such degree or reoccurrence as to manifest culpability, wrongful intent, or evil design, or show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer\u2019s interest or of the employee\u2019s duties and obligations to the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 182-83.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Applying those principles, we held that, because the employees \u201cwere engaged in a concerted activity in good faith for their mutual aid and protection,\u201d and with an \u201cabsence of evil intent or willful desire to injure the employer,\u201d under all of the circumstances, the employees were not guilty of misconduct connected with the work within the meaning of section 5(b). <em>Id. </em>at 183, 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Subsequent case law, although sparse, has made clear that the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard for defining misconduct is not limited to a literal and isolated reading of the <em>Am.Jur. </em>passage quoted above. The definition also includes the discussion in <em>Beaunit Mills </em>preceding the <em>Am.Jur. </em>passage we have also quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">In <em>Demech v. Board of Review, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super </em>35, 400 A.2d 502 (App.Div.1979), we considered conduct in which a supermarket employee threw a twenty-five pound meat roast at a co-employee out of frustration and anger caused by his inappropriate conduct toward her. <em>Id. </em>at 36-38, 400 A.2d 502. The Board found that the employee\u2019s termination for that incident constituted misconduct because it \u201cwas a disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of its employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 400 A.2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>While that finding might have satisfied the <em>Am.Jur. </em>definition cited in <em>Beaunit Mills, </em>we disagreed and found that the employee\u2019s conduct did not constitute misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39, 400 A.2d 502. Citing <em>Beaunit Mills, </em>we explained that \u201c[jjudicial attempts to imbue the term with substantive meaning have ... insisted upon the ingredients of wilfulness, deliberateness and intention if an employee\u2019s act is to qualify as misconduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because the employee\u2019s conduct was provoked by the co-employee, was unthinking and spontaneous, and was not intended to and did not cause injury to the co-employee, it did not qualify as misconduct under the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard. <em>Ibid. </em>We concluded: \u201cAll that the statute undertakes to penalize is deliberate and willful disregard of standards of conduct an employer has a right to expect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 400 A.2d 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The critical distinction between intentional and deliberate conduct on the one hand and negligent or inadvertent conduct on the other was brought into sharp focus in a case decided by a divided panel of this court in <em>Smith v. Board of Review, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 658 A.2d 310 (App.Div.1995). In that case, a hospital orderly was fired for misconduct because he brought food to a pre-surgery patient, contrary to oral instructions from a nurse that he not do so. <em>Id. </em>at 428, 658 A.2d 310. The Board found this conduct to be \u201ca willful disregard of the employer\u2019s best interest,\u201d thus constituting misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 430, 658 A.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The majority agreed, and, applying the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard, held that the record supported the Board\u2019s finding of a deliberate refusal to comply with the employer\u2019s work rules. <em>Id. </em>at 431-33, 658 A.2d 310. The dissenting member also applied the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard, but would have reversed because, in his view, the evidence was not sufficient to support a willful disregard of the employer\u2019s policies, but only negligent conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 438, 658 A.2d 310 (Brochin, J.A.D., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">In <em>Parks v. Board of Review, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. </em>252, 255, 963 A.2d 1245 (App.Div.2009), we again emphasized the need for deliberate or intentional conduct, this time for an employee who was fired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>because of excessive absenteeism, based on four absences. Although all of the absences were occasioned by family illnesses or emergencies, the Board found that misconduct was established because, after being warned, the employee\u2019s further absenteeism constituted a disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer had a right to expect. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 963 A.2d 1245. Again, this could satisfy one of the disjunctive alternatives set forth in the <em>AmJur. </em>passage quoted in <em>Beaunit Mills.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">However, we discussed the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard in broader terms, noting that misconduct \u201cmust be more than simply inadequate job performance that provides good cause for discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 963 A.2d 1245. After quoting the <em>AmJur. </em>passage and citing <em>Beaunit Mills, </em>we stated: \u201cThus, disqualification under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(b) is warranted only when the employee\u2019s conduct that resulted in his or her discharge had \u2018the ingredients of wilfulness, deliberateness and intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Demech, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 400 A.2d 502) (citing <em>Smith, supra, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 433-34, 658 A.2d 310). We therefore concluded that, because the employee\u2019s absences were the result of excusable circumstances, they could not meet the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard of deliberate or intentional violations of the employer\u2019s rules. <em>Id. </em>at 256, 963 A.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">In the only other reported decisions of which we are aware dealing with the definition of misconduct, intentional acts of insubordination were deemed to constitute misconduct under section 5(b). <em>Borowinski v. Bd. of Review, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>242, 246, 787 A.2d 902 (App.Div.2001); <em>Broderick v. Bd. of Review, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 31, 335 A.2d 67 (App.Div.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Apparently mindful of this line of eases, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (Department) promulgated a rule in 2003 defining misconduct as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">For an act to constitute misconduct, it must be improper, intentional, connected with one\u2019s work, malicious, and within the individual\u2019s control, and is either a deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s rules or a disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of an employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>[N.J.AC. </em>12:17-10.2(a).[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">By its plain terms, this rule prescribes a two-prong standard to establish misconduct. First, the conduct must be improper, intentional, connected with the work, malicious, <em>and </em>within the employee\u2019s control. Second, the conduct must <em>also </em>be either a deliberate violation of the employer\u2019s rules or a disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">This test is more stringent than the <em>Am.Jur. </em>passage quoted in <em>Beaunit Mills. </em>It incorporates the other features of the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>analysis, as further elucidated and reiterated in subsequent case law. And, <em>Beaunit Mills </em>built upon a foundation laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Bogue, </em>the rationale of which hinged upon the incongruity of allowing benefits to \u201ca group of employees [who] <em>deliberately </em>violate a [clearly important] basic provision of a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Bogue, supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>at 436, 122 A.2d 615 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">Because <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:17-10.2(a) is the agency\u2019s own rule, it constitutes the controlling authority for disposition of claims based on misconduct. <em>Besler &amp; Co. v. Bradley, </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168,173-74, 824 A.2d 289 (App.Div.2003); <em>Venuti v. Cape May Cnty. Bd. of Appeals, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 554-55, 555 A.2d 1175 (App.Div. 1989); <em>see also N.J.AC. </em>12:17-1.1(c) (stating that the provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to all employers and to all workers who file unemployment insurance claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The 2010 amendment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-5(b) added a new severe misconduct provision, placed between the paragraphs dealing with simple misconduct and gross misconduct. The first sentence of the new paragraph prescribed the disqualification penalties applicable for an employee suspended or discharged for severe misconduct. No definition was given for severe misconduct, but the second and final sentence of the new paragraph gave examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Examples of severe misconduct include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: repeated violations of an employer\u2019s rule or policy, repeated lateness or absences after a written warning by an employer, falsification of records, physical assault or threats that do not constitute gross misconduct as defined in this section, misuse of benefits, misuse of sick time, abuse of leave, theft of company property, excessive use of intoxicants or drugs on work premises, theft of time, or where the behavior is malicious and deliberate but is not considered gross misconduct as defined in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>43:21-5(b), as amended by <em>L. </em>2010, c. 37, \u00a7 2, eff. July 1, 2010.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">This amendment was not part of the original bill passed by the Legislature. It was added to that bill in response to Governor Chris Christie\u2019s conditional veto message, which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">It is time for the State to achieve comprehensive reform in the State\u2019s unemployment compensation system in order to bring the [Unemployment Insurance Trust F]und back to solvency in a fair and balanced way. There is a broad consensus that the current statutory framework for our treatment of misconduct eases is not in line with the practices of a majority of other states. Under the current statutory structure about 90 percent of the misconduct cases have the same penalty without regard to the individual\u2019s level of misconduct. This treatment is not balanced. I am advised that by redefining \u201cmisconduct\u201d by carving out a \u201csevere misconduct\u201d tier, as well as creating a more proportional unemployment benefit penalty structure, the individuals seeking unemployment insurance would be treated more equitably, and the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund would realize a significant savings each year. In this regard, I believe it would be equitable to reform this section of the law to ensure that the penalty for the misconduct is treated proportionately to the level of misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">Moreover, I will advise the Department of Labor &amp; Workforce Development to change any regulations that are not consistent with the above recommendation, and, also, to propose appropriate regulations to require that an employer provide written documentation to show that the employee\u2019s actions constitute either misconduct, severe misconduct, or gross misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">[Governor\u2019s Conditional Veto Message, S1813, <em>L. </em>2010, c. 37.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">The Department has not yet adopted new regulations to distinguish simple misconduct from severe misconduct. It first made an effort to do so with a proposed rule amendment issued November 15, 2010. 42 <em>N.J.R. </em>2712(a). However, the proposed rule was never adopted and it expired, as referenced by the second effort, which is now underway, by virtue of a different proposed rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>amendment issued January 7, 2013. 45 <em>N.J.R. </em>19(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Until any new definition is promulgated by rule, the definition contained in the present version of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17-10.2(a) controls, except to the extent it is superseded by the 2010 amendment of the statute. The regulation, of course, pertains only to simple misconduct. However, it seems to us fundamental that the term \u201cmisconduct,\u201d should have the same meaning throughout <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(b) and its implementing regulation. <em>Commerce Bancorp, Inc. v. InterArch, Inc., </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 336-37, 9 A.3d 1056 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Two of the examples of severe misconduct listed in the 2010 amendment describe, if read literally, conduct that would not necessarily be deliberate, intentional, or malicious (\u201crepeated violations of an employer\u2019s rule or policy,\u201d and \u201crepeated lateness or absences after a written warning\u201d). However, in light of the history we have described, it is obvious that the Governor and Legislature intended to create severe misconduct as a gap-filler between simple misconduct and gross misconduct. It would make no sense to allow for conduct with a lower level of culpability (such as mere inadvertence or negligence) to qualify as severe misconduct and carry with it a harsher sanction than simple misconduct. Such a result would be absurd and clearly contrary to the legislative intent, as expressly set forth in the Governor\u2019s Conditional Veto Message. S1813, <em>L. </em>2010, <em>c. </em>37.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Therefore, we must construe these two examples of severe misconduct as requiring acts done intentionally, deliberately, and with malice. Because these two examples of severe misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>require repeated violations, such a construction would render the conduct more egregious than simple misconduct, which could result from a single such violation committed intentionally and with malice. We understand \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cmalicious\u201d as used in the regulation to include deliberate disregard of the employer\u2019s rules or policies, or deliberate disregard of the standards of behavior that the employer has the right to expect of an employee. This interpretation comports with the amended statutory scheme, which lists three levels of misconduct, each dependent upon the employee\u2019s relative degree of culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We do not know what amendatory rules the Department will ultimately adopt. The rulemaking process is now ongoing. Whatever newly promulgated rules may apply to future cases, they will have no applicability to this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Appellant does not dispute that her conduct, after the prior infractions and warning, provided her employer with just cause to terminate her for poor work performance. The issue is whether she committed misconduct within the meaning of the unemployment law. Appellant has at all times candidly admitted that the missing pen was her fault and a result of her mistake. At the Appeal Tribunal hearing, she made this statement at the end of her testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">I want you to know that was an honest mistake on my part that I would never, ever ... [fail] to report anything____ I would never consider this misconduct and I always respected every incident regardless of how minor they may seem and that I had neglected to follow rules and procedures____I counted my pens, checking and double checking before and after each class if I had the time which I usually did and I\u2019m also the art teacher and I had more materials than other teacher[s] there. This has happened to other teachers also. I had pens, pencils, markers and other things and I also did the testing and I had pens there Tuesday and Thursday mornings. The truth is that despite my precautions ... [the students] take advantage of me and they were faster than me and they found ways to distract me. I mean these are criminals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>The appeals examiner set forth as the controlling definition of misconduct the <em>AmJur. </em>passage quoted in <em>Beaunit Mills. </em>The appeals examiner then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">The claimant\u2019s action in violating procedure, which was the cause of the discharge, was a disregard of the standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employees and constitutes misconduct connected with the work. In this case at hand, while there is little doubt the claimant was a conscientious employee, her action of failing to ensure she had all twelve (12) pens before releasing the class was a violation of the established procedures in place. The claimant possibly did not have control over a pen she did not issue to a student, but it was within her control to comply with all aspects of the employer\u2019s procedures. She was aware she should have accounted for all pens before releasing the children and her failure to do so rose to a level of misconduct as defined above. Additionally, as the claimant was on a final warning for the same infraction, her actions constitute severe misconduct connected to the work. Therefore, the claimant is disqualified for benefits under <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-5(b), as of 02/20/2011 as she was discharged for severe misconduct connected with the work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Nowhere in the decision of the Appeal Tribunal is there any mention of <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:17-10.2(a), and its requirement that the conduct be intentional, deliberate, and malicious. That regulation is also conspicuously absent from the employer\u2019s appellate brief and the statement in lieu of brief filed on behalf of the Board in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The factual findings of the appeals examiner, adopted by the Board, do not include a finding of intentional or deliberate conduct or malicious intent. Nor did the appeals examiner find that appellant intentionally or deliberately disregarded the employer\u2019s rule for collecting pens after a class. Indeed, the record would not support such a finding. The repetitive violation of a rule, policy, or standard of conduct may justify a reasonable inference that the employee\u2019s disregard was deliberate and in that sense malicious. However, appellant explained the circumstances of her failure to account for all the pens, and the employer did not refute her assertion that she was trying to comply with the rule. She was simply unable to do so. It is clear to us, as it apparently was to the appeals examiner and the Board, that appellant\u2019s conduct was a result of negligence or inadvertence, not intentional or deliberate disregard of the employer\u2019s rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>To find misconduct, the agency relied on the portion of the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard contained in the <em>Am.Jur. </em>passage. In our view, that fragmented approach has never been what was intended by <em>Beaunit Mills, </em>as described in our subsequent opinions, and reliance on it constituted legal error. Under the correct <em>Beaunit Mills </em>analysis, appellant\u2019s conduct did not constitute misconduct because it lacked the requisite elements of wilfulness, deliberateness, intention, and malice. More important, her conduct did not satisfy the agency\u2019s own definition of misconduct, which is controlling, and which, in our view, appears to have been designed to express the entire <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">As we have stated, appellant was found to have committed not only misconduct, but severe misconduct. Because we have concluded that, under the controlling legal definition, there was no misconduct, of necessity there could be no severe misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We recognize our limited standard of review of a final agency decision. We will not upset such a decision unless it was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or violated legislative policies expressed or implied in the act governing the agency. <em>Campbell v. Dep\u2019t of Civil Serv., </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>556, 562, 189 A.2d 712 (1963). As a reviewing court, while we respect an agency\u2019s expertise, ultimately the interpretation of statutes and regulations is a judicial, not administrative, function and we are not bound by the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>Mayflower Secs. Co. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In this case, the Board has ignored its own regulation defining \u201cmisconduct.\u201d Instead, it applied its view of the <em>Beaunit Mills </em>standard, which, for the reasons we have explained, was erroneous. We therefore conclude that the legal error underpinning the Board\u2019s action rendered its action arbitrary and contrary to the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-14\"> Appellant also argues that she was denied due process in connection with the Appeal Tribunal hearing.
