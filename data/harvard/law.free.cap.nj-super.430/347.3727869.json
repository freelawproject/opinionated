The funds were apparently recovered by the creditor in an action he brought in Florida against both the debtor and a Florida corporation that owed the debtor money. The debtor hired counsel to represent it after the creditor obtained judgment against the debtor in New Jersey. When the creditor sought to collect on the judgment by bringing the suit in Florida against the Florida corporation, the debtor entered into a \u201ccontingency agreement\u201d with its counsel for representation respecting the \u201cunlawful retention\u201d of money owed by the Florida corporation. The agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ment provided for a fee based on a percentage of \u201cmoney recovered for\u201d the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We reverse the orders of the Law Division releasing the disputed funds to debtor\u2019s former counsel and remand the matter to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Slava Kornilov (Kornilov), a New Jersey resident, purchased two diamonds from East West Precious Metals of New York, Inc. (East West) for $245,865. When Kornilov did not receive the diamonds, he filed suit in Bergen County against East West seeking damages and injunctive relief (the New Jersey Action). Kornilov moved for default judgment after East West failed to answer or otherwise move with respect to the complaint. Kornilov\u2019s motion was granted on January 8, 2010, and the court ordered East West to give the diamonds to Kornilov within ten days, failing which Kornilov would be entitled to \u201cplace a hold\u201d of $245,865 \u201c[o]n any bank account held by East West in a Constructive Trust [sic]----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Two weeks later, after East West failed to deliver the diamonds, Kornilov filed a verified complaint in the Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida (the Florida Action) upon discovering East West was owed $253,972.33 by a Florida corporation, Republic Metals Corporation, Inc. (Republic). East West was also named as a party defendant in the Florida Action, which sought to recover and impose a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d for the benefit of Kornilov on the money Republic owed to East West.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">East West had earlier retained Schepisi &amp; McLaughlin, P.A. (Schepisi) on an hourly basis to represent it in the New Jersey Action. Apparently, after learning of the pendency of the Florida Action, East West signed a second agreement with Schepisi agreeing to pay Schepisi a contingent legal fee based upon a percentage of \u201cmoney recovered\u201d for East West on the \u201cunlawful retention\u201d of money \u201cdue and owing\u201d by Republic. By the time the agreement was entered, the Florida complaint had already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>been filed. Schepisi never entered an appearance in the Florida Action, although a Florida lawyer, Aaron Resnick, did file a \u201cNotice of Limited Appearance\u201d on behalf of East West in order to permit him to attend a status conference in that action scheduled for March 4, 2010. Further, the record does not contain a copy of any pleadings or cross-claims filed by East West in the Florida Action, if, indeed, any were filed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">After Kornilov brought the Florida Action against Republic and East West, East West filed a motion in New Jersey to vacate the order of January 8, 2010. Shortly thereafter, Kornilov, East West and Republic reached a settlement in the Florida Action whereby Republic agreed to pay the money it owed and forward $253,972.33 to New Jersey counsel. A stipulation filed in the Florida action recited that Kornilov had commenced the action to establish a \u201cconstructive trust\u201d on the money Republic owed to East West and that while Republic \u201cha[d] no interest\u201d in the money, it \u201c[could not] safely\u201d abide by an order in the New Jersey Action until that order was \u201cdomesticated in the State of Florida.\u201d The parties then stipulated that Republic would be released from further liability upon paying over the funds as agreed. The Florida Circuit Court dismissed the Florida Action on April 19, 2010, but \u201cretained] jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">An order was entered in the New Jersey Action on March 10, 2010, vacating the order of January 8, 2010, and requiring Republic to transfer $253,972.33 to Sehepisi\u2019s attorney trust account, out of which $245,865 was to be held in escrow in that trust account pending further order of the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The same day, East West filed its answer to the complaint in the New Jersey Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Thereafter, Kornilov and East West filed cross-motions in the New Jersey Action to release the funds from Schepisi\u2019s attorney trust account to each party. The motion court denied both motions on June 30, 2010, and denied East West\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>reconsideration on October 5, 2010. On December 3, 2010, an order was entered relieving Schepisi as counsel for East West in the New Jersey Action, after East West represented to Schepisi that it could no longer pay its legal fees, and ordering an \u201cattorney\u2019s charging lien on any sums received\u201d by East West. The order provided that the amounts due Schepisi would be determined by the court at the end of trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Following Schepisi\u2019s withdrawal as counsel, East West retained LoFaro &amp; Reiser, LLP (LoFaro). LoFaro negotiated a settlement of the New Jersey Action between East West and Kornilov whereby East West agreed to pay Kornilov the sum of $245,865 and Schepisi would be required to transfer that amount from its attorney trust account to the trust account of Kornilov\u2019s attorneys, Gambourg &amp; Borsen, LLC (Gambourg). On February 10, 2011, LoFaro forwarded Schepisi a consent order dated February 9, 2011, entered by the court and executed by both Kornilov and East West, memorializing these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In response, Schepisi filed an order to show cause and a verified complaint against LoFaro and East West as defendants, and Kornilov and Gambourg as \u201cinterested parties,\u201d seeking to vacate the consent order. The verified complaint asserted that East West and LoFaro obtained the February 9, 2011, consent order through \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d and thereby impaired Sehepisi\u2019s right to collect fees from East West \u201carising out of the charging lien and contingency agreement.\u201d In a second count, Schepisi claimed it was owed a contingency fee on the $253,972.33. Later, Schepisi dismissed its claims against LoFaro \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Prior to the adjourned return date of the Order to Show Cause, the parties executed a consent order dated April 7, 2011, whereby Schepisi agreed to release $141,671.30 from its attorney trust account to Gambourg. The remaining funds-$104,193.70-were to stay in Sehepisi\u2019s attorney trust account pending further court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>order. The $104,193.70 represented attorney\u2019s fees Sehepisi claimed East West owed the firm as a result of its representation of East West in the Florida Action and the New Jersey Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On April 12, 2011, the court ordered that the remainder of the funds in Schepisi\u2019s attorney trust account be released to Sehepisi pursuant to the \u201ccontingent fee agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a written rider to the order, the motion judge explained that \u201cSehepisi ... successfully resolved\u201d the Florida Action and \u201c[t]he issue now is whether the settlement, memorialized in the consent order, can be fully complied with\u201d in view of the dispute over Schepisi\u2019s claim of entitlement to collect its contingency fee from the funds. The motion judge acknowledged Kornilov\u2019s argument that Sehepisi \u201cperformed very little work\u201d in the Florida action, but concluded that \u201cthe December 3, 2010, order and the contingent fee agreement demonstrate that Sehepisi\u201d is entitled to payment of its claimed contingent fee. The motion judge added that the February 9, 2011 consent order \u201ccannot be used to subvert the contingency fee agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AX7\">Kornilov filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Kornilov contends that the funds in the attorney trust account belong to him pursuant to the settlement of the New Jersey Action and consent order executed by the court. Kornilov further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>argues that the motion judge erred by failing to abide by the requirements of the Attorney Lien Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:13-5, and <em>Rule </em>1:20A-6. Specifically, Kornilov contends that no valid attorney\u2019s lien existed because: (1) the trial court did not have jurisdiction to establish an attorney\u2019s lien because Schepisi failed to file its lawsuit to recover a fee in the forum where the lien arose; (2) there was no final recovery by East West to which an attorney\u2019s lien could attach; and (3) Schepisi failed to provide East West with a Pre-Action Notice in accordance with <em>Rule </em>1:20A-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Schepisi argues that it is entitled to 33-1/3% of the funds in its attorney trust account based on the contingent fee agreement associated with the work it performed for East West. Schepisi further maintains that Kornilov has failed to demonstrate that (1) the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable; (2) the trial court failed to consider all probative evidence; or (3) there are new facts that were not known at the time of the prior order which may be relevant to this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">We begin by setting forth general principles that govern liens. Until recently, our courts have recognized \u201ctwo forms of liens for the collection of fees, the charging (or special) lien and the retaining lien.\u201d Michels, <em>New Jersey Attorney Ethics </em>\u00a7 37:2-2a at 910 (2013).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">The common-law charging lien is for \u201cservices rendered in a particular cause of action and ... attaches to the judgment in the cause for which the services were rendered.\u201d <em>Brauer v. Hotel Assocs., Inc., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>415, 420, 192 A.2d 831 (1963) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 <em>U.S. </em>944, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>2077, 18 L.Ed.2d 1330 (1967). The charging lien is \u201ca right recognized at common law as rooted in equitable considerations, although not a lien in the true sense of a right resting in the possession, actual or constructive, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the thing upon which it operates.\u201d <em>Republic Factors, Inc. v. Carteret Work Uniforms, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>525, 534, 133 A.2d 6 (1957) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">It has been termed as \u201c \u2018merely a claim to the equitable intervention of the court\u2019 for the attorney\u2019s \u2018protection, when, having obtained judgment for his client, there is a probability of the client depriving him of his costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). <em>Accord Cole, Schotz, Bernstein, Meisel &amp; Forman, P.A v. Owens, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>453, 460, 679 A.2d 155 (App.Div.1996) (citation omitted) (stating same). In other words, the common-law charging lien \u201cis a judicial device to protect the attorney\u2019s rights where he has been unable to get possession; to this end the attorney is considered an equitable assignee of the judgment to the extent of his debt.\u201d <em>Republic Factors, supra, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>at 534, 133 A.2d 6 (citations omitted). <em>Accord Horowitz v.

Jay Parrino\u2019s the Mint, L.L.C., </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>133, 139, 796 A.2d 866 (2002) (quoting <em>Martin v. Martin, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super </em>212, 222, 762 A.2d 246 (App.Div.2000) (citation omitted)). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:13-5 provides, in pertinent part, that an attorney appearing for a client in any action asserting a claim, \u201cshall have a lien for compensation, upon his client\u2019s [claim]\u201d which shall attach to any \u201cverdict, report, decision, award, judgment or final order in his [or her] client\u2019s favor, and the proceeds thereof in whosesoever hands they may come.\u201d <em>See also </em>Michels, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 37:2-2(b)(2) at 912-14 (describing expansive character of lien).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The statute\u2019s reach, however, is not unlimited. <em>Musikoff, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 139, 796 A.2d 866. There is no authorization for \u201can attorney\u2019s lien to be asserted for post-judgment legal services.\u201d <em>Panarello v. Panarello, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>318, 322, 585 A.2d 428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>(Ch.Div.1990). <em>Cf. Steiger v. Armellino, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>176, 180, 716 A.2d 1216 (Ch.Div.1998) (holding that the statute did not prevent a lien from attaching to a subsequent matter that stemmed from original pleadings).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]here there is no recovery, there is nothing to which the attorney\u2019s lien can attach.\u201d <em>Cole, Schotz, supra, 292 N.J.Super. </em>at 460, 679 A.2d 155. <em>See also Wheeler v. Wheeler, </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 508, 145 A.2d 796 (App.Div.1958) (holding the statute \u201cby its very terms [was] not applicable since plaintiff recovered nothing to which her attorney\u2019s lien could attach\u201d); <em>Cole v. Cole, </em>30 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 435-38, 104 A.2d 866 (Ch.Div.1954) (where the parties reconciled, there was no decree favorable to either party and, therefore, no valid charging hen could be asserted by the attorney).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">After the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:13-5, we noted that the statute did not set out a specific procedure for determining and enforcing an attorney\u2019s lien. <em>H. &amp; H. Ranch Homes, Inc. v. Smith, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>347, 353, 148 A.2d 837 (App.Div.1959). We then devised the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">The attorney should make application to the court, as a step in the proceeding of the main cause, by way of petition, which shall set forth the facts upon which he relies for the determination and enforcement of his alleged lien. The petition shall as well request the court to establish a schedule for further proceedings which shall include time limitations for the filing of an answer by defendants, the completion of pretrial discovery proceedings, the holding of a pretrial conference, and the trial. The court shall, by order, set a short day upon which it will consider the application for the establishment of a schedule. A copy of such order, together with a copy of the petition, shall be served upon defendants as directed by the court. The matter should thereafter proceed as a plenary suit and be tried either with or without a jury, in the Law Division____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">[Ibid.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">This procedure must be considered in light of <em>Rule </em>l:20A-6, \u201cPre-Action Notice to Client,\u201d which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-11\">No lawsuit to recover a fee may be filed until the expiration of the 30 day period herein giving Pre-Action Notice to a client; however, this shall not prevent a lawyer from instituting any ancillary legal action____The notice shall specifically advise the client of the right to request fee arbitration and ... that if the client does not promptly communicate with the Fee Committee secretary and file the approved form of request for fee arbitration within 30 days after receiving pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>action notice by the lawyer, the client shall lose the right to initiate fee arbitration. The attorney\u2019s complaint shall allege the giving of the notice required by this rule or it shall be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">In <em>Cole, Schotz, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 459, 679 A.2d 155, we held an attorney\u2019s lien invalid when the plaintiff \u201cmoved for the imposition of a lien instead of filing a complaint or giving Pre-Action Notice.\u201d This is because a client should have the opportunity to request fee arbitration under the Rules. In that case, the fee arbitration committee determines the amount of the attorney\u2019s lien. <em>R. </em>1:20A-3. If the client does not request fee arbitration, the court will conduct a plenary hearing in order to resolve the lien dispute. <em>Cole, Schotz, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 458, 679 A.2d 155. The Pre-Action Notice requirement applies to a petition to establish an attorney\u2019s lien as well as to a complaint for attorney\u2019s fees. New Jersey law is clear that in the absence of compliance with the Rule, such a petition must be dismissed. <em>Mateo v. Mateo, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 79, 656 A.2d 846 (App.Div. 1995) (citing <em>Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 570 A.2d 1026 (Ch.Div.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">With these principles guiding our analysis, we reverse the orders of April 12 and June 13, 2011, and remand the matter to the Law Division for further proceedings. It appears that Sehepisi failed to comply with our court rules governing charging hens, and, further, in these circumstances, the terms of the contingency fees may not provide the proper measure of Schepisi\u2019s compensation, assuming Schepisi is entitled to any compensation at all. An evidentiary hearing is required to resolve these issues and to ascertain what, if any, services Schepisi performed that would warrant a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">Initially, we observe that a substantial question exists as to the validity of the \u201ccharging hen\u201d in view of Schepisi\u2019s apparent failure to comply with <em>Rule </em>1:20A-6. <em>Cole, Schotz, supra, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 458, 679 A.2d 155. Also, we are uncertain whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Schepisi ever filed a \u201cpleading containing a ... cross-claim\u201d on behalf of East West in the Florida Action. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2A:13-5. The hen arises on the filing of a claim, attaches to the judgment or recovery, and does not depend on the attorney actually conducting the trial. <em>H. &amp; H., supra, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 352, 148 A.2d 837. It is not affected by a settlement and is not terminated by the consensual substitution of counsel. <em>Ibid. </em>Under the statute, attorneys \u201care entitled to a lien as of the date of the filing of the complaint, which lien cannot be affected by a settlement between the parties.\u201d <em>Guernsey v. Young, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>339, 340, 139 A.2d 799 (Ch.Div.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">There appears to be no verdict, report, decision, award, decree, judgment or final order in East West\u2019s favor in either the New Jersey Action or the Florida Action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2A:13-5. The order permitting Schepisi to withdraw from representation stated only that Schepisi would have an attorney\u2019s charging hen \u201con any sums received by ... East West____\u201d With the exception of the $8,287.33, being the difference between the $253,972.33 that was transferred from Repubhc to Schepisi\u2019s attorney trust account and the $245,685 that was to be released to Kornilov pursuant to the February 9, 2011 consent order, East West appears to have received no funds as a result of either the New Jersey Action or the Florida Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Moreover, the Court in <em>Musikoff, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 146, 796 A.2d 866, specifically \u201caffirm[ed] the basic elements of the process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>articulated in <em>H. &amp; H., </em>except ... [it did] not interpret the process to require an attorney to file and enforce a lien petition prior to settlement or judgment of the underlying action.\u201d This procedure requires, at the very least, a plenary hearing to resolve relevant, factual disputes. Here, a factual dispute exists as to the extent of the services performed by Schepisi, if any, in the Florida Action pursuant to the contingency fee agreement, and whether, in these circumstances, East West \u201crecovered\u201d anything at all against which Sehepisi\u2019s fee claim would attach. All of these issues require a plenary hearing, which was not undertaken here. <em>H. &amp; H., supra, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 353, 148 A.2d 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Kornilov instituted the Florida Action upon discovery that Republic owed East West funds in Florida. The Florida Action sought to sequester funds to satisfy a Writ of Execution obtained by Kornilov against East West in the New Jersey Action. It was Kornilov, not Schepisi or its client East West, who initiated suit for collection of funds in Florida. In fact, East West was a defendant in the Florida Action and Schepisi did not appear of record as counsel for East West in the Florida Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Kornilov, as plaintiff, appears to have successfully obtained the funds in Florida, and, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the funds were transferred to Schepisi\u2019s attorney trust account. This settlement agreement was intended to make Kornilov whole, after East West allegedly took $245,865 from Kornilov but failed to deliver the diamonds. Schepisi then moved to be relieved as counsel before the trial on the Kornilov claim. East West thereafter settled with Kornilov by agreeing to pay $245,865 to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Having arguably recovered nothing for East West, Schepisi would not be entitled to recover its contingent legal fee from the money recovered from Republic by the efforts of Kornilov. The assertion of a \u201ccharging lien\u201d on funds Schepisi did not recover does not create entitlement to fees it was not entitled to receive in the first instance. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 508, 145 A.2d 796. Moreover, to the extent Schepisi is owed any money by East <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>West, Sehepisi would have had to pursue such fees from East West pursuant to a proceeding that complies with <em>Rule </em>1:20A-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Finally, having successfully moved to be relieved as counsel in the New Jersey Action, we question whether the contingency agreement remains the proper measure of Schepisi\u2019s entitlement to compensation, even assuming it can show it actually \u201crecovered\u201d money \u201con behalf of\u2019 East West.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">An attorney hired on a contingent fee basis and later discharged before completion of the services is not entitled to recover fees on the basis of such contingent agreement; instead, he or she may be entitled to recover on a <em>quantum meruit </em>basis for the reasonable value of the sei-viees rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\"><em>[Glick v.
