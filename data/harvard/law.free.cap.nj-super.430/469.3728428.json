We conclude, therefore, that the judge did not abuse her discretion, and affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In October 2006, plaintiff filed a complaint against her former employer, defendant University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ), and supervisors Rameshwar Sharma, Ph.D., and Dr. Duda. She alleged employment discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation in violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (the LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -49.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Plaintiff alleged the following facts in her complaint, most of which defendants disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In 2000, UMDNJ employed plaintiff as a post-doctoral fellow, and she received positive evaluations for approximately five years. In January 2005, plaintiff notified Drs. Sharma and Duda that she was pregnant and they began to harass and discriminate against her. For example, in April 2005, plaintiff discovered that Drs. Sharma and Duda published an article without recognizing her work effort, and when plaintiff questioned them about the article, Drs. Sharma and Duda threatened to terminate her if she complained publicly; and, in May 2005, Dr. Duda criticized plaintiffs work as being too slow, and pressured her that work-related stress could cause a premature birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">After giving birth, plaintiff remained home pursuant to UMDNJ\u2019s medical leave policy. When she returned to work in October 2005, Dr. Sharma allegedly told her that \u201c[y]ou cannot be a mommy and a scientist at the same time.\u201d In October 2005, plaintiff suffered from anxiety, depression, and marital problems. In January 2006, plaintiff filed an internal discrimination complaint with UMDNJ\u2019s Office of Affirmative Action/EEO, and in September 2006, UMDNJ terminated her. She found new employment five months later. Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages for her emotional distress, and asserted a lost wage claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Defense counsel deposed plaintiff on four separate days between August 2008 and April 2010. At her first deposition, plaintiff appeared with a folder that she had not produced in discovery containing notes that she had made \u201cafter every accusation\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Drs. Sharma and Duda, and she attempted to consult those notes during the proceeding. After an off-the-record conversation with her counsel, plaintiff produced the notes and the deposition continued, but the proceeding was interrupted by other off-the-record consultations between plaintiff and her counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties were unable to complete the deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">In March 2009, plaintiff appeared for her second deposition and expressed an unwillingness to answer questions and provide discovery. For example, regarding her immigration status, she testified that she applied for a green card as an independent researcher, but refused to give to defense counsel the name of her immigration attorney. Plaintiffs counsel stated, \u201cI\u2019m leaving the ultimate decision as to whether she\u2019s going to provide the information up to her. I\u2019ve explained the risks and ramifications of her not responding to your question.\u201d Defense counsel then informed plaintiff that he could move to dismiss the case if she failed to answer his questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Plaintiffs third deposition occurred in February 2010. At this deposition, plaintiff again refused to provide the name of her immigration attorney, refused to answer other questions, and attempted to control the proceeding. Plaintiff announced that she would \u201canswer only questions which are related to the time I was working for Dr. Sharma and UMDNJ.\u201d For example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">Q: Who do you work for now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">A: I\u2019ll not answer the question [because it is] not related [to ray employment] with UMDNJ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">Q; [To plaintiffs counsel:] are you instructing your client not to answer this question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">A: [From plaintiffs counsel:] It\u2019s up to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Q: What is your annual salary with your present employer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">A: I\u2019ll not answer that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">A: And I will not answer any other questions which are not related to ... [UMDNJ]. <em>And that\u2019s final</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">Q: [Y]ou will not answer my questions about what current benefits you have in your present job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">A: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">During the deposition, defense counsel advised plaintiff to answer the questions unless otherwise instructed by her counsel, and repeated his warning that he would move to dismiss her complaint if she refused to cooperate. Then the questions turned to plaintiffs tax records, defendant\u2019s notice to produce, and her continued unwillingness to provide discovery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">Q: Did you bring copies of your tax returns today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">Q: You were asked [at your second deposition] to bring tax returns for the years 2004 to 2007. Did you produce those tax returns in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">A: [N]o____ I will not provide [to] you my tax returns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">The questions next switched to plaintiffs curriculum vitae and her refusal to provide certain additional discovery.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-16\">Q: [A]re there any publications that you have authored since the time [you issued your CV]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-17\">A: I told you [that] I\u2019ll not answer the questions regarding my private life which is not related with the time I have been working with Dr. Sharma.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-18\">At this third deposition, defense counsel stated that he served a notice to produce the tax returns, explained that plaintiff refused to provide discovery, and asked plaintiffs counsel if he would be filing a protective order. Plaintiffs counsel maintained that \u201cwe object to the request for the income tax records.\u201d At the end of the third deposition, however, plaintiffs counsel said that \u201cwe\u2019re open minded about ... the tax records, if we can find them, and we\u2019ll think about continuing with the deposition.\u201d With that, the deposition ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>In March 2010, the parties appeared before the judge and participated in a conference to resolve plaintiffs unwillingness to answer questions. The judge stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Art\">[T]he thrust of [plaintiffs] claim is for the emotional harm that she suffered as a result of the alleged statements by Dr. Sharma. In that regard[,] <em>I\u2019m going to allow a full explm-ation of all aspects of the emotional harm, that is claimed and I don't mean that in a narrow sense. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-6\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The judge then selected the date of March 29, 2010 to complete plaintiffs deposition. Thereafter, plaintiffs counsel cancelled the deposition due to plaintiffs busy schedule and then the parties engaged in motion practice.</p>\n<p id=\"AP6\">Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s order<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that plaintiffs deposition be continued, and Dr. Sharma moved to dismiss the complaint without prejudice pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:23-5 (failure to make discovery), <em>Rule </em>4:23-4 (failure to attend deposition), and <em>Rule </em>l:2-4(a) (sanctions for failure to appear). On April 5, 2010, the judge conducted oral argument and stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">[W]ith respect to [plaintiffs] motion to reconsider the requirement that she [be] deposed, I find that [you have not brought] to my attention anything new____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">I find that there were issues that remained outstanding from those prior deposition sessions. Those issues had not been addressed____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">[Y]our client, in the end, made the decision that she was simply going to disobey the order of this [c]ourt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">[Plaintiff failed to appear for her deposition on March 29, 2010, and] it was utterly unreasonable to expect others to essentially dance around her schedule and to move forward with depositions on some other day, a non-work day.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">I conclude that [plaintiff] made a decision in this case. [She decided] not to make discovery [which this court ordered]____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-15\">Under <em>Rule </em>4:23-5(a)(l), the plaintiffs complaint is dismissed without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>I\u2019m going to require that this deposition, if you\u2019re to reschedule it, be rescheduled within a two week period as a condition of this reinstatement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">On April 8, 2010, the judge entered the order dismissing the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Plaintiffs fourth deposition occurred on April 15, 2010. At this proceeding, plaintiff testified for the first time that she shredded her 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax returns. Plaintiff indicated that she did not shred her 2008 tax returns, but she refused to produce them because \u201c2008 doesn\u2019t apply to the time I was working in Dr. Sharma\u2019s lab.\u201d Plaintiff also refused to produce her 2009 tax returns for the same reason. Plaintiff was adamant that even if the records existed, \u201cI will never produce my tax returns for you.\u201d The questioning continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Q: Will you fill out [Form 4506T-EZ \u2014 thereby allowing defense counsel to obtain your tax returns directly from the IRS]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">Q: Have you published anything since [you issued your] CV?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">Q: Tell me what you published, and where it was published?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">A: I\u2019m not telling you what I have published.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Plaintiff then testified that Dr. Sharma \u201cis the only one\u201d who caused her emotional harm, and that she had no other stress points in her life. Defense counsel probed into her statement that Dr. Sharma was solely responsible for her emotional stress claim, but she continued to obstruct the discovery of relevant information.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">Q: Did you ever have any concerns about your immigration status that caused you any stress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-14\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">Q: Did you ever have any concerns about your husband\u2019s immigration status that caused you any stress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-16\">A: Well, my husband is my dependent. So, if I am safe, he is safe, too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-17\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-18\">A: The only thing that I was worrying about is if I lose [my] job in Dr. Sharma\u2019s lab, ... I have to go back to my country ... if I don\u2019t find a job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>A: I never got any cancellation letter of my [v]isa ... and [I showed papers to lawyers, and] they were valid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">Q: Will you give me th[e] name [of the immigration lawyer]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">A: No, I\u2019m not going to give you that name____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In May 2010, plaintiff moved to reinstate her complaint believing that she produced fully responsive discovery, and defendants moved to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. Plaintiff argued, in part, that her tax returns are irrelevant \u201cas the plaintiff withdrew <em>most </em>of [plaintiffs] lost wage claim.\u201d (Emphasis added). At oral argument in August 2010, the judge stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">The [c]ourt previously hear[d] motion practice [regarding the production of tax records,] and ... plaintiff unilaterally ... refus[ed] to comply with the order of the [c]ourt____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">She refused to answer [the] question[s] about [recent publications].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">The [c]ourt finds that there is no adequate basis for that refusal. She also refused to provide the name of her immigration attorney____[T]he name of one\u2019s attorney is not something that is necessarily privileged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-14\">[T]o the extent that ... plaintiff ... may have been confused ... the [e]ourt will provide [thirty additional] days to supply [the outstanding discovery].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-15\">As a result, on September 8, 2010, the judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice and ordered that plaintiffs complaint may be reinstated if she produced by October 8, 2010 (1) documents pertaining to her publications; (2) tax returns for years 2005-2008;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (3) the name of her immigration attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-16\">On October 8, 2010, plaintiffs counsel produced her W-2 forms from 2005 to 2008, and he represented to defense counsel that plaintiff does not have her federal tax returns. On October 12, 2010, defendant\u2019s counsel renewed his request that plaintiff sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>IRS authorizations so that he could obtain the records directly from the government. On October 29, 2010, plaintiffs counsel stated that he himself would use the authorizations and obtain the records. In November 2010, defense counsel objected and repeated his request for signed authorizations from plaintiff, and in May 2011, defense counsel again requested the authorizations, which plaintiff ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Finally, on February 4, 2011, plaintiffs counsel produced her 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 federal tax returns, but she unilaterally redacted them. She did not seek a protective order, as defense counsel had inquired about during plaintiffs third deposition. Plaintiff also removed certain schedules that were referenced in the tax records, but she provided no reason for that alteration. On February 23, 2011, plaintiffs counsel wrote defense counsel and explained that the redacted portions of the tax returns pertained to plaintiffs husband, but there was no mention of the schedules that plaintiff removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Believing that she produced fully responsive discovery to the document demands, plaintiff then moved to reinstate her complaint in May 2011. Defendants, however, cross-moved, and repeated their request that the judge dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The motions were assigned to a different judge than the one who had been managing the case up to this point. The new judge thoroughly reviewed the file, conducted oral argument, and entered the June 10, 2011 order dismissing plaintiffs complaint with prejudice and denying her motion to reinstate. In her lengthy and comprehensive oral opinion she stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_n\">The plaintiff has exhibited a history of refusing to produce [the] required discovery____ She has chosen to ignore [e]ourt orders by producing incomplete tax records____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">She has ignored [c]ourt orders in the past, and by doing so, she has caused the litigation to be unnecessarily delayed to the point where the defendants are now harmed by the passage of time.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was dismissed without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>prejudice more than [thirteen] months ago, and until now, she has not taken the steps necessary to have it reinstated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">Plaintiff is not in comport with <em>Rule </em>4:23-5(a)[,] ... she has not produced the demanded and fully responsive discovery, nor has she demonstrated any exceptional circumstances ... to allow for the reinstatement of her complaint____ [T]he motion for dismissal with prejudice is <em>required </em>to be granted unless full and responsive answers have been served by the time of the return date or extraordinary circumstances are demonstrated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">Accordingly, given the history of continual and unilateral discovery delay and failure to abide by court orders, and further, given that as of today, the plaintiff is still not in compliance with the discovery and further, that no exceptional circumstances have been [shown], the motion to reinstate the complaint is denied, the motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Plaintiff moved for reconsideration. She contended that (1) the first judge was better equipped to hear her motion to reinstate the complaint; (2) the cross-motion to dismiss with prejudice was heard impermissibly; and (3) she argued for the first time that the tax returns were properly redacted to protect her and her husband\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, and she maintained that the tax returns were irrelevant. The judge issued an oral decision rejecting these arguments, and then entered the July 22, 2011 order denying reconsideration. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that (1) the court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint without prejudice on April 8, 2010, and then by entering the September 8, 2010 order requiring her to produce discovery as a condition to reinstatement; (2) the judge abused her discretion by dismissing the complaint with prejudice on June 10, 2010, because plaintiff produced fully responsive discovery; (3) the judge committed plain error by \u201crefusing to honor\u201d plaintiffs Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination; (4) the judge erred by failing to grant plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment; and (5) the judge erred by granting summary judgment dismissing her claims for fraud and conversion. We focus on plaintiffs contentions that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>abused its discretion by dismissing the case, without and then with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We begin by addressing plaintiffs argument that the court erred by dismissing her complaint without prejudice. \u201c \u2018A trial court has inherent discretionary power to impose sanctions for failure to make discovery, subject only to the requirement that they be just and reasonable in the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Abtrax Pharms., Inc. v. Elkins-Sinn, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>499, 513, 655 A.2d 1368 (1995) (quoting <em>Calabrese v. Trenton State Coll., </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 151-52, 392 A.2d 600 (App.Div.1978), <em>aff'd, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>321, 413 A.2d 315 (1980)). Against this standard, we conclude that the judge did not err by dismissing the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Defendants sought to dismiss the complaint without prejudice pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:23-5(a)(1), <em>Rule </em>4:23-4, and <em>Rule </em>1:2-4. In dismissing the complaint without prejudice, the judge relied on <em>Rule </em>4:23-5(a)(1), which states in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">If a demand for discovery pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:18, ... is not complied with and no timely motion for an extension or a protective order has been made, the party entitled to discovery may, ... move, on notice, for an order dismissing or suppressing the pleading of the delinquent party____Unless good cause for other relief is shown, the court shall enter an order of dismissal or suppression without prejudice____ The delinquent party may move on notice for vacation of the dismissal or suppression order at any time before the entry of an order of dismissal or suppression with prejudice. The motion shall be supported by affidavit reciting that the discovery asserted to have been withheld has been fully and responsively provided____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">Here, the judge concluded that \u201cthere were issues that remained outstanding from those prior deposition sessions,\u201d plaintiff failed \u201cto make discovery,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and cancelled her fourth deposition date selected by the judge. Although plaintiff argues that the judge never entered a written order that the deposition occur on March <em>29, 2010, </em>plaintiff failed to <em>comply </em>with the oral order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>appear at her continued deposition. Instead, plaintiff moved to reconsider whether a fourth deposition was necessary. She appeared for her fourth deposition after the court dismissed her complaint without prejudice. The fact remains, however, that she had failed to respond to defendant\u2019s document demands. For this reason alone, the judge did not err by dismissing the complaint without prejudice pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:23-5(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Furthermore, by compelling plaintiff to produce the three items referenced in the court\u2019s September 8, 2010 order (documents pertaining to her publications; tax returns for years 2005-2008; and the name of her immigration attorney), the judge imposed no more than what the rule mandated, requiring plaintiff to produce \u201cfully and responsive\u201d discovery as a condition to reinstatement of the complaint. <em>R. </em>4:23-5(a)(1). In fact, the judge entered the September 2010 order rather than dismissing the complaint with prejudice as defendants had urged vigorously. As a result, the judge imposed sanctions that were neither unjust nor unreasonable. <em>Abtrax, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 513, 655 A.2d 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Next, plaintiff contends that the judge abused her discretion by dismissing the complaint with prejudice. In dismissing the complaint with prejudice, the judge relied on <em>Rule </em>4:23-5(a)(2), which provides in part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">If an order of dismissal ... without prejudice has been entered pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this rule and not thereafter vacated, the party entitled to the discovery may, ... move on notice for an order of dismissal ... with prejudice____ The motion to dismiss ... with prejudice <em>shall </em>be granted unless a motion to vacate the previously entered order of dismissal ... without prejudice has been filed by the delinquent party <em>and </em>either the demanded and fully responsive discovery has been provided or exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Although plaintiff asserts that she produced fully responsive discovery, the record demonstrates otherwise. Even though she was warned repeatedly that refusal would result in the dismissal of her case, and that she should obtain a protective order if warranted, plaintiff refused to sign IRS tax authorizations at defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>repeated requests, thereby depriving the defense of obtaining unaltered tax records directly from the IRS; produced incomplete tax records that she redacted without a protective order or authorization by the court; and without notice to the court or parties, removed schedules that were referenced in the tax returns. As a result of her deliberate decision to withhold relevant discovery, we conclude that plaintiff failed to produce \u201cfully responsive\u201d discovery as the rule requires. <em>R. </em>4:23\u20145(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">This is also not a situation where plaintiff failed to produce discovery on a minor issue in response to court orders. Plaintiff argues that the tax records are irrelevant because she withdrew most, but not all, of her wage claim. The tax returns are relevant not only to the remaining wage claim, but also to plaintiffs primary contention that Dr. Sharma alone caused her emotional distress and marital problems. <em>Abtrax, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 514, 655 A.2d 1368 (stating that dismissal with prejudice is appropriate where \u201cthe order for discovery goes to the very foundation of the cause of action\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiff testified that her husband was not employed and she refused to tell counsel what her salary was. Defendant sought the tax returns, in part, to verify whether her husband had reported earned income, to confirm if he had been working, and to compare income levels before and after UMDNJ terminated her. He sought the tax records to determine whether money issues contributed to her emotional distress claim. Also, although she testified that her husband was not working, if her tax returns showed otherwise, then this inconsistency would be relevant to impeach her credibility. Thus, we agree with the court that the tax records are relevant to plaintiffs claim of emotional distress because \u201cthe information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:10-2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Finally, we conclude that plaintiffs \u201crefusal to comply [with the discovery demands]\u201d was \u201cdeliberate and contumacious,\u201d and that, under the totality of the circumstances of this case, the sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>imposed were not unjust or unreasonable. <em>Abtrax, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 513-14, 655 A.2d 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">We disagree with plaintiffs contention that the judge committed plain error by \u201crefusing to honor\u201d her Fifth Amendment right, \u201cand possibly her husband[\u2019s],\u201d against self-incrimination. Plaintiff never asserted her right to be silent in response to any deposition question. Therefore, we focus on plaintiffs decision to ignore repeated requests to file a protective order, and her deliberate, continuous attempts to thwart the discovery process.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">We note at the outset that plaintiff raised this argument for the first time during her motion to reconsider the judge\u2019s June 10, 2011 order dismissing the complaint with prejudice, where the judge stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">the last argument presented is that the plaintiff properly redacted the [c]ourt ordered tax returns because she was asserting a [F]ifth [A]mendment privilege on the part of both herself and her husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">[This is] the first time such an argument has been advanced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Although the judge declined to address the argument because plaintiff raised it for the first time on her reconsideration motion, <em>see Rosen v. Keeler, </em>411 <em>N.J.Super. </em>439, 450, 986 A.2d 731 (App.Div.2010) (not disturbing the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider arguments first raised in motion for reconsideration), the judge stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">[t]he privilege against self-incrimination is personal, applying only to individuals.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">[O]ne cannot assert a [F]ifth [A]mendment right on behalf of another. It can only he asserted if testimony might incriminate one\u2019s self.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">Nevertheless, we focus on plaintiffs calculated decisions to \u201cdeliberately pursu[e] a course that thwarts persistent efforts to obtain the necessary facts.\u201d <em>Abtrax, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 515, 655 A.2d 1368.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">Plaintiffs self-incrimination argument on reconsideration and on appeal contradicts the position she advanced on February 23, 2011, when plaintiffs counsel informed defense counsel that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>redactions \u201cpertained to [plaintiffs] husband. As he is not a party to this action, any information pertaining to him would be undiscoverable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Plaintiff never asserted <em>her </em>Fifth Amendment right to be silent during her depositions. Rather, she ignored the opportunity to seek a protective order or to address any potential privilege issue, even though she had been invited repeatedly to do so and warned that defense counsel would move to dismiss the complaint if she refused to provide discovery. Instead, plaintiff refused to supply the tax records, contending that they were irrelevant. In fact, on appeal, plaintiffs counsel maintains that \u201cany money that [plaintiffs] husband might have earned in the United States [is] irrelevant.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Lastly, we affirm that part of the January 8, 2010 order denying her motion for partial summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact exist, and she is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). In support of her motion, she relied on a report from a manager of UMDNJ\u2019s Office Of Administrative Action/EEO. <em>She contended </em>that <em>the </em>manager\u2019s report, <em>in </em>response to her discrimination complaint that she filed with the UMDNJ Office of Affirmative Action/EEO, constituted an admission pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b). We reject that argument because the manager is not a party and is unauthorized by UMDNJ to make a statement concerning plaintiffs LAD case that she filed in superior court. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>We have determined that plaintiffs remaining arguments lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in this written decision. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-11\"> Plaintiff also appeals from (1) a January 8, 2010 order denying her motion for partial summary judgment on liability, granting summary judgment to all defendants dismissing her claims for fraud and conversion, and dismissing all claims against defendant Teresa Duda, Ph.D.; (2) a February 8, 2010 amended order dismissing all claims against Dr. Duda with prejudice; (3) an April 8, 2010 order dismissing the complaint without prejudice; (4) a September 8, 2010 order conditionally permitting reinstatement of the complaint subject to the production of discovery; and (5) that part of the June 10, 2011 order denying her motion to reinstate her complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-12\"> She also asserted claims for vicarious liability, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, violation of public policy, fraud and conversion, violation of the New Jersey Family Leave Act (FLA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:11B-1 to -16, and conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b500-9\"> Plaintiff dropped her future lost wage claim during her third day of deposition testimony. In that proceeding, plaintiff's counsel stated, however, that \"we're still pursuing her claim for economic losses\u201d up to the time when plaintiff found new employment, five months after UMDNJ terminated her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-14\"> During the deposition, Dr. Sharma's counsel reminded plaintiff\u2019s counsel about <em>Rule </em>4:1-4\u20143(f) (regarding the limitations placed on communication between a deponent and counsel once a deposition commences).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b503-16\"> The judge issued the order verbally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b503-17\"> Plaintiff suggested that her deposition occur on a Saturday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-17\"> Thus, the judge rejected her argument that the tax returns were irrelevant to her emotional distress claim, as he previously had determined that \"I\u2019m going to allow a full exploration of all aspects of the emotional harm that is claimed and I don\u2019t mean that in a narrow sense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"> At this point, it was approaching four years after she had filed her complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b508-14\"> Plaintiff failed to respond to the defense's document demands for tax documents and the name of her immigration attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> \u201c[T]he United States Supreme Court has never interpreted [the Fifth Amendment] to create a broader right that would extend that protection to a third party.\" <em>State v. Baum, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>407, 417, 972 A.2d 1127 (2009). As such, \u201cthe Fifth Amendment cannot be asserted vicariously.\" <em>Id. </em>at 418, 972 A.2d 1127 (internal quotation marks omitted).
