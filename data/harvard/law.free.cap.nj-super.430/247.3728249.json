The additional requirement for identification of the specific impacted properties only applies when a change in boundaries is proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Plaintiffs Mahwah Realty Associates, Inc., and TSI Mahwah, LLC, filed this action in lieu of prerogative writs, seeking the invalidation of Ordinance 1653, which defined the terms \u201chealth and wellness center\u201d and \u201cfitness and health club,\u201d and added those uses to those permitted in Mahwah\u2019s two existing industrial zoning districts, IP-120 and GI-80. Defendants Township of Mahwah and its planning board (hereafter collectively referred to as \u201cMahwah\u201d) appeal a summary judgment that invalidated the ordinance based on the trial judge\u2019s determination that Mahwah gave insufficient notice to property owners in or within 200 feet of the affected zoning districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Mahwah\u2019s attempts to include health clubs as a permitted use in these zoning districts commenced over twelve years ago; this is the third lawsuit spawned by those efforts. The first suit concerned the July 27, 2000 adoption of Ordinance 1368, which added health and fitness centers to the uses permitted in the IP-120 zone. Plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking to invalidate that ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>nance, and, after a non-jury trial, Judge Jonathan N. Harris rendered a written decision in which he described the suit as \u201ca banal clash between competing land owners interested in establishing and maintaining health clubs, dressed up in the garb of a land use dispute,\u201d and described plaintiffs\u2019 intent in litigating as \u201ca thinly veiled effort to protect its local monopoly.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notwithstanding, the judge invalidated Ordinance 1368 because the ordinance changed the classification of the zoning district and because notice had not been sent to property owners in or within 200 feet of the impacted zoning district. Judge Harris also held that plaintiffs \u201cfailed to demonstrate that the substantive zoning provisions in Ordinance 1368 are arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable\u201d and concluded \u201c[tjhere is nothing irrational or whimsical about the governing body\u2019s decision to add health and fitness center facilities to Mahwah\u2019s industrial zones.\u201d No appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In 2007, Mahwah adopted Ordinance 1589, which was substantially similar to Ordinance 1653, prompting plaintiffs to file another action in lieu of prerogative writs. After a non-jury trial, Judge Harris found Ordinance 1589 was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable except \u201cinsofar as [he] lack[ed] confidence that the Mahwah governing body and its Planning Board appropriately considered the ordinance\u2019s effect upon the B-40 zone.\u201d He also determined that Mahwah did not give notice to property owners in and within 200 feet of the B-40 zone. As a result, judgment was entered invalidating Ordinance 1589. Again, no appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">On July 23, 2009, Mahwah\u2019s council voted to adopt Ordinance 1653. Mahwah\u2019s clerk caused written notice to be published in <em>The Record, </em>a local newspaper. That notice included the date, time, and place of the public hearing, and reprinted the entire text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of Ordinance 1653. The clerk also sent written notice of the public hearing to all property owners entitled to notice, including property owners in or within 200 feet of the B-40, GI-80 and IP-120 zoning districts. Separate cover letters advised recipients whether they owned property in or within 200 feet of the zoning districts in question. -These letters also stated the date, time, and place of the public hearing. In addition, the clerk included a copy of the notice of the public hearing that had been published in <em>The Record </em>that also referred to the ordinance by its title, the date it was introduced, and the date, time, and place of the hearing. And the notice included a copy of the ordinance, which expressed that its purpose \u201cis to include health and wellness centers and health clubs as principal permitted uses in the GI-80 zone and IP-120 zone and not the B-40 zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On July 24, 2009, Ordinance 1653 was referred to the planning board. The planning board noted that although Ordinance 1653 is \u201cnot substantially consistent\u201d with the master plan, the omissions of the uses in question from the master plan was not intentional because these uses are \u201crelatively new and unique\u201d and not \u201cnormally expected to be found\u201d in a master plan. The planning board also found, as memorialized in its resolution, that the proposed uses would be \u201cappropriate uses in the GI-80 Zone and the IP-120 Zone,\u201d consistent with other uses in those zoning districts, and \u201cbeneficial to the residents of Mahwah and the surrounding area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">On September 10, 2009, Mahwah\u2019s council held a public hearing and, at its conclusion, adopted Ordinance 1653.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Plaintiffs thereafter commenced this timely action. A judge not involved in the prior suits made two rulings, which we reviewed in an earlier appeal. The judge first compelled the depositions of the mayor, council members, and planning board members for the purpose of eliciting information that might reveal whether their participation in the ordinance\u2019s adoption was barred by a conflict of interest. And the judge granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on procedural grounds not relevant to the issues now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>before us. We reversed and remanded for proceedings on the remaining issues. <em>Mahwah Realty Assocs., Inc. v. Twp. of Mahwah, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>341, 21 A.3d 643 (App.Div.2011). The Supreme Court denied plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification. 208 <em>N.J. </em>599, 34 A.3d 780 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Following our remand, plaintiffs again moved for summary judgment, arguing that Mahwah failed to give the notice required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1. Mahwah cross-moved for partial summary judgment, seeking the dismissal of four counts of the amended complaint \u2014 specifically, those that challenged the sufficiency of the notice in <em>The Record, </em>the notice to property owners, and alleged conflicts of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The judge held the ordinance purports to alter the classification of the effected zones, thereby triggering the notice requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1. In addition, the judge held that Mahwah was required \u2014 but failed \u2014 to give notice of this proposed classification change in the manner required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1. Consequently, summary judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs; the order also denied Mahwah\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In this appeal, Mahwah argues that the ordinance does not change the classification of the affected zoning districts but, if it does, the notice to property owners conformed to <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-62.1. We reject the first argument and agree with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">We examined what the MLUL intended by a \u201cclassification\u201d change in <em>Robert James Pacilli Homes, LLC v. Twp. of Woolwich, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>319, 329, 926 A.2d 412 (App.Div.2007), recognizing that \u201c[ujnlike many terms found in the MLUL, \u2018classification\u2019 is not defined.\u201d After giving the word its \u201c \u2018ordinary and well understood meaning,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Levin v. Twp. of Parsippany-Troy Hills, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>174, 182, 411 A.2d 704 (1980)), and considering its context, we determined that \u201cclassification is typically synonymous with the broad general uses permitted in a designated area ... and extends to sub-categories within those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>general categories,\u201d which are further \u201cdistinguished by the intensity of the permitted use,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 330, 926 A.2d 412, and \u201cthe density, bulk and height standards and conditions applicable to designated uses,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 331, 926 A.2d 412. Until the Legislature adopts some different meaning,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we will continue to apply, as we apply here, <em>Pacilli\u2019s </em>general understanding of the term as including an ordinance that \u201chas the capacity to fundamentally alter the character of a zoning district.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The additional uses in question fundamentally alter the industrial zoning districts affected by Ordinance 1653. The definitions given by the ordinance to both \u201chealth and wellness center\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to \u201cfitness and health club\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reveal that these proposed uses are clearly discordant from the uses permitted in the affected industrial zoning districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The IP-120 zoning district permits, among other things: research laboratories; assembly and packaging businesses; manufacturing, assembling and packaging of electronic and electric components, instruments, precision tools, and timepieces; public utility buildings; telephone exchanges; printing plants; publish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ing houses; some light manufacturing operations; businesses using structures where office space is combined with a warehouse; and planned industrial developments. The GI-80 zoning district permits, among other things: distribution terminals; extraction or excavation operations; glass and textile manufacture; truck terminals; lumber and building materials sales; contractor\u2019s equipment sales and service; tool, die and pattern making, and other machine shop operations; wholesale business storage and warehousing; woodworking, furniture repair and custom upholstery operations; metalworking; electrical sales; manufacture, assembly or packaging of products from previously prepared materials; public parks, playgrounds or athletic fields; and post offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">We agree with Judge Harris\u2019s comment in one of the earlier related lawsuits that health clubs and wellness centers are not of an \u201cindustrial stripe.\u201d Certainly, the uses permitted by Ordinance 1653 are dissimilar from those now permitted in the industrial zoning districts because the ordinance would introduce commercial recreation, medical services, retail sales, and educational facilities into zoning districts designed for manufacturing, trucking and the like. We, thus, conclude that Ordinance 1653 represents a fundamental alteration of \u2014 and therefore a change in the classification of uses permitted in \u2014 the IP-120 and GI-80 zoning districts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The more difficult question concerns the parties\u2019 dispute about the proper interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1, which, in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">A notice pursuant to this section shall state the date, time and place of the hearing, the nature of the matter to be considered and an identification of the affected zoning districts and proposed boundary changes, if any, by street names, common names or other identifiable landmarks, and by reference to lot and block numbers as shown on the current tax duplicate in the municipal tax assessor\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The parties\u2019 dispute presents a problem commonly encountered when a statute \u2014 in a single sentence \u2014 first lists multiple items or imposes multiple obligations and then includes words that modify or limit some or all of those items or obligations. Inevitably, such a convoluted statutory sentence will invite disagreements about whether the limiting or modifying language was intended to apply to all the previously listed items or requirements or only the item or requirement closest in the sentence to the modifier. A simple example of this type of syntactic ambiguity would be a phrase in a statute that would impose an obligation on \u201ccharitable corporations or institutions performing educational functions,\u201d which would not clearly reveal whether the statute applies to all charitable corporations or only those performing educational functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1 provides that a municipality must give notice of an ordinance that \u201cpropos[es] a change to the classification or boundary changes\u201d of a zoning district, and the notice in those instances must \u201cstate the date, time and place of the hearing, the nature of the matter to be considered and an identification of the affected zoning districts and proposed boundary changes[.]\u201d That much is clear, but then the statute engages in syntactic ambiguity by including additional language in the same sentence immediately after \u201caffected zoning districts and proposed boundary changes,\u201d namely: \u201cif any, by street names, common names or other identifiable landmarks, and by reference to lot and block numbers as shown on the current tax duplicate in the municipal tax assessor\u2019s office.\u201d We understand Mahwah\u2019s argument as seeking our interpretation of the statute as if it had been phrased in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">the notice must state the date, time and place of the healing, the nature of the matter to be considered and an identification of the affected zoning districts <em>and, if a boundary change is proposed the notice must also identify such change </em>by street names, common names or other identifiable landmarks, and by reference to lot and block numbers ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">On the other hand, plaintiffs seek an interpretation as if the statute\u2019s words and phrases had been arranged in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>the notice must state the date, time and place of the hearing, the nature of the matter to be considered and an identification <em>by street names, common names or other identifiable landmarks, and by reference to lot and block numbers ... of the affected zoning districts and proposed boundary changes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">These reworded examples demonstrate that whatever meaning may have been intended, the Legislature could have expressed itself in a clearer fashion. But this analysis only begs the question because we consider the statute not as it could have been written but as it actually was written.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Despite plaintiffs\u2019 forceful arguments to the contrary, we conclude that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1 must be interpreted as Mahwah argues and that the additional identification requirements apply only to boundary changes, not classification changes. The lynehpin for that conclusion is the two-word phrase \u201cif any,\u201d which appears in the statute immediately after \u201cproposed boundary changes.\u201d That phrase \u2014 \u201cif any\u201d \u2014 can only logically relate to \u201cproposed boundary charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We draw this conclusion because the statute may only be understood as applying to two events \u2014 classification changes and boundary changes. If what follows \u201cif any\u201d in the statute was meant to apply to both those circumstances, then there would be no reason for the Legislature to insert \u201cif any.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That expression, by its very nature, was intended to distance those requirements that follow from one of the two applicable circumstances or it was intended to apply to only one of the two possible events, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>both.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result, if \u201cif any\u201d applies to only one of the two \u2014 as it must \u2014 then it must apply only to \u201cboundary changes,\u201d which immediately precedes it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That result comports with the general rule of statutory construction that \u201ca modifying phrase applies to the last antecedent phrase, absent contrary intent.\u201d <em>Morella v. Grand Union/N.J. Self-Insurers Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 240, 917 A.2d 826 (App.Div.2007), <em>affd o.b., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>350, 939 A.2d 226 (2008); <em>see also State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. &amp; Energy v. Santomauro, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>339, 345, 618 A.2d 917 (App.Div. 1993). Absent any other intrinsic or extrinsic evidence \u2014 and none has been offered \u2014 that might reveal the legislation\u2019s intent, we can logically interpret this statute in no way other than where its literal wording and natural connotation takes us.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Moving from the <em>form </em>to the substance, we observe also that adoption of plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation would take the statute to a dryly illogical extreme because, for no practical reason, plaintiffs would have us untangle the statute\u2019s syntactic ambiguity in a way that imposes a time-consuming and futile obligation on municipalities. The statute was designed to require municipalities to give adequate notice of the change to be effected by a proposed ordinance. If the classification of a zoning district is what is being changed, then it suffices to identify the zoning districts affected\u2014 here, IP-120 and GI-80. On the other hand, a change in the boundaries of a zoning district is not revealed by a mere reference to the affected zoning districts. A boundary change inevitably requires further description as delineated by the language following \u201cif any\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">For example, in giving notice of a boundary change of a particular zoning district in Trenton, a notice would be adequate if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>it disclosed that an ordinance had been proposed to move a zoning district\u2019s northern border, which presently is the centerline of State Street, between Broad Street (near the State House) on the west end and Clinton Avenue (near the federal court house) on the east end, to the centerline of Perry Street between Broad Street and Clinton Avenue. Such a description of the proposed boundary change, with reference to the lot and block numbers of the affected properties, would be generally understandable and meaningful to property owners entitled to notice. When placed in this practical setting, the legislative intent to require a further description of the impact on the zoning districts \u2014 through an adequate description of the boundary changes and the properties affected by those boundary changes \u2014 logically applies only when a change in the boundaries of the affected zoning districts is proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Plaintiffs urge an interpretation of the statute that would impose similar descriptive obligations when a zoning district\u2019s classification is changed. Such a requirement, however, would serve no practical purpose. For example, when asked what more it would have Mahwah do, plaintiffs argued that Mahwah was required to provide, within the other materials sent to all property owners entitled to notice, a list of all the properties \u2014 by lot and block number \u2014 within both zoning districts. We question how meaningful such a list would be to most, if not all, noticed property owners to whom lot and block numbers would have no particular meaning without further research.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Although we are obligated to view planning and zoning determinations with an understanding that municipalities must act \u201cin strict conformity\u201d with the MLUL, <em>Nuckel v. Little Ferry Planning Bd., </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>95, 101, 26 A.3d 418 (2011), we reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument because its interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-62.1 would generate absurd consequences and impose futile requirements. Instead, we adopt that interpretation that is most \u201cconsonant\u201d with \u201creason and good direction,\u201d <em>Schierstead v. City of Brigantine, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>220, 230, 148 A.2d 591 (1959) (quoting <em>Morris Canal &amp; Banking Co. v. Central R.R. Co., </em>16 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>419, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>428 (Ch.1863)); <em>see also State v. Friedman, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>102, 118-19, 35 A.3d 1163 (2012); <em>DeLisa v.

First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>75, 84, 740 A.2d 1081 (1999), and conclude that the notice given by Mahwah to property owners was consistent with the obligations contained in N.J.S.A 40:55D-62.1.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The order under review \u2014 which granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the sufficiency of notice pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1, and denied Mahwah\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment on the sufficiency of that same notice, as well as the notice published in <em>The </em>Record,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and on the conflict-of-interest claims \u2014 is reversed. The matter is remanded for entry of an order dismissing those counts of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint that alleged insufficiency of notice. Although the judge denied Mahwah\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the conflict-of-interest counts, she did not explain why; we assume the judge found it unnecessary to decide those issues in light of the award of summary judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. Now that we have reversed the summary judgment entered in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, Mahwah is entitled to a ruling on the merits of its cross-motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>summary judgment on the conflict-of-interest counts.

Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 431, 640 A.2d 817 (1994); <em>110-112 Van Wagenen Ave. Co. v. Julian, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>230, 235, 244 A.2d 123 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>52 <em>N.J. </em>490, 246 A.2d 450 (1968), but it cannot be said that the phrase \"if any\u201d appears in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-62.1 by accident. It is a phrase that suggests an intent to limit or modify the class to which it refers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Stated more simply, if a statute applies only to A or B, the Legislature would not need to say that additional obligations are imposed only \u201cif any\u201d of either A or B are applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\"> Certainly, \"if any\u201d cannot be viewed as applying only to changes in classification. That would require a surgical transplant of \"if any\u201d to a different location in the statute. Plaintiffs have not suggested such an interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> The trial judge observed that even though not raised by either side, the notice is \"devoid of any information regarding the nature of the proposed changes.\" We reject this. If the notice met the requirements of the MLUL\u2014 which it does \u2014 Mahwah was not obligated to further explain the ordinance\u2019s meaning. Mahwah's mailing to all impacted property owners included, among other things, a complete copy of the ordinance. The MLUL does not require an ordinance of such brevity to be summarized even in newspaper notices. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:49-2.1(a); <em>Cotler v. Twp. of Pilesgrove, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 385, 923 A.2d 338 (App.Div.2007). The notice given by Mahwah complied with the MLUL in all respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> Plaintiffs did not oppose that part of Mahwah\u2019s appeal that argued the notice published in the newspaper was sufficient. We agree the notice was sufficient. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>40:49-2.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
