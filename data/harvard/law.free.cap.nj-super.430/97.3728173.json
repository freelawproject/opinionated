The order denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs breach of contract claim (count one), but plaintiff later voluntarily dismissed this count making the order appealable as of right.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The motion judge determined that plaintiffs claims under the CFA, and other state tort claims, were preempted by a specific clause of the federal Airline Deregulation Act (ADA), 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 41713(b)(1), and that plaintiffs claim for class certification was baseless. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We derive the following facts from the record. On December 1, 2009, defendant instituted a cashless cabin policy for accounting and security purposes. Defendant <em>informed </em>the public of this change in policy by issuing a nationwide press release, and through pre-boarding announcements and announcements after completion of the boarding process. The motion judge recited other pertinent facts, which are undisputed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">[In] 2009 plaintiff Michael Rosen purchased a round trip flight ticket from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles, California with the defendant Continental Airlines. While on board the flight from Newark to Los Angeles plaintiff purchased a headset by credit card from defendant for in-flight movies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">Prior to purchasing the headset the passengers on the flight were advised that headsets could be used on future Continental flights. On January 6th, 2011, plaintiff boarded the return flight from Honolulu, Hawaii to Newark. On that flight the plaintiff attempted to use the headset purchased on the prior flight and discovered the headset was not compatible with \u201cjacks\u201d and he would have to purchase a new headset which would be compatible with the available jacks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">Plaintiff tried to purchase a new headset with cash. But defendant\u2019s representative indicated that the defendant was only capable of accepting payments by credit card or debit card. Plaintiff later tiled to purchase a cocktail and was told that Continental had a no cash policy on its airplane and that he could not make any purchases unless he possessed a debit or credit card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Since plaintiff did not have in his possession either debit or credit card he was unable to make any purchases on the flight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Plaintiff filed suit on October 4, 2010, in the Law Division, asserting the causes of action noted above. On defendant\u2019s motion, the case was initially removed to the federal district court, but was later remanded to the Law Division, where defendant then moved to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e). Plaintiff opposed the motion, and filed a cross-motion for leave to file an amended complaint asserting a class action. After hearing argument, Judge Denise A. Cobham issued an order dismissing, with prejudice, the second, third and fourth counts of plaintiffs complaint, and denying plaintiffs cross-motion for leave to amend the complaint to assert a class action. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">In considering a motion to dismiss under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), courts search the allegations of the pleading in depth and with liberality to determine \u201cwhether a cause of action is \u2018suggested\u2019 by the facts.\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989) (quoting <em>Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189, 192, 536 A.2d 237 (1988)). We must therefore determine \u201cwhether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim, opportunity being given to amend if necessary.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). A pleading should be dismissed if it states no basis for relief and discovery would not provide one. <em>Camden Cnty. Energy Recovery Assocs. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl.

Such claims are expressly preempted by the ADA. 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 41713(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Under the Supremacy Clause, <em>U.S. Const. </em>art. VI, cl. 2, state laws that \u201c \u2018interfere with, or are contrary to the laws of congress, made in pursuance of the constitution\u2019 are invalid.\u201d <em>Wis. Pub. Intervenor v. Mortier, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>597, 604, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2476, 2481, 115 L.Ed.2d 532, 542 (1991) (quoting <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. </em>(9 Wheat) 1, 211, 6 <em>L.Ed. </em>23, 73 (1824)). Thus, \u201cwhen the mandates of federal law and state law are not consistent, the state law must yield.\u201d <em>Feldman v. Lederle Lab., </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>117, 133, 592 A.2d 1176 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>1219, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>3027, 120 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 898 (1992). The preemption doctrine applies equally to common law and state statutory law. <em>Id. </em>at 134, 592 A.2d 1176 (citing <em>Chicago N.W. Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co., </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>311, 325-26, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1124, 1134, 67 L.Ed.2d 258, 270 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">In 1978, Congress enacted the ADA, based on the determination that \u201c \u2018maximum reliance on competitive market forces\u2019 would best further \u2018efficiency, innovation, and low prices\u2019 as well as \u2018variety [and] quality ... of air transportation services[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>374, 378, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2031, 2034, 119 L.Ed.2d 157, 164 (1992). To ensure that the states would not undermine the federal deregulation scheme with regulations of their own, the ADA contains a preemption provision that prohibits states from interfering with the deregulation process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">(b) Preemption.-(l) Except as provided in this subsection, a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of at least 2 States may not enact or enforce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">[49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 41713(b)(1) (amending 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1305(a)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The broad preemption principles set forth in 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 41713(b)(1) preclude any state cause of action relating to a service provided by an air carrier. <em>Hodges v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>44 <em>F.</em>3d 334, 336 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cstate enforcement actions having a connection with or reference to airline \u2018rates, routes or services\u2019 are preempted\u201d). The United States Supreme Court has determined that the ADA preempts state law claims. <em>See, e.g., American Airlines v. Wolens, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>219, 221, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>817, 820, 130 L.Ed.2d 715, 721 (1995); <em>Morales, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 383, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2036-37, 119 L.Ed.2d at 167. The United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of a federal statute is, of course, controlling. <em>See Dewey v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>69, 79, 577 A.2d 1239 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">In <em>Wolens, supra, </em>the Supreme Court held that the purpose of the clause is \u201cto leave largely to the airlines themselves, and not at all to States, the selection and design of marketing mechanisms appropriate to the furnishing of air transportation services____\u201d 513 <em>U.S. </em>at 228, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 824, 130 L.Ed.2d at 726 (holding that the ADA preempts state law claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act against an airline arising out of American Airlines\u2019 retroactive modification to its frequent flyer program). Of particular import is the Court\u2019s holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">The ADA\u2019s preemption clause, \u00a7 1305(a)(1), read together with the FAA\u2019s saving clause, stops States from imposing them own substantive standards with respect to rates, routes, or services, but not from affording relief to a party who claims and proves that an airline dishonored a term the airline itself stipulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">[7d. at 232-33,115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 826,130 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 728.] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Here, resolution of the preemption issue hinges on whether the sale of a headset and an alcoholic beverage \u201crelat[es] to price, routes, or service[J\u201d We hold that it does. In <em>Morales, supra, </em>the Supreme Court gave broad meaning to the phrase \u201crelating to rates, routes, or services\u201d contained in the ADA\u2019s preemption clause, and indicated that it prohibits states from taking any \u201cenforcement actions having a connection with, or reference to, airline \u2018rates, routes, or services[,]\u2019 \u201d whether through laws specifically addressed to the airline industry or through more general statutes. 504 <em>U.S. </em>at 384, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 167-68. Therefore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">the Court determined: (1) that \u201cstate enforcement actions having connection with, or reference to\u201d carrier \u201crates, routes, or sendees are pre-empted,\u201d (2) that such pre-emption may occur even if a state law\u2019s effect on rates, routes or sendees \u201cis only indirect,\u201d (3) that, in respect to pre-emption, it makes no difference whether a state law is \u201cconsistent\u201d or \u201cinconsistent\u201d with federal regulation, and (4) that preemption occurs at least where state laws have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d related to Congress\u2019 de-regulatory and pre-emption related objectives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\"><em>[Rowe v. N.H. Motor Transp. Ass\u2019n, </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>364, 370-71, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 995, 169 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>933, 939 (2008) (citing <em>Morales, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 384, 386-87, 390, 112 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2037-38, 2040, 119 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 167-69,171).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Citing <em>Morales, </em>we have held that CFA claims based on ticket prices reflecting surcharges concern airline \u201crates, routes or services\u201d and are therefore preempted. <em>Vail v. Pan Am Corp., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 297-98, 616 A.2d 523 (App.Div.1992). In <em>Vail, </em>we dismissed a CFA claim on preemption grounds where the airline imposed a $5.00 per ticket surcharge for an enhanced security program that allegedly did not exist or had never been implemented. <em>Vail, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299-302, 616 A.2d 523. We stated that \u201c[pjermitting plaintiffs\u2019 claims ... vitiates the exclusive federal occupation of the field of aviation, and frustrates the broad preemptive purpose of \u00a7 1305(a)(1) to create a unified system of airline regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 616 A.2d 523; <em>see also Blackner v. Continental Airlines, Inc., </em>311 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 14, 709 A.2d 258 (App.Div.) (affirming the trial court\u2019s dismissal on preemption grounds of plaintiffs complaint, which alleged that a $60.00 surcharge for replacement of a lost airline ticket bore no reasonable relationship to any cost incurred by the airline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>replace the lost ticket), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>405, 719 A.2d 687 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Plaintiff argues that <em>Morales </em>cautions against finding preemption \u201cin eases where the states\u2019 laws impact on an air carrier\u2019s services is \u2018tenuous, remote or peripheral.\u2019 <em>Morales, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 890, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2040, 119 L.Ed.2d at 172.\u201d This argument, however, was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Wolens. </em>There, the Court stated, \u201c[w]e need not dwell on the question whether plaintiffs\u2019 complaints state claims \u2018relating to [air carrier] rates, routes, or services.\u2019 <em>Morales, </em>we are satisfied, does not countenance the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s separation of matters \u2018essential\u2019 from matters unessential to airline operations.\u201d <em>Wolens, supra, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>at 226, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 823, 130 <em>L.Ed.2d. </em>at 724. <em>Wolens </em>clarified that a breach of contract claim should not be preempted, <em>see id. </em>at 228, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 824, 130 L.Ed.2d at 725, but, as we stated earlier, plaintiffs claim for breach of contract was voluntarily dismissed below, and is therefore not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Although the Supreme Court broadly interprets the scope of the ADA\u2019s preemption provision, the Court has yet to define what constitutes a \u201cservice.\u201d <em>Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Duncan, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1058, 1058, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>650, 650, 148 L.Ed.2d 571, 571-72 (2000) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting from the denial of certiorari). There are two \u201cdirectly conflicting positions\u201d respecting its definitions among the courts of appeals. <em>Ibid. </em>The minority view construes \u201cservice\u201d narrowly. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Duncan v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </em>208 <em>F.</em>3d 1112, 1114-15 (9th Cir.2000) (holding \u201cthat the term \u2018service\u2019 encompasses \u2018the prices, schedules, origins and destinations of the point-to-point transportation of passengers, cargo, or mail,\u2019 but not the \u2018provision of in-flight beverages, personal assistance to passengers, the handling of luggage, and similar amenities.\u2019 <em>Charas v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>160 <em>F.</em>3d 1259, 1261 (9th Cir.1998)\u201d), <em>cert. denied, Northwest Airlines, supra, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>1058, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>650, 148 L.Ed.2d 571).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In contrast, the majority view defines \u201cservice\u201d much more broadly, and includes \u201c \u2018contractual features of air transportation,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>including \u2018ticketing, boarding procedures, provision of food and drink, and baggage handling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Hodges, supra, </em>44 F.3d at 336); <em>see also Air Transport Ass\u2019n of Am. v. Cuomo, </em>520 F.3d 218, 223 (2d Cir.2008) (confirming that the \u201cmajority\u201d of the circuit courts hold \u201cthat the term refers to the provision or anticipated provision of labor from the airline to its passengers and encompasses matters such as boarding procedures, baggage handling, and food and drink-matters incidental to and distinct form the actual transportation of passengers\u201d). Given the broad meaning the United States Supreme Court has already accorded to the phrase encompassing the term \u201cservice[,]\u201d we determine that the broad, majority definition more closely comports with congressional intent. <em>See Wolens, supra, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>at 228, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 824, 130 L.Ed.2d at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Employing the definition accepted by the majority of the circuit courts, then, we determine that plaintiffs claims, under the CFA, are preempted because the claims relate to a \u201cservice.\u201d As explained above, the term \u201cservice\u201d includes \u201c[elements of the air carrier service bargain[,]\u201d which \u201cinclude[s] provision of food and drink.\u201d <em>Hodges, supra, </em>44 F.3d at 336. Further, the provision of an airline entertainment headset falls squarely within that definition, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Based on our analysis of the statutory language and case law, we are also satisfied plaintiffs common law fraud and tort claims are preempted by Section 41713(b)(1), as they \u201crelate to a price, route, or service of any airline carrier\u201d involved in the sale of airline goods. Any contrary interpretation would be unsupported by the language of the statute, longstanding principles of statutory construction, and the expressed reasoning of the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Morales, supra, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>at 384-85,112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2037, 119 L.Ed.2d at 168; <em>see also Wolens, supra, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>at 232, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 826, 130 L.Ed.2d at 728; <em>Vail, supra, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 298, 616 A.2d 523. Accordingly, we affirm the motion court\u2019s dismissal of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Plaintiff argues that the motion court improperly denied his cross-motion to certify a class action consisting of claims of all low income individuals and unaccompanied minors that have traveled on Continental flights since the institution of the cashless cabin policy and have been deprived of the opportunity to purchase amenities on those flights. We need not address this issue because we have already held that plaintiffs claims are preempted by the ADA. We add only the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As a threshold issue, plaintiffs putative class action is improper, because plaintiff himself lacks standing as a member of the putative class. <em>Rule </em>4:32-1 provides that \u201cone or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties[J\u201d It is well established that, in order to bring a class action lawsuit, the named representative must individually have standing to bring their claims. <em>See R. </em>4:32\u20141(a)(3); <em>Holmes v. Pension Plan of Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>213 F.3d 124, 135 (3d Cir.2000) (plaintiff who lacks the personalized, redressable injury required for standing to assert claims on his own behalf would also lack standing to assert similar claims on behalf of class); <em>Laufer v. U.S. Life Ins. Co. in City of New York, </em>385 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 186, 896 A.2d 1101 (App.Div.2006). Consequently, \u201cif the named plaintiffs bringing class action claims do not individually have standing to bring those claims, the case should be dismissed prior to the class certification process.\u201d <em>Ramirez v. STi Prepaid LLC, </em>644 F.Supp.2d 496, 504 (D.N.J.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Plaintiffs putative class would consist of unaccompanied minors, low income individuals and others who are not in possession of credit cards. Plaintiff does not have standing as the class representative, however, because plaintiff is neither an unaccompanied minor nor a person without a credit card. It is undisputed that plaintiff has a credit card and used it to pay defendant\u2019s baggage fee and the fee for the headset on his previous flight. Consequently, plaintiff does not have standing to bring these claims on behalf of the other members of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The remainder of plaintiffs arguments are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-10\"> As a matter of fairness and judicial economy, plaintiff cannot now appeal from his own voluntary dismissal of his breach of contract claim. <em>See Winberry v. Salisbury, </em>5 <em>N.J. </em>240, 255, 74 A.2d 406, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 <em>U.S. </em>877, 71 <em>S.Ct. </em>123, 95 <em>L.Ed. </em>638 (1950); <em>Cooper Medical Ctr. v.

However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>because defendant moved to dismiss under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), and the motion court was guided by the principles under that rule, we likewise limit our review to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b131-13\"> The Court in <em>Wolens, supra, </em>concluded that, notwithstanding its preemption clause, \"the ADA permits state-law-based court adjudication of routine breach-of-contract claims . . . .\" 513 <em>U.S. </em>at 232, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 826, 130 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 728. Here, of course, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed that claim and, consequently, cannot appeal from that decision. <em>See infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
