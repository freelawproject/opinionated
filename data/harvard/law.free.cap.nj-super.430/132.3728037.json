The court\u2019s decision nullifies a \u201cstop work\u201d order issued by the Borough and authorizes plaintiff Daniel Motley to restore his nonconforming house, which had been torn down to its foundation and footings, back to its prior dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to nullify the stop work order because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68 allows a nonconforming structure to be rebuilt only if it has been \u201cpartially\u201d destroyed. We also reverse the decision because the record establishes that plaintiffs dismantling of all of the interior and exterior walls and his attempt to rebuild the house exceeded the scope of the zoning permit that had been issued to him. However, we affirm the trial court\u2019s rejection of plaintiffs separate claim that the stop work order should be invalidated by principles of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Plaintiff is the owner of property located on Block 65, Lot 55 in the Borough of Seaside Park, with an address of 213 \u201c0\u201d Street. The property lies within Seaside Park\u2019s R-3 zone, which is restricted to single-family uses. The parties agree that the property is a pre-existing nonconforming use, as it contains two structures, the front building (\u201c213A\u201d) and the rear building (\u201c213B\u201d), which were erected in or around 1931, long before the zone restrictions were put into effect in 1972. Both buildings are used as single-family dwellings. Plaintiffs brother has occupied the rear build<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff, meanwhile, occupied the front building for a number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">When plaintiff bought the property with his brother in 1999, the front building\u2019s main floor had two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. Above the main floor was a loft area, which was used as a \u201ckids\u2019 room.\u201d The property does not conform to the zoning ordinance\u2019s bulk requirements with respect to its lot width, lot depth, lot area, front yard setback, rear yard setback, side yard setback, and building coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Plaintiff initially decided in 2007 to pursue renovations of the front house after pipes in its hot water system burst in or about 2006 and caused significant water damage. In addition, he sought to add a complete second story to that building. To that end, plaintiff filed an application with the Board for a use variance to authorize the second floor addition as an expansion of a nonconforming use. Plaintiff also sought numerous associated bulk variances.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The Board denied the variance application in February 2008. In its resolution memorializing that denial, the Board noted, among other things, that the property \u201ccontains a pre-existing non-conforming use and expansion of said use would only exacerbate the condition therein.\u201d The Board also determined that the numerous bulk variances that plaintiff requested \u201cwould not provide any added benefit and instead [would] cause substantial detriment to the immediate neighborhood.\u201d In addition, the Board found that the proposed project did not \u201cpromote the purposes of zoning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Having failed to obtain variances, plaintiff revised his approach and filed an application for a zoning permit with the Borough in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>August 2009. His permit application sought to allow \u201crepair [and] renovation of [the] existing dwelling\u201d at 213A and to allow for replacement of 213A\u2019s aireonditioning unit. Plaintiff included the construction plans with the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The Borough\u2019s new zoning officer, James Mackie, approved the permit application on August 28,2009. However, Mackie noted on the approval form that there was to be \u201c[n]o expansion of [the structure\u2019s] dimensions.\u201d Mackie also wrote on the approval form: \u201c[s]iding, shingles, additional [windows] only \u2014 no bump-outs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff sought and obtained several other permits in relation to his project, which are not germane to the zoning issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">According to his testimony in the record, Ralph Finelli, a licensed architect retained by plaintiff in developing the renovation plan, characterized the project as a \u201crehab [of] the entire building\u201d and a \u201ctotal renovation\u201d of the building\u2019s interior and exterior. Finelli stated that the plan included in plaintiff\u2019s application provided for replacement of the \u201croof, frame and finish,\u201d and a new floor. He also noted that a new staircase was to be installed to replace an existing \u201cship[ ] ladder\u201d that led into the loft area, and a new upstairs bathroom was to be installed. Finelli further stated that the renovation plan would not change the structure\u2019s existing dimensions..</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Steven Lisa, plaintiffs construction superintendent for the renovations of 213A, testified that the roof was removed first. According to Lisa, as the work on the house progressed, it became clear that there was more damage to the structure than was initially known. Lisa stated that the structure was in \u201c[m]uch worse\u201d condition than he had anticipated. Among other things, parts of the building had been made from \u201cdebris,\u201d and there was \u201cno consistency to the dimensioning\u201d of the wall frames. The roof was also leaking, and the hot water system in the loft had leaked and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>caused part of the first-floor ceiling to collapse. Lisa stated that the hope was to keep as much of the existing walls as possible to save costs, but that the condition of the structure did not permit that approach. Many floor beams were rotted, and the \u201cmain center beam through the middle of the house\u201d was sagging \u201csix to eight inches.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Eventually, a building inspector<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Borough, Gary Swizczynski, determined that the entire structure needed to be removed. The building was not habitable before construction began, and evidently had not been habitable since 2005 or 2006. Plaintiff proceeded with the demolition, without contacting Mackie, the zoning official.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On February 4, 2010, the Borough\u2019s code enforcement officer, Patrick Linkovieh, issued a stop work order, after discovering the extent to which plaintiff and his contractors had demolished the front building. According to Mackie, the order was issued because too much of the building had been removed, to an extent that the project had become, in essence, \u201call new construction.\u201d Mackie described the state of the premises at that point as \u201can existing building that had been stripped of all it[s] siding materials, and roofing materials, and that it was strictly a ... gutted shell[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">By the time plaintiff received the stop work order, the floor was still in place but many of the floor beams had been removed, new framing had been installed for all four walls, and the foundation was intact. In addition, a new plate had been installed in the foundation to replace a rotted one.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">According to Mackie, plaintiffs actions in tearing down the structure to its foundation and footings went beyond the scope of the zoning permit that had been issued for the project. The extent of the demolition had not been set forth in the plans that plaintiff had submitted when applying for the permit. Mackie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>understood the structural facets of the plans to call only for new windows cut into the existing walls, re-siding by way of new shingles, and a new roof. He stated that the terms \u201creconstruction\u201d or \u201crebuild\u201d should have been included in the plans if plaintiff had wanted approval for the building to be torn down to its foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Plaintiff contested the issuance of the stop work order and sought to have it vacated by the Board. He contended that the construction plans, which he had shown to Mackie before the zoning permit was issued, sufficiently alerted the Borough to the possibility that the walls might need to be removed. Plaintiff claimed that he had discussed with Mackie replacing the floor joists, insulation, and exterior wall framing, and that he had also discussed installing \u201ccomposition siding with Tyvek [insulation material].\u201d In the alternative, plaintiff requested that the Board grant him a use variance to allow the construction to continue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The Board conducted three public hearings on this matter. It heard testimony from plaintiff, his architect Finelli, and his construction superintendent Lisa. It also heard competing testimony from Mackie. In addition, the Board considered comments by several neighbors who were opposed to plaintiffs project, including one neighbor who described the tight fit of the two houses on the lot as the equivalent of \u201cfive pound[s] of sausage in a three pound bag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">One of the factors considered by the Board was a provision in the Borough\u2019s zoning ordinance, \u00a7 25-616(E), stating that a preexisting nonconforming use may be repaired or maintained, so long as the repair or maintenance does not result in the \u201ctotal destruction\u201d of the property. That ordinance provision is consistent with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">Any nonconforming use or structure existing at the time of the passage of an ordinance may be continued upon the lot or in the structure so occupied and <em>any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>such structure may be restored or repaired in the event of partial destruction thereof.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The parties disputed, and continue to dispute, whether or not the demolition of the front building comprised \u201ctotal destruction\u201d or merely \u201cpartial destruction.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Finelli testified for plaintiff that the remaining footings and foundation of the structure represent \u201cconservatively 15 percent of the building and as much as maybe 20 percent of the building.\u201d Finelli added that \u201cthe footing remain[s] in the ground, the foundation wall remains in the ground, and a new wood frame structure [has been] put on top of the pre-existing, remaining footing and foundation.\u201d On this basis, he disputed the Borough\u2019s position that there had been \u201ctotal destruction\u201d of the structure. Mackie, on the other hand, testified that more than ninety-five percent of the structure had been removed. He stated that, given this degree of removal, the decision to issue the stop work order, although not his own, was a \u201cno brainer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">On December 13, 2010, the Board unanimously denied plaintiffs application to lift the stop work order. In its resolution explaining its reasoning, the Board found that Mackie had approved a \u201crepair [and] renovation\u201d of the existing building, with limitations. The Board further determined that, although the plans indicated that a wooden floor and the existing roof frame would be removed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>replaced, it did not discern anything in the plans that allowed for the walls to be replaced or removed. The Board thus found that the \u201cdemolition and reconstruction effected by the applicant far exceeds the zoning approvals granted,\u201d and concluded that the stop work order was properly issued. The Board also determined that plaintiffs installation of stairs, plumbing, and a bathroom in the loft constituted an impermissible expansion of the nonconforming use by creating a second story of living quarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Plaintiff then filed an action in lieu of prerogative writs in the Law Division, seeking to overturn the Board\u2019s decision. Upon considering the parties\u2019 respective positions on de novo review, the trial court issued a written decision on January 24, 2012, reversing the Board\u2019s denial of plaintiffs request to lift the stop work order and allowing plaintiff to continue certain development of the property. In particular, the court\u2019s decision allowed plaintiff to reconstruct the property\u2019s walls and loft, provided that the structure\u2019s dimensions not be expanded. The court disallowed, however, the installation of plumbing, a bathroom, and a living area in the building\u2019s loft. On February 8, 2012, the trial court issued an order of judgment reflecting these determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In its written statement of reasons, the trial court found that \u201cit was not unreasonable for [plaintiff] to remove and replace the building\u2019s walls upon discovery of the unsafe and dilapidated condition of the existing walls.\u201d The court perceived that, to encourage property owners\u2019 compliance with safety codes, the sounder policy is to allow the \u201crenovation of debilitated nonconforming structures\u201d as long as there is no unlawful expansion of the nonconformity. Because plaintiffs replacement of the walls here did not alter the dimensions of the structure, the court found that such replacement should be allowed without the need for variance relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The trial court rejected, however, plaintiffs invocation of the doctrine of equitable estoppel as an independent basis for relief from the stop work order. Moreover, the court found that installation of plumbing, a bathroom, and a sleeping area in the loft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>constituted an improper expansion of the nonconforming use, and thus concluded that the Board had not erred in refusing to allow those particular additions without a use variance. In sum, the court determined that plaintiff was \u201centitled to renovate the front building to its use and within the dimensions that existed prior to the renovations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The Board now appeals. It argues that the trial court misapplied the governing law in vacating the stop work order and in allowing plaintiff to proceed with the reconstruction of his nonconforming structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Plaintiff opposes the Board\u2019s contentions, arguing that the trial court had a sound basis to vacate the stop work order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the alternative, plaintiff argues that, even if <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-68 is read to not authorize his reconstruction of the premises back to its prior dimensions, he nevertheless should be allowed to finish the reconstruction work based upon equitable principles of estoppel and relative hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">We begin our analysis with a recognition of the well-settled law of our state that disfavors the continuation of nonconforming uses and structures.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Although land use laws may confer a right to continue a pre-existing nonconforming use, \u201cthe policy of the law is to restrict them closely[.]\u201d <em>Hay v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>37 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 464, 117 <em>A.</em>2d 650 (1955). This is because their \u201c \u2018tendency is to subvert rather than support sound planning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grundlehner v. Dangler, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>256, 274, 148 A.2d 806 (1959) (Burling, J., concurring) (quoting <em>Ranney v. Istituto Pontificio Delle Maestre </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Filippini, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>189, 196, 119 A.2d 142 (1955)). Accordingly, municipalities \u201cmay impose restrictions on nonconforming uses, including prohibiting their expansion.\u201d <em>Conselice v. Borough of Seaside Park, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>327, 333, 817 A.2d 988 (App.Div. 2003). Municipalities may not, however, take \u201cactive\u201d steps to eliminate nonconforming uses, and must wait with \u201c \u2018fervent hope that they would in time wither and die and be replaced by conforming uses.\u2019\u201d <em>Fred McDowell, Inc. v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>201, 214, 757 A.2d 822 (App.Div.2000) (quoting <em>Grundlehner, supra, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>at 263, 148 A.2d 806), <em>certif. denied, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>88, 769 A.2d 1051 (2001). Moreover, given the statutory objective to eradicate nonconforming uses over time, local governing bodies may not adopt ordinances that authorize the restoration or replacement of all nonconforming structures, even on the condition that the cubic size of the replacement structure does not exceed the size of the existing structure. <em>Avalon Home &amp; Land Owners Ass\u2019n v. Borough of Avalon, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>205, 543 A.2d 950 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">As we have noted, the relevant statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68, provides that a nonconforming use or structure \u201cmay be restored or repaired in the event of <em>partial destruction </em>thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added). By contrast, total destruction of such a structure, \u201cwhether by the owner\u2019s design or by accident,\u201d terminates a nonconforming use and the owner\u2019s right to continue that use likewise ceases. <em>S &amp; S Auto Sales, Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>603, 619-20, 862 A.2d 1204 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The term \u201cpartial destruction\u201d is not defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68, nor is the reciprocal concept of \u201ctotal destruction.\u201d Prior cases have construed total destruction to mean \u201csubstantially totally destroyed.\u201d <em>Camara v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 56, 570 A.2d 1012 (App.Div.1990); <em>see also Krul v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>18, 298 A.2d 308 (Law Div.1972), <em>aff'd, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>150, 313 A.2d 220 (App.Div.1973); <em>Twp. of Lacey v. Mohr, </em>119 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 138, 290 A.2d 450 (App.Div.1972). In essence, the test of whether a nonconforming use or structure may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>be restored or repaired is whether there has been some quantity of destruction that surpasses mere partial destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The scenario in <em>Lacey, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 135, 290 A.2d 450 aptly illustrates these concepts. In that case, an inn operating as a pre-existing nonconforming use was damaged by a fire. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 290 A.2d 450. The proprietors attempted to restore portions of the building as living quarters for themselves, but the township brought an action against the proprietor to prevent that restoration. <em>Ibid. </em>The township argued that the destruction of the building caused by the fire \u201cwas so extensive as to preclude [the proprietors\u2019] right to restore it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>At trial, the township contended that sixty-nine percent of the building was totally destroyed, and that an additional fourteen percent was \u201cbadly gutted.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The proprietors conversely asserted that one-third of the structure remained. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial judge accepted the township\u2019s contention that the inn was \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55-48, the statutory precursor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">On appeal in <em>Lacey, </em>we held that the trial court properly disregarded the municipality\u2019s ordinance prohibiting the rebuilding of a nonconforming structure if it had been at least seventy-five percent destroyed. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 290 A.2d 450 (citing <em>H. Behlen &amp; Bros. v. Mayor &amp; Council of Kearny, </em>31 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 37-39, 105 A.2d 894 (App.Div.1954) (invalidating a municipal ordinance allowing restoration of a \u201cbuilding destroyed to an extent less than seventy-five percent of its replacement value\u201d because the ordinance subverted the legislature\u2019s intent in refusing to mandate a \u201crigid formula of that kind\u201d)). We declined to reach whether the Legislature, in using the term \u201cpartial\u201d within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55-48, intended to encompass \u201call destruction [that is] less than total.\u201d Nevertheless, we agreed with the trial court that there was ample support in the record to conclude that \u201cthe use of the building as an inn was substantially totally destroyed ... and therefore its destruction exceeded partial destruction[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>We similarly observed in <em>Kearny, supra, </em>31 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 39, 105 A.2d 894 that what comprises \u201cpartial destruction\u201d depends upon \u201cthe facts of each case,\u201d and that a specific \u201cpercentage delineation by ordinance is not authorized.\u201d Consequently, we need not resolve the numerical disagreement here between plaintiff and the Board in this case as to the specific percentage of destruction to the structure caused by plaintiff and his contractors, nor whether that figure surpasses the fifty-percent level set forth in the Borough\u2019s amended ordinance. Instead, the court must examine the discrete facts presented and determine whether the municipal authorities erred in treating the level of destruction as \u201ctotal\u201d rather than \u201cpartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">In considering the Board\u2019s application of the terms of the statute, we recognize that questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo. <em>James R. Ientile, Inc. v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 329, 638 A.2d 882 (App.Div.1994) (noting that \u201cinterpretation is a judicial function and the conclusions of the Board of Adjustment and the trial court are not, in consequence, entitled to any special deference\u201d) (citing <em>Cherney v. Matawan Borough Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 144-45, 534 A.2d 41 (App.Div.1987)). We therefore accord no special deference to either the Board or the trial court on the legal question of whether plaintiffs destruction of the building was \u201ctotal\u201d or merely \u201cpartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">The trial court noted that the Board had made no finding in this case as to whether the front building had been totally destroyed or merely partially destroyed. We agree with the court that the Board\u2019s resolution, as written, does not express a finding of total destruction in the most straightforward manner. The resolution does state, however, in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">4. The Zoning Permit does not allow destruction and reconstruction of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">5. The demolition and reconstruction effected by the applicant far exceeds the zoning approvals granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The clear implication of these resolution findings, imperfectly as they may be worded, is that the Board found that plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>dismantled the structure to a degree beyond mere \u201cpartial\u201d destruction. That is the position that the Borough\u2019s zoning officer and its code enforcement officer have taken from the inception of the stop work order. We do not interpret the wording of the resolution to convey a more favorable assessment by the Board of what plaintiff had done. Having so construed the resolution, we must now consider whether that clearly-implied finding of total destruction is supported by the record as a matter of law. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The proofs before the Board reflect that, after plaintiffs plan was approved, extensive damage to the front building was discovered. It then became obvious that much more of the house would have to be removed than had been previously anticipated. By the time that the stop work order was issued, only the original foundation and footings remained, and new wall frames had been erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">These circumstances closely resemble the facts in <em>Lacey, supra. </em>Both cases involve nonconforming structures that were destroyed, either by damage or by construction activity, to a considerable extent such that very little of the original structure remained. Here, by removing every part of the structure except the foundation and the footings, plaintiff effected a \u201ctotal destruction\u201d of the front building. <em>See </em>Cox &amp; Koenig, <em>N.J. Zoning &amp; Land Use Admin. </em>11-4 (2012) (noting the \u201crule of thumb\u201d that has developed in many municipalities, where if the foundation and at least two walls remain, the destruction is only partial).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">We recognize that plaintiffs architect Finelli opined that, contrary to the observations of Mackie, at least fifteen to twenty percent of the front building remained. Even if, for the sake of argument, we were to adopt Finelli\u2019s percentage estimate, such percentages are not controlling. <em>Kearny, supra, </em>31 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>39, 105 A.2d 894. Instead, we must consider whether the destruction is so substantial in nature \u2014 qualitatively if not quantitatively \u2014 to surpass the \u201cpartial\u201d threshold that the statute expresses. Having done so, we agree with the Board\u2019s position that plaintiffs removal of all of the walls of the building down to the foundation and footings exceeds any reasonable notion of a mere partial demolition.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">In addressing the question of severity, the trial court relied upon <em>Krul, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 18, 298 A.2d 308. In that ease, the three-story main building of a complex of nonconforming buildings burned down. <em>Id. </em>at 21, 298 A.2d 308. The complex was used for the property owner\u2019s business in the sale and distribution of sheet metal and roofing materials. <em>Id. </em>at 20-22, 298 A.2d <em>308. </em>Although the main building was totally destroyed, a series of one-story buildings occupying most of the remainder of the plot were not destroyed by the fire. <em>Id. </em>at 21-22, 298 A.2d 308. After the fire, the property owner sought a permit to build a one-story building in place of the old one for use in the same business. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 298 A.2d 308. The permit was denied, and litigation ensued. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Law Division judge in <em>Krul </em>took note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55-48, the previously-noted precursor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68, did not contemplate the destruction of a single unit that is part of an overall nonconforming use. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 298 A.2d 308. The statute instead focused only on the destruction of a building which, by itself, constitutes the entire use. <em>See ibid. </em>The judge determined that \u201cthe nonconforming use statute should be interpreted to encompass the destruction of a part of <em>an integrated whole </em>of a business enterprise in the same manner as the destruction of a part of an individual structure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 298 A.2d 308 (emphasis added). The judge therefore ruled that a permit to build the one-story structure in place of the destroyed structure should have been issued. <em>Id. </em>at 28-29, 298 A.2d 308. Our court affirmed that disposition, for the reasons expressed by the Law Division. 126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 152, 313 A.2d 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>We disagree with the trial court that the present case is sufficiently analogous to <em>Krul </em>to justify reversal of the Board\u2019s determination. <em>Krul </em>involved the destruction of a building that was a part of a use comprised, as \u201can integrated whole,\u201d by an entire complex of buildings on the site. Here, the use of the front house is entirely independent of the use of the rear house. Each building is a stand-alone residence. We therefore regard <em>Krul </em>as factually distinguishable, and discern no inconsistency in reaching an opposite conclusion in the present case on these facts. The extent of destruction here was clearly not partial. Absent a variance, plaintiff had no right to restore the nonconforming structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In granting plaintiff relief in this matter, the trial judge was swayed by policy considerations that, in the judge\u2019s estimation, warranted a more lenient application of the statutory standards that govern nonconforming structures and uses. The judge determined that \u201cit was not unreasonable for [plaintiff] to remove and replace the building\u2019s walls upon discovery of the unsafe and dilapidated condition of the existing walls.\u201d In reaching that conclusion, the judge expressed the view that a sounder policy approach is to permit the \u201crenovation of debilitated non-conforming structures,\u201d as long as there is no unlawful expansion of the nonconformity. The judge reasoned that because plaintiffs replacement of the walls here did not expand the dimensions of the structure, the replacement should be judicially permitted without the need for variance relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">We appreciate the trial judge\u2019s concern that the limitations on reconstruction that are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68 may sometimes lead to harsh outcomes for owners of nonconforming structures who innocently come to learn that their buildings must be demolished. That policy concern, however, to the extent it has any validity, is best reserved for a potential legislative response, either through statutory amendments or through the adoption of municipal ordinances within the powers delegated to local govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ing bodies. <em>Cf. Avalon Home, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 212-13, 543 A.2d 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">For example, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Avalon Home, </em>a municipality may revise its ordinances to designate certain previously-disallowed uses as permitted or conditional uses within a particular zone. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 543 A.2d 950. Another possibility, which plaintiff in this case unsuccessfully pursued in 2007 and 2008, is to demonstrate entitlement to a property-specific use variance, under the standards set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d). <em>Ibid. </em>Such remedial measures are appropriately authorized by local \u201celected and appointed officials,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 213, 543 A.2d 950, or by the Legislature, rather than through policy choices made by the judiciary, <em>see Des Champs Labs., Inc. v. Martin, </em>427 <em>N.J.Super. 84, 108, </em>47 A.3d 25 (App.Div.2012). We <em>offer no view on </em>whether such enactments should be pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In any event, the trial court\u2019s policy concerns about hardship to innocent property owners are misplaced in this case. Plaintiff allowed his roof and hot water system to leak until the loft floor caved in. Several of the neighbors who spoke at the Board\u2019s hearings observed that the property had not been well maintained. Although plaintiff conceivably might not have known that the leaks had caused such extensive damage to the walls, the record suggests that the damage to the structure could have been prevented or abated with proper care.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">As the case law repeatedly observes, nonconforming uses and structures \u201csubvert\u201d sound planning. <em>Grundlehner, supra, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>at 274, 148 A.2d 806. <em>It </em>is therefore the prerogative of municipalities to ensure that such non-conformities eventually \u201cwither and die.\u201d <em>McDowell, supra, </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 214, 757 A.2d 822. Accordingly, if an owner such as plaintiff allows his nonconforming building to degrade into a poor condition that requires a complete destruction of the building, the municipality should be permitted to terminate that use and require conformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Apart from these statutory underpinnings in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-68, the stop work order in this case was also justified by plaintiffs improper conduct in exceeding the limitations of the zoning permit that had been issued to him. Mackie\u2019s notations on the permit clearly show that the authorized work was limited in nature. The approval covered siding, shingles, and additional windows, but not \u201cbumpouts.\u201d The permit did not state that plaintiff was authorized to remove all of the walls of the house down to its footing and foundation and then to rebuild the structure. Nor do the plans submitted by plaintiff conspicuously state that removal of all of the walls was contemplated. The plans do specify that the roof on the house was to be replaced, but that is hardly a disclosure that the walls beneath the roof also would be removed. Nor is the generic reference in the plans to the \u201cRenovation Code\u201d a sufficient indication that all four walls were expected to come down.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, the building inspector\u2019s determination that the structure was unsafe and needed to be dismantled was not an authorization to rebuild it.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Plaintiff had no legal right to exceed what the zoning officer\u2019s permit authorized. <em>See, e.g., Lang v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>41, 733 A.2d 464 (1999) (affirming a zoning board\u2019s grant of a variance under <em>N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-70(c) which imposed a number of restrictions on the applicant\u2019s intended construction); <em>Burbridge v. Mine Hill, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>376, 568 A.2d 527 (1990) (similarly affirming a conditional variance grant under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)); <em>see also N.J.S.A </em>40:55D-18 (noting a municipality\u2019s authority to issue zoning permits as a precondition to the \u201cerection, construction, ... conversion, removal or destruction of any building\u201d). Having gone well beyond the permit\u2019s limitations, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>cannot fairly complain about the Board\u2019s actions enforcing those limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Plaintiff next contends that the Board and the municipality should be equitably estopped from complaining about the destruction of the property, including the removal of the supporting walls. The thrust of his argument in this regard is that Maekie\u2019s issuance of a zoning permit entitled him to perform the extensive renovations that he ultimately undertook. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">It is well established that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is \u201c \u2018rarely invoked against a governmental entity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Middletown Twp. Policemen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n Local No. 124 v. Twp. of Middletown, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>361, 367, 744 A.2d 649 (2000) (quoting <em>Wood v. Borough of Wildwood Crest, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>650, 656, 726 A.2d 310 (App.Div.1999)). Equitable estoppel may only be applied against a governmental entity \u201cwhere the interests of justice, morality and common fairness clearly dictate that course.\u201d <em>Gruber v. Mayor of Raritan, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>1, 13, 186 A.2d 489 (1962); <em>see also Twp. of Neptune v. N.J., Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>422, 438, 41 A.3d 792 (App.Div.2012) (rejecting an appellant\u2019s equitable estoppel claim against the State, even though the appellant was likewise a governmental entity).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">In the specific context of the issuance of building permits, the application of estoppel requires proof of four elements: (1) the building permit was issued in good faith, (2) the building inspector acted \u201c \u201cwithin the ambit of [his] duty\u2019 \u201d in issuing the permit, (3) a sufficient question of interpretation of the relevant statutes or zoning ordinances as to \u201crender doubtful a charge that the ... official acted without any reasonable basis\u201d for issuing the permit, and (4) there was \u201c \u2018proper good faith reliance\u2019 \u201d on the issuance of the permit. <em>Jesse A. Howland &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Borough of Freehold, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>484, 489, 363 A.2d 913 (App.Div.) (quoting <em>Hill v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>156, 162, 299 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>737 (App.Div.1972)), <em>certif. denied, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>466, 371 A.2d 70 (1976). Even assuming, for the sake of discussion, the first three of these elements are present here, the fourth element of plaintiff\u2019s \u201cgood faith reliance\u201d has not been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Plaintiff attempts to liken his circumstances, and his claim of reliance, to the circumstances in <em>Hill, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>156, 299 A.2d 737. In that case, a married couple applied for a permit to make certain additions to their home. <em>Id. </em>at 158, 299 A.2d 737. Their proposed additions would have reduced their sideyard setback to only four feet. <em>Ibid. </em>Although the local ordinance required a sideyard setback of seven feet, the building inspector nevertheless issued the permit in error. <em>Ibid. </em>Four months later, after \u201csubstantial\u201d work on the project had been completed, the error was discovered and the permit was revoked. <em>Id. </em>at 159, 299 A.2d 737. By then, the foundation had been laid and inspected, the rough framing of the rooms and garage had been completed, the roof had been \u201crough-sheathed\u201d and partially shingled, and the side of the garage and rear of the addition had also been rough-sheathed. <em>Ibid. </em>The homeowners had spent $3500 of an estimated cost of $6000. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">On appeal in <em>Hill, </em>we determined that the building inspector had acted erroneously but \u201cwithin the province of [his] general duties,\u201d and so estoppel was not precluded for that reason. <em>Id. </em>at 162, 299 A.2d 737. Moreover, given the delay in the discovery of the inspector\u2019s error, and the intervening investments made by the homeowners in carrying out their plan, we ruled that the application of estoppel was appropriate and the homeowners should not be prevented from continuing their project. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 299 A.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The present case is fundamentally different than <em>Hill. </em>The homeowners in <em>Hill </em>reasonably relied upon the explicit approval of their plan, and actually followed it. Here, plaintiff received only a limited zoning approval of his plan, which allowed for \u201csiding, shingles, [and] additional windows only[.]\u201d Plaintiff then proceeded to remove every part of the building, except the foundation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>footings, and started to put up new walls. By doing so, plaintiff and Ms agents exceeded the scope of the zoning approval and created the very proMem from which he now seeks to extract himself. The circumstances do not present a situation where a person has reasonably relied on a zoning official\u2019s express permission to do something. Such reliance being an essential aspect of estoppel, <em>see Boritz v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>640, 647, 968 A.2d 1223 (App.Div.2009), the doctrine does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Plaintiff acted at his peril, as he failed to consult with Mackie or other appropriate zomng officials before removing the flooring and walls within the house and beginning to erect new walls. If, hypothetically, he had been unsure about the extent of work authorized by the zoning permit, he was obligated to consult with such officials before going further.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">For similar reasons, we reject plaintiffs related argument that the stop work order should be overturned based upon a notion of relative hardship. The concept of relative hardship is also an eqmtable doctrine, which can apply when mistakes are made by local officials in issuing permits despite violations of zoMng ordinances. In such circumstances, the courts may consider the hardship of removing the nonconformity in determining whether to force the homeowner to do so. <em>See Hill, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 164, 299 A.2d 737; <em>Cohen v. Bd. of Adjustment, </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 621, 935 A.2d 842 (App.Div.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Applying the doctrine of relative hardship in <em>Hill, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 164, 299 A.2d 737, we noted that the homeowners m that case would be forced to destroy the improvements that they had made before the litigation was brought. Apart from the funds the homeowners had already spent, it would have cost them additional outlays and would have rendered the garage too small for its intended use. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the complaining neighbor in that case would \u201chave suffered no discermble damage by the proposed eonstruction[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In fact, the Board of Adjustment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>found that the sideyard violation was \u201cconsistent with many properties in the neighborhood.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">We revisited the concept of relative hardship in <em>Cohen, supra, </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 610-21, 935 A.2d 842. In that case, the homeowner hired two architectural firms to draw plans for a new home to replace his current home. <em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 935 A.2d 842. The plans were submitted to the borough, which then issued a building permit. <em>Id. </em>at 611, 935 A.2d 842. The plans \u201con their face appeared to conform to the zoning requirements,\u201d but did not with respect to building coverage and total lot coverage. <em>Ibid. </em>Neither architectural firm reviewed the local zoning ordinance before preparing the plans. <em>Ibid. </em>During construction, it was discovered that the house exceeded the building and lot coverage standards, and a stop work order was issued. <em>Ibid. </em>The zoning board also declined to issue a variance. <em>Id. </em>at 613-14, 935 A.2d 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We distinguished the facts in <em>Cohen </em>from those presented in <em>Hill, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 158-59, 299 A.2d 737. In <em>Hill, </em>\u201cthe errors in the plans ... were apparent on their face, and the municipal budding inspector made a mistake in issuing the building permit.\u201d <em>Cohen, supra, </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 621, 935 A.2d 842. By contrast, the plan in <em>Cohen </em>\u201cappeared to comply with the zoning regulations\u201d and \u201cthe fault was primarily with [the homeowner] and his professionals, not with the municipal building inspeetor[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>For this reason, we determined in <em>Cohen </em>that the doctrine of relative hardship was not applicable under such circumstances. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Plaintiff urges that principles of relative hardship should be applied in this case, so that the funds that he has already expended in this project are not wasted. We disagree. We recognize that Mackie acknowledged in his testimony before the Board that he had overlooked certain aspects of plaintiffs plan when it was initially submitted. However, that oversight did not fundamentally cause plaintiffs financial loss. The root cause of plaintiffs loss was plaintiff himself, in ignoring the limitations of Mackie\u2019s approval and in failing to consult with the proper local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>officials when it appeared that all of the walls needed to be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s rejection of plaintiffs equity-based arguments but reverse the court\u2019s nullification of the Borough\u2019s stop work order. The stop work order, and the Board\u2019s decision upholding that order, are therefore reinstated. The trial court shall issue a conforming order implementing our disposition within twenty days of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-10\"> At oral argument on the appeal, we learned from counsel that the rear building was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012.

As of September 1, 2009, the ordinance was amended to define \"total destruction\u201d as no more than fifty percent of the structure or the building\u2019s square footage \u201cbased on the evaluation by both the Borough\u2019s Zoning Officer and the Construction Official using the Borough\u2019s Evaluation Checklist.\u201d Mackie, however, could not recall consulting such a checklist when the stop work order was issued.
