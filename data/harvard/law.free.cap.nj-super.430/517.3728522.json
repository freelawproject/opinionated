Count eight was dismissed by the court prior to trial. Defendant was tried <em>in absentia. </em>The jury acquitted defendant of unlawful possession of assault firearms and handguns without a permit (counts one and two), but convicted him of the remaining charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">On November 18, 2011, the court sentenced defendant as follows: on counts three and four, to five years imprisonment with a mandatory minimum three-year period of incarceration pursuant to the Graves Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6(c); on counts five and six, to eighteen months imprisonment; and on count seven, to three years imprisonment. The court ordered the sentences to run concurrently. Therefore, defendant was sentenced to an aggregate five-year term of imprisonment with a three-year period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>parole ineligibility. Appropriate monetary penalties were also imposed, including reimbursement to Hunterdon County for the cost of defendant\u2019s extradition from Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Defendant presents the following arguments on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">THE COURT BELOW ERRED IN FAILING TO DISMISS THE FIREARM CHARGES IN THE INDICTMENT EVEN THOUGH IT REALIZED THE CASE WAS INCORRECTLY PRESENTED TO THE GRAND JURY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">THE COURT BELOW ERRED BY FAILING TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE AND STATEMENTS GLEANED FROM THE UNLAWFUL DETENTION OF DEFENDANT AND THE WARRANTLESS, UNCONSENTED SEARCH OF HIS AUTOMOBILE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-12\">THE COURT BELOW ERRED BY CONDUCTING THE TRIAL IN DEFENDANT\u2019S ABSENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-13\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-14\">THE DEFENDANT WAS ERRONEOUSLY CONVICTED FOR POSSESSING LARGE CAPACITY AMMUNITION MAGAZINES BECAUSE THE STATE FAILED TO MEET THE ELEMENTS OF ITS CASE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-15\">\n<em>POINT V</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-16\">DEFENDANT\u2019S POSSESSION OF HOLLOW NOSE AMMUNITION WAS PROTECTED BY <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-3(g)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-17\">\n<em>POINT VI</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-18\">DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION FOR HINDERING SHOULD BE REVERSED BECAUSE IT WAS THE RESULT OF AN UNLAWFUL CONFESSION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvS\">\n<em>POINT VII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-19\">THE DEFENDANT\u2019S POSSESSION OF HIS LAWFULLY ACQUIRED PROPERTY WAS PROTECTED UNDER THE SECOND AMENDMENT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-20\">We have considered these arguments in light of the record and the applicable law and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-22\">At approximately 3:25 a.m. on March 20, 2009, Patrolman Gregory Wester of the Readington Township Police Department was on routine patrol when he observed a Toyota sport utility vehicle (SUV) with its lights off, parked behind a Wachovia Bank. As Wester pulled into the bank\u2019s parking lot to investigate, he turned on his overhead lights, which activated a mobile video <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>recorder on his dashboard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After notifying the police dispatcher of his location, Wester approached the vehicle with a flashlight.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Wester noticed that the vehicle had Texas license plates and that an individual, later identified as defendant, was sleeping in the driver\u2019s seat under a blanket. Wester testified that when he woke defendant, he appeared \u201cnervous and tired.\u201d According to Wester, defendant \u201chad trouble maintaining eye contact\u201d and when asked \u201ca basic question he would think about it and stutter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Defendant provided Wester with a Texas driver\u2019s license but could not produce the vehicle registration or proof of insurance. When Wester inquired about a Texas license plate on the floor near the center console that was different from the plates on the SUV, defendant said the plates on the vehicle had expired, and he had difficulty installing the current plates which were in the vehicle. Defendant also said he had been a police officer in Maine and had stopped to rest while traveling from Maine to Texas, but defendant was unable to produce any law enforcement identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Wester noticed several items \u201cstacked\u201d on the backseat of the SUV, and he asked if there was anything illegal in the vehicle. Defendant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Wester also asked defendant if he was transporting any firearms, and defendant responded, \u201cNo, no, all good.\u201d At that point, Wester used his flashlight to illuminate the rear passenger compartment, and he saw two nylon firearm cases on the backseat of defendant\u2019s vehicle. Wester again asked if there were any firearms in the SUV, and defendant again answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Wester testified, \u201cOnce I saw the firearms I didn\u2019t say anything about it. I didn\u2019t want to alert him. I immediately radioed for backup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">When a backup officer arrived, Wester confronted defendant about the cases on the backseat of the vehicle. Wester said he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>saw \u201ca case in there that looks very, very similar to what I have in my house for my long arm, so I\u2019m going to ask you again [are] there any firearms in the car.\u201d This time, defendant admitted he had \u201clong arms that [he was] moving to Texas,\u201d which were registered in Texas. Defendant was ordered out of the vehicle and patted down for weapons, but none were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">After two more officers arrived, Wester asked for consent to search the vehicle. Defendant denied consent. Wester asked how many firearms were in the vehicle, and defendant answered, \u201cThree shotguns [and] an AR-15.\u201d Wester also asked if there were any handguns in the SUV. Defendant said he was \u201cnot sure,\u201d even though he acknowledged he had packed the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Wester then opened the back door of defendant\u2019s SUV and removed the two nylon cases. Wester testified he did so \u201cfor safety reasons\u201d and to make sure the firearms were being \u201ctransported in a safe manner.\u201d As Wester was examining the cases, defendant told another officer there were \u201capproximately twelve firearms\u201d in the vehicle, including \u201ca loaded Glock handgun\u201d behind the driver\u2019s seat. Once defendant admitted there was a loaded handgun in his vehicle, he was charged with hindering his own apprehension, advised of his <em>Miranda? </em>rights, and handcuffed. Wester then returned the firearm cases to the vehicle, and it was towed to the Readington Township Police Department. Later that same morning, Wester applied for and obtained a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">A search of defendant\u2019s vehicle revealed twenty-one<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> firearms, including rifles, shotguns, and handguns. In addition, the police recovered hollow-nose bullets from the Glock handgun and a large capacity magazine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>When Wester testified before the grand jury, he provided a summary of the firearms and other items recovered from defendant\u2019s vehicle. He also stated that defendant\u2019s SUV did not have a trunk, but rather a \u201crear compartment,\u201d and that defendant did not have a New Jersey permit to purchase or carry firearms or a New Jersey firearms purchaser ID card.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Wester explained that several of the rifles and shotguns were located on the backseat of defendant\u2019s vehicle and were stored in either nylon or cloth cases that closed with zippers or Velcro flaps, and none of the firearms were in locked containers. One of the grand jurors asked whether defendant would have been charged if the firearms were \u201clocked in a box and separated.\u201d The prosecutor responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">No. There are actually some exceptions to the requirements----Basically, if someone is moving ... from Residence A [to] Residence B, or transporting, say, for example, they just purchased it, so they can transport it to then- home, if they are properly secured, locked in a trunk, locked in a special lockbox and unloaded, then that would most likely provide an exception to these requirements, and therefore a defense to being charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">So, that is a factor to consider how the weapons were contained and, again, whether they were loaded, whether they were in a lockbox.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">The prosecutor also read the exemption for transporting firearms under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6(g), which requires a firearm to \u201cbe carried unloaded and contained in a closed and fastened case, gunbox, securely tied package, or locked in the trunk of the automobile in which it is being transported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Defendant filed three pretrial motions: a motion to dismiss the indictment, a motion to suppress evidence obtained with and without a search warrant, and a motion to suppress his statements to the police. Wester was the only witness to testify at the suppression hearing. Except for dismissing count eight of the indictment, which charged defendant with obstructing the administration of law, the court denied the motions on March 8, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>During a pretrial conference on April 16, 2010, the court informed defendant of his right to be present at trial and that the trial was scheduled for August 9, 2010. The court also informed defendant that if he failed to appear, the trial could proceed in his absence. Defendant stated that he understood. Nevertheless, defendant failed to appear for his trial, which began on August 9, 2010, and his attorney could not explain his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The State presented testimony from Detective Donald Mundorff, a member of the New Jersey State Police Firearms Investigation Unit. He testified defendant had not applied for a New Jersey firearms ID card, pistol purchase permit, carrying permit, or a permit for an assault weapon. Mundorff conceded on cross-examination, however, that a Maine resident who purchased firearms in Maine would not be required to obtain New Jersey permits or firearms purchaser\u2019s ID cards to transport the firearms through New Jersey, so long as the firearms were transported in accordance with 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 926A, which regulates the interstate transportation of firearms. 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 926A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle: <em>Provided, </em>That in the case of a vehicle without a compart ment separate from the driver\u2019s compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In addition, the State called Wester and Detective Sergeant Ryan Neiber to document the location of the firearms and additional items recovered from defendant\u2019s SUV through digital photography. Wester testified the SUV did not have a trunk, and some rifles and shotguns were in unlocked nylon or vinyl cases on the backseat of defendant\u2019s vehicle. According to Wester, the rest of the rifles and shotguns were in \u201cgun socks.\u201d Wester testified the gun socks had \u201can opening on one end with Velcro. Just open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the Velcro and you can slide the gun out of the gun sock.\u201d Wester also testified that the Glock handgun, recovered from behind the driver\u2019s seat, was loaded with hollow-nose bullets.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The State\u2019s final witness, Detective Gary Mayer, a ballistics expert with the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, was responsible for determining whether the firearms were operable. Except for one shotgun that was broken, Mayer examined and test-fired each of the firearms and found them to be operational. Mayer also testified that an ammunition magazine recovered from the vehicle, which held approximately thirty bullets, was compatible with two of the semi-automatic weapons he tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Defendant did not present any witnesses. Defense counsel emphasized in his opening and closing statements that defendant was in the process of traveling from his \u201cold residence in Maine\u201d to his \u201cnew residence in Texas,\u201d and that it was lawful for defendant to transport his firearms from \u201cone residence [to] another residence while moving.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney also argued that some of the firearms cases had zippers that were \u201cclosed and fastened\u201d and the cases that did not have zippers were not \u201cany less worthy.\u201d Therefore, defendant \u201cwas within the exemptions of the federal law.\u201d In response, the State stressed that the Glock handgun was loaded, none of the firearms were in locked containers, and the firearms on the backseat of defendant\u2019s vehicle were readily accessible from the driver\u2019s seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The court instructed the jury to consider both state and federal laws regulating the transportation of firearms. The jury was instructed that defendant had a defense under New Jersey law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6(g), if: (1) he was \u201ccarrying or transporting\u201d the firearms \u201cfrom one residence to another or between his residence and place of business\u201d; (2) \u201cthe firearms being transported were carried unloaded\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe firearms were contained in a closed and fastened case, gunbox, securely tied package, or locked in the trunk\u201d of defendant\u2019s vehicle. The jury was told to \u201cconsider the evidence as it pertained to each firearm\u201d in determining whether the defense applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>The jury was further instructed that defendant had a defense under federal law if he was transporting the firearms, including any assault firearms, \u201cfrom one residence where he may lawfully possess and carry\u201d the firearms \u201cto any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry\u201d the firearms; the firearms \u201cbeing transported were carried unloaded\u201d; and neither the firearms nor any ammunition were \u201creadily accessible\u201d or \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d from the passenger compartment of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The jury returned its verdict on August 13, 2010. Defendant was subsequently apprehended and extradited from Texas to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">In his first point, defendant argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment. Defendant primarily claims the indictment is defective because the prosecutor failed to instruct the grand jury on 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 926A. The trial court rejected this argument and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The purpose of the grand jury is to \u201cdetermine whether the State has established a prima facie case that a crime has been committed and that the accused has committed it.\u201d <em>State v. Hogan, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>216, 227, 676 A.2d 533 (1996). The grand jury \u201cis an accusative rather than an adjudicative body,\u201d and requiring it \u201cto weigh inculpatory and exculpatory evidence would alter the grand jury\u2019s historical role.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229-30, 676 A.2d 533. Accordingly, a prosecutor\u2019s duty to present exculpatory evidence \u201carises only if the evidence satisfies two requirements: it must directly negate guilt and must also be clearly exculpatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 676 A.2d 533. In this case, defendant\u2019s SUV did not have a trunk. Therefore, the exemption under the federal statute, 18 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 926A, only applied if defendant\u2019s firearms were stored \u201cin a locked container other 'than the glove compartment or console\u201d of his vehicle. In addition, the federal exemption did not apply because the firearms in the unlocked gun cases on the backseat of the SUV and the loaded handgun behind the driver\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>seat were \u201cdirectly accessible\u201d to defendant. Thus, the prosecutor did not improperly interfere with the grand jury\u2019s decision-making process by failing to explain the federal exemption available to interstate travelers, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the indictment was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In his second point, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained with and without a search warrant and statements made prior to his arrest. Defendant argues it was unreasonable for Wester to seize the two firearm cases without a warrant, because \u201che did not have probable cause to believe any law was being violated\u201d or \u201cexigent circumstances to justify the search.\u201d Defendant also claims the \u201cinitial unlawful search\u201d led to his admission-that there was a loaded handgun behind the driver\u2019s seat, \u201cwhich, in turn, was used to justify the search warrant.\u201d Therefore, defendant contends that \u201call statements and physical evidence found should be suppressed.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u201c[T]he Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution protect citizens against unreasonable police searches and seizures by requiring warrants issued upon probable cause \u2018unless [the search] falls within one of the few well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>192, 205, 793 A.2d 619 (2002) (quoting <em>State v. Maryland, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>471, 482, 771 A.2d 1220 (2001)). These exceptions \u201cinclude, among others, plain view, consent, community caretaking, search incident to arrest, and the automobile exception.\u201d <em>State v. Pena-Flores, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>6, 18, 965 A.2d 114 (2009). \u201c \u2018In analyzing the validity of warrantless searches, the strands of constitutional exceptions to the Fourth Amendment must be kept untangled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 205, 793 A.2d 619 (quoting <em>State v. Welsh, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>346, 354, 419 A.2d 1123 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness,\u2019 \u201d and the reasonableness of a search or seizure is determined \u201c \u2018by assessing, on the one hand, the degree to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>it intrudes on an individual\u2019s privacy and, on the other, the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Davila, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>97, 111, 999 A.2d 1116 (2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Knights, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>112, 118-19, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>587, 591, 151 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>497, 505 (2001)). \u201cThe main test always remains whether the law enforcement officer has acted in an objectively reasonable manner.\u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>4,19-20, 667 A.2d 1043 (1995). \u201cThe State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the validity\u201d of a search executed without a warrant. <em>State v. Edmonds, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>117, 128, 47 A.3d 737 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">As the Court has stated, \u201c[a] field inquiry \u2018is a limited form of police investigation that, except for impermissible reasons such as race, may be conducted without grounds for suspicion\u2019 \u201d and does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>State v. Nishina, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>502, 510, 816 A.2d 153 (2003) (quoting <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>117, 126, 796 A.2d 857 (2002)). \u201c[A]n investigative detention (sometimes called an investigatory stop or a Terry<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stop)\u201d is \u201cmore intrusive than a field inquiry.\u201d <em>Nishina, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 510, 816 A.2d 153. An investigative detention is valid when \u201c \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pineiro, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>13, 20, 853 A.2d 887 (2004) (quoting <em>Nishina, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 511, 816 A.2d 153). However, \u201can investigative stop becomes a <em>de facto </em>arrest when \u2018the officers\u2019 conduct is more intrusive than necessary for an investigative stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Dickey, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>468, 478, 706 A.2d 180 (1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>759 F.2d 633, 636 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>837, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>113, 88 L.Ed.2d 92 (1985)). The third type of police-citizen encounter is an arrest, which must be supported by probable cause. <em>Pineiro, supra, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 853 A.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In the present matter, defendant does not challenge the initial field inquiry. When an initial detention is justified, \u201cthe question becomes whether the ensuing investigation is \u2018reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Baum, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>275, 286, 923 A.2d 276 (App.Div.2007) (quoting <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 20, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1879, 20 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 905), <em>aff'd in part and modified in part, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>407, 972 A.2d 1127 (2009). The Court has also recognized that when \u201cthe circumstances \u2018give rise to suspicions unrelated to the [initial detention], an officer may broaden [the] inquiry and satisfy those suspicions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dickey, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 479-80, 706 A.2d 180 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>58 F.3d 356, 357-58 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>936, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>348, 133 L.Ed.2d 245 (1995)); <em>see also Baum, supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 287, 923 A.2d 276 (noting that \u201cinconsistent stories, inability to name the owner of the car, the lack of a driver\u2019s license, and [the driver\u2019s] nervousness supported a reasonable extension of the original detention beyond the activity justifying the initial stop\u201d). For similar reasons, there was sufficient justification for further investigation in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In addition, as this court has noted, \u201c[a] simple observation into the interior of an automobile by a police officer located outside the automobile is not a \u2018search\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Foley, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 215, 527 A.2d 482 (App.Div.1987) (citing <em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>730, 739-40, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1535, 1541-42, 75 L.Ed.2d 502, 513 (1983)). \u201cThere is no legitimate expectation of privacy shielding that portion of the interior of an automobile which may be viewed from outside the vehicle by either inquisitive passersby or diligent police officers.\u201d <em>Brown, supra, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>at 740, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1542, 75 L.Ed.2d at 513 (internal citation omitted). It is equally well-settled that Wester\u2019s use of a flashlight to illuminate the firearm cases on the rear seat of the SUV did \u201c \u2018not transform an otherwise reasonable observation into an unreasonable search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 793 A.2d 619 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>(quoting <em>State v. Gibson, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 11, 722 A.2d 960 (App.Div.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Based on the outward appearance of the nylon cases, Wester reasonably believed they contained rifles or shotguns that were easily accessible to defendant. <em>See State v. Demeter, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>374, 381, 590 A.2d 1179 (1991) (noting that some containers \u201cmay by their configuration or design proclaim their contents to an observer\u201d). Moreover, when Wester questioned defendant about the nylon cases, defendant confirmed he had long arms that he was transporting to Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Because defendant \u201crepeatedly denied having guns in the vehicle, even though the firearm cases were in plain view on the rear seat,\u201d the trial court concluded the warrantless seizure of the two firearms cases was objectively reasonable \u201cfor the safety of the officer.\u201d <em>See State v. Roach, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>19, 29, 796 A.2d 214 (2002) (noting a warrantless seizure was valid when the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d created an \u201cobjectively reasonable concern for the officers\u2019 safety\u201d); <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>1032, 1049, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>3469, 3481, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201, 1220 (1983) (permitting police to conduct a weapons search of the interior of a car when they have a reasonable belief that the driver is potentially dangerous); see <em>also State v. Lund, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>35, 48, 573 A.2d 1376 (1990) (adopting <em>Long </em>as \u201csound and compelling precedent [that] should be followed to protect New Jersey\u2019s police community\u201d). In our view, however, the warrantless seizure was not necessary for the officers\u2019 safety, because defendant had been removed from the vehicle and there were multiple backup officers at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Nevertheless, we conclude the limited seizure was valid under the plain view exception to the search warrant requirement. The rationale for the plain view doctrine is that \u201ca police officer lawfully in the viewing area\u201d need not \u201cclose his eyes to suspicious evidence in plain view.\u201d <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 237, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984). To satisfy this exception: (1) \u201cthe police officer must be lawfully in the viewing area\u201d; (2) \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>officer has to discover the evidence \u2018inadvertently,\u2019 meaning that he did not know in advance where evidence was located nor intend beforehand to seize it\u201d; and (3) \u201cit has to be \u2018immediately apparent\u2019 to the police that the items in plain view were evidence of a crime, contraband, or otherwise subject to seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236, 463 A.2d 320 (quoting <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>443, 466, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>2022, 2038, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>564, 583 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The <em>Bruzzese </em>Court clarified the third requirement \u201cto mean that in order to seize evidence in plain view a police officer must have \u2018probable cause to associate the [item] with criminal activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 463 A.2d 320 (quoting <em>Brown, supra, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>at 741-42, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1543, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 513). \u201cAll the officer needs to meet the third requirement is \u2018[a] \u2018practical, nontechnical\u2019 probability that incriminating evidence is involved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Brown, supra, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>at 742, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1543, 75 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 514). \u201cIn determining whether the officer has probable cause to associate the item with criminal activity, the court looks to what the police officer reasonably knew at the time of the seizure.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Mann, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>328, 341, 2 A.3d 379 (2010) (finding the plain view exception was satisfied when an officer \u201cwas lawfully in the viewing area\u201d and \u201chad probable cause to associate [a] bag of suspected drugs with criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">It is clear that the plain view exception to the warrant requirement applies in this case. First, Wester was lawfully conducting a field inquiry while standing outside defendant\u2019s SUV when he observed the firearm cases. Second, Wester did not possess advance knowledge that firearms would be present in the vehicle. Third, based on defendant\u2019s initial denials that there were firearms in his vehicle, Wester\u2019s plain view discovery of firearm cases on the back seat, and defendant\u2019s subsequent admission that he was transporting long arms to Texas, Wester had probable cause to believe that defendant possessed firearms in violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Because the seizure of the firearm cases was proper under the plain view doctrine, it was not necessary for the State to establish exigent circumstances under the automobile exception. <em>See Pena-Flores, supra, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 965 A.2d 114 (\u201cAs we have said, in order for the automobile exception to come into play, exigency was required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The trial court also found that defendant\u2019s statements to the police at the scene prior to his arrest were admissible, because they were made \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d and \u201cwere not the result of custodial police interrogation.\u201d The warnings under <em>Miranda </em>are required in a custodial situation prior to conducting an interrogation. <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>420, 428-129, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3138, 3144, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>317, 327 (1984). Determining whether a suspect is in custody depends on \u201cwhether there has been a significant deprivation of the suspect\u2019s freedom of action based on the objective circumstances, including the time and place of the interrogation, the status of the interrogator, the status of the suspect, and other such factors.\u201d <em>State v. P.Z., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>86, 103, 703 A.2d 901 (1997). Custodial interrogations do not include general on-the-scene questions. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 477, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1629, 16 L.Ed.2d at 725; <em>State v. Gosser, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>438, 445-46, 236 A.2d 377 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>1035, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1434, 20 L.Ed.2d 295 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Here, during Wester\u2019s lawful seizure of the firearm cases, defendant was neither handcuffed nor secured in a police vehicle, and the video recording confirms defendant was not pressured or coerced into making any incriminating statements. We therefore conclude the court properly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements he made to the police prior to his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The trial court also determined Wester\u2019s affidavit in support of a search warrant set forth sufficient probable cause \u201cto establish there were illegal weapons in the defendant\u2019s vehicle.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized during the execution of the warrant. \u201c[A] search executed pursuant to a warrant is presumed to be valid and ... a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>defendant challenging its validity has the burden to prove \u2018that there was no probable cause supporting the issuance of the warrant or that the search was otherwise unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Jones, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>377, 388, 846 A.2d 569 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Valencia, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>126, 133, 459 A.2d 1149 (1983)). In this case, the trial court correctly concluded there was sufficient probable cause to justify the warrant, and defendant\u2019s suppression motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In his third point, defendant claims the court erred by proceeding with the trial in his absence. However, defendant had actual notice of his scheduled trial date and the consequences of failing to appear, and he did not present a valid reason for failing to attend the trial. Under these circumstances, defendant effectively waived his right of presence. <em>See R. </em>3:16(b); <em>see also State v. Finklea, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>211, 213, 686 A.2d 322 (1996) (\u201c[O]nce a defendant has been given actual notice of a scheduled trial date, nonappearance on the scheduled or adjourned trial date is deemed a waiver of the right to be present during the trial absent a showing of justification by the defendant.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>837, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>110, 139 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In his fourth point defendant argues, for the first time, there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession of a large capacity magazine. This claim is procedurally barred because defendant failed to move for a new trial based on that ground as required by <em>Rule </em>2:10-1. <em>See State v. DiFerdinando, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 399, 785 A.2d 440 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>338, 793 A.2d 717 (2002). In any event, this argument lacks merit. There was strong evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that defendant possessed a large capacity magazine that was compatible and operable with a semi-automatic weapon. Furthermore, the testimony of Mayer established that the magazine was capable of \u201ccontinuously and directly\u201d feeding more than fifteen rounds of ammunition into a semi-automatic firearm as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1(y).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In his next argument, defendant asserts his possession of hollow-nose bullets was protected by the exemption under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-3(g)(2). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-3(g)(2) provides that a person may possess hollow-nose bullets in his dwelling or carry the ammunition \u201cfrom the place of purchase to said dwelling.\u201d However, under the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, defendant was not carrying the ammunition from its \u201cplace of purchase\u201d to his dwelling. Thus, defendant\u2019s possession of the hollow-nose bullets was not protected by <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-3(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Defendant argues in his sixth point that his \u201cconviction for hindering should be reversed because it was the result of an unlawful confession\u201d that \u201cflowed from the illegal search.\u201d Because Wester\u2019s seizure of the two firearm cases was not unlawful, and defendant was not subject to custodial interrogation, this argument is clearly without merit and does not warrant further discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11\u20143(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">In his final argument, defendant claims his convictions should be reversed because \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s gun control scheme\u201d violates his right under the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution to keep and bear arms. We disagree. The Second Amendment does not create \u201ca right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 <em>U.S. </em>570, 626, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>2783, 2816, 171 L.Ed.2d 637, 678 (2008). Furthermore, the Second Amendment does not preclude the State from regulating the manner in which firearms and related accessories must be transported. <em>See e.g. State v. Hatch, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>179, 188-89, 313 <em>A</em>.2d 797 (1973) (applying New Jersey\u2019s statutory requirements to a Massachusetts resident driving through New Jersey on his way to Pennsylvania).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-9\"> We derive the facts from the video recording (which was shown to the jury), Wester's affidavit in support of a search warrant, grand jury testimony, pretrial motion hearings, and trial testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\"> Because the record does not contain an inventory of the firearms that were seized, we rely on the jury verdict sheet which lists fourteen rifles, four shotguns, and three handguns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b555-11\"> Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-l(y), a \"[l]arge capacity ammunition magazine\" is defined as \"a box, drum, tube or other container which is capable of holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>more than 15 rounds of ammunition to be fed continuously and directly therefrom into a semi-automatic firearm.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> <em>Terry v.
