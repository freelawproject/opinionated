He raises two issues for review, only one of which is necessary to consider. He contends the trial Court committed error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>in limiting defense counsel to three minutes for closing argument. We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">Article 1, \u00a7 16 of the Constitution of the State of Florida provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">\u201c. . . [The] accused shall . . . have the right ... to be heard in person, by counsel or both. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">As stated by the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Cooper v. State, </em>106 Fla. 254, 143 S.Ct. 217, 218 (1932):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cTo arbitrarily limit counsel for defendant who is on trial, charged with a criminal offense, to the space of five minutes in which to present the defendant\u2019s case to the jury, is upon its face an abuse of discretion, and amounts to denying the defendant the benefit of counsel in violation of the Declaration of Rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The State contends that no harm befell Appellant in that the Judge allowed defense counsel to continue beyond the allotted three minutes and, in fact, allowed seven. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The chilling effect created on the young public defender by the authority of the Court could only be said to deprive Appellant of his constitutional right to effective counsel. Certainly, a Court can reasonably limit the time allowed for closing argument; however, to arbitrarily limit counsel to three minutes, then extend it to seven, denies that counsel\u2019s client a fundamental right to be properly represented. For that reason alone, the conviction and sentence of the trial Court must be vacated and reversed and the matter remanded for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">It is so Ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
