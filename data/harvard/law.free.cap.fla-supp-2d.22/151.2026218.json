State, </em>450 So.2d 836 (Fla. 1984) and <em>Reed v. State, </em>470 So.2d 1382 (Fla. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\">It is the finding of this Court that the issue of prostitution is one of moral turpitude and should be resolved in trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Having decided that issue, we do not find it necessary to decide the other issues in this case at this time. Consequently, this case is Reversed and Remanded to the lower Court for trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
