The Appellant had purchased a ticket as a patron and was not in any way obstructing the function of the Hialeah track.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">A majority of this Court, upon breaking from the gate, felt the conviction could not stand since the underlying \u201cbanishment\u201d was an unconstitutional exercise by the Racing Commission and Track. However, while whipped into racing around the Library Track, the Court was cut off at the far pole by Appellate Decisions,, out of <em>Stare Decisis, </em>and the winner by many lengths was Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The front runner was <em>Marrone v. Washington Jockey Club of the District of Columbia, </em>227 U.S. 633, 33 S.Ct. 401 (U.S. Sup. Ct. 1913) when, in a similar situation, Justice Holmes ruled that the purchase of an admission ticket does not create a right <em>in rem </em>and the track could exclude a patron for real or imaginary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Coming up fast on the outside was <em>Calder Race Course, Inc. v. Gaitan, </em>393 So.2d 15, 16 (Fla. 3d DCA 1980), which clearly held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">\u201cUntil the Florida Legislature acts or private racing establishments disparage constitutionally guaranteed rights, they continue to have the right to choose those persons with whom they wish to do business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-11\"><em>Winfield v. Noe, Jr., </em>426 So.2d 1148 (Fla. 3d DCA 1983), broke from the field and lead all the way into the home stretch. That decision affirmed that a track may exclude any patron, \u201c. . . absent a showing that the exclusion of any person is for reasons which are constitutionally impermissible\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Since ancient times, the Common Law created the absolute right to exclude any patron. Until and unless the Legislature acts to abrogate that right, this Court cannot do otherwise than to affirm the conviction below. It should be noted that many State have abrogated that absolute right, but Florida remains far behind the pack. See, <em>Tropical Park, Inc. v. Jock, </em>374 So.2d 639 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979); <em>cert. denied </em>383 So.2d 1196 (Fla. 1980). The solution remains with the Legislature, and it is suggested the Legislature jockey Florida into the rail lane before urinalysis and saliva tests become pre-admission requirements for patrons, as well as horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>This Court, bridled by its obligation to enforce, not create Law, and saddled with the duty to apply the Law even handedly, cannot say \u201cneigh\u201d and must take the bit between its teeth and affirm. We do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">Rivkind, Nadler, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-13\"> Obviously, herein neither race, sex, nor religion played any part in the Appellant\u2019s exclusion. In <em>Tropical Park v. Jock, infra, </em>the exclusion was based only on \u201cknowledge\u201d by the Track of \u201cunderworld connections\u201d of the patron.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
