(minor), a ward of the juvenile court, appeals from an order that he pay restitution to the Downey Unified School District following minor\u2019s admission that he damaged school property. The court ordered minor to reimburse the district for, among other things, labor costs of salaried employees who repaired the damage. Minor contends that part of the order not associated with out-of-pocket expenses is not authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1130\">*1130</page-number>Welfare and Institutions Code section 730.6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we conclude that the statute\u2019s mandate that restitution be ordered for all \u201ceconomic losses\u201d permits reimbursement for such labor costs. Hence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Procedural and Factual History</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In a petition filed May 21, 2001, it was alleged that minor, then 16 years old, came within the provisions of section 602 in that he entered the South Middle School on two occasions, March 11 and 18, 2001, with the intent to commit larceny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the dispositional hearing, minor admitted the allegations in order to participate in the Deferred Entry of Judgment program. He was declared a ward of the court pursuant to section 602 and ordered confined for a period not to exceed three years eight months. Entry of judgment was deferred, and minor was placed on probation during which time he was allowed to remain living at home. The terms of probation included a provision that he \u201c[mjake reparation on all related losses as determined by the Probation Officer . . . .\u201d According to the probation officer\u2019s report dated several days before the hearing, minor had been expelled from school because his mother could not afford to pay $1,745, that sum being minor\u2019s prorated portion of the restitution being requested by the school district. At minor\u2019s request, a restitution hearing was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">At that hearing, Robert Weinfurter, director of maintenance and related operations for the school district, testified he had investigated the two burglaries. He submitted an itemized list detailing the hours worked by various people to make the affected classrooms operational. The $3,071 total sought included $1,201.56 for custodial cleanup, plus 31 percent benefit payments. It did not include the cost of broken items or items stolen from the classrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Weinfurter testified the costs associated with the first incident included cleanup, the maintenance supervisor changing the locks and making a new keying system for the classrooms, and overtime payments to custodians and grounds men required for additional security to avoid a repeat break-in. After the second incident, no custodians were immediately available, so the school principal herself spent two hours cleaning the rooms until support personnel became available. An outside locksmith was hired to replace all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>the hardware on the doors. Weinfurter and the school district\u2019s operation supervisor also spent time remedying the break-ins. Weinfurter, the maintenance supervisor and the principal were all salaried employees. Dealing with the aftermath of a burglary is not a part of these employees\u2019 normal duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The juvenile court found the school\u2019s loss to be at least $3,071.14, observing: \u201cIt appears to me that all of the damages that have been testified to by Mr. Weinfurter indicate that over $3,000 in just man-hour labor and part costs were involved. And regardless of the fact that some of the people were salaried and some of them were not makes no difference to this court as to loss.\u201d The court found the school to be entitled to restitution in the amount of $3,071.14, plus any additional amounts for damaged or stolen items as determined by the probation officer. The court also directed the probation officer to determine minor\u2019s prorated share of this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Minor contends the restitution order must be reversed and the matter remanded for another restitution hearing because the order improperly includes costs other than out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the district. Specifically, he argues that payments based on the number of hours worked on cleanup by salaried employees and the pro rata share of the benefits to which those employees are entitled were improperly included in the restitution order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Section 730.6 governs restitution in cases where a minor is adjudicated a ward of the court pursuant to section 602. In pertinent part, that statute provides: \u201c(a)(1) It is the intent of the Legislature that a victim of conduct for which a minor is found to be a person described in Section 602 who incurs any <em>economic loss </em>as a result of the minor\u2019s conduct shall receive restitution directly from that minor. [5Q (2) [T]he court shall order the minor to pay, in addition to any other penalty provided or imposed under the law, both of the following: [IQ ... [f] (B) Restitution to the victim or victims, if any, in accordance with subdivision (h).\u201d In relevant part, section 730.6, subdivision (h) provides: \u201cA restitution order pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a), to the extent possible, shall identify . . . the amount of each victim\u2019s loss to which it pertains, and shall be of a dollar amount sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for all determined <em>economic losses </em>incurred as the result of the minor\u2019s conduct for which the minor was found to be a person described in Section 602, including all of the following: RD (1) Full or partial payment of the value of stolen or damaged property. The value of stolen or damaged property shall be the replacement cost of like property, or the actual cost of repairing the property when repair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>is possible. [ID ... HQ (3) Wages or profits lost due to injury incurred by the victim .... (4) Wages or profits lost by the victim . . . due to time spent as a witness or in assisting the police or prosecution.\u201d (Italics added.) A court may order restitution to any legal entity that is a direct victim of an offense. (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (k).)</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The standard of review of a restitution order is abuse of discretion. \u201cA victim\u2019s restitution right is to be broadly and liberally construed.\u201d <em>(People v. Mearns </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 493, 499 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 511].) \u201c \u2018When there is a factual and rational basis for the amount of restitution ordered by the trial court, no abuse of discretion will be found by the reviewing court.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.; People </em>v. <em>Dalvito </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 557, 562 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 679] <em>(Dalvito).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We begin our analysis, of course, with the statute itself. The plain meaning of the statute defeats minor\u2019s argument that restitution is limited to out-of-pocket expenses. Section 730.6 expressly states that \u201ceconomic losses,\u201d not monies expended, is the governing test. Although our research has not uncovered any discussion of the term \u201ceconomic losses\u201d in the context of the type of juvenile restitution orders at issue here, nor do the parties cite any direct authority, we observe that section 730.6 parallels Penal Code section 1202.4, which governs adult restitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that context, both the People of this state when they passed Proposition 8, and extensive case authority express that restitution statutes are to be interpreted broadly and liberally.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mearns, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.4th at p. 499.) Any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1133\">*1133</page-number>interpretation that limits a victim\u2019s rights to restitution \u201cwould be in derogation of the expressed intent and purposes of Proposition 8 and the provisions adopted by the Legislature to implement tins measure.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Carbajal </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 1114, 1122 [43 Cal.Rptr.2d 681, 899 P.2d 67].) The term \u201ceconomic losses\u201d is thus entitled to an expansive interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Particularly in light of restitution being available'to \u201cany legal entity\u201d (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (k)), courts must remain mindful of real world business considerations in calculating loss. A review of adult restitution awards confirms that the appellate courts have upheld such vigilance. For example, in addition to profits lost due to time spent as a witness (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (h)(4); see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(E); <em>People v. Nguyen </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 32, 44 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 140] [restitution award pursuant to Gov. Code, \u00a7 13967, former subd. (c) properly included economic loss due to robbery victim having to close her store while she testified]) and the replacement cost of stolen property (\u00a7 730.6, subd. (h)(1); see also Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3)(A)), courts have affirmed restitution awards of lost business profits resulting from various forms of theft (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Thygesen </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 988 [81 Cal.Rptr.2d 886] [amount of restitution for loss of use of stolen cement mixer should be calculated by number of days reasonably required to replace mixer multiplied by reasonable rental rate]; <em>People v. Ortiz </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 791, 798 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] [restitution award to nonprofit trade organization properly calculated as the number of counterfeit tapes defendant sold multiplied by the price at which those tapes were sold]; <em>People v. Whisenand (1995) </em>37 Cal.App.4th 1383, 1390 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 501] [restitution award properly included compensation for the loss of use of embezzled funds by an award of interest from the time of the embezzlement to the restitution hearing]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1, 5 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 1] [restitution award properly based on increased value of embezzled mutual fund shares at time defendant placed on probation]).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\"><em>Dalvito, supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at page 562, is particularly instructive on the rule that the victim need not demonstrate out-of-pocket loss to qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1134\">*1134</page-number>a restitution award. There, the trial court\u2019s order included $15,950 for the price of a necklace the defendant obtained from the victim under false pretenses. After the defendant absconded with the necklace, the victim stopped payment on the check he wrote to a third person (a jeweler) from whom he had purchased the necklace. The jeweler sued the victim and obtained judgment in the amount of the check, but the victim declared bankruptcy and the jeweler\u2019s judgment against the victim was discharged. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 558-559.) The appellate court affirmed the restitution order, rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that the victim had suffered no actual loss inasmuch as his debt to the jeweler was discharged. It reasoned that the victim had initially suffered an economic loss in a determined amount and it was immaterial what actions the victim took to mitigate his damages. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 561.) \u201cIf defendant had not stolen the necklace for which [the victim] owed $15,950, then perhaps [the victim] would not have been obliged to seek refuge in the bankruptcy laws. [The victim] has had his debt to the jeweler for $15,950 discharged, but he suffered the consequences of that action. . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Here, under the reasoning of the court in <em>Dalvito </em>and the other authorities previously cited, we hold today that a restitution award may also properly include the reasonable value of employee work product lost as a result of the criminal conduct of another, be that person a minor or an adult. The evidence established that various salaried employees were required to spend time making classrooms operational after the break-ins. This caused the district an economic loss to the extent it deprived the district of the work product these salaried employees would have generated if they had not been obliged to clean up the mess made by minor. Thus, minor\u2019s assertion that the school district \u201cdid not incur any loss related to these salaried employees\u201d is inaccurate. The juvenile court reasonably valued the lost work product at the salary rate of the district employees, including benefits, for the lost time. We see no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Any other rule would encourage public entities and other victims to incur out-of-pocket expenses rather than try to repair damage to property in-house, an anomalous result given that the likelihood of actually receiving reimbursement from a criminal defendant via a restitution order is problematic at best. No public policy is served by such a rule, and, as we have noted, it is not compelled by statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Minor\u2019s reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Friscia </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 834 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 656] <em>(Friscia) </em>for a contrary result is misplaced. In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1135\">*1135</page-number>the defendant embezzled money from her employer, a private school. The authorities refused to prosecute the case until the school produced an accounting determining the amount of loss. The owners of the school prepared the accounting themselves, spending 222.25 hours searching records to determine the exact amount the defendant had embezzled. The defendant pleaded guilty to embezzlement and, pursuant to former Penal Code section 1203.04,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court ordered restitution in the amount of $47,000, which included $11,112.50 for the owners\u2019 time spent putting the case together for the authorities. (Friscia, at pp. 835-836.) The appellate court struck the restitution order, reasoning that the statute unambiguously limited \u201crestitution\u201d to \u201c \u2018full or partial payment for . . . wages or profits lost due ... to time spent as a witness or in assisting the police or prosecution,\u2019 \u201d and the school owners did not lose any wages or ascertainable profits as a result of the time they spent making the accounting. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>Friscia, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 834, is inapposite. Whereas the term \u201crestitution\u201d was expressly defined in former Penal Code section 1203.04, it is not defined at all in section 730.6. On the contrary, section 730.6, subdivision (h) mandates that a restitution order \u201cbe of a dollar amount sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for all determined economic losses incurred as the result of the minor\u2019s conduct . . . <em>including\u201d </em>various kinds of losses. (Italics added.) In <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1389 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323], our Supreme Court held that the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d is a phrase of enlargement. Here, use of the word \u201cincluding\u201d before the list of kinds of losses indicates the Legislature\u2019s intention not to limit the court to the kinds of losses specified, but to allow the court broad discretion to determine the victim\u2019s economic loss. (Cf. Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(3) [requiring restitution order to be of dollar amount to fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>reimburse victim for losses \u201cincluding, <em>but not limited </em>to\u201d specified kinds of losses (italics added)].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That discretion was properly exercised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Cooper, P. J., and Boland, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 30, 2002.

He and one other participant admitted to participating in both burglaries, the other two juveniles admitted to just one of the break-ins. According to the probation report, in addition to damage to school property, a desk was ransacked, and United States currency in the amount of $97 and assorted candy valued at $18 were stolen in the incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Penal Code section 1202.4 provides: \u201c(a)(1) It is the intent of the Legislature that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.\" The amount of restitution to the victim of an adult offender is determined in accordance with subdivision (f) of Penal Code section 1202.4. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (a)(3)(B).) In pertinent part, subdivision (f) provides: \u201cIn every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court. . . . fl[| ...

The value of stolen or damaged property shall be the replacement cost of like property, or the actual cost of repairing the property when repair is possible, . . .

Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b).) In 1983, the Legislature adopted implementing legislation, including former Penal Code section 1203.04, requiring trial courts to order restitution from defendants convicted of crimes and placed on probation, and former Welfare and Institutions Code section 729.6, imposing a similar requirement in all juvenile delinquency matters. <em>(People v. Broussard </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1067, 1072 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 278, 856 P.2d 1134].) After Penal Code section 1203.04 was repealed, Penal Code section 1202.4 governed restitution in cases where probation was granted, <em>(Dalvito, supra, 56 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 560-561.) After section 729.6 was repealed, section 730.6 governed victim restitution in juvenile delinquency matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">Section 730.6, subdivision (k) expressly includes as \u201cdirect victim[s] of an offense\u201d governmental subdivisions and agencies, as well as other legal and commercial entities.

The defendant in each instance should be obligated to compensate the victim for the actual loss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\"> At the time of the decision in <em>Friscia, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 834, former Penal Code section 1203.04 provided: \u201c(a) In every case where a person is convicted of a crime and is granted probation, the court shall require, as a condition of probation, that the person make restitution as follows: (1) To the victim, if the crime involved a victim. ...[$]... [HI (d) <em>For purposes of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), \u2018restitution\u2019 means full or partial payment for the value of stolen or damaged property, medical expenses, and wages or profits lost </em>due to injury or to time spent as a witness or in assisting the police or prosecution, which losses were caused by the defendant as a result of committing the crime for which he or she was convicted.

Here, the legislative history and statutory scheme relating to victim restitution establish a legislative intent to broaden the restitution available to crime victims. Accordingly, to the extent it has any significance at all, we find omission of the words \u201cbut not limited to\u201d in section 730.6 was merely legislative oversight. (See <em>Muller v.
