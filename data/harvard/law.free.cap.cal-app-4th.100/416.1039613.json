The court found that the forensic alcohol analysis submitted by the DMV in support of the suspension was not sufficient competent evidence to support the suspension because it would not have been admissible over a hearsay objection in a civil action. The DMV appeals, claiming that the analysis would have qualified for admission in a civil action under Evidence Code section 1280\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule in conjunction with Evidence Code section 664\u2019s presumption that official duty has been regularly performed. We conclude that the DMV, as the proponent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>document, failed to establish that it had been prepared by a person with an official duty. Therefore, the document was not sufficient competent evidence to support the suspension of Furman\u2019s license as it could not have qualified for admission over a hearsay objection in a civil action. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Furman was detained by law enforcement at 1:20 a.m. on June 20, 2000, after he failed to stop at a stop sign. After an officer observed that Furman was exhibiting objective symptoms of intoxication, he arrested Furman. At 2:18 a.m., Furman had a \u201cblood test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The DMV held a September 2000 administrative hearing on the suspension of Furman\u2019s driving privilege. At the hearing, the DMV submitted a one-page document entitled \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis\u201d that stated that Furman\u2019s blood had been tested and found to contain \u201c0.17% (W/V) alcohol.\u201d This document was on letterhead from \u201cDepartment of Justice HD Bureau of Forensic Services.\u201d The document stated that the blood sample had been received on June 23, 2000. It listed the \u201cDate Analysis Complete\u201d as \u201c6/30/00\u201d and the \u201cDate Of Report\u201d as \u201c7/5/00.\u201d The document bore the signature of \u201cMarianne Perhach flQ Criminalist.\u201d No further detail about the source of this information was provided in the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Furman objected on hearsay grounds to this document. He contended that the DMV had failed to meet its foundational burden of showing that (1) the document had been prepared by a person with an official duty under title 17 of the California Code of Regulations to perform and record the results of a forensic alcohol analysis and (2) the document had been prepared at or near the time of completion of the analysis. Furman also argued that the DMV\u2019s evidence did not establish that his blood had been drawn by a qualified individual in accordance with title 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">On October 2, 2000, the DMV suspended Furman\u2019s driving privilege. On October 31, 2000, Furman filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to overturn the suspension. He reiterated the arguments that he had made at the administrative hearing. The DMV opposed the petition. It argued that Fur-man had the burden of producing evidence challenging the DMV\u2019s evidence, and he had not met this burden. The superior court agreed with all three of Furman\u2019s contentions, and it issued a writ of mandate requiring the DMV to set aside the suspension and reinstate Furman\u2019s driving privilege. The DMV filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">H. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Furman maintains that the DMV did not produce sufficient competent evidence to support its suspension of his driving privilege because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>document purporting to show his blood-alcohol level was hearsay that would not have been admissible over objection in a civil action.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u201cWhen an administrative agency initiates an action to suspend or revoke a license, the burden of proving the facts necessary to support the action rests with the agency making the allegation. Until the agency has met its burden of going forward with the evidence necessary to sustain a finding, the licensee has no duty to rebut the allegations or otherwise respond. . . . The mere fact that the licensee has the right to subpoena witnesses . . . does not relieve the D.M.V. of meeting its burden of producing competent evidence supporting a suspension. Thus, in this case, the licensee had no duty to testify or otherwise rebut the allegations at the hearing until the D.M.V. made a prima facie showing by competent evidence . . . .\u201d <em>(Daniels v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 532, 536 [189 Cal.Rptr. 512, 658 P.2d 1313], citations omitted.)  Here, the DMV attempted to make a prima facie showing by relying on the document entitled \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis.\u201d Furman claims that the DMV did not make the requisite showing because this document was not competent and sufficient proof of his blood-alcohol level.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">B. <em>Hearsay Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The DMV concedes that the document purporting to be a \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis\u201d was hearsay evidence, but it argues that this document was nevertheless competent and sufficient to prove Furman\u2019s blood-alcohol level. \u201cHearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence [at an administrative hearing] but over timely objection shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11513, subd. (d).) \u201c \u2018[T]here must be substantial evidence to support such a board\u2019s ruling, and hearsay, unless specially permitted by statute, is not competent evidence to that end.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Daniels v. Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at pp. 536-537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Furman made a timely hearsay objection to the document, but the DMV asserts that the document was still sufficient and competent proof because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>would have been admissible over a hearsay objection in a civil action. The DMV bases this assertion on its claim that the document came within Evidence Code section 1280\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule. \u201cEvidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in any civil or criminal proceeding to prove the act, condition, or event if all of the following applies: HO (a) The writing was made by and within the scope of duty of a public employee. HD (b) The writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event. RD (c) The sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u201cA forensic alcohol report becomes an official record of the DMV, and thus admissible at an administrative per se hearing, <em>if </em>it complies with the requirements governing the admission of evidence. . . . This includes hearsay. Although a forensic report is hearsay, it falls within the public employees record exception to the hearsay rule <em>if the proponent of the report (here, the DMV) establishes the necessary foundation for its </em>admission.\u201d <em>(Shea v. Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1059, citation omitted, italics added.)  The DMV, as the proponent of the document, bore the burden of \u201cproducing evidence sufficient to establish the necessary foundation\u201d for a finding that the hearsay evidence came within Evidence Code section 1280\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1133, 1177 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 892, 938 P.2d 950].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The \u201cact, condition, or event\u201d in question here was the forensic alcohol analysis of Furman\u2019s blood sample. To come with Evidence Code section 1280\u2019s hearsay exception, the document had to (1) be a record made by a public employee with a duty to perform, and record the result of, a forensic alcohol analysis, (2) have been made at or near the time of completion of the analysis, and (3) have been made under circumstances that reflected that it was trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Furman challenges the DMV\u2019s assertion that the document met the first of these three requirements. He claims that there was no basis for a foundational finding that the document was prepared by a public employee with a duty to perform, and record the results of, a forensic alcohol analysis. The DMV, on the other hand, maintains that its foundational burden was satisfied by the presumption of official duty regularly performed that arises under Evidence Code section 664. The DMV claims that Evidence Code section 664 creates a presumption that \u201cthe entities and individuals who administer, analyze and report blood-alcohol-test results\u201d properly perform their \u201cofficial\u201d duties in compliance with applicable regulations. It asserts that this presumption shifted the burden to Furman to establish that the forensic alcohol analysis had not been properly performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Evidence Code section 664 provides that \u201c[i]t is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed.\u201d \u201cCalifornia courts have applied this presumption in finding that proffered evidence satisfies the foundational requirements of the official records exception.\u201d <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 125 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563].) However, Evidence Code section 664\u2019s presumption applies only where a person has an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to perform an act. <em>{Martinez, supra, </em>at p. 130, fn. 8.) It is this \u201cofficial duty\u201d that underlies both Evidence Code section 664\u2019s presumption and Evidence Code section 1280\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe fundamental circumstance is that <em>an official duty exists to make an accurate statement, </em>and that this special and weighty duty will usually suffice as a motive to incite the officer to its fulfillment. . . . It is the influence of the official duty, broadly considered, which is taken as the sufficient element of trustworthiness, justifying the acceptance of the hearsay statement.\u201d . . <em>(People v. Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 130, fn. 8 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563], citation omitted, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Furman argues that neither Evidence Code section 664 nor Evidence Code section 1280 was applicable here because the DMV, the proponent of the document, provided no foundation that could have supported a finding that the individual who prepared the \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis\u201d had an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to perform and record the results of a forensic alcohol analysis of Furman\u2019s blood sample. We are compelled to agree. The DMV did not offer any foundational evidence either at the administrative hearing or in the trial court. The performance of \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis\u201d is subjected to strict regulation by title 17 of the California Code of Regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These regulations do not support the DMV\u2019s claim that the \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis\u201d it offered at the hearing was prepared by a person with an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to perform and record the results of such analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The document purported to record the performance of a \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis\u201d of Furman\u2019s blood sample by Marianne Perhach, who was identified as a \u201cCriminalist.\u201d Title 17 expressly rebuts any inference that a \u201cCriminalist\u201d has an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to perform a \u201cForensic Alcohol Analysis.\u201d Instead, title 17 expressly specifies those who are authorized to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>forensic alcohol analysis. \u201cForensic alcohol analysis <em>shall be performed only by persons </em>who meet the qualifications set forth in these regulations for <em>forensic alcohol supervisors, forensic alcohol analysts, or forensic alcohol analyst trainees </em>[working under the supervision of a forensic alcohol supervisor or forensic alcohol analyst].\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 1216, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) Title 17 also specifies the duties and qualifications of forensic alcohol analysts, forensic alcohol supervisors and forensic alcohol analyst trainees. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7\u00a7 1215.1, subds. (f) &amp; (g), 1216.1, subds. (e) &amp; (f).) Title 17 makes no mention of criminalists.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The record before us does not reflect that Perhach, the author of the document, was among those authorized by title 17 of the California Code of Regulations to perform forensic alcohol analysis, and therefore she could not have had an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to perform unauthorized analyses. Nor is there any indication in the record that Perhach or any \u201cCriminalist\u201d had an official duty to record the results of forensic alcohol analyses performed by authorized individuals. The absence of an official duty precludes the application of either Evidence Code section 664\u2019s presumption or Evidence Code section 1280\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It follows that the document was hearsay that was not sufficient competent evidence of Furman\u2019s blood-alcohol level. The DMV does not claim that there was other evidence of Furman\u2019s blood-alcohol level that this document was only intended to supplement. Consequently, the DMV failed to make a prima facie showing that Furman had an excessive blood-alcohol level, and the trial court did not err in granting Furman\u2019s petition and issuing a writ of mandate overturning the suspension of Furman\u2019s driving privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">III. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Bamattre-Manoukian, Acting P. J., and Rushing, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October '23, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Furman\u2019s driving privilege was suspended based on a finding that he drove a vehicle with a blood-alcohol level of .08 or higher. \u201cOnly an objective scientific test can establish that fact.\u201d <em>(Shea </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1061 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 896]; <em>Imachi v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 809, 817, fn. 7 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 478].)
