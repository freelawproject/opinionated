Deleuze and Rosa Lee Deleuze doing business as ZD Wines, a winegrower/supplier licensee (collectively ZD). The Department had issued a decision that ZD\u2019s payment for advertising in the exclusive sales catalog of an individual retail licensee violated the proscriptions of the \u201ctied-house\u201d laws. The Alcoholic Beverage Control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>Appeals Board (Board) reversed the decision, finding that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statute was too restrictive. We conclude that the Department\u2019s decision contains a reasoned interpretation and application of the alcoholic beverage control laws and, therefore, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The facts in this matter are not in dispute. The parties submitted the following stipulated facts: \u201c1. Norman C. de Leuze and Rosa Lee de Leuze doing business as ZD Wines (\u2018[ZD]\u2019) hold a winegrower\u2019s license. HD 2. Mel-Jen, a California corporation doing business as Wally\u2019s (\u2018Wally\u2019s\u2019), holds an off-sale general retail license at 2107-09 Westwood Boulevard, Los Angeles, California. HQ 3. George Rice &amp; Sons (\u2018George Rice\u2019) is a printer and holds no alcoholic beverage licenses. HD 4. George Rice contracted with Wally\u2019s'to produce a holiday gift catalog (\u2018Wally\u2019s catalog\u2019) in 1995 and 1996. HD 5. [ZD] paid George Rice $650 for a wine advertisement placed in the 1995 Wally\u2019s catalog and $750 for a wine advertisement placed in the 1996 Wally\u2019s catalog. HD 6. The Wally\u2019s catalogs contained exclusively products carried by Wally\u2019s. HO 7. The Wally\u2019s catalogs were distributed to over 125,000 customers in the Los Angeles area. HD 8. The Wally\u2019s catalogs contained Wally\u2019s phone number, fax number and address, information about the products and how to order them exclusively from Wally\u2019s. HD 9. In April 1996, George Rice placed $7,164.03 in Wally\u2019s US Postal Service Account.\u201d It was also undisputed that, but for payment by ZD and others, Wally\u2019s would have been required to pay George Rice &amp; Sons for the cost of producing the catalog.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In August 1998 the Department filed an accusation against ZD, alleging two violations of Business and Professions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 25502, subdivision (a)(2). The first count alleged that \u201c[o]n or about August 11, 1995, [ZD] did furnish, give or lend money or other thing of value, directly or indirectly, to a person engaged in operating, owning or maintaining an off-sale licensed premises, to wit: a $650.00 payment to George Rice &amp; Sons, Inc., for a wine product advertisement placed in a publication belonging to Mel Jen, a California corporation, [Wally\u2019s] who then and there held an off-sale general license, in violation of Section 25502(a)(2) of the California Business and Professions Code.\u201d The second count mirrored the allegations for a $750 payment made the following year. ZD filed a notice of defense pursuant to Government Code section 11506 and the matter was set for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Following a one-day hearing the administrative law judge (ALJ) issued his proposed decision, in which he concluded that section 25502, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>(a)(2) had been violated and that cause for suspension of ZD\u2019s license had been established. The ALJ found that payments by ZD to George Rice &amp; Sons were indirect payments to Wally\u2019s, the sponsor of the catalogs and the only retail outlet mentioned in the two catalogs. The ALJ proposed that a fine of $10,000 be paid as an alternative to actual suspension of the license in accord with section 23095. The Department adopted the proposed decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">ZD appealed the Department\u2019s decision to the Board. The Board reversed the decision of the Department. Conceding that \u201cthere is something to be said for the Department\u2019s arguments based on the \u2018tied house\u2019 legislation,\u201d the Board nonetheless was \u201cnot . . . convinced.\u201d Relying primarily on California Attorney General Opinion No. NS216 (Mar. 22, 1937) (hereafter 1937 opinion), the Board concluded that the interpretation the Department placed on the transactions at issue was \u201cunreasonably restrictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">We granted the Department\u2019s petition for a writ of review pursuant to section 23090.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">n. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The Department\u2019s primary contention is that the Board erred in reversing the Department\u2019s decision by substituting its interpretation of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act (\u00a7 23000 et seq.) (Act) for that of the Department\u2019s, thus exceeding its limited scope of review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">The administration of the Act, within its scope and purposes, is initially vested in the Department. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22; see also \u00a7 23000 et seq.) The Department\u2019s decisions are subject to administrative review by the Board. (\u00a7 23084.) After the Board has issued a final order, the Department\u2019s decision is also subject to judicial review in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal. (\u00a7 23090.2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">The scope of review of both the Board and the courts is a narrow one. \u201cThe review by the board of a decision of the department shall be limited to the questions: ft[| (a) Whether the department has proceeded without, or in excess of, its jurisdiction, [fj (b) Whether the department has proceeded in the manner required by law. flQ (c) Whether the decision is supported by the findings, ffl] (d) Whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record. flQ (e) Whether there is relevant evidence, which, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>have been produced or which was improperly excluded at the hearing before the department.\u201d (\u00a7 23084.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Section 23090.2 directs the courts to review, not the Board\u2019s decision, but the Department\u2019s decision, addressing the same enumerated questions. The statute goes on to provide: \u201cNothing in this article shall permit the court to hold a trial de novo, to take evidence, or to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, in deciding the issues before us our role is limited to determining, based upon a review of \u201cthe whole record of the department,\u201d whether the <em>Department\u2019s </em>decision is subject to reversal on the grounds specified in section 23090.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">If the Department\u2019s administrative action declares or applies legal rules, or sets forth conclusions of law which are drawn from adjudicated or undisputed facts, it is subject to review only for insufficiency of the evidence, excess of jurisdiction, errors of law, or abuse of discretion. <em>(Boreta Enterprises, Inc. v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 85, 95 [84 Cal.Rptr. 113, 465 P.2d 1].) \u201c \u2018[T]he discretion exercised by the Department . . . \u201c \u2018is not absolute but must be exercised in accordance with the law, and the provision that it may revoke [or deny] a license \u201cfor good cause\u201d necessarily implies that its decisions should be based on sufficient evidence and that it should not act arbitrarily in determining what is contrary to public welfare or morals.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] Nevertheless, <em>it is the Department, and not the Board or the courts, which must determine whether \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for denying a license upon the ground that its issuance would be contrary to public welfare or morals. </em>[Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kirby v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 732, 736-737 [109 Cal.Rptr. 291]; see also <em>Sepatis </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 93, 102 [167 Cal.Rptr. 729] [if the Department\u2019s determination is a reasonable one, neither the Board nor the courts may substitute a contrary decision even if such decision would be equally or more reasonable].) Although most cases address the Department\u2019s discretionary powers in the context of the revocation, granting or denial of a license, the same deferential standard of review should and would apply to the Department\u2019s discretionary powers to determine whether there is good cause to suspend a license, since all of the powers derive from the same constitutional source. (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22.)</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We evaluate the decision of the Department in light of the jurisdiction of the Department and the legislative purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">B. <em>Jurisdiction of the Department</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Department has been granted exclusive jurisdiction to \u201clicense the manufacture, importation and sale of alcoholic beverages in the State . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>(Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22, par. 9.) The Department also has the power, \u201cin its discretion, to deny, suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverages license if it shall determine for good cause that the granting or continuance of such license would be contrary to public welfare or morals, or that a person seeking or holding a license has violated any law prohibiting conduct involving moral turpitude.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> The discretion legally vested in an administrative body, such as the Department, is broad and inclusive and is not subject to judicial control when exercised within its legal limits. <em>(Walsh v. Kirby </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 95, 103 [118 Cal.Rptr. 1, 529 P.2d 33]; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 287, 295 [341 P.2d 296].) However, deference to the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Act is not unlimited. It is subject to review and intervention by the Board and the courts in the event that the Department acts in an arbitrary and capricious manner, or in a manner which is not in conformity with the spirit of the law. <em>(Walsh v. Kirby, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 106.)</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">C. <em>Background of Alcoholic Beverage Control Laws</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The legislative background of the alcoholic beverage control laws and of section 25502 was aptly summarized by the California Supreme Court in <em>California Beer Wholesalers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 402, 407-408 [96 Cal.Rptr. 297, 487 P.2d 745] <em>(California Beer Wholesalers): </em>\u201cFollowing repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, the vast majority of states, including California, enacted alcoholic beverage control laws. These statutes sought to forestall the generation of such evils and excesses as intemperance and disorderly marketing conditions that had plagued the public and the alcoholic beverage industry prior to prohibition. [Citations.] By enacting prohibitions against \u2018tied-house\u2019 arrangements, state legislatures aimed to prevent two particular dangers: the ability and potentiality of large firms to dominate local markets through vertical and horizontal integration [citation] and the excessive sales of alcoholic beverages produced by the overly aggressive marketing techniques of larger alcoholic beverage concerns [citations]. [1Q The principal method utilized by state legislatures to avoid these antisocial developments was the establishment of a triple-tiered distribution and licensing scheme. [Citations.] Manufacturing interests were to be separated from wholesale interests; wholesale interests were to be segregated from retail interests. In short, business endeavors engaged in the production, handling, and final sale of alcoholic beverages were to be kept \u2018distinct and apart.\u2019 [Citation.] fl[] . . . All levels of the alcoholic beverage industry were to remain segregated; firms operating at one level of distribution were to remain free from involvement in, or influence over, any other level.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) It is these legislative objectives that the tied-house provisions of California\u2019s alcoholic beverage control laws seek to effectuate.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>D. <em>Department\u2019s Interpretation and Application of Section 25502, Subdivision (a)(2)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Section 25502, one of the so-called tied-house laws, provides: \u201c(a) No . . . winegrower, . . . California winegrower\u2019s agent, ... or wholesaler . . . shall . . . : HD . . . HD (2) Furnish, give, or lend any money or other thing of value, directly or indirectly, to, or guarantee the repayment of any loan or the fulfillment of any financial obligation of, any person engaged in operating, owning, or maintaining any off-sale licensed premises.\u201d Based upon the stipulated facts presented, the Department concluded that all of the elements of section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) were present: ZD is a winegrower and a licensed supplier. Wally\u2019s is a licensed off-sale retailer. ZD furnished money to publisher George Rice &amp; Sons to pay a portion of Wally\u2019s financial obligation to the publisher for the production of Wally\u2019s exclusive catalog. Therefore, ZD furnished to Wally\u2019s something of value in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">ZD challenges that determination. It argued below and argues here that section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) only prohibits gifts or other unilateral transfers from manufacturers or wholesalers to retailers and, therefore, this transaction is not a violation of the statute but only a straightforward purchase of advertising\u2014a bilateral contract for which consideration was paid. Although this contention finds some support in the Attorney General\u2019s 1937 opinion, the Department concluded that ZD\u2019s interpretation of the statute \u201cwould place the Department in the impracticable position of having to examine transactions between winegrowers and licensed retailers to determine whether the transactions constituted fair value exchanges. . . . HQ . . . HQ To limit the reach of the statute\u2019s use of \u2018furnish\u2019 to unilateral contracts as urged by [ZD] would invite suppliers to engage in subterfuges regarding the fair value exchanges cited by [ZD] as a non-proscribed activity between suppliers and retailers and [would] defeat the Legislature\u2019s intent to limit vertical and horizontal integration of the alcoholic beverage industry.\u201d We agree with the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Viewed in the context of the purposes of the tied-house laws, ZD did not merely \u201cpurchase ... an advertisement\u201d as it might do, for example, in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation. Rather, ZD paid money to place wine advertisements in a licensed retailer\u2019s sales catalog. The catalog promoted Wally\u2019s exclusively, containing only Wally\u2019s telephone number, fax number, and address and only information about the products sold at Wally\u2019s and how to order them from Wally\u2019s. The catalog was then sent to over 125,000 consumers in the Los Angeles area, bringing Wally\u2019s and all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>its products directly to the consumer\u2019s doorstep. Thus, ZD contributed a valuable and tangible benefit to Wally\u2019s by participating in paying for the production of its exclusive sales catalog\u2014in essence, a \u201cvirtual\u201d retail establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The Department\u2019s decision that this violated the prohibition against a winegrower\u2019s furnishing anything of value to a retailer is consistent with the legislative purpose of the tied-house laws, as articulated in the <em>California Beer Wholesalers </em>decision. There, the Supreme Court made clear that all \u201cfirms operating at one level of distribution were to remain free from involvement in, or influence over, any other level.\u201d <em>(California Beer Wholesalers, supra, </em>5 Cal.3d at p. 408.) An ongoing relationship between a winegrower and a retailer such as that between ZD and Wally\u2019s could easily lead to the kind of influence of a supplier over a retailer the statutes were intended to prevent, for example, by causing the retailer to favor or \u201cpush\u201d the products of the wholesaler who chooses to pay for advertising in the retailer\u2019s catalog. \u201c \u2018[T]he [tied-house] prohibition . . . exists primarily to remove the influence by the manufacturer over the wholesaler and the wholesaler over the retailer, a practice which might result in preference for the manufacturer\u2019s or wholesaler\u2019s product. . . .\u2019 32 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 75, 76 (1958).\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 408, fn 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">ZD contends the 1937 opinion, interpreting the statutory predecessor to section 25502, and relied upon by the Board, is controlling. In that opinion, the Attorney General concluded the statute would not be violated \u201cif advertising were placed [by a supplier] in the magazine of a club which held an on-sale license, where the magazine was circulated to the members and friends of the club at their homes or offices, even though a few copies of the magazine might also be retained in the reading rooms of the club.\u201d (1937 opn.) The Attorney General construed the word \u201cgiving\u201d in the statute to mean \u201cdonating\u201d and, therefore, opined that a \u201cbona fide purchase of advertising space\u201d would not be prohibited. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The Department did not act unreasonably in declining to follow this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> First, while an opinion of the Attorney General is entitled to great weight, it is not controlling legal authority. This is particularly true where, as here, there is case authority in existence interpreting the statute at issue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Thorpe v. Long Beach Community College Dist. </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 655, 662-663 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 897].) Furthermore, the facts upon which the 1937 opinion was predicated are substantially different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>the stipulated facts presented for review in this case. The 1937 opinion involved advertising in a club\u2019s magazine, not in the sales catalog of a retailer. Presumably, the magazine was a club newsletter, not a means for soliciting mail-order purchases by club members from the club.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the benefit of the advertising in the club\u2019s magazine would inure to the advertiser whose purpose is to generate sales of its product at bars, restaurants and stores. The Attorney General was not asked to comment upon a situation where, as here, the benefit of the advertising would inure not only to the advertiser, but also to a single off-sale retail licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">ZD next contends that the Department\u2019s interpretation of section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) would lead to the absurd result of prohibiting winegrowers or suppliers from purchasing <em>any </em>goods and services from any licensed retailers. It argues that if the purchase of an advertisement placement is prohibited under section 25502, subdivision (a)(2), then the purchase of any goods or services from a licensed retailer, whether a loaf of bread, a tube of toothpaste or a pound of onions is also a prohibited purchase. But the purchase of a loaf of bread at a grocery store is not analogous to the placement of a wine advertisement in a retailer\u2019s catalog; the \u201cthing of value\u201d furnished here related directly to sales of alcoholic beverages. As the Department noted, it \u201cexercises its discretion to not consider regular commercial transactions unrelated to the sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages as a violation of Section 25502(a)(2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">ZD counters with the contention that the \u201cregular consumer transactions\u201d exception is, in effect, an improper, ad hoc amendment to the statute and, therefore, the Department has not proceeded as required by law and its decision is in excess of its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ZD also contends the Department\u2019s decision renders the reach of the statute \u201cunknown and unknowable\u201d and is an invitation to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement actions by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Department. This contention fundamentally ignores both the authority conferred on the Department by the Constitution to exercise \u201cits discretion, to deny, suspend or revoke any specific alcoholic beverages license\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 22, par. 9) and the power conferred on the Department by statute to liberally construe and strictly enforce the alcoholic beverage control laws (\u00a7\u00a7 23001 &amp; 23049). It is thus well within the Department\u2019s purview to determine that section 25502 applies to certain transactions but not to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The fact that the application of section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) has been and will be subject to interpretation by the Department in the exercise of its discretion is unremarkable. Hundreds of laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and application by state and local agencies designated to administer them; in so doing, the exercise of discretion is common. And the courts routinely review these decisions for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) As with other agencies, the Department\u2019s discretion is circumscribed by articulated standards and is subject to both administrative and judicial review. (\u00a7\u00a7 23084 &amp; 23090.2; see also <em>Kirby v. Alcoholic Bev. etc. Appeals Bd.., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.3d at p. 738 [court upheld the Department\u2019s interpretation of a statute because it was a \u201creasonable\u201d one, while noting that a different interpretation would have been unreasonable].) Accordingly, we need not address or anticipate the specter, conjured by ZD, of arbitrary and subjective decisionmaking by the Department in determining what is and is not prohibited under section 25502, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">ZD contends that section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) cannot prohibit paid advertising through a retailer\u2019s mailed catalog because section 25503, subdivision (h), which governs other prohibited conduct between suppliers and retailers, specifically prohibits only <em>on-premises </em>advertising. Therefore, ZD reasons, any other kind of advertising must be permitted. First, this contention cannot be correct, because if it were, then section 25503.3, subdivision (b)\u2014permitting a supplier to advertise in the publication of a bona fide trade association <em>only </em>\u201cif that publication does not advertise on behalf of, or directly benefit, any individual retail licensee\u201d\u2014would be superfluous. Additionally, in this day and age, it would make no sense to prohibit advertising on th\u00e9 <em>premises </em>of a retailer but allow advertising in a retailer\u2019s exclusive <em>catalog. </em>For mail order houses, the catalog is often the only \u201cpremises\u201d the retailer has.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">A similar argument was rejected by the California Supreme Court in <em>California Beer Wholesalers. </em>There, the Department denied the application of a licensed off-sale retailer for a wholesale liquor license as being a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>violation of the tied-house provisions of section 25502. The Board reversed the Department\u2019s decision, applying the following reasoning: Section 25502 provides that no wholesaler of beer, wine or distilled spirits may hold an interest in a retailer\u2019s off-sale liquor license. But section 25506 by its terms only prohibits a retailer from holding any interest in the business of a \u201cdistilled spirits wholesaler, . . . manufacturer, ... or manufacturer\u2019s agent.\u201d Therefore, under the doctrine of <em>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius </em>a retailer is free to acquire a wholesaler\u2019s beer and wine license. <em>(California Beer Wholesalers, supra, </em>5 Cal.Sd at pp. 405-406.) The court disagreed. \u201c[T]he attempt to use section 25506 to nullify the general prohibition of section 25502 would also nullify the Legislature\u2019s basic objective of erecting a triple-tiered system of distribution and licensing and would thereby weaken the entire framework of the statutory structure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 411.) Similarly, here, the narrow prohibition contained in section 25503, subdivision (h) cannot be used to nullify the general prohibition of section 25502 and the basic objective of the tied-house statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"AJX\">Finally, ZD makes the unadorned assertion that the only constitutionally permissible interpretation of section 25502 would be one which allows ZD to place paid advertising <em>anywhere </em>except on the premises of a retailer, citing <em>Actmedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stroh </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 830 F.2d 957. ZD complains that the Department \u201cignores <em>Actmedia </em>and its analysis\u201d and engages in a \u201c \u2018duck and avoid\u2019 technique\u201d by \u201casserting that administrative agencies cannot declare a statute unconstitutional.\u201d In our opinion, however, it is ZD who \u201cducks\u201d the issue. ZD fails to provide this court with its own analysis of <em>Actmedia </em>or any other relevant authority, as applied to the facts in this case, which might lead us to conclude that the Department\u2019s enforcement action under section 25502 in this limited context creates a constitutional question.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> &amp;Mere suggestions of error without supporting argument or authority other than general abstract principles do not properly present grounds for appellate review. The court is not required to make an independent, unassisted study of the record in search of error. The point is treated as waived and we pass it without further consideration. <em>(Lowery v. Robinson </em>(1965) 238 Cal.App.2d 36, 39 [47 Cal.Rptr. 495]; <em>Interinsurance Exchange v. Collins </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1445, 1448 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 126].)</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">ZD\u2019s reliance on <em>Actmedia </em>seems to be misplaced, in any event, because the rationale of <em>Actmedia </em>supports, rather than undercuts, the Department\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>decision. There, the court related the legislative history of the alcoholic beverage control laws. <em>(Actmedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stroh, supra, </em>830 F.2d at pp. 959-961.) <em>Actmedia </em>concluded that section 25503, subdivision (h) (prohibiting suppliers from purchasing on-premises advertising from retailers) was designed to \u201celiminate the possibility that such [advertising] payments could be used by large-scale operators to purchase favored treatment for their products by individual retailers, or even exclusion of their products\u2019 competing brands. . . . The concern that advertising payments could be used to conceal illegal payoffs to alcoholic beverage retailers appears to have been widely held at the time of section 25503(h)\u2019s enactment, . . . and we \u2018hesitate to disagree with the accumulated, common-sense judgments of [the] lawmakers\u2019 who originally enacted the provision or who have retained it in effect. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Actmedia, </em>at pp. 966-967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The same rationale applies to section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) and the extant facts. Here, the manufacturer paid for advertising in the exclusive catalog of the retailer. Unquestionably, the purpose of the exclusive catalog was to have the consumer purchase the winemaker\u2019s product <em>from the retailer. </em>This creates the potential for manufacturers and suppliers to gain \u201cfavored treatment for their products by individual retailers, or even exclusion of their products\u2019 competing brands\u201d in violation of the tied-house laws. <em>(Actmedia, Inc. v. Stroh, supra, </em>830 F.2d at pp. 966-967.) Further, a flat prohibition precluding manufacturers from making any payments to retailers for advertising has the salutary effect of \u201celiminat[ing] any danger that such payments will be used to conceal illegal payoffs and violations of the tied-house laws . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 967.)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">E. <em>No Applicable Exception to Section 25502 Governs These Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Having concluded that the Department correctly found the elements of a violation of section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) were established, it remains for us to determine whether such conduct is otherwise authorized anywhere else in the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our review of the Act turns up no authorization for supplier/winegrower licensees to pay for advertising in a catalog for a single retail licensee. To the contrary, the Legislature specifically authorized suppliers to advertise in \u201cany regular publication of a bona fide trade association the members of which are . . . retailers\u201d <em>but only if </em>that publication \u201cdoes not advertise on behalf of, or directly benefit, any individual retail licensee.\u201d (\u00a7 25503.3, subd. (b).) As noted by the Department, if section 25502, subdivision (a)(2) is somehow construed to allow suppliers to advertise in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>the catalog of a single retailer, why would the Legislature have created this exception allowing suppliers to advertise in a generic trade association publication so long as the publication does <em>not </em>benefit an individual retailer? We conclude the Legislature could not have intended to make an exception where there was no rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">in. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">In this proceeding we do not determine whether the decision of the Board can or should be affirmed; we determine only whether the Department\u2019s decision must be overturned based on any of the grounds set forth in section 23090.2. For the reasons set forth above, we hold\u2014and the Board appears to concede\u2014that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the statute is a rational one. Accordingly, it was error for the Board to substitute its own interpretation for that of the Department, nor are we allowed to supplant the Department\u2019s decision with one of our own. Having discovered no grounds for reversing the Department\u2019s decision, the Board\u2019s decision is vacated and the decision of the Department is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Reardon, Acting P. 1, and Sepulveda, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Unless otherwise noted all statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">ZD correctly argues that there is no legal authority that directly interprets subdivision (a)(2) of section 25502. However, <em>California Beer Wholesalers, </em>cited by the Department in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>decision, contains an extensive discussion of the tied-house laws generally and of section 25502 specifically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> Indeed, in the context of the law prohibiting a supplier from advertising on the premises of a retail establishment, the 1937 opinion distinguishes between a magazine in general circulation and a program handed out where a licensed retail establishment conducts business, such as at a baseball game.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">ZD argues: \u201cIn essence the Department\u2019s newly promulgated \u2018enforcement condition\u2019 . . . would rewrite Section 25502 to state: \u2018No [supplier]. . . shall. . . [f]umish, give, or lend any money or other thing of value OR PURCHASE, directly or indirectly, to, OR FROM . . . , any person engaged in operating, owning, or maintaining any off-sale licensed premises UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT DETERMINES IN ITS DISCRETION THAT SUCH CONDUCT (A) IS NOT IN CONNECTION WITH OR UNRELATED TO THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND (B) HAS BEEN PERFORMED BY SUCH SUPPLIER ...
