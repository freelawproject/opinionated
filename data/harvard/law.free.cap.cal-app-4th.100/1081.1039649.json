J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGL\">In this matter arising from construction defect litigation in the superior court, petitioner Pardee Construction Company (Pardee) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>seeks a writ of mandate directing the court to vacate an order denying Pardee\u2019s motion for stay of the proceedings and appointment of a judicial referee. Pardee contends the court erred in concluding provisions in Pardee\u2019s agreements with real parties in interest Ivan Ernesto. Rodriguez et al.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (together plaintiffs) that required the parties to submit their disputes to judicial reference were unconscionable and contrary to statutory law/public policy. Concluding the court properly denied Pardee\u2019s motion, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">This case involves seven detached single-family \u201centry-level\u201d residences<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> built in the late 1990\u2019s in the Otay Mesa area of San Diego.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In buying those homes from Pardee, plaintiffs signed agreements entitled \u201cOffer to Purchase and Escrow Instructions.\u201d Each agreement contained a paragraph 15 entitled \u201cJudicial Reference\u2014Trial by Judge in Court of Competent Jurisdiction-Waiver of Trial by Jury.\u201d Printed entirely in capital letters and single-spaced, paragraph 15 presented the appearance of a dense block of verbiage.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Paragraph 15\u2019s first subparagraph provided that all agreement-related claims, including those for construction defects, would be determined by a general reference conducted by a single referee (a retired superior court judge) appointed under Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> section 638 et seq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In particular, the referee would try all issues relating to such claims, whether of fact or law, and report a statement of decision; the referee would have power to grant all legal and equitable remedies; the parties would be deemed to have waived their rights to recover punitive damages; the parties would be entitled to the same discovery rights available in a court action; the referee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>would apply legal rules including the rules of evidence; and any dispute about the validity or interpretation of the judicial reference provision would be decided by a court without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">Paragraph 15\u2019s second subparagraph provided that if the judicial reference provisions were found invalid, all claims would be tried by a court without a jury and the parties would be deemed to have waived the right to punitive damages. Paragraph 15\u2019s third subparagraph provided that each word or group of words in paragraph 15 would be deemed severable, and that if any were held to be invalid, the decision would not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the paragraph. The parties initialed paragraph 15 at its end.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">In June 2001 plaintiffs filed a class action suit against Pardee for construction defects in the homes and underlying lots. In November 2001 Pardee appeared specially to seek a stay of the proceedings and appointment of a judicial referee under the terms of the parties\u2019 agreements. In opposing Pardee\u2019s motion, plaintiffs claimed the parties\u2019 agreements, including their judicial reference provisions, were contracts of adhesion, unconscionable and against public policy. After hearing, the superior court denied Pardee\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In denying Pardee\u2019s motion, the superior court concluded the parties\u2019 agreements were contracts of adhesion; the agreements\u2019 provisions requiring submission to judicial reference were unconscionable; the agreements\u2019 provisions effecting waiver of the right to recover punitive damages were contrary to public policy (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1668); and the agreements in their entirety were contrary to the public policy against compelling homeowners to submit construction defect claims to alternative dispute resolution (cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1298.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">In petitioning for a writ of mandate, Pardee contends the superior court\u2019s denial of its motion for stay and judicial reference was unreasonable, prejudicial, and contrary to law because (1) the parties\u2019 agreements were assertedly not contracts of adhesion; (2) the portions of the agreements\u2019 judicial reference provisions effecting the waiver of the parties\u2019 rights to jury trial and to recover punitive damages were assertedly not unconscionable or contrary to public policy (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1668); and (3) as applying only to binding arbitration, Code of Civil Procedure section 1298.7 is assertedly inapplicable to contractual provisions requiring judicial reference. Since the court properly denied Pardee\u2019s motion, we deny the petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Our analysis is narrowly tailored to this record, in particular to the parties\u2019 agreements. We do not decide any issue as a matter of law. Instead, on this record we simply conclude the parties\u2019 agreements were adhesive contracts fatally infected with procedural and substantive unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">\n<em>The Purchase Agreements Were Adhesion Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The superior court concluded the parties\u2019 agreements were contracts of adhesion because plaintiffs were presented with \u201cstandardized\u201d contracts \u201cdrafted\u201d by Pardee \u201cand imposed on plaintiffs who could only accept or reject\u201d them. Thus, in attacking the court\u2019s denial of its motion for judicial reference, Pardee first contends the parties\u2019 agreements were not contracts of adhesion. More particularly, Pardee asserts the court \u201celiminated\u201d the parties\u2019 contractual rights to judicial reference despite plaintiffs\u2019 failure to produce evidence that the parties\u2019 agreements were contracts of adhesion. Specifically, Pardee argues plaintiffs did not present evidence that if plaintiffs had refused to proceed with their home purchases from Pardee, plaintiffs could not have obtained other tract houses in other developments in the same general area from different sellers with purchase contracts that did not include judicial reference provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">\u201c \u2018The term [contract of adhesion] signifies a standardized contract, which, imposed and drafted by the party of superior bargaining strength, relegates to the subscribing party only the opportunity to adhere to the contract or reject it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 83, 113 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745, 6 P.3d 669] <em>(Armendariz); Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>II Davorge </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 819, 826 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 1]; <em>Izzi v. Mesquite Country Club </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1309, 1318 [231 Cal.Rptr. 315].) \u201cIf the contract is adhesive, the court must then determine whether \u2018other factors are present which, under established legal rules\u2014legislative or judicial\u2014operate to render it [unenforceable].\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Generally speaking, there are two judicially imposed limitations on the enforcement of adhesion contracts or provisions thereof. The first is that such a contract or provision which does not fall within the reasonable expectations of the weaker or \u201cadhering\u201d party will not be enforced against him. [Citations.] The second\u2014a principle of equity applicable to all contracts generally\u2014is that a contract or provision, even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>consistent with the reasonable expectations of the parties, will be denied enforcement if, considered in its context, it is unduly oppressive or \u201cunconscionable.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.] Subsequent cases have referred to both the \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 and the \u2018oppressive\u2019 limitations as being aspects of unconscionability.\u201d <em>{Armendariz, supra, </em>at p. 113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">\u201cUnconscionability analysis begins with an inquiry into whether the contract is one of adhesion.\u201d <em>(Armendariz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 113.)  Although this record contains no specific evidence of adhesion, the introduction to Pardee\u2019s petition alleged that plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was brought by 13 individuals, with 11 of those plaintiffs potentially filing suit as class representatives for up to 187 additional sets of class members (for the project where plaintiffs live) or potentially 800 additional sets of class members (for the master plan development where plaintiffs\u2019 project is located); and each and every purchase agreement for the project and the entire master plan development included the judicial reference provision. By thus acknowledging that none of the hundreds of home purchasers struck out the judicial reference provision, Pardee has effectively admitted the parties\u2019 agreements were adhesive. Further, as potential buyers interested in Pardee\u2019s entry-level homes, plaintiffs were unlikely to have significant economic bargaining power against developer Pardee. Moreover, since judicial reference provisions were contained in agreements for purchase of all homes in Pardee\u2019s large development, plaintiffs had little choice other than to sign those agreements as presented by Pardee. As stated by the superior court at the hearing on Pardee\u2019s motion, the situation presented each buyer with \u201ca take-it-or-leave-it proposition\u201d; and since each buyer was \u201cbuying a house,\u201d not \u201ca piece of sporting equipment\u201d or some other \u201cregular type of product,\u201d factors such as \u201clocation,\u201d \u201cview,\u201d and \u201cset-back\u201d made it \u201ca pretty unique purchase,\u201d one that \u201cfor most people\u201d is \u201cthe biggest purchase they will ever make in their life.\u201d The court also stated that \u201cas a practical matter,\u201d Pardee\u2019s argument that plaintiffs \u201ccan go elsewhere if they don\u2019t like it\u201d flies \u201cin the face\u201d of \u201cthe uniqueness of a home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In sum, the superior court properly concluded the parties\u2019 agreements were adhesive contracts. Finally, in any event, even if the parties\u2019 agreements were deemed not to be adhesive, plaintiffs have established the judicial reference provisions of those agreements were unconscionable at the time such agreements were made. <em>(Armendariz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 113; <em>Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. v. II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 828.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">\n<em>The Agreements\u2019 Judicial Reference Provisions Were Unconscionable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Pardee meritlessly contends the judicial reference provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements effectively waiving their rights to jury trial and to recover punitive damages were not procedurally or substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\u201cUnconscionability is ultimately a question of law for the court.\u201d <em>(American Software, Inc. v. Ali </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1386, 1391 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 477].) Unconscionability \u201c \u2018has both a \u201cprocedural\u201d and a \u201csubstantive\u201d element,\u2019 the former focusing on \u2018 \u201coppression\u201d \u2019 or \u2018 \u201csurprise\u201d \u2019 due to unequal bargaining power, the latter on \u2018 \u201coverly harsh\u201d \u2019 or \u2018 \u201cone-sided\u201d \u2019 results. [Citation.] \u2018The prevailing view is that [procedural and substantive unconscionability] must <em>both </em>be present in order for a court to exercise its discretion to refuse to enforce a contract or clause under the doctrine of unconscionability. \u2019 [Citation.] But they need not be present in the same degree. \u2018Essentially a sliding scale is invoked which disregards the regularity of the procedural process of the contract formation, that creates the terms, in proportion to the greater harshness or unreasonableness of the substantive terms themselves.\u2019 [Citations.] In other words, the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and vice versa.\u201d <em>(Armendariz, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 114.) In essence, \u201cunconscionability has both a procedural and a substantive element, both of which must be present to render a contract unenforceable.\u201d <em>(24 Hour Fitness, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1212-1213 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 533].) However, \u201c[although both elements must be present before a contract or contract provision is rendered unenforceable on grounds of unconscionability, they are reviewed in tandem such that \u2018the greater the degree of substantive unconscionability, the less the degree of procedural unconscionability that is required to annul the contract or clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kinney v. United Healthcare Services, Inc. </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1322, 1329 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 348] <em>(Kinney).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">\n<em>Issue of Procedural Unconscionability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">\u201c \u2018Procedural unconscionability\u2019 concerns the manner in which the contract was negotiated and the circumstances of the parties at that time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1089\">*1089</page-number><em>(Kinney, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 1329; <em>American Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ali, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1390.) Procedural unconscionability \u201cfocuses on factors of oppression and surprise. [Citation.] The oppression component arises from an inequality of bargaining power of the parties to the contract and an absence of real negotiation or a meaningful choice on the part of the weaker party.\u201d <em>(Kinney, </em>at p. 1329.) \u201cThe second component of procedural unconscionability encompasses an aspect of surprise, with the terms to which the party supposedly agreed being hidden in a prolix printed form drafted by the party seeking to enforce them.\u201d <em>{Ibid.', </em>accord, <em>Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 828.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">In contending the judicial reference provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements were not procedurally unconscionable at the time those agreements were made <em>(Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v. Blue Cross of California </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 677, 688 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 809]), Pardee contends plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that the agreements were oppressive or that their judicial reference provisions containing waivers of the rights to jury trial and to recover punitive damages were a surprise. Specifically, Pardee asserts plaintiffs made no attempt to present evidence that they were unable to buy similar homes elsewhere under purchase contracts that did not include judicial reference provisions. However, this record reveals that procedural unconscionability existed at the time the parties\u2019 agreements were formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">With respect to the oppression component of procedural unconscionability, the parties had unequal bargaining power. As discussed, as potential purchasers of entry-level homes, plaintiffs stood in an economic position well below Pardee, the developer of hundreds of homes in the master plan development. <em>{Kinney, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 1329.) As also discussed, since judicial reference provisions were contained in all agreements for purchase of homes in the entirety of Pardee\u2019s master plan development of several hundred units, plaintiffs had no meaningful choice with respect to accepting those provisions. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Further, as reflected by Pardee\u2019s admission that none of the hundreds of home buyers in the development struck out the judicial reference provision contained in every purchase agreement, there was no real negotiation by the parties about removal of those provisions. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">With respect to the surprise component of procedural unconscionability, the essential elements of the judicial reference provisions, including the waiver of jury trial, were buried in the form contracts drafted by Pardee. <em>(Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. v. II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 828; <em>Kinney, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at p. 1329.) First, the judicial reference provisions in paragraph 15 of the parties\u2019 agreements were physically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1090\">*1090</page-number>difficult to read as printed in dense, single-spaced capital letters. Further, the term \u201cJudicial Reference\u201d in paragraph 15\u2019s caption did not explain the essence of the judicial reference provisions or otherwise convey anything meaningful to an entry-level purchaser. Moreover, although accurate, the next term in paragraph 15\u2019s caption, \u201cTrial by Judge in Court of Competent Jurisdiction,\u201d was misleading as applying only in the event the judicial reference provisions were not enforced. Additionally, paragraph 15\u2019s caption did not mention that the purchaser was waiving the right to punitive damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Finally, a significant element of the surprise component of paragraph 15\u2019s procedural unconscionability was the absence of any mention of referee\u2019s fees or responsibility for their payment, thus leaving open the potential that the buyers might be liable, in part or whole, for those fees. As counsel indicated at oral argument, a usual referee\u2019s fee in San Diego was $200 to $300 per hour. Unlike attorney fees contingent on some measure of plaintiffs\u2019 success, the referee\u2019s fees potentially owed by plaintiffs could likely accrue at that rate to an amount constituting heavy burdens for buyers of entry-level homes. Since savings in costs purportedly constituted a fundamental rationale for the judicial reference provisions, it is particularly surprising that nothing in the caption or body of paragraph 15 mentioned referee\u2019s fees or responsibility for paying those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In sum, the judicial reference provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements were procedurally unconscionable because (1) there was no real bargaining about those provisions, (2) paragraph 15 was difficult to read and misleading, and (3) the agreements omitted mention of the economically significant matter of referee\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">\n<em>Issue of Substantive Unconscionability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">\u201cSubstantive unconscionability focuses on the actual terms of the agreement . . . .\u201d <em>(American Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ali, supra, 46 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1390.) \u201cWhile courts have defined the substantive element in various ways, it traditionally involves contract terms that are so one-sided as to \u2018shock the conscience,\u2019 or that impose harsh or oppressive terms.\u201d <em>(24 Hour Fitness, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1213; accord, <em>Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. v. II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1091\">*1091</page-number>829.) Oppression is present when an agreement includes terms serving to limit the obligations or liability of the stronger party. <em>(Madden v. Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 699, 713 [131 Cal.Rptr. 882, 552 P.2d 1178].) Thus, in essence, \u201c \u2018[s]ubstantive unconscionability\u2019 focuses on the terms of the agreement and whether those terms are \u2018so one-sided as to <em>\u201cshock the conscience.\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kinney, supra, </em>70 Gal.App.4th at p. 1330; <em>American Software, Inc., </em>at p. 1391.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">The record indicates the judicial reference provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements were substantively unconscionable at the time those agreements were formed. As Pardee virtually concedes, paragraph 15\u2019s terms effecting a waiver of the right to recover punitive damages, albeit potentially severable from the remainder of that paragraph, were substantively unconscionable as, in practical reality, only for Pardee\u2019s benefit. (Cf. Civ. Code, \u00a7 1668;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. v. II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 829; <em>Kinney, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1330-1331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Further, although plaintiffs may \u201ccertainly\u201d waive their constitutional right to a jury trial, \u201c \u2018the right to pursue claims in a judicial forum is a substantial right and one not lightly to be deemed waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 829; <em>Marsch </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1994) 23 Cal.App.4th 250, 254 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 398].) Hence, before upholding the provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements purporting to effect a waiver of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional right to trial by jury, we must closely scrutinize the impact of the waiver on the parties. Although in an appropriate case such waiver might be advantageous to plaintiffs as providing efficiencies of speed and economy not always afforded in a jury trial, nothing in the record suggests this is such a case. At oral argument both counsel represented that significant portions of construction defect cases are already commonly sent to judicial reference. Thus, the only potential savings to litigants from jury waivers would be that actual time in trial might be shorter. However, there was no evidence showing why a referee-tried matter would be shorter than a jury trial (except for the time incurred in jury selection).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Accordingly, since Pardee has not alleged or shown that in San Diego County cases would be heard appreciably sooner injudicial reference than in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1092\">*1092</page-number>a court of jurisdiction or that proceedings once started in judicial reference would be appreciably shorter than in a jury trial, we cannot say that waiver of a jury trial in this case would in fact result in any significant saving of time or costs. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests th\u00e1t buyers otherwise gained anything from waiving their substantial constitutional right to a jury trial. <em>(Villa Milano Homeowners Assn. v. II Davorge, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 829; <em>Marsch v. Williams, supra, </em>23 Cal.App.4th at p. 254.) Thus, as giving buyers nothing in return for such waiver, the judicial reference provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements were so one-sided as to be substantively unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In sum, the superior court properly concluded the judicial reference provisions of the parties\u2019 agreements were unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">\n<em>Court\u2019s Ruling Was Consistent with Public Policy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Section 1298.7 provides: \u201cIn the event an arbitration provision is included in a contract or agreement covered by this title [sections 1298-1298.8 involving real estate contract arbitration], it shall not preclude or limit any right of action for bodily injury or wrongful death, or any right of action to which Section 337.1 [patent construction defect] or 337.15 [latent construction defect] is applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">At the hearing on Pardee\u2019s motion for judicial reference, the court noted that \u201cas opposed to any other type of case, we do have a statute, . . . Section 1298.7, which really talks about public policy of not requiring homeowners to submit their claims to Alternative Dispute Resolution.\u201d In its minute order denying Pardee\u2019s motion for judicial reference, the superior court concluded the parties\u2019 agreements \u201cas a whole\u201d were \u201ccontrary to the public policy against compelling homeowners to submit their construction defect claims to alternative dispute resolution. (See ... \u00a7 1298.7.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">Attacking the court\u2019s conclusion, Pardee contends section 1298.7 does not apply to contractual provisions requiring submission to judicial reference but instead only to provisions requiring binding arbitration. Further, Pardee contends the court improperly sought to use the statutory scheme involving binding arbitration to create public policy involving judicial reference. However, fairly read, the court\u2019s oral and written statements did not say section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>1298.7 was controlling here. Instead, the court simply indicated such statute expressed a legislative statement of public policy favoring a trial with full procedural and constitutional rights over alternative dispute resolution in the context of construction defect litigation. We believe the court properly concluded that although not controlling, section 1298.7 was informative in these circumstances involving judicial reference provisions in real estate sales documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The petition is denied.
