(the father), the presumed father of 10-year-old Victoria C. (the minor), challenges the juvenile court\u2019s summary dismissal of his Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 388 petition seeking modification of the court\u2019s custody order and requesting the removal of the minor from the custody of her mother, Becky C. (the mother). We conclude the court erred, but find the error harmless and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The minor\u2019s parents have never been married and do not currently live together. Pursuant to family court proceedings, the minor lived with her mother and visited her father every other weekend and on Wednesdays. The minor\u2019s parents have ongoing problems regarding custody and visitation. As a result, the father filed 14 custody order violation police reports in the first seven months of 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The family came to the attention of Orange County Social Services Agency (SSA) in July 2000. The mother told authorities the father hit the minor on numerous occasions, which left marks and bruises, and burned the minor with a glue gun. She also reported other instances of physical abuse dating back to 1998. The mother also reported that the minor had twice been hospitalized for suicidal ideation and depression, took medication for depression, and was involved in ongoing individual and group counseling. The minor frequently indicated that she did not want to visit her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">When contacted by SSA, the father acknowledged he had used inappropriate physical force to discipline the minor and occasionally argued with the mother in front of the child, but also claimed the mother verbally abused the minor and contributed to the minor\u2019s reluctance to visit him. The father had voluntarily taken anger management and parenting courses, but continued to have problems with the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In late July 2000, SSA advised the mother to obtain a restraining order prohibiting the father from contacting the minor. SSA took the minor into protective custody when the mother failed to follow through in a timely manner. The minor was immediately released to the mother\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">On August 8, SSA filed a dependency petition alleging the minor suffered serious physical and emotional harm (\u00a7 300, subds. (a), (c)), and the mother knew of the harm and failed to protect the minor (\u00a7 300, subd. (b)). The mother and the father pleaded no contest to the allegations and the court declared the minor to be a dependent child of the juvenile court. The court ordered the minor to remain in the mother\u2019s custody, with weekly monitored visitation with the father, and the preparation of a psychological evaluation of the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">In April 2001, the minor arrived for a supervised visit with the father wearing \u201ca black ski mask, screaming, and crying, and refused to visit with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>her father.\u201d The night before, the minor wrote a \u201cgood-bye letter\u201d to her family, threatened other children in her household with a knife, and appeared to be responding to auditory and visual hallucinations. The minor\u2019s counselors recommended she stop visiting with the father and the father agreed to temporarily discontinue visitation. However, the social worker noted in an interim report that she was \u201cpuzzled with this situation.\u201d She observed that the mother had not timely reported the minor\u2019s hallucinations, suicide note, or threatening behavior. The social worker stated, \u201cIt appears the only emergency in the mother\u2019s mind was getting the visits with the father stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">On May 16, the court terminated the father\u2019s visitation and ordered Psychologist Dr. David Garland to prepare an Evidence Code section 730 evaluation of the minor and her parents. Dr. Garland concluded both parents had demonstrated poor judgment with respect to their treatment and interaction with the minor, but that \u201cif [the minor] is allowed to continue to [live] with her mother at this time, she will continue to demonstrate periods of decompensation.\u201d Dr. Garland averred, \u201c[T]hat dramatic measures would need to be taken to sever the pathological ties that [the minor] has with [the] mother, and to enable her to have a positive relationship with both parents. As long as [the minor] continues in the custody of her mother there is no chance of her having a positive relationship with her father.\u201d He recommended placement in \u201ca highly structured Group Home or residential treatment setting,\u201d with monitored visitation for both parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On July 13, SSA filed a supplemental petition under section 387. The petition alleged, referring to Dr. Garland\u2019s report, that the mother subjected the minor to \u201cemotional abuse,\u201d \u201c \u2018interfered with the [minor\u2019s] relationship with [the] father,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018demonstrated poor judgment to the detriment of [the minor].\u2019 \u201d Notwithstanding the evaluation, the court dismissed the supplemental petition three days later, \u201cwithout prejudice on motion of [County Counsel].\u201d All parties stipulated to the dismissal and the case was continued for a six-month review hearing, leaving the prior custody order and order prohibiting the father\u2019s visitation intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Before the review hearing, the father filed a section 388 petition for modification of the court\u2019s custody and visitation orders, requesting that \u201cThe minor be removed from the care of her mother and the father resume visitation . . . .\u201d According to the father\u2019s declaration, the supplemental petition was dismissed because there was no alternative placement available. The father had relinquished visitation rights in hopes of improving the situation, but now wanted to resume visitation with the minor. With respect to the request for removal, the father stated, \u201cNothing has changed since the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>social worker originally filed the supplemental petition. In fact, my daughter has been allowed to remain in a home where she is subjected to emotional abuse and put in the role of being a parent to her mother. I feel that it would be in my daughter[\u2019]s best interest to be removed from her mother\u2019s care based on the results of the 730 evaluation. I feel that I need to protect my daughter\u2019s interests since the social services agency has not yet refiled the supplemental petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">County counsel opposed the father\u2019s removal request, arguing \u201c[T]he bottom Une is the Legislature has put the duty of investigation on the social worker and the filing of the petition on the social worker and it is the sole discretion of the social worker when it comes to removal from the parent. And there\u2019s nothing contrary to that in the case or statutory law.\u201d The court agreed: \u201c[T]he relief sought regarding the minor being removed from the care of her mother is not permitted under the statute, nor case law that has been cited to me. So I\u2019ll not address that issue in the 388. RQ However, the issue of visitation is clearly within the realm of the court regarding a 388, so we are going to hear the 388. I\u2019ll order it be filed in regards to visitation. However, that issue runs concurrent with the [six-month] review hearing . . . I\u2019m granting an evidentiary hearing regarding visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">During the combined hearing, the court admitted SSA reports and Dr. Garland\u2019s report, and received the testimony of Dr. Garland, the social worker, and the minor. Dr. Garland reiterated his opinion that the mother \u201crepeatedly attempted to ahenate the [minor] from her father,\u201d was \u201cnot really able to focus appropriately on the [minor\u2019s] needs,\u201d and posed an \u201cemotional risk\u201d to the minor. It was his opinion, \u201cthat as long as the [minor is] in the custody of her mother ... the mother will continue to undermine that relationship and interfere with any relationship between the [minor] and her father.\u201d Dr. Garland acknowledged the father\u2019s prior physical and emotional abuse of the minor. Without minimizing the damage the father had caused, Dr. Garland recommended \u201csomething dramatic ... to take [the minor] out of her mother\u2019s home and to put her in a neutral setting where therapeutic efforts can be attempted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">The minor, who testified outside the presence of her parents, stated, \u201cI do not want to see my dad because of how he hurt me and when I\u2019m around him, I can still feel the anger and sadness that he put me through and I hate him. I would not want visitations with him. I would love to live with my mom and to stay with her because I don\u2019t like my dad.\u201d However, she later indicated that she would attempt monitored visitation with the father and counseling if ordered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The social worker testified that despite the filing of the supplemental petition, SSA did not recommend removing the minor from the mother\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the court retained jurisdiction, ordered custody of the minor to remain with the mother under the supervision of SSA, and visitation with the father, \u201cto begin only after a therapist feels it\u2019s appropriate . . . .\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">County counsel, the father, and the minor agree the court erred by summarily dismissing the portion of the father\u2019s section 388 petition requesting the minor be removed from the mother\u2019s home. The mother, relying on <em>Kimberly R. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1067 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 670] <em>(Kimberly R.) </em>and <em>Allen M. v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1069 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 259] <em>(Allen M.), </em>and adopting county counsel\u2019s position in the trial court, argues the father\u2019s sole remedy was a timely objection to the dismissal of the section 387 supplemental petition and that his failure to object constitutes a waiver of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">To resolve the procedural conundrum with which we are faced, a brief overview of dependency proceedings is in order: \u201cThe objective of the dependency scheme is to protect abused or neglected children and those at substantial risk thereof and to provide permanent, stable homes if those children cannot be returned home within a prescribed period of time. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Marilyn H. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 295, 307 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 544, 851 P.2d 826].) \u201cDependency proceedings are proceedings of an ongoing nature. While different hearings within the dependency process have different standards and purposes, they are part of an overall process and ongoing case. One section of the dependency law may not be considered in a vacuum. It must be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">When a child comes to the attention of governmental authorities and a social worker determines the child must be detained, a section 300 \u201coriginal\u201d petition must be timely filed to commence proceedings to adjudge the child a dependent of the juvenile court. (\u00a7 325; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1406(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) A \u201csubsequent\u201d petition is filed when jurisdiction has been established and the petitioner alleges new facts or circumstances, other than those sustained in the original petition, warranting continuation of jurisdiction. (\u00a7 342; rule 1430(b).) \u201cSupplemental\u201d petitions are filed if the social worker determines the previous disposition order has not been effective and it is necessary to remove \u201cthe child from the physical custody of a parent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>guardian, relative, or friend and direct[] placement in a foster home, or commitment to a private or county institution. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 387; see also rule 1430(c).) In each instance, the social worker initiates proceedings by the filing of a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Once the court has taken jurisdiction over a dependent child, \u201c[a]ny parent or other person having an interest in a child who is a dependent child of the juvenile court [a person with standing in the dependency action] . . . may, upon grounds of change of circumstance or new evidence, petition the court. . . for a hearing to change, modify, or set aside <em>any </em>order of court previously made or to terminate the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d (\u00a7 388, italics added.) Because the statute states \u201cany\u201d order, we presume the Legislature intended to permit liberal use of this procedure to challenge all types of orders in an ongoing case, including custody and placement orders. (See <em>Kimberly R., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 1077 [\u201cA section 388 petition may seek any conceivable change or modification of an existing order.\u201d].) Further, a broad interpretation of the statutory language comports with the purpose of section 388. <em>(In re Marilyn H., supra </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 308-309 [\u201cthe parent has the continuing right to petition the court for a modification of any of its orders based upon changed circumstances or new evidence pursuant to section 388\u201d].) It appears the only difference between a request for removal of a child from a parental home and any other order is a more stringent burden of proof: a request for removal from a parental home, or to a \u201cmore restrictive placement,\u201d requires clear and convincing evidence that grounds for removal exist. <em>(In re Katrina C. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 540, 549 [247 Cal.Rptr. 784]; rule 1432(f).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the father\u2019s section 388 modification petition was an appropriate procedural vehicle to seek removal of the minor from the mother\u2019s custody, and the juvenile court erred by concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The mother\u2019s reliance on <em>Kimberly R. </em>and <em>Allen M. </em>is misplaced. Both cases addressed the agency\u2019s obligation to justify a request for dismissal following the filing of a section 300 original petition <em>(Allen </em>M), or a section 387 supplemental petition <em>(Kimberly R.), </em>concluding that an objecting party may force a hearing for which the agency bears the burden of proof. <em>(Kimberly R., supra, 96 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 1077-1078; <em>Allen M., supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 1074.) Neither case addressed what procedure is available to a noncustodial parent to challenge a custody order, although the <em>Kimberly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number><em>R. </em>court did mention, \u201ca section 388 \u2018modification hearing\u2019 petition can ultimately result in removing a child from parental custody (on the higher clear and convincing standard). . . .\u201d <em>(Kimberly R., supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 1077 [dicta].)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Nor are we convinced a \u201cwaiver rule\u201d should apply because a timely objection to SSA\u2019s dismissal of the supplemental petition was the most expeditious way to challenge the court\u2019s custody order. Here, the father did not object to the dismissal because no group home placement was available and he thought the situation might improve. When no improvement was forthcoming, he filed the section 388 petition. Based on the facts of this case, the father\u2019s decision to stipulate to the dismissal was appropriate. We see no reason to punish him for his patience; neither the statutory framework nor public policy considerations require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Although the erroneous denial of a hearing on a section 388 petition is not necessarily harmless (see <em>In re Hashem H. </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1791, 1800-1801 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 294]), we find no reason to reverse the judgment and order a second hearing here. The juvenile court must address the \u201ccontinuing necessity for and appropriateness of the [child\u2019s] placement\u201d at every periodic review hearing when parental custody is supervised. (\u00a7\u00a7 361.2, subd. (b)(2)), 366, subd. (a)(1)(A).) The court conducted a contested review hearing, during which it admitted the declaration submitted with the father\u2019s section 388 petition, SSA reports, Dr. Garland\u2019s report and his testimony, and the testimony of other witnesses. After careful consideration of the evidence and the arguments of counsel, the court reaffirmed its previous custody order. The court\u2019s mistaken belief it lacked jurisdiction to change or modify its custody order pursuant to the father\u2019s section 388 petition did not prevent the parties from presenting evidence and arguing their respective cases, and the father has failed to point to any evidence that would be presented at a second hearing. Thus, the court\u2019s procedural error did not infringe on the father\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The mother also claims the father\u2019s section 388 petition was \u201cfacially insufficient\u201d to justify a hearing because it failed to allege any changed circumstances warranting removal of the minor. We disagree. The father challenged the court\u2019s May 16 disposition order, not the later dismissal order. Thus, all the facts and circumstances alleged in the father\u2019s section 388 petition were changed circumstances or new evidence as to that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We decline to address county counsel\u2019s alternative contention that the father should have requested the initiation of new dependency proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>pursuant to sections 329 and 331.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have determined a noncustodial parent may file a section 388 petition to seek the removal of a dependent minor from the home of the custodial parent. We need not render an advisory opinion on whether the father had other remedies available to him, or if the court could have construed an appropriately filed section 388 petition as something else. <em>(Salazar v. Eastin </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 836, 860 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 21, 890 P.2d 43].)</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The orders of the juvenile court are affirmed.
