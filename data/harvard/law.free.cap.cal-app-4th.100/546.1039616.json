J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACM\">Plaintiffs Michael McElroy and Gary Nelson, officers with the City of Orange Police Department (OPD), appeal from a summary judgment entered in favor of defendants the State of California and California Highway Patrol (CHP) Officers Brent Pembleton and Aaron D\u2019Aoust. The CHP officers collided with plaintiffs\u2019 unmarked police car after joining an ongoing pursuit in the City of Orange.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Prior to the accident, defendants were returning to their station when they \u201cnoticed several marked police vehicles traveling \u2018Code 3\u2019 . . .in front of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>them.\u201d Defendants followed the police cars and attempted to make radio contact with the OPD dispatcher to find out the nature of the chase. Plaintiffs filed suit alleging negligence; they sought damages for injuries sustained in the accident. Defendants moved for summary judgment contending they were immune from liability under the \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule\u201d as construed in <em>Calatayud v. State of California </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1057 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 202, 959 P.2d 360] <em>(Calatayud). </em>In their deposition testimony, defendants stated they observed plaintiffs\u2019 unmarked car approaching an intersection; as defendants approached the intersection, they activated their overhead lights to \u201cwarn traffic\u201d behind them and assist the OPD units in their pursuit. The court granted the motion after concluding \u201cthe individual parties were \u2018jointly engaged\u2019 in their duties as peace officers within the meaning set forth in <em>[Calatayud] </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The undisputed facts show that all officers involved were on duty at the time of the accident. The only issue on appeal is whether defendants were \u201cjointly engaged\u201d with plaintiffs in the pursuit such that they are shielded from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><em>Calatayud </em>holds that unintentional harm caused by law enforcement officers to their fellow officers does not fall into the statutory exception to the \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1714.9, subd. (a)(1)) when the officers are \u201cjointly involved\u201d in police or rescue activities. <em>(Calatayud, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1068.) The rationale for the decision is that liability would needlessly impair the ability of separate agencies to coordinate or for the individuad officers involved to make judgment calls \u201cwhen responding to a rapidly developing emergency or crisis. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1069, fn. omitted; see also <em>Farnam v. State of California </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 1448, 1453-1454 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 642].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Plaintiffs argue defendants were not \u201cjointly engaged\u201d in the pursuit because they were not summoned to assist in the chase and they made no radio contact with the OPD (and consequently had no idea what the pursuit was about). Although the court in <em>Calatayud </em>used the terms \u201cjointly engaged\u201d <em>(Calatayud, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1060, fn. 3), \u201cjointly involved\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1068), \u201cjoint operations\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1069), and \u201cjointly discharging their duties\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1071) to limit the scope of officer-to-officer immunity, it made no attempt to define these terms with any precision.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Nonetheless, the public policies underlying the \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule\u201d support immunity in this case. In <em>Calatayud </em>the plaintiff responded to \u201can \u2018officer needs assistance\u2019 call\u201d and assisted fellow officers to subdue a suspect. <em>(Calatayud, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1060.) He was not participating in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>preplanned, well-coordinated multiple agency operation. (See, e.g., <em>City of Oceanside v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 269, 272 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 621] [city and Camp Pendleton lifeguards \u201cconducted a joint operation to rescue a jet ski collision victim\u201d].) To limit the \u201cfirefighter\u2019s rule\u201d to those situations where the officers are engaged in formally coordinated efforts ignores the reality that situations in the field may develop quickly and chaotically, and although officers arriving on the scene later might lack information available to officers originally summoned to the crisis, the former are nonetheless satisfying \u201ctheir primary commitment to the public\u2019s essential safety and protection . . . .\u201d (Calatayud, supra, 18 Cal.4th at p. 1069.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Respondents shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">O\u2019Leary, 1, and Moore, 1, concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
