Code, \u00a7 273a, subd. (a)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 664), and aggravated arson (\u00a7 451.5, subd. (a)(3)) and found that he inflicted great bodily injury on the child (\u00a7\u00a7 1203, subd. (e)(3), 12022.7, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal he claims the trial court erred in denying a continuance so he could be represented by retained counsel or represent himself. He claims defense counsel was incompetent for not requesting an instruction on voluntary intoxication. He claims there is insufficient evidence to support the convictions for attempted murder and aggravated arson. He also claims the court erred in failing to appoint new counsel for the purpose of filing a motion for new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the conviction for aggravated arson, reverse the judgment, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">II. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">The primary witness against defendant was Anna Owczarska. At the time of trial, she was in custody for having left a drug treatment program. She admitted having a prior misdemeanor conviction for auto theft. She testified that in 1998, she was living with her baby daughter and defendant in an apartment on Magliocco Drive in San Jose. She said he hit her and would disconnect the phone and once pulled a knife on her. He also told her he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>hired somebody to kill her and that she would not live to her 22d birthday on February 25, 1999.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Owczarska testified than on February 5, 1999, she and defendant smoked crack cocaine and argued. Later, she left to buy some baby formula, leaving defendant angry and alone with the baby. Owczarska first drove to see her mother, Renata Pilichowski, and her husband, Wieslaw, to ask them for money. They had none to give her so she went to a friend\u2019s house to smoke some more crack. From there, she drove to a store to buy formula. When she returned home, she found the front door lock jammed with a piece of metal. She knocked, but no one answered. The windows were also locked. After a while, she freed the lock and opened the door. Inside, she smelled gas and noticed that everything was dark and closed up, even the bathroom window, which was usually kept open.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">When Owczarska mentioned the smell of gas to defendant, he grabbed the baby, handed her to Owczarska, and told her to leave. However, Owczarska put the baby down and decided to have a cigarette. Defendant told her not to light it \u201ccause the house is going to blow-up.\u201d He then went into the bathroom. Owczarska lit her cigarette, and the apartment exploded.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Owczarska screamed, defendant grabbed the baby, and the three fled. As they drove away, defendant told her he was trying to kill himself. He told her not to tell the police because they would think he was crazy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They did not go to the hospital for fear that defendant might be arrested on outstanding warrants and instead drove to a friend\u2019s apartment. However, the friend insisted they take the baby to the hospital. They drove to the parking lot at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, where Renata and her husband, Wieslaw, were parked. Owczarska and Renata then took the baby to the emergency room. The baby suffered extensive and serious bums and respiratory injury. Owczarska suffered first and second degree bums, mostly on her hands and face.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Later, Renata returned to the parking lot, and she and Wieslaw took defendant to get some money, cigarettes, and a bottle of liquor, which he drank in the car. They then drove to a friend\u2019s apartment. Renata and Wieslaw entered, but defendant stayed in the car and fell asleep. Police found him there and arrested him. According to Renata, defendant was depressed because he had closed his business and was not working.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Jeffrey Weber, an investigator for the San Jose Fire Department, testified as an expert in determining the origin and cause of fires. He went to the scene of the explosion and found six heavily damaged apartments and others with moderate damage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He traced the origin of the explosion to defendant\u2019s apartment, No. 4. He explained that gas lines had been cut or forcibly broken, and the other parts of the heater had been dismantled, allowing gas to flow freely into the apartment. He noted that attached to the heater were printed instructions in case the pilot light went out. They do not require that the gas lines be cut or the heater dismantled.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Weber explained that an accumulation of gas could be ignited by a refrigerator or a light switch cycling on but opined that here it was probably ignited by the cigarette lighter found near the heater. According to Weber, the safest place in the apartment was the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Owczarska, Renata, and Wieslaw testified that there had always been problems with the wall heater and the pilot light. Renata said she had on occasion smelled gas in the apartment. Wieslaw testified that after the explosion, defendant told him about the smelling gas but did not mention trying to fix the heater.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\n<em>The Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Defendant testified that he had his own business for three years but sold it in January 1999 because he was losing money. He had money in the bank and decided to take several weeks off. He said he was not happy about his employment situation but denied being depressed about it. He also denied that he jammed the door lock and filled the apartment with gas to harm Owczarska or the baby or destroy the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Defendant testified that on February 5, 1999, he had four or five brandies, starting about 6:00 p.m.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Around 8:00 p.m., the heater would not start, but Owczarska was able to light it. At 11:00 p.m., he fell asleep, and at 2:00 a.m., Owczarska woke him up. She asked for money and left. Defendant noticed that the heater was off again, and when he tried to light it, it blew up. He smelled gas, heard a \u201chissing sound,\u201d and decided to fix it. As he tried to tighten a gas line fitting, his wrench slipped and cracked the pipe. Fearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>another explosion, he ripped out gas lines, wires, and a valve and stuffed a plastic bag in the pipe to plug the gas leak. Defendant decided to wait for Owczarska rather than disturb the landlord. He opened the doors and windows to air out the apartment, but when he got cold, he closed everything. He then returned to the couch and fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Defendant woke up when he heard Owczarska yelling and pounding on the door. She seemed paranoid, and defendant thought she was on drugs. Both smelled gas, and defendant picked up the baby, gave her to Owczarska, and told her to leave. However, Owczarska put the baby down and pulled out a cigarette lighter. Defendant \u201cfreaked\u201d and told her the place could blow up. He then went into the bathroom and was there when the apartment exploded.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Defendant and Owczarska fled with the baby to a friend\u2019s house and then to the hospital parking lot to see Renata and Wieslaw. Renata and Owczarska took the baby to the emergency room, and defendant and Wieslaw waited outside. Later, Renata and Wieslaw took defendant to the bank and then to the store, where he bought cigarettes and a pint of schnapps. From there, they drove to a friend\u2019s apartment so Renata and Wieslaw could freshen up. Defendant stayed in the car, drank the pint of schnapps, and fell asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">After his arrest, defendant wrote to Owczarska. In one letter he told her to tell the truth, saying, \u201cLook where you got me with those lies . . . .\u201d He also told her not to \u201clook good at [his] expense.\u201d At trial, he explained that \u201cI just told her, you know, not to lie because she wants to look good, you know, for the family court to get her baby back. She makes all those lies up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In another letter he wrote in Polish, he asked her to forgive him for \u201c[a]ll the bad things I have caused you.\u201d He disagreed that the Polish words he used meant \u201cevil things\u201d rather than simply \u201cbad things.\u201d In another letter, he warned her not to volunteer information and not to incriminate herself or the people she cares for. He testified that his advice was directed toward Owczarska\u2019s dealings with social workers, who were trying to take the baby away from her. In another letter, he told Owczarska to destroy the letters and documents he sent her because he was afraid the district attorney would subpoena \u201call incriminating paper.\u201d Defendant testified that there was nothing incriminating in his letters and that his advise to destroy them was \u201c[j]ust a figure of speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">IH. <em>Denial of Continuances</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>IV. <em>Aggravated Arson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction for aggravated arson under section 451.5, subdivision (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">This section requires proof that the defendant was responsible for a fire that \u201ccaused damage to, or the destruction of, five or more inhabited <em>structures.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(\u00a7 451.5, subd. (a)(3), italics added.) Section 450, subdivision (a) defines \u201cstructure\u201d as \u201cany <em>building, </em>or commercial or public tent, bridge, tunnel, or powerplant.\u201d (\u00a7 450, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Weber\u2019s testimony is substantial evidence that the explosion and fire damaged at least six apartments. The record also contains photographs of defendant\u2019s apartment complex. As these photographs reveal, defendant\u2019s apartment was one of several virtually identical units in a two-story structure. The upper units share a common roof, an exterior covered walkway, and stairways to the ground floor. The upper unit floors are connected to the ceilings of the lower units. All units are connected to neighboring units by common walls. Each unit has an exterior front door and windows that face a central courtyard with a swimming pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Defendant claims that an apartment in his complex is not a <em>building </em>and therefore does not come within the definition of \u201cstructure\u201d in section 450, subdivision (a). Thus, the damage to five or more apartments does not establish \u201cdamage to, or the destruction of, five or more inhabited structures\u201d as required by section 451.5, subdivision (a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The People argue that to effectuate the purpose of the statute and avoid absurd results, <em>building </em>must be construed broadly and expansively to include individual units in an apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">In construing statutes, our fundamental goal is to \u201cascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 246 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224].) To find intent, we first turn to the words of the statute. Viewing them in context and in light of the nature and purpose of the statute, we give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>words their plain, everyday, commonsense meaning. However, because legislative intent ultimately prevails over statutory language, we do not adopt the literal meaning of words if it would lead to absurd results. Rather, we will, if possible, read the words so as to conform to the spirit of the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murphy </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 136, 142 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 387, 19 P.3d 1129]; <em>People v. Pieters </em>(1991) 52 Cal.3d 894, 898-899 [276 Cal.Rptr. 918, 802 P.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201cThe Penal Code does not define \u2018building\u2019 for purposes of arson; we therefore apply the plain meaning of the word.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Labaer </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 289, 292 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 629].) In <em>People v. Moreland </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 11, 18, footnote 4 [146 Cal.Rptr. 118], the court addressed the meaning <em>building </em>as used in section 246, which proscribes discharging a firearm into, among other things, an \u201coccupied building.\u201d Quoting a variety of dictionaries, the court noted that \u201c[t]he word \u2018building\u2019 commonly has been defined as: 0Q . . . 0Q \u2018[A] constructed edifice designed to stand more or less permanently, covering a space of land, usu. covered by a roof and more or less completely enclosed by walls, and serving as a dwelling, storehouse, factory, shelter for animals, or other useful structure\u2014distinguished from structures not designed for occupancy (as fences or monuments) and from structures not intended for use in one place (as boats or trailers) even though subject to occupancy\u2019 . . . (Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Diet. (3d ed. 1961) p. 292, col. 1); ftj] \u2018[A] relatively permanent essentially boxlike construction having a roof and often windows and enclosing within its walls space, usually on more than one level, for any of a wide variety of activities, as living, entertaining, manufacturing, etc.\u2019 (Random House Dict, of the Eng. Language (unabridged ed. 1973) p. 194, col. 3); [10 \u2018An edifice for any use; that which is built, as a dwelling house, bam, etc.\u2019 (Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Comprehensive Internat. Dict. (Bicentennial ed. 1973) p. 175, col. 1); [1Q \u2018Something that is built; a structure; an edifice\u2019 (American Heritage Dict, of the Eng. Language (1960) p. 174, col. 1); [ID \u2018That which is built; a stmeture, edifice: now a stmeture of the nature of a house built where it is to stand\u2019 (1 Oxford Eng. Dict. (1933) p. 1162, col. 2).\u201d <em>(People v. Moreland, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d at p. 18, fn. 4, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"> In ordinary usage and consistent with the above definitions, <em>building </em>usually describes a covered stmeture that stands predominately by itself and appears more separate and distinct from any other stmeture than connected to and a part of another stmeture.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">This understanding of <em>building </em>supports defendant\u2019s position. None of the individual apartments in defendant\u2019s complex projects an identity that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>more separate and distinct from the complex than connected to it. Indeed, photographs indicate that the apartments were not separately constructed and later joined together. Rather, the entire complex appears to have been built as a single entity, comprising multiple units. Each unit constitutes an integral part of the whole complex. None could be removed without compromising the integrity of the complex because the fundamental elements of each unit\u2014walls, ceilings, floors\u2014are structurally inseparable from the whole. Moreover, none of the units has an external shape or identity that is independent of the shape and identity of the entire complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">As noted, the People argue that the Legislature intended <em>building </em>to have a broad and expansive meaning in order to effectuate the purpose of the aggravated arson statute. This view is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The Legislature enacted section 450 (definitions) and section 451 (simple arson) in 1979, replacing former sections 447a through 450a. (Stats. 1979, ch. 145, \u00a7\u00a7 1-8, pp. 338-339.) The former arson statutes listed several different types of structures. For instance, former section 447a applied to \u201cthe burning of any dwelling house, or any kitchen, shop, bam, stable or other outhouse that is parcel thereof, or belonging to or adjoining thereto . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 25, \u00a7 1, p. 46.) Section 451, subdivision (b) basically replaced former section 447a, but used the phrase \u201cinhabited structure\u201d rather than the term \u201cdwelling house.\u201d <em>(People v. Green </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 369, 378 [194 Cal.Rptr. 128].) It is reasonable to infer that the Legislature intended the broadest definition of the phrase \u201cinhabited structure,\u201d and intended that a \u201cdwelling house\u201d would qualify as such. Moreover, in analogous contexts, courts have concluded that an apartment is a \u201cdwelling house.\u201d <em>(People v. Jischke </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 552, 556 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 269] [defendant convicted of discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house, per \u00a7 246, where he shot through his own apartment floor and thereby shot at the apartment below]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cruz </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 764, 778 [55 Cal.Rptr.2d 117, 919 P.2d 731] [apartment qualifies as a dwelling house for purposes of burglary statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 459 and 460].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We also note that section 459, the burglary statute, provides, in relevant part, \u201cEvery person who enters any house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, bam, stable, outhouse <em>or other building, </em>tent, vessel . . . with intent to commit, grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.\u201d (\u00a7 459, italics added.) The phrase \u201cor other building\u201d suggests that at least for the purposes of burglary, the Legislature considers houses, rooms, apartments, tenements, shops, warehouses, stores, mills, bams, stables, and outhouses to be buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>Furthermore, the Legislature has provided a range of punishment for arson, depending on the harm caused.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In 1994, the Legislature enacted section 451.5 (the aggravated arson statute) out of concern that the existing penalties for arson did not take into account \u201cthe extent of the damage inflicted.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 1309 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 10, 1994, p. 4.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The enactment was designed to \u201cincrease the penalties for the worst arsonists who . . . inflict serious damage.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Given this purpose, the People argue that section 451.5, subdivision (a)(3) in general and the term <em>building </em>in particular must be construed to promote the Legislature\u2019s intent to punish more severely those whose conduct creates a greater risk of danger to life and property. For example, in causing a fire in a multi-unit complex, defendant\u2019s conduct posed a far greater risk of damage to property and injury to life than if he had caused a fire to a single, detached home. According to the People, \u201c[i]t simply is more consistent with the legislative intent ... to recognize that each occupied apartment unit in an apartment building itself is a \u2018structure\u2019 within the contemplation of the statute.\u201d Conversely, it would be incongruous with the expressed legislative intent to impose the same punishment in a case involving damage to a single-family house as in a case involving damage and/or injury to numerous conjoined apartments and their inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The People further argue that giving <em>building </em>its ordinary meaning would lead to absurd results. They argue that in terms of the danger posed to human life, it is irrational to distinguish a fire that damages five apartments in a single building from a fire that damages five separate homes in a housing tract. Thus, <em>building </em>must be interpreted to include individual apartments so that section 451.5 covers both situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The People\u2019s analysis has persuasive force. However, it does not completely convince us that the Legislature intended <em>building </em>to include individual units in an apartment complex. Indeed, under the People\u2019s interpretation, building would also include individual rooms in a hotel. Nor do we find that giving <em>building </em>its ordinary meaning necessarily leads to absurd results.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We point out that the Legislature used the term <em>building </em>to define the much broader term <em>structure: </em>a building is a structure, but not all structures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>are buildings. Thus the purpose of defining <em>structure </em>was to narrow the scope of the section 451.5, subdivision (a)(3). This purpose, however, undermines the People\u2019s view that the Legislature intended for <em>building </em>to have a broader more expansive meaning than it normally conveys. In this regard, we further point out that unlike the burglary statute noted above, section 450, subdivision (a) does not expressly list apartments or rooms in defining \u201cstructure\u201d or otherwise suggest that <em>building </em>includes apartments and rooms. Given the specificity of the burglary statute, we question whether the Legislature would have relied on the word <em>building </em>to include structures\u2014apartments, hotel rooms\u2014that are not ordinarily referred to as buildings. Indeed, we doubt that a reasonable person would, or could, know from section 450, subdivision (a) that <em>building </em>included apartment units and hotel rooms. For this reason, the People\u2019s interpretation, if adopted, could raise serious constitutional questions in this case concerning whether the statute provided defendant with adequate and reasonable notice concerning the proscribed conduct. (See <em>United States v. National Dairy Corp. </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 29, 32-33 [83 S.Ct. 594, 597-598, 9 L.Ed.2d 561]; <em>People v. Superior Court (Caswell) </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 381, 389 [250 Cal.Rptr. 515, 758 P.2d 1046].) As a rule, however, we must avoid constructions that raise such constitutional concerns unless there is no other reasonable alternative. (See <em>People v. Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104, 1139 [240 Cal.Rptr. .585, 742 P.2d 1306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Next, we point out that the People\u2019s analysis is based in part on the increased risk of <em>injury </em>posed by causing a fire in a multidwelling apartment complex. However, it is the damage to <em>property </em>that makes arson in violation of section 451.5, subdivision (a)(3) different from simple arson and other forms of aggravated arson. Moreover, the arson statutes, as noted, provide a range of punishment depending on, among other things, the consequences of the fire\u2014did it damage real or personal property; did it damage a building, or commercial or public tent, bridge, tunnel, or power plant; did it damage an inhabited structure; did it damage more than five inhabited structures; did it cause great bodily injury? In our view, the Legislature could reasonably choose to punish a person whose fire damaged five separate homes more severely than a person whose fire damaged five units in an apartment building or rooms in a hotel. Although in each situation, the potential danger to inhabitants may be equivalent, the magnitude of the danger and harm to <em>property </em>is rationally distinguishable. Furthermore, if one causes a fire that damages more than one unit in an apartment building or room in a hotel, he or she is punishable even if apartments and hotel rooms are not considered <em>buildings. </em>(See \u00a7 451, subd. (b).) Thus, although it does seem incongruous to punish a person who, for example, destroys an entire multidwelling apartment building the same as a person who destroys a single house, we cannot say that such a result is absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Finally, the People\u2019s reliance on <em>People v. Green, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 369, to support their interpretation of <em>building </em>is misplaced. In <em>Green, </em>the defendant set fire to one apartment that had previously been vacated by the tenant. The defendant was convicted of simple arson of an inhabited structure, but on appeal, he claimed the recently vacated apartment did not constitute an <em>inhabited </em>structure. The court disagreed, noting that the defendant \u201cwas convicted of \u2018arson of an inhabited structure\u2019 <em>because he started a fire in a large apartment building, </em>thus endangering the lives of all of the building\u2019s occupants.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 379, italics added.) <em>Green </em>does not suggest that an individual apartment, whether occupied or not, constitutes a <em>building. </em>If anything, it suggests that the entire apartment complex, and not individual units, constituted the <em>building </em>for the purposes of the arson statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Given our discussion of the opposing interpretations of <em>building, </em>we consider the term to be ambiguous and reasonably susceptible of either interpretation, neither of which would necessarily frustrate the purpose of a statute, render it nugatory, or lead to an absurd result. We urge the Legislature to resolve this ambiguity by clarifying the meaning of <em>building </em>and the scope of the aggravated arson statute. Here, however, we resolve the conflict under the settled rule that where the language of a penal statute is susceptible to alternative reasonable interpretations, we give the defendant the benefit of a doubt and interpret it as favorably to him or her as is reasonably possible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Zamudio) </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 192 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 463, 999 P.2d 686]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarado </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 178, 185-186 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 624].) Under the circumstances, we adopt the common and ordinary meaning of <em>building. </em>Under this meaning, an apartment in defendant\u2019s complex is not a <em>building. </em>Thus, we conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support defendant\u2019s conviction for aggravated arson under section 451.5, subdivision (a)(3).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Our conclusion does not mean, however, that no conviction for arson may stand.  Under section 1260, a reviewing court is not restricted to the remedies of affirming or reversing a judgment of conviction. \u201c \u2018Where the prejudicial error goes only to the degree of the offense for which the defendant was convicted, the appellate court may reduce the conviction to a lesser degree and affirm the judgment as modified, thereby obviating the necessity for a retrial.
