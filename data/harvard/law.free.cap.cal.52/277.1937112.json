The complaint was filed May 17th, 1876. The complaint further alleged that the defendant was a corporation organized for building a railroad along the coast where the land lay, and was about to grade the land for the railroad by building an embankment across the salt-beds, and that they would thus destroy the plaintiff\u2019s salt-works by separating the bed into two parts, and preventing the flow of sea-water from one to the other, and that the defendant also threatened to dig up and destroy the salt-bed and works, and permanently appropriate the land. An injunction was asked. On filing the complaint a preliminary injunction was granted. On the 24th of May, 1876, the defendant answered, denying, on information and belief, that the plaintiffs were in possession of or owned the premises as lessees for eight years, and denying, on information and belief, that the plaintiffs had salt - beds on the land, or were manufacturing salt there, and also denying, on information and belief, that it was necessary, in the manufacture of salt, to have several beds, into which the sea-water flowed in succession. The answer then denied that the defendant was about to enter upon or threatened to enter on any premises or land of the plaintiffs, or that it was about to destroy plaintiff\u2019s business. The answer then set up that the premises were the property of the Green Point Dairy and Transportation Company, and that said Company sold to A. E. Davis, in March, 1876, and that the defendant had entered by permission of said Davis, who bought without notice of the plaintiff\u2019s alleged lease. There was also a denial that the lease mentioned in the complaint was a lease of the premises described in the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-5\">The defendant moved to dissolve the injunction on the answer, and on affidavits which were filed. The plaintiff filed counter-affidavits. The Court made an order dissolving the injunction in so far as it restrained the defendant from grading its road-bed, and from making the necessary embankments or cuts for the purpose of its road, upon condition, however, that the defendant, in constructing its railroad, provide such culverts as were necessary for a free use of the plaintiff\u2019s salt-beds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>ditches, and the water flowing therein, and other property of the plaintiff connected therewith. The plaintiffs appealed from the order.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-5\"><em>Bishop &amp; Bifield, </em>for the Appellants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We claim that the plaintiffs were owners of the leasehold interest in the land, and being in possession under their lease, the defendant had no right to take the land for the use of its railroad, except by consent of the plaintiffs, or by the judgment of a competent Court condemning the land to public use, and the payment of compensation. <em>(San Mateo Water Works </em>v. <em>Sharp-stein, </em>50 Cal. 284; <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Belden, </em>51 Cal. 266.)</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\"><em>Stewart </em>&lt;6 <em>Greathouse, </em>for the Eespondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">It is incumbent on the appellants to show that there has been an abuse of discretion on the part of the Court in modifying an injunction. <em>(Me Garrett </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>1 Hilt. 132; Freeman on Cotenancy, 253.)</p>\n<author id=\"b307-9\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">In the view we take of this case, we deem it unnecessary to decide whether the order appealed from dissolves or only modifies the preliminary injunction; and if the latter, whether it is an appealable order. It is a matter largely in the discretion of the District Court, whether, on the coming in of the answer, a preliminary injunction previously granted should be continued in force, dissolved, or modified; and, except in cases of palpable error or an abuse of discretion, the action of that Court in such cases will not be disturbed on appeal. (<em>Godey </em>v. <em>Godey, </em>39 Cal. 167; <em>McCreery </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>42 Cal. 462; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Tennant, </em>45 Cal. 186; <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>50 Cal. 345.) Tested by this rule, wo see nothing in the facts disclosed by the record to justify us in disturbing the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">Order affirmed. Eemittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
