The applicant Wigginton and Romualdo Pacheco were rival candidates for the office of Representative in Congress in September, 1876, and the applicant in his petition alleged that there was an error in footing up the votes by which the record incorrectly showed a less number of votes cast in his favor than were actually cast. He asked that a writ issue to the Clerk requiring him to correct the error.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-13\"><em>D. 8. </em>Terry, for the Applicant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b439-14\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">The writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Mr. Justice Crockett, concurring specially, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-17\">I wish to state, for myself, that I concur in the order denying the application for the writ, on the ground that the Clerk has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>no authority to correct the record as it stands, for the reason that the records are under the control of the Board of Supervisors ; and if there is to he any correction of the record, or any change in any way, it must be under some proceeding had by the Board of Supervisors. Therefore, a writ of this kind, directed to the Clerk, would be unavailing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
