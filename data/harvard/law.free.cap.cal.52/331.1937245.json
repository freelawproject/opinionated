Upon receipt of such certificate, the defendants commenced acting as trustees of said corporation, and assumed to be a corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">The complaint contained a statement of the facts and a copy of the articles, and averred that the defendants had usurped the franchises of a corporation, and asked that they be excluded from such franchises. The answer did not deny the allegations of the complaint, but averred that a majority of the associates were present and voted. The plaintiff\u2019 moved for judgment on the pleadings, and the Court granted the motion. The defendants appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-7\"><em>Jarboe &amp; </em>Harrison, for the Appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\">All that is required is a substantial compliance with the statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>8. &amp; V.

TV. </em>v. <em>San </em>Francisco, 22 Cal. 440.)</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">The certificate of the Secretary of State (fol. 5) is conclusive upon the plaintiff. Until that has been vacated by proper proceedings the defendants cannot be charged with any usurpation of a \u201c franchise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">A mere \u201c claim \u201d to have a \u201c franchise,\u201d or an \u201c intention \u201d to exercise corporate powers, will not warrant the proceedings taken in this case. There must be a \u201c user \u201d and exercise of the franchise, or some. \u201c act\u201d, by the defendants which is an infringement upon the rights of the public.

(42 Cal. 209.)</p>\n<author id=\"b361-6\">By the Couet :</author>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">1. The right to be a corporation is in itself a franchise; and to acquire a franchise under a general law, the prescribed statutory conditions must be complied with. The Civil Code (sec. 594) requires that the articles of incorporation shall, among, other matters, \u201c <em>set forth </em>* * * <em>that a majority of the members of such association </em>* * * <em>voted at such election,\u201d </em>etc. The certificate in this case altogether omits any statement in this respect, and is, therefore, insufficient to constitute the association a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">2. The information avers that the claim of the defendants to be a corporation is based upon the certificate just referred to, and sets out the certificate as constituting the title of the defendants\u2014which, as we have seen, is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">3. The defect appearing upon the face of the certificate is not aided by the averment found in the answer, that in point of fact a majority of the members of the association did vote at the election mentioned in the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
