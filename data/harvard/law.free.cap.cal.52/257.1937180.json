Tho demanded premises were a part of the Pueblo lands of said city. The land in the Western Addition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>was occupied, and the city had been extended over it, when, on the 8th day of March, 1866, Congress passed an act confirming it to the city, and making the city a trustee for the parties in the <em>bona fide </em>actual possession of the lands on the 8th of March, 1866, on such conditions as the Legislature of this State should impose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-6\">On the 14th day of January, 1868, the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco passed an order called \u201c Order No. 800,\u201d for the settlement of land titles within the corporate limits of the city and county. This order provided for a subdivision into blocks and lots of the Pueblo lands outside of the corporate limits of the city as it existed in 1851, and for a map of the same. Persons who were in the actual <em>bona \u25a0fide </em>occupation of any of the land on the 8th day of March, 1866, or had been ousted before that day, and were entitled to recover possession by legal process, were the beneficiaries to whom the city was to convey; but there were some conditions which such persons were to fulfill before receiving a conveyance. One of these was the payment of all taxes which had been assessed on the land claimed for the five years preceding July 1st, 1866.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-7\">On the 27th of March, 1868, the Legislature passed an act ratifying and confirming said Order No. 800.

No such evidence had, in fact, been introduced. The Court overruled the objection. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendant, C. P. Duane, appealed.

The conveyance running to the plaintiff from the City and County of San Francisco was properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">When it was offered, and admitted, the defendant did not appear to have any claim to the title conferred on the city by the Act of March 8th, 1866, and conveyed to the plaintiff by the deed in question, and it was, therefore, no concern of his whether the plaintiff had been rightfully determined to be a beneficiary under the Act of 1866 or not. \u201c That was a question \u201d (as was said here in <em>Le Roy </em>v. <em>Cunningham) </em>\u201c for the Board of Supervisors, in which the defendant had no concern, inasmuch as he was not entitled to the conveyance.\u201d (44 Cal. 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">2. The motion for nonsuit, as made in the Court below, when the plaintiff rested, was but a repetition in another form of the objections made to the conveyance\u2014\u201c that the plaintiff had not proved title or right of possession to the demanded premises.\u201d The motion assumed that the conveyance made by the city to the plaintiff was inoperative, because it had not been shown by evidence <em>dehors </em>the deed and its recitals, that the plaintiff was a beneficiary under the act, and it also assumed that the defendant was in a position to litigate that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">The views we have expressed under the first point arc decisive against the appellant upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">3. It is next claimed by the appellant in his printed points, that he offered to show that \u201c he. was in the actual, <em>bona fide </em>possession of the demanded premises on the 8th of March, 1866, and claimed a right under the Act of Congress of that date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The bill of exceptions, as found in the record, however, docs not support the claim of the appellant in this respect. Its language upon this point is as follows: \u201c In defense, defendants offered to prove that they had been in the actual, exclusive, and adverse possession of the demanded premises for five years and upwards, next before the filing of the complaint herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">The offer, as thus made to the Court below, was objectionable in two prominent particulars:</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\"><em>(a.) </em>It did not state that such possession as the defendant had was <em>bona fide.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>(5.) Inasmuch as the action was commenced in December, 1873, the offer, as made, did not carry the possession of the defendant, such as it was, as far back as the 8th day of March, 1866. The offer, as made, was not, therefore, an offer to show that the defendant was, or might justly claim to be, a beneficiary under the Act of Congress of March 8th, 1866, and was for that reason properly excluded by the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">4. The last point made by the appellant is that he \u201c should have been allowed to prove five years\u2019 adverse possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The only plea found in the record upon which it is claimed that this proof was admissible is as follows: \u201cFurther answering this defendant avers, that he is, and was at the time of the filing of the complaint in this action, and for more than five years immediately prior thereto, the owner, seized in fee, and entitled to the possession of the lands and premises in the first count of said complaint described, and of every part thereof.\u201d It is obvious that this defense, as thus pleaded, is not a plea of the Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Judgment affirmed. Remittitur forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
