The suit was commenced on the last named day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-11\">The defendant, in his answer, admitted the plaintiff\u2019s possession and title to the crop on the southeast quarter of the section, but denied his possession of, or title to, the northeast quarter, or the crop thereon. The answer also stated that the land was public land, but did not aver any claim of right as a pre-emptor. On the trial, the evidence on behalf of the plaintiff tended to show that about six years before the commencement of the suit the grantors of the plaintiff entered on the half section and inclosed it with a substantial fence, and that in 1874 one Stewart Harris purchased ,the land and improvements from the persons who thus inclosed it, and that said persons and Harris and his tenants had since been in possession of the land. A short time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>after purchasing the land Harris leased it to one Cravens, who plowed it and put in a crop of grain. Cravens remained in possession of the land until October, 1875, when Harris leased it to Smith, the plaintiff, and Smith had since cultivated the land. At the time the plaintiff went upon the land there were some forty acres of summer-fallow and about one hundred and twenty acres of volunteer grain on it, which the plaintiff purchased from Cravens when he took his lease. In the winter of 1875 the defendant sowed some grain on the volunteer and summer-fallow. In the summer of 1876 the defendant began to harvest the crop, when this action was commenced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-6\">The evidence on behalf of the defendant tended to show that Pleasant West was living on the northeast quarter; that he lived in a cabin built on the land in dispute by the defendant, and helped sow some of the grain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">The defendant here offered in evidence a lease of the said northeast one-fourth from him to the witness, dated in December, 1875, at the time the witness went on to the land. The Court, on the objection of the plaintiff, ruled it out. The evidence also tended to show that the defendant sowed and harrowed in grain on the volunteer ground. The evidence of Smith, the defendant, tended to show that on the 2nd day of February, 1875, he took up the northeast one-fourth as Government land, and lived on it until some time in May, and on the 19th of March, 1875, filed in the local land office a declaratory statement as a pre-emptor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">li. Thrasher, one of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, was asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel, on cross-examination, who had claimed the northeast quarter since March, 1875. The plaintiff objected to the question, and the Court sustained the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">A. Mead, a witness for the plaintiff, testified on his cross-examination that his brother went on to the land to take up a claim in case it was Government land, and was living there when the defendant came. He was then asked how long his brother lived there, but the Court sustained an objection of the plaintiff to the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">The Court granted the injunction, and the defendant appealed from the judgment, and from an order denying a new trial. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Hatch, &amp; Kirk, </em>and <em>T. J. Hart, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The legal rights of the parties as to the ownership of the crop and possession of the northeast one-quarter were in dispute, and undetermined at law; an injunction, therefore, would not lie. <em>(Middleton </em>v. Franklin, 3 Cal. 238; <em>Waldron &amp; Joiner </em>v. <em>Marsh et. al. </em>5 Cal. 119; <em>Oates </em>v. Teague, Oct. Term, 1856; <em>Leach </em>v. Z%, 37 Cal. 643; <em>N. O. &amp; S. O. Co. </em>v. j&amp;fcZ, 37 Cal. 283; 7 Johns\u2019 Ch. Eep. p. 315; 4 Johns\u2019 Ch. Eep. p. 21; <em>Moore </em>v. Or\u00ed?, 15 Cal. 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">A. A. <em>Hart, </em>for the Eespondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The plaintiff could not have maintained ejectment against defendant, because the acts of the latter did not work an ouster or <em>disseizin. </em>(Tyler on Ejectment, 79, 82, 83, 85; Code Civil Procedure, 323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The plaintiff, being in the possession of the land, was the owner of the growing crop. <em>(Page </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>39 Cal. 412; <em>Pennebecker </em>v. <em>McDougal, </em>46 Cal. 661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">In this case the defendant is not shown by the record to have ever been in possession of the land. The plaintiff had his volunteer crop in, and ivas in possession of the land, and the defendant went there and sowed a few sacks of grain over plaintiff\u2019s volunteer. The grain had not been cut or <em>harvested </em>at the time the action was begun. In such a case the crops partake of the realty, and belong to the person who is in the rightful possession, and is entitled to the use and occupation of the land. <em>(Corcoran </em>v. Doll, 35 Cal. 476; <em>McLean </em>v. Bovee, 1 Am. Eeports, 185; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Klein, </em>15 Am. Eeports, 235.)</p>\n<author id=\"b352-11\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Action to enjoin the defendant from harvesting and removing the crop of grain growing and standing upon the tract of land described in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-13\">There is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain all the material averments of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">Neither party claimed title to the land, but it was either in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the United States or had been granted to a railroad company; and the title to the growing crop, as between the plaintiff and defendant, depended upon the question as to which of the parties was in the possession of the land. The evidence, therefore, to the effect that the defendant or a third person claimed the land, or that a third person lived upon the land, or that the defendant had executed a lease of the land to a third person, was irrelevant and immaterial, and the Court did not err in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The plaintiff having alleged and proven that the title to the standing grain was in himself, and that the defendant is insolvent, is entitled to an injunction to restrain the defendant from, harvesting and removing the crop. <em>(Hicks </em>v. Compton, 18 Cal. 206; <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Doll, </em>35 Cal. 476; Hilliard on Injunction, p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">J udgment and order affirmed.
