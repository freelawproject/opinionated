The demanded premises were a part of the Pueblo lands which the city held in trust to convey to the persons who were in the <em>bona fide </em>possession of the same on the 8th day of March, 1866. The plaintiff offered to read in evidence a deed from the City of San Francisco to himself, dated April 22nd, 1870, in which facts were recited showing that he was a beneficiary under the act, but did not offer to prove, <em>dehors </em>the deed, the truth of the recitals in the same. The defendant objected to the deed because evidence, <em>dehors </em>the deed, had not been introduced showing the truth of the recitals. The Court overruled the objection. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendant John Duane appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-11\"><em>John </em>Duane, in pro per.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-12\"><em>Wilson &amp; Wilson </em>and <em>8.
