The gross sum was three hundred and twelve dollars and two cents, and of this sum only one hundred and eighty-eight dollars and twenty-three cents was the cost of improving the roadway. The assessment did not separate the cost of the roadway from the sidewalks. The plaintiff demanded the payment of three hundred and twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>dollars and two cents. The defendant appealed. The other facts are \"stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-6\"><em>M. A. Edmonds </em>and <em>L. Reynolds, </em>for the Appellants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The Court has no power to correct assessments. \u201c It is impossible to distinguish between that part of a tax which might have been rightly assessed, and that for which no authority is given, so that the assessment should be valid for one part and. void for another.\u201d <em>(Libby </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>15 Mass. 147; <em>Stetson. </em>v. <em>Kempton, </em>13 Ibid. 283; <em>Hardenburgh </em>v. <em>Kidd, </em>10 Cal. 402;. <em>Buclcnall </em>v. <em>Story, </em>36 Ibid. 72, 73; <em>Huse </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>2 Greenl. 376, 377; <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Egremont, </em>3 Cush. 567.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\"><em>J. M. Wood, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">As to the divisibility and apportionment of the contract and assessment, the case of <em>Beaudry </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>32 Cal. 276, is authority. See, also, <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Satterlee, </em>40 Cal. 528; <em>Himmelman </em>v. <em>Hoadley, </em>44 Cal. 279.)</p>\n<author id=\"b469-10\">By the COURT:</author>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The resolution of intention described the proposed work as follows: \u201cThat Vallejo Street from Polk to Gough Street (except the crossing of Van Mess Avenue and Vallejo Street) be macadamized and curbed with redwood curbs.\u201d The specifications and the contract for the doing of the work included the macadamizing of the sidewalks as well as the roadway. The resolution does not include work on the sidewalks, but is limited to that to be done to the roadway. <em>(Himmelman </em>v. <em>Satterlee, </em>50 Cal. 68.) The Court found the cost of the work on the roadway and that on the sidewalk separately, and, deducting the latter from the whole assessment, gave judgment for the remainder, as for the cost of the work on the roadway. But the demand made by the plaintiff was for the whole assessment, and not for the portion thereof which would be charg\u00e9able for the work on the roadway. The plaintiff is not entitled to a recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ery, unless he proves a demand for the amount legally due for the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
