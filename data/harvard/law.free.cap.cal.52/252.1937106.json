On the 4th of September, 1875, Stryker conveyed the land to the plaintiff, and gave him the certificate of sale. The conveyance was not recorded, and on the 8th day of September, 1875, defendant Oullahan, who was a creditor of Stryker, sued him on a promissory note and attached the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-6\">Oullahan afterward obtained judgment and placed an execution in the hands of the Sheriff, defendant Dodgers, who advertised the land for sale. This action was commenced to enjoin the Sheriff \u25a0 from making the sale, on the ground that it would cast a cloud on the plaintiff\u2019s title. The Court made findings of fact, and gave judgment for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-7\"><em>Schell &amp; Scrivner, </em>for the Appellants.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\">An unrecorded deed is good between the parties, and as to all the world but subsequent purchasers in good faith. <em>(Hastings </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>5 Cal. 315; <em>Ricks </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>19 Cal. 577.) It is also good as against an attaching creditor. <em>(Plant </em>v. <em>Smythe, </em>45 Cal. 161; <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Munie, </em>4 Cal. 174.)</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\"><em>Terry, McKinne &amp; Terry, </em>for the Despondents.</p>\n<author id=\"b281-10\">By the Coubt :</author>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The writ of attachment in the case of <em>Oullahan </em>v. <em>Stryker </em>was levied September 8th, 1875. On the 4th of September, 1875, Stryker had conveyed the premises to Le Clert, the plaintiff, and on the next day had assigned to him the certificate of purchase. Neither the deed nor the certificate and its assignment had been recorded at the time the attachment was levied; but, though not recorded, they would, in the absence of fraud, prevail against the writ of attachment levied subsequently to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>their delivery. But the answer sets up that the transfer to the plaintiff was made without consideration, \u201c and with intent to hinder and delay and defraud E. Oullahan, one of these defendants, who was and is a creditor of said Stryker.\u201d Upon the issue of fraud in fact thus tendered by the answer the findings are entirely silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">This cause is, therefore, not in a condition to be decided; and it is remanded to the Court below, with directions to determine the issue of fraud made by the answer, upon the evidence already before it, and such other proper evidence as may be offered upon either side.
