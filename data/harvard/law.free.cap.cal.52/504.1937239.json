Judgment was asked for the four hundred dollars, and costs and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-12\">The \u201c undertaking \u201d was a common-law bond, signed by Stroh as principal, and Neuman and Frese as sureties, conditioned that if the plaintiff should recover judgment against Stroh, and he should satisfy it, or if the plaintiff should fail to&gt; recover it, that the \u201c obligation \u201d should be void. The defendant Neuman demurred to the complaint, because it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action; but the demurrer was overruled, and judgment was rendered in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>plaintiff by default. The defendant Neuman appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion..</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b533-6\"><em>Bishop &amp; Fifield, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The complaint shows that the undertaking sued on was executed to procure the setting aside of a judgment, and the release of property theretofore taken on attachment; but fails to allege that the property attached was released, or the judgment set aside, upon the execution of the undertaking. It has been repeatedly held by this Court that such omission renders a complaint substantially defective. <em>(Palmer </em>v. Melvin, 6 Cal. 651; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Blatten, </em>9 Cal. 500; <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Chatterton, </em>7 Cal. 568; <em>The County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>45 Cal. 252 <em>Curtis v.Richards, </em>9 Cal. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The actual levy of the attachment, and entry of the judgment, by default, were by-gone transactions, to which the sureties were strangers at the time of executing the undertaking. In order, therefore, to support the undertaking, it was necessary to-show some new consideration moving at the time, to wit, the. release of the property, and the setting aside of the judgment. A promise by one man to pay another\u2019s debt is <em>nudum </em>pactum,. without a present consideration. . ( <em>Comstock </em>v. <em>Breed, </em>12 Cal. 286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The fact that the undertaking is in form a common-law bond does not alter the case. It was given under the statute (Code of Civ. Pro. secs. 540-555) and was substantially in conformity therewith. ( <em>Curriac </em>v. <em>Packard, </em>29 Cal. 199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\"><em>George W. Tyler, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">It is not true that this action is brought upon an \u201c undertaking \u201d either to set aside a judgment, or to release an attachment. It is brought upon a common-law bond. There is no provision of the Code for an \u201c undertaking \u201d in consideration of setting aside a judgment. It is true there is a provision of the Code for an Undertaking to be given for a release of attachment under certain circumstances, but this is not an undertaking of that kind.</p>\n<author id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">There is no allegation found in the complaint to the effect that the judgment mentioned in the undertaking sued on was set aside, or that the attachment therein named was released, and the demurrer should have been sustained for that reason. <em>(Palmer </em>v. Melvin, 6 Cal. 652; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>45 Ibid. 252, and other cases cited in the appellant\u2019s points.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">, Judgment as to defendant Paul Neuman reversed, and cause remanded, with directions to sustain the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
