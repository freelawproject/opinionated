Fowler paid him $960, and was to pay him the further sum of $2,880 when the deed was delivered. The land was within the limits of the grant to the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California, made by the Acts of Congress passed July 1st, 1862, and July 2nd, 1864. The Western Pacific Railroad Company had acquired the title of the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California. On the 9th day of April, 1870, the United States issued to the Western Pacific Railroad Company a patent for the land. On the 22nd day of June, 1870, the Western Pacific Railroad Company and the Central Pacific Railroad Company consolidated under the name of the Central Pacific Railroad Company. April 5th, 1871, the Central Pacific Railroad Company conveyed the land to McLaughlin. McLaughlin afterwards tendered to Fowler a deed, and demanded the remainder of the purchase-money. Fowler refused to pay it. This action was brought to enforce the contract by obtaining a decree for the sale of the land for the balance of the purchase-money. The land was within the exterior limits of a Mexican grant called \u201c Los Moquelomnes,\u201d made to Andres Pico. Pico applied for a confirmation of the grant, and the same was confirmed by the Board of Land Commissioners.\u201d An appeal was taken to the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of California, and on the 24th of April, 1857, the grant was again confirmed. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, and at the December term, 1859, the decree of the District Court was reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>On the 4th day of June, 1862, the District Court rejected the grant. An appeal was again taken to the Supreme Court of the United States, and at the December term, 1864, the decree of the District Court was affirmed. The defendant and his grantor had been in possession of the land ten or fifteen years before the commencement of the action, to wit, July 26th, 1871. The United States, on the 3rd day of October, 1871, issued a patent for the land to Damon, the defendant\u2019s grantor. This patent recited that the land had been inadvertently included in the patent of April 9th, 1870, to the Western Pacific Railroad Company. The Court gave judgment for the defendant for the nine hundred and \u2019 sixty dollars he had paid. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-5\"><em>Tully JR.
