Cardinell never owned or acquired the title to the horse. It never was transferred to him, and he never had the right to its possession. (Civil Code, secs. 1661,1721, 1726-8; Story on Sales, secs. 1 and 274.) An action of this kind cannot be maintained, unless the plaintiff, at the time of the conversion, is the owner of the property, and entitled to its imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>d\u00edate possession. (1 Chitty on Pleadings, 148-9 ;z <em>2 </em>Greenl. on Ev. sees. 561-3.) Replevin or trover was not the plaintiff\u2019s remedy, but an action for damages. (Story on Sales, secs. 430, 450; <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Hewitt, </em>15 Johns. 349.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\"><em>Thomas V. O'Brien, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Plaintiff was entitled absolutely to the possession of the horse, as against either Carpenter or Bennett, on payment or tender. (Civil Code, secs. 1748, 1822, 2905, 1504, 1512; <em>Tngersoll &amp; Boride </em>v. <em>Emmerson, </em>1 Smith\u2019s Ind. 77; <em>Batters </em>v. <em>Everest, </em>20 Wend. 267; <em>Roland </em>v. <em>Gundy, </em>5 Ohio, 202, and \u25a0cases ; Story on Bailments, sec. 102.) As to the effect of tender, see <em>Kirtright </em>v. <em>Cady, </em>211ST.

The transaction did not amount to a sale on credit from Carpenter to Cardinell, but a -contract whereby it was agreed that the latter should acquire the property'on the performance of certain conditions promised by him to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
