The prosecuting attorney should always be afforded an opportunity to suggest the addition to the bill (as prepared by defendant\u2019s counsel) of such evidence actually given as may have a tendency to remove the effect of a statement of evidence when that effect is to make a ruling apparently erroneous, which \u2014in view of all the evidence bearing on the point\u2014would be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">In the case before us it appears from the bill of exceptions that evidence merely <em>hearsay </em>and otherwise clearly inadmissible was admitted over the objection and exception of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">It is suggested by the District Attorney that further evidence was <em>in fact </em>taken at the trial which rendered admissible the evidence which on the face of the bill was inadmissible. But if further evidence was given, it is not before us, and we have no power to add the oral declaration of counsel to the certified bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new .trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
