Notice of such election, to be held on the 27th day of June, 1874, was published. The notice stated: \u201c The polls will be open at the public school-house between the hours of one o\u2019clock and six o\u2019clock p. M.\u201d At the election a majority of the votes was cast in favor of the tax. This action was brought against the defendant, Seale, and his land to recover the tax\u2014$387.30. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>Fred.

Castro, 39 Cal. 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">It is provided in the Code (sec. 1831) that an election for that purpose must be called by posting notices in three of the most public places in the district for twenty days (sec. 1832); such notices must specify the time and place of holding the election, <em>etc.; </em>the election (sec. 1833) must be held, in all respects, as nearly as practicable, in conformity with the general election law. The giving of the prescribed notice is material, and the time at which the election will be held is required to be stated in the notice. It is essential, too, that neither the notice of election nor any other proceedings contravene the provisions of the general election law.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">In this case the notice was to the effect that the polls would be open only between the hours of one o\u2019clock P. M. and six o\u2019clock p. M., and in point of fact the polls were kept open only between those hours, and in this important respect the election, as held, was not \u201c in conformity with the general election law \u201d \u2014for that requires the polls to be open \u201c at one hour after sun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>rise on the morning of the election,\u201d and to be kept open until sunset (Political Code, sec. 1160).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
