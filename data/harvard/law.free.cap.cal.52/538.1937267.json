E. Griffin, Public Administrator of said county, petitioned the Probate Court of said county for letters of administration, alleging that deceased died intestate, and without heirs. On the 30th day of October, 1876, Joseph Perdeu petitioned said Probate Court for letters of administration, with the will annexed, to be issued to said petitioner and Wm. R. Rowland, a fit and competent person, averring the foregoing instrument to be the last will and testa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>ment, and said petitioner, and his brother, William Perdeu, sole devisees of said deceased. On the 17th day of November, 1876, upon the hearing of said petitions, said will was duly proved and admitted to probate, and thereupon the Court made the following order, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">\u25a0\u201c [Title of Court and Cause.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-7\">\u201cIn the matter of the application of the petitions of Joseph Perdeu and Wm.

Rowland, are fit, proper, and competent persons to serve as administrators, with the will annexed, of the estate of said deceased, and if the appointment rested in the discretion of the Court, the Court would appoint said Perdeu and Rowland such administrators; but in the opinion of the Court, the Public Administrator is, under the statute of California, entitled to letters as a matter of right. It is therefore ordered that J. E. Griffin, Public Administrator in and for said county, be, and he hereby is, appointed administrator of said estate with will annexed. H. K. S.

The Court found that Thomas Perdeu, one of the devisees, and William R. Rowland are fit and competent persons to serve as administrators with the will annexed of the estate of the decedent; but was of the opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Public Administrator was entitled to letters of administration,, as a matter of right\u2014no person named in sec. 136.5 prior to the Public Administrator having petitioned for letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The correctness of the determination of the Probate Court depends upon the question whether a decedent who left an instrument which is entitled to probate as his last will and testament can be held, within the meaning of sec. 1365, to have died intestate. It is said in the notes to 1 Eedfield on Wills, 5, that the opinion that the naming of an executor was indispensable to the validity of a will \u201c has long since been abandoned in England, and never obtained in the United States.\u201d Many documents which omitted to name an executor have been admitted to probate in the Courts of this State, and we are satisfied that in this State the naming of an executor is not essential to the-validity of a will. A decedent whose will is entitled to be admitted to probate did not die intestate, and therefore sec. 1365 is not applicable to this case, and the Probate Court, in granting letters of administration with the will annexed, is not limited to the order therein prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Order reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings, in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
