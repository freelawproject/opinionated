The tax for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1871, was not paid, and the lot was sold to the plaintiffs grantor, who received a tax deed on the 21st day of December, 1871. This was the plaintiff\u2019s title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-12\">The Statute of 1857, as amended in 1859, (sec. 23) provides that the matters recited in a tax deed shall be all the requisites essential to the validity of a tax sale, and the tax deed shall convey to the grantee the absolute title, and shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of title in the grantee, \u201c except that Courts of Law and Equity may examine <em>only </em>in regard to such deed, and may hear any testimony in relation thereto to show:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u201c 1. That the property, or a larger parcel of which it is a portion, was not assessed or equalized, as required by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">\u201c <em>2. </em>That the taxes, or a portion of them, were not levied by law, or by some person or body under authority of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-7\">\u201c 3. That the taxes were paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-8\">\u201c 4.

That the person who executed the deed was not the proper officer, or <em>de facto </em>acting as such officer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-11\">The plaintiffs rested on the tax deed, and the conveyance from the grantee therein to them. The defendant was permitted to prove that the supplement in which the list, and time, and place of sale were published, was not circulated with the papers which were distributed outside of the City and County of San Francisco, and that the paper making the publication had a circulation outside said City and County. The defendant had judgment, and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-12\"><em>It. S. Clyde </em>and <em>M. Q. </em>Cobb, for the Appellant,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AYO\">in support of the point that the publication was sufficient, cited <em>Haskell </em>v. Bartlett, 34 Cal. 284; <em>Chandler </em>v. Spear, 22 Vt. 388; <em>Brown </em>v. Hutchinson, 11 Vt. 569; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Mowyer, </em>5 Mich. 465; <em>People </em>v. Seymour, 16 Cal. 332 ; <em>Perry </em>v. Washburn, 12 Cal. 270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\"><em>H H. </em>Haight, for the Respondents.</p>\n<author id=\"b516-14\">By the Coubt :</author>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">The fifteenth section of the Revenue Act of 1857, as amended in 1859, (Stats. 1859, p. 348) provides that the delinquent tax list shall be published by one insertion, once a week, for three successive weeks, in a newspaper published in the city and county, or in a supplement to such paper; and it is required that the time and place of commencing the sale of the delinquent property shall be designated in such publication. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>is no other mode in which the time of the sale can be designated, or the notice thereof given, than by such publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In this case the delinquent list was published in a supplement to the newspaper; and it was proven that the supplement was not circulated co-extensively with the newspaper, but was delivered to subscribers and others within the city and county, and not to those without the city and county. It was not the intent of the statute that the list might be published in a single copy, or a limited number of copies, of a supplement to the newspaper ; but that it might be published in a supplement which was distributed for circulation generally with the newspaper. The publication in this case does not conform to the statute, and therefore is insufficient as a notice of the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">It is urged that the defendant cannot avail himself of this objection as a defense; but in our opinion the point is not tenable. The twenty-third section provides that the party resisting the Tax Collector\u2019s deed may show, among other things : \u201c Fourth, that at a proper <em>time </em>and place the property was not sold,\u201d etc. The proper time for the sale is the time stated in the publication of the delinquent list made in conformity with the statute. The time cannot be fixed in any other mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
