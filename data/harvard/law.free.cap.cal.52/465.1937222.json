P. Gallagher filed in said Probate Court the will of Mary Cunningham, deceased, and asked that it be admitted to probate. Patrick Cunningham filed an opposition to the probating of the will. Among the grounds of opposition were these two\u2014that she did not execute the will, and that she signed it under undue influence on the part of Belle Coughlin and said Gallagher, who was named in the will as executor. The case was tried with a Jury, and special issues were submitted. Among the issues were these\u2014 \u201cDid the deceased sign the will filed in this Court July 12th, 1876? \u201d \u201c Was the execution of that will obtained by undue influence ? \u201d Contestant introduced evidence to sustain the issues on his part. The Jury answered \u201c Yes \u201d to the first issue, and \u201c No \u201d to the second. The Court probated the will. The contestant appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-11\"><em>Robert </em>Ash,, for Appellant,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"Aqa\">argued that the Court should have left the facts to the J ury.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\"><em>J. G. Severance </em>and <em>J. F. </em>Sullivan, for the Respondent.</p>\n<author id=\"b493-13\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b493-15\">One of the questions submitted to the J ury was as follows: \u201c Was the execution of this will\u201d (meaning the will filed July, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>18T6) \u201c obtained by undue influence ? \u201d This will was executed, if at all, April 29th, 1874, and there was evidence to the effect that the testatrix was unfit to transact business when under the influence of liquor, and that she was \u201c on a spree \u201d and scarcely drew a sober breath during the last three weeks of April, 1874. Under these circumstances the Court below first instructed the J ury that they should find that <em>the </em>will was not obtained by undue influence. The circumstance, if true, that the testatrix was in this condition when she executed the will was pertinent evidence, in connection with other circumstances in proof upon the question of undue influence; inasmuch as a person in that condition might be more readily influenced than if sober at the time. In this view the instruction as given was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Subsequently the Court instructed the Jury that the question of \u201c <em>undue </em>influence, menace, duress, and fraud \u201d in the execution of this will was one submitted to them for their verdict. In short, the two instructions were contradictory\u2014the one withdrawing from the Jury, and the other submitting to them the same question of fact, and must have confused them in their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
