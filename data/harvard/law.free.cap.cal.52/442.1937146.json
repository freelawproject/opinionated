Mora Moss a portion thereof. On the 4th day of June, 1857, said Bernals conveyed the rancho to Harvey S. Brown, subject to the mortgage. This was an action of ejectment to recover possession of a portion of the rancho bordering on Islais Creek. The plaintiff deraigned title from Brown, and the defendants claimed under a foreclosure of the mortgao-e and Sheriff\u2019s deed. The defendants appealed from the judgment and from an order denying a new trial. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>Pringle &amp; Hayne </em>and <em>Jos.

This white oak stood <em>half a mile </em>from the river, and if the line be run in a direct course from thence to the beginning, a large part of the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s grant will be left out of Gee\u2019s patent; but if the river is deemed to be the boundary, the land described in defendant\u2019s grant will then be included in Gee\u2019s patent.\u201d The river was held to be the boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">In <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Slade\u2019s Admin. </em>3 Murph. 84, the description was: \u201c Beginning at Whitehurst\u2019s corner at the letter A; thence east along Ward\u2019s line eighty poles; thence south on his line 320 poles to the back swamp.\u201d The first distance was more than doubled, and both courses were changed thirty degrees, in order to conform to Ward\u2019s line. The case is an instructive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">See, also, <em>Harramond </em>v. MeQlaughon, Taylor\u2019s (N. C.) B. 84; <em>Fix </em>v. Johnson, 5 N. H. 524; <em>Bruce </em>v. Taylor, 2 J. J.

The Court below held that the premises in dispute are not included in the mortgage; and on that assumption entered a judgment for the plaintiff. We are all of opinion that this ruling was erroneous, and that the creek is the true boundary, and consequently that the premises in controversy were included in, the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The plaintiff, however, contends that the defendants are estopped by two surveys, one by Hoadley and the other by Potter, establishing, as is claimed, an agreed line. In respect to the Hoadley survey, as we understand the testimony, Hoadley was selected simply to ascertain the true line as fixed by the mortgage, and not as an arbitrator to establish such other line as he might consider equitable under all the circumstances. We have been referred to no adjudicated case which holds that such a survey, of itself, independently of other circumstances, creates an estoppel. The same remark applies to the Potter survey; and, moreover, the agreement for this survey was between the plaintiff and the defendant Williams only, and of course would not bind the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
