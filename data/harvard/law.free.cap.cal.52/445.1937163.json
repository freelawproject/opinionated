It was of no legal consequence in this action that the verdict, as first returned, specified the amount found as \u201c gold coin,\u201d for the complaint had not demanded gold coin, and the judgment should have been entered for the sum first found, disregarding the mere character of money in which the verdict had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">In <em>Watson </em>v. <em>S. F. &amp; H. B. R. R. Co. </em>50 Cal. 523, this precise question was before us, and we then said as follows: * * <em>* </em>\u201cIf <em>the </em>verdict goes beyond the issues raised by the pleadings, and passes upon an extraneous fact not embraced therein, it is void <em>pro </em>tanto, and the surplus matter may be disregarded in entering the judgment. In this case there was no issue as to whether the plaintiff\u2019s demand was payable in gold coin, and the complaint contains no averment on that point. The words \u2018 gold coin \u2019 in the verdict are therefore mere surplusage, and should have been disregarded in entering the judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Judgment and order reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
