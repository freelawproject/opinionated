Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The following are the principal facts of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">Prior to the 16th day of October, 1874, the plaintiff forwarded from Yolo County certain wheat consigned to E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons, shipping and commission merchants, doing business at San Francisco, to be forwarded to a European port by said E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons, and there sold by them for account of respondent. At some time previous to the date of the consignment the plaintiff had chartered a ship from Morgan\u2019s Sons, and the wheat referred to was sent to the latter for shipment in said vessel. Morgan\u2019s Sons had, in the year 1872-73, been largely engaged in buying and selling wheat on their own account, and shipping the same to Europe, and during 1873-74 had been and were engaged in chartering vessels and forwarding wheat to European ports.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-7\">Instead of placing plaintiff\u2019s wheat on board the vessel chartered by him, Morgan\u2019s Sons shipped it in their own name, and in the usual course of their business, on board of the defendant\u2019s vessel, the <em>Charles </em>Murdoch, then under charter to that firm, to be by said vessel transported to a European port in accordance with the terms of a charter party executed between the owners of the ship and E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons. On the 19th of October, E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons became insolvent, and ceased to do business. They broke the covenants of the charter party by detaining the vessel after her lay days had expired, and refusing to proceed with the loading thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-8\">The plaintiff thereupon claimed delivery of his wheat from the defendant. Eg tender of freight or charges was made. Defendant refused to deliver1 it, and it was thereupon seized by action of claim and delivery, and delivered to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-9\">Defendant had no notice or knowledge of the ownership of the goods, or of the violation of instructions by Morgan\u2019s Sons with regard to the means of shipment. <em>He claimed to hold the same under his contract of charter </em>party, <em>for his freight and </em>charges, and was ready to carry it forward in accordance therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-10\">The Court sustained a demurrer to the appellant\u2019s answer, which set up his claim under the charter party; and in the trial of the cause refused to hear evidence of any kind with respect to said claim on the wheat for freight or charges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The questions raised by demurrer and on the trial were essentially the same, excepting that plaintiff on the trial proved that the wheat was forwarded to E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons for shipment by a particular vessel, the <em>Pride of the Port.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">The defendant urges that the Court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the amended answer, and erred in excluding the testimony offered by him on the trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-7\"><em>Andross ,&lt;&amp; </em>Page, Appellant\u2019s counsel,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AMN\">argued that, under the circumstances disclosed by this case, the principal was bound by his factors\u2019 act as well by the common as the statute law.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\"><em>a. </em>E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons were general agents. (1 Parsons on Contracts, 95; Story on Agency, secs. 110, 131; 2 Kent, *621; Dunlap\u2019s Payley\u2019s Agency, 241; W<em>right </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>19 Cal. *76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">5. Factors for shipment have authority to bind the principal to payment of the freight. (Story on Agency, sec. 110; Molloy, De Jure, Bk. III, ch. viii, sec. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">c. Factors, for many if not for most purposes, are treated as the owners of the goods. (Story on Agency, sec. 111; Molloy, <em>ubi. sup. </em>sec. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">II. <em>a. </em>\u201c The lawful possession of goods being once acquired for the purpose of carriage, the carrier is not obliged to restore them to the owner again, even if the carriage be dispensed with, unless upon his being paid his due remuneration, for by the delivery he has already incurred certain risks.\u201d The carrier has a lien thereon. (Story on Bailments, sec. 585; Angell on Carriers, sec. 368; Abbot on Shipping, *595; <em>Tindal </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>4 El. &amp; B. 219; <em>Bark Edwin, </em>1 Sprague, 481; <em>Bark Edwin </em>v. <em>Naumkeag Cot. Co. </em>1 Cliff. 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\"><em>MeKune &amp; Welty, </em>for Eespondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">I. The plaintiff was a stranger to the charter party, and his property cannot be taken, held, or pledged to satisfy appellant\u2019s claims against E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons. ( <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>19 Cal. 76.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">II. Plaintiff did not put his wheat on board the <em>Charles Murdoch. </em>E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons wrongfully and unlawfully di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>verted it from the <em>Pride of the Port, </em>of which plaintiff held a charter; and appellant had and has no claim against respondent for anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">III. E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons wrongfully put the wheat in question on board the <em>Charles Murdoch ; </em>and a wrongdoer cannot create a lien for freight. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>5 Cush. 137; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>B. &amp; W. R. R. Co. </em>8 Gray, 262; <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>42 Me. 197; <em>Buskirk </em>v. <em>Purin, </em>2 Hall, 561; <em>Saltus </em>v. <em>Everett, </em>20 Wend. 267 ; <em>Pitch </em>v. <em>Newberry, </em>1 Doug. Mich. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">IY. In cases like this, the rule <em>nemo plus juris in alium transferre potest quam ipse habet </em>prevails over the rule that of two parties he who trusts must pay. Plaintiff did not trust appellant, and did not trust E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons to ship the wheat generally, but directed it to be sent in plaintiff\u2019s own ship. Appellant secured the possession without cost on his part. Despondent paid for the loading and unloading.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Y. The factor could not pawn the goods to pay his debt or liability. Can his creditor <em>in invitum, </em>upon the mere fact that he has got possession under circumstances which would create a lien if the goods belonged to the factor, accomplish what could not be done with the consent of the factor?</p>\n<author id=\"b617-9\">By the Co\u00fcbt :</author>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">The amended answer of Campbell, to which a demurrer was sustained, set up that the wheat \u201c was shipped by E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons, merchants and factors, as aforesaid, in their own name, and in the usual course of trade, without knowledge or notice on the part of this defendant of the alleged ownership thereof by said plaintiff, or the ownership thereof by any person or persons other than said E. E. Morgan\u2019s Sons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The demurrer should have been overruled; for under the provisions of the Civil Code, (sec. 2369) Morgan\u2019s Sons, factors of the plaintiff, had <em>ostensible </em>authority to deal with the property as their own, \u201cin transactions with persons not having notice of the actual ownership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">In this respect the case differs from that of <em>Green </em>v. Meyer, just decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Subsequently, upon a petition for rehearing having been filed, the following opinion was rendered:</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<author id=\"b618-7\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The judgment was reversed here, because a demurrer interposed to the special defense had been sustained by the Court below. The respondent, in the petition for a rehearing, now claims that this action of the Court below was not of any moment, because the matter set up' in the special defense might have been proved under the general issue pleaded in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">It is not worth while, however, to consider this proposition now, because, even if the view of the respondent be correct, it appears by the record that the defendant offered at the trial, under the general issue pleaded, to prove the several matters set up in the special defense, but the evidence was excluded upon objection of the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
