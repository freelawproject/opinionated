The giving of the prescribed notice is material, and the time at which the election will be held is required to be stated in the notice. It is essential, too, that neither the notice of election nor any other proceedings contravene the provisions of the general election law.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">In this case the notice was to the effect that the polls would be open only between the hours of 1 o\u2019clock p. M. and 6 o\u2019clock p. M., and in point of fact the polls were kept open only between those hours ; and in this important respect the election, as held, was not \u201cin conformity with the general election law \u201d\u2014lor that requires the polls to be open \u201c at one hour after sunrise on the morning of the election,\u201d and to be kept open until sunset. (Political Code, sec. 1160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
