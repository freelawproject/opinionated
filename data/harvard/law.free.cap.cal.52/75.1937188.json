James, Horatio P. Livermore, and a number of other persons commenced an action against John Center and several other persons in Fresno County, Thirteenth Judicial District, to have them declared the trustees of the plaintiffs in the ownership of certain lands, and to quiet the title to said lands. The defendants, most of them, answered, and also filed what they called cross - complaints; to which cross - complaints the plaintiffs filed answers. On the 15th of February, 1877, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys filed with the Clerk a dismissal of the action, at the plaintiffs\u2019 costs. The Clerk thereupon entered a judgment dismissing the action and in favor of the defendants for their costs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>leaving a blank to - be filled with the amount of costs. On the next day the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys notified the defendants\u2019 attorneys that the cause was dismissed. Defendants\u2019 attorneys procured from the Judge an order on the plaintiffs to show cause, on the 26th day of February, 1877, why the order of dismissal should not be set aside and vacated, and the cause restored to the calendar. On the last named day both parties appeared by their attorneys, and the Court heard argument and took the cause under advisement. On the 2nd of March the Court made an order setting aside and vacating the judgment of dismissal, and placing the cause on the calendar for trial on the 12th of March. On the 8th day of March, 1877, the plaintiffs served and filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court from the order vacating the judgment, and also filed an undertaking on appeal. The District Court was about to proceed and try the cause on the 12th, when the plaintiffs procured from the Supreme Court an alternative writ for the Judge to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue. The Judge, in his answer, assigns as reasons why he should be allowed to proceed and try the cause, notwithstanding the appeal, the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">1. That the judgment of the Clerk was entered without authority of law, and was invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">2. That he had authority to vacate it, and if the order vacating was erroneous, it could be reached by appeal from a judgment to be finally rendered in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">3. That on the 8th day of March, when the appeal was taken from the order vacating the judgment, no judgment existed, and the order was not then an order after final judgment and no appeal could be taken from it.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-9\"><em>Stetson &amp; Houghton </em>and <em>McAllister &amp; </em>Bergin, for the Writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b104-10\"><em>Sol.
