An indictment should therefore charge burglary generally, and leave the degree to be determined by the verdict if the plea is not guilty, and by the Court if the plea is guilty.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b480-17\">Duty ob Court on Plea ob Guilty.\u2014If the defendant pleads guilty to an indictment which charges an of\u00edense which is divided into degrees, the Court, before passing sentence, must ascertain the degree.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b480-18\">Appeal from the County Court, County of San Joaquin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b480-19\">The defendant appealed.- The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-20\"><em>jS.

There, omitting the averment of malice, an unlawful and felonious killing is charged, and the verdict may properly be guilty of <em>manslaughter. </em>And inasmuch as the averment of \u201c malice aforethought \u201d includes both express malice (or the intent to kill affirmatively proved) and implied malice\u2014which may be presumed from the killing\u2014the defendant may be found guilty of murder in the first or second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">As was said in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hann, </em>44 Cal. 96, and reiterated in <em>People </em>v. Doyell, 48 Cal. 85, the term \u201c murder \u201d has but one meaning\u2014the killing of a human being with malice aforethought, either express or implied. Where such killing with malice aforethought is alleged, there is an averment of all the facts which constitute each of the offenses, murder in the first degree, in the second degree, and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">But while a defendant indicted for one crime may be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>victed of a less offense <em>also charged in the </em>indictment, lie cannot be convicted of an offense not charged in the indictment, (actually, or by construction created by the legislative will) and which consists of an additional element of circumstance not averred in the indictment. Prior to the amendments referred to, an indictment charging an entry in the night-time could not be construed as averring an entry in the day-time; and as there was no allegation of an entry in the day-time, a defendant accused of \u201c burglary \u201d could not be convicted of \u201c housebreaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">By see. 459 of the Penal Code, as amended, \u201c burglary \u201d is defined to be the entry of a habitation, etc., with intent to commit grand or petty larceny, or any felony; while by secs. 460 and 461 a burglary committed in the night-time is declared to be burglary in the first, and a burglary committed in the daytime is made burglary in the second, degree. Sec. 1157 provides : \u201c Whenever a crime is distinguished into degrees, the jury, if they convict the defendant, must find the degree of crime of which he is guilty \u201d ; and as we have seen, in case of a plea of guilty, a like duty is cast upon the Court by sec. 1192. It would be illogical, and not in accord with elementary principles of pleading, to declare that if the indictment charged an entry in the night-time only, the jury or Court could find the defendant guilty of an entry in the day-time. Yet it was the evident purpose of the Legislature to authorize the jury or Court to determine the degree, as the evidence might show that the entry was in the day or night-time. Eeading the sections of the statute together, it seems plain that it was the intention to pro-, vide for a crime which is styled \u201c burglary,\u201d and which consists of an entry with intent to commit a felony or petty larceny, either in the night or day-time. This crime is divided into two degrees\u2014an entry with such intent in the night-time, and an entry with like intent in the day-time, while the duty of determining <em>from the evidence </em>whether the offense is burglary in the first or second degree is imposed on the Court or jury, as the plea may be \u201c guilty \u201d or \u201c not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Inasmuch as the indictment, to cover both degrees, <em>must not specify that the entry was either by day or </em>night, it follows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the. averment must be general without such specification, and such averment must be construed as charging an entry <em>both </em>in the night and day-time. Thus construed, whether the Court or jury find defendant guilty of burglary in the first or second degree, he will be found guilty of an offense charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">It follows that the Court below erred in pronouncing judgment without first fixing the degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Prior to the amendments to the Penal Code above referred to, it happened, perhaps, that those guilty of the less offense, but indicted for the greater, escaped punishment by reason of the evidence leaving a \u201c reasonable doubt \u201d that the crime was committed in the \u201c night time,\u201d within the meaning of the statute. It may have been one or the main purpose of the amendments to prevent such failure or delay in the administration of justice. The construction we have given the law will carry that purpose into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to the County Court to determine the degree of defendant\u2019s guilt, as required by sec. 1192 of the Penal Code, and thereupon to pronounce sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
