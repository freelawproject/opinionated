B. Sbarboro for improving Larkin Street, from Tyler to Market Street. The defendants owned a lot which was assessed. On the 80th day of April, 1872, the Superintendent delivered the assessment to the Tax Collector, for collection. The City and County Attorney commenced this action to enforce the lien of the assessment before the Tax Collector had advertised for thirty days that it was in his hands for collection, etc. The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-9\">\u00ab7. <em>B. </em>Townsend, for the Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-10\"><em>W.

The failure to give this notice is a matter which goes to the power of the Assistant City and County Attorney, not to the sufficiency of the complaint or proof, or to the question as to whether any other defenses can be made to the merits than those mentioned in sec. 11 of the same act.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">An action commenced before such publication by the Tax Collector was prematurely brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
