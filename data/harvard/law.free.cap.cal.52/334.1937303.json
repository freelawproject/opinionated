In 1873, the plaintiff loaned the husband money, and to secure the same the wife gave him a mortgage on the lot. When the wife gave the mortgage, she told the plaintiff that the lot was \u201c her property, bought with money she had earned in the practice of medicine.\u201d On the 30th of April, 1875, the husband died intestate, leaving surviving him the wife and two infant children, who are made defendants here. This was an action to enforce the lien of the mortgage. The Court gave judgment for the defendants, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b362-12\">The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b362-13\"><em>G. A. </em>Tuttle, for the Appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b362-14\">It does not appear that there is an administration on the estate, or that there ever will be, or that there are any debts. The Court was not called on to decide whether it would enforce the mortgage against an administrator. A decree for plaintiff would not bind an administrator if one should hereafter seek to sell the property for debts. As the matter appears of record, the plaintiff can defeat the mortgage, and rest on her title as an heir, and never administer. Judgments rendered against a person in one capacity will not estop him when he sues in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>capacity. <em>QJRobinsonis Case, </em>5 Esp. 32; <em>Dutchess Kingston's Case, </em>Smith\u2019s Leading Cases, Yol. 2; Com. Dig. Estop. C.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The wife, at the death of the husband, inherited one-third of the property. This after-acquired title feeds the mortgage, and is subject to it, and we should have had a decree for that much of the property, at least. (Civil Code, sec. 2930; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>14 Cal. 630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\"><em>J. Clark, </em>for the Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">This land being community property, it could not be incumbered by a mortgage executed by the wife alone; for by sec. 167, Civil Code, it is enacted that \u201c the property of the community is not liable for the contracts of the wife made after marriage, unless secured by a pledge or mortgage thereof executed by the husband.\u201d</p>\n<author id=\"b363-9\">By the Court :</author>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">While it is clear that the mortgage executed by Mrs. Kelley created no lien on the community property, it was not void in the extreme sense. Sec. 158 of the Civil Code provides that \u201c either husband or wife may enter into any engagement or transaction with the other, or with any other person, respecting property, which either might if unmarried; subject in transactions between themselves to the general rules which control the acquisitions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other, as defined by the Title on Trusts.\u201d Mrs. Kelley was, therefore, as competent in law to execute a mortgage as though she had been at the time a <em>femme sole ; </em>and while she may then have had no title to the mortgaged premises on which she could create a lien, it does not follow that the mortgage was void as a contract between the mortgagor and mortgagee. It stands on the same footing as a mortgage made by any other person on property to which he had, at the time, no title. But though the mortgagor had no title at the date of the mortgage, yet if he subsequently acquired the title, the mortgage, under our Code, attaches to the subsequently acquired title. Sec. 2930 of the Civil Code provides that \u201c title acquired by the mortgagor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>subsequent to the execution of the mortgage inures to the mortgagee as security for the debt, in like manner as if acquired before the execution.\u201d In the present case, while the Court finds that the mortgaged premises were community property at the date of the mortgage, and that for that reason the mortgage, when made by the wife, created no lien upon them, it also finds that the husband subsequently died intestate, leaving, surviving him, the wife and two infant children. The complaint avers that no administration has been granted on his estate, and this averment is not denied by the answer. On the death of the husband, the wife became entitled to an interest in the common property, subject to the payment of the debts of the estate; and under sec. 2930 of the Civil Code above quoted, the interest thus acquired \u201c inures to the mortgagee as security for the debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
