The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and he moved for a new trial for error in the instructions, and appealed from the judgment and from an order denying the same.

Phipps, 39 Cal. 326, and in <em>People </em>v. Padilla, 42 Cal. 535, and on the authority of these cases the judgment and order are reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.
