The Bridge and Building Company bought from the plaintiff material of the value of $690.84, which it used in the construction of the building. This was an action to recover the value of the same, and, to enforce a lien on the building for the amount. The owner, Quintana, alone answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-12\">On the trial the defendant Quintana offered to prove that he had paid the contractor, the Bridge Company, the full amount of the contract price, less $2,000, and1 that the building was not finished according to the contract, and that he had sustained damage in the sum of $3,518 by reason of the failure to do the work according to the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-13\">The plaintiff objected to so much of the evidence as tended to show damage for failure to comply with the contract, because the same had not been pleaded, and the Court sustained the objection.
