The District Attorney of the county brought an action to foreclose the defendant\u2019s interest in the land and to annul the certificate of purchase. The Political Code, sec. 3548, requires him to bring such actions, and permits the summons to be served by publication. The summons issued in the case required the defendant to appear in an action \u201c brought to obtain a decree of this Court foreclosing the interest of defendant in certificate of purchase number one thousand three hundred and ninety-three of grants sixteen and thirty-six sections, and lieu lands, in the County of Santa Barbara, and all costs of suit, and such other judgment or order as may seem meet and proper.\u201d Judgment was rendered by default, and the defendant appealed from the judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-6\"><em>Moore, Laine &amp; Leib, </em>for the Appellant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The summons was radically defective.

It does not substantially state the cause or general nature of the action set forth in the complaint. The service of the summons was by publication, and the defendants failing to appear, judgment was taken by default. The summons was so radically defective that no judgment could properly be entered under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.
