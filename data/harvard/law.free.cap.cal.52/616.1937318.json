Smith, one of the Trustees, was called as a witness by the prosecution, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>testified that he did not sign his name to the order. He then stated that one Walker first showed him the order, and proceeded, notwithstanding the objection of the defendant, to detail what Walker said about it. The defendant was not present at the conversation. The defendant was convicted, and appealed. The other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-6\"><em>Oreed </em>Haymond, for the Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b645-7\"><em>Jo </em>Hamilton, Attorney-General, for the People, confessed error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b645-8\">By the COURT:</author>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">It was error to permit the witness Smith to testify to the prior conversation between himself and Walker.
