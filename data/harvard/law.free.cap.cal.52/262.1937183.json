The defendants offered to prove that they had been in the actual, exclusive, and adverse possession of the demanded premises for five years next before the filing of the complaint herein, and the exclusion of the evidence thus offered is the only supposed error remaining to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The answer of the defendants was a mere denial of the allegations contained in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">There was no attempt whatever, even such a one as was made in <em>McCreery </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>to plead the Statute of Limitations\u2014nor was any affirmative defense whatever set up in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">In this condition of the pleadings the proof offered by the defendants, even if amounting to anything in itself, was correctly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Judgment and order affirmed.
