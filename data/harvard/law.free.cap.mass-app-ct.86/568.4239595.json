L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a); one count of unlawful possession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(A); one count of possession of a class B substance with the intent to distribute (\u201ccrack\u201d cocaine), G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A; and one count of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm charged in a separate complaint, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 lO(n).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge of possession with intent to distribute and the firearms and ammunition charges. The defendant also argues that his motion for new trial, which was based on a claim of newly discovered evidence and prosecutorial nondisclosure regarding problems in the William A. Hinton State Laboratory Institute (Hinton lab) involving chemist Annie Dookhan, should have been allowed. We conclude that the evidence was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the charges but that the motion for new trial should have been allowed as to the drug charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><em>Facts. </em>Police officers in the Boston drug control unit obtained a search warrant for an apartment in a six-family building located in Dorchester. They executed the warrant on June 18, 2008, and initially tried to gain entry by knocking loudly on the apartment door and announcing their presence. The police heard the sound of people \u201cscurrying\u201d inside the apartment, but no one answered the door. Using a battering ram, the police struck the door eight or nine times until it finally gave way.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Upon gaining entry, the defendant fled over a balcony, dropped to the ground, and ran. The defendant, a six-foot, three-inch man weighing about 210 pounds, was readily distinguishable from a second male suspect, who was about five feet tall, and who was also running from the rear of the building about ten feet away from the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant attempted to jump over a fence but became entangled and fell. To free himself, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>ant pulled off a headphone, the wire of which had been hooked on the fence, and continued to run. He was apprehended by one of the officers who were chasing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The police retraced the defendant\u2019s path and located a bag containing what appeared to be ten rocks of crack cocaine individually packaged in small plastic bags and the headphones the defendant had been wearing when he became hooked on the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The apartment where the search warrant was executed consisted of five rooms, including a living room, two bedrooms, and a kitchen. Police located Joel Moore in the smaller bedroom, which contained a day bed; it was in disarray with clothes scattered all over and piled on the bed. The room also contained a bureau, on top of which was a black backpack. An officer unzipped the backpack and saw a handle and trigger guard of what was later identified as a Taurus nine millimeter semiautomatic pistol (Taurus pistol). The officer also found two pieces of mail from the Social Security Administration addressed to the defendant at a different address in Dorchester, a letter addressed to Eddie Gaston, a box of plastic sandwich bags, a loaded High Point .380 caliber semiautomatic pistol (High Point pistol), a single loose round of ammunition, and assorted items of very large male clothing. The officer also found a scale with residue on it, a mirror, and a razor blade in that bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">In the second, larger bedroom, another officer found one live round of .380 ammunition and a firearm barrel cleaning rod in the top drawer of a bureau. He also recovered mail, a money order, and identification in the name of Cedric Motin, the apartment lessee; $151 in United States currency; and a spent shell casing. The bedroom also contained a bed and a closet with clothing. Motin, who is about five feet, six inches tall and weighs about 140 pounds, returned to the apartment during execution of the warrant and spoke to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The Taurus pistol, the High Point pistol, both magazines, and all of the ammunition were examined by the police for fingerprints. Five latent prints were recovered from those items. Three prints were recovered from the Taurus pistol but were of insufficient quality to compare them to anyone else\u2019s prints. Two latent prints were recovered from the magazine of the Taurus pistol, and one of those prints was of sufficient quality to exclude the defendant and match the print to an individual named Dashawn Hinton.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion for new trial. </em>The defendant argued in his motion for new trial that his inability to access Dookhan\u2019s pervasive and egregious misconduct until after his trial and the prosecutor\u2019s failure to disclose the misconduct prevented him from challenging her role as the confirmatory chemist. The motion judge, who was not the trial judge, reasoned that because Dookhan was merely the confirmatory chemist there was no substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had they been made aware of her misconduct because the primary chemist had independently tested the same sample and given her opinion at trial that the substance was cocaine. The defendant appeals claiming, in essence, that his motion for new trial should have been allowed on the common-law ground of newly discovered evidence and the constitutional claim of pro-secutorial nondisclosure. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. 336, 359 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">As is often repeated, we review an appeal from the \u201cdenial of a motion for new trial \u2018to determine whether there has been a significant error of law or other abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>467 Mass. 1002, 1004 (2014), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robideau, </em>464 Mass. 699, 701-702 (2013). \u201cWhere, as here, a judge hearing a motion for new trial was not the trial judge, we regard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the trial record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>448 Mass. 585, 593 (2007) (quotation omitted). In addition, when a new trial motion is constitutionally based, as is one of the claims at issue here, \u201cthis court will exercise its own judgment on the ultimate factual as well as legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salvati, </em>420 Mass. 499, 500 (1995), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 409 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">After the briefs were submitted in this case, the Supreme Judicial Court issued a series of cases involving challenges to guilty pleas pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), on grounds that the pleas were entered neither knowingly nor voluntarily as the result of misconduct by Dookhan. We know of no published decision in Massachusetts in which the appeal was from a conviction after trial, rather than from a guilty plea. The lead case in the recent spate of decisions, however, includes a lengthy discussion regarding challenges from a conviction after trial, which is instructive in analyzing the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>presented here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 358-362.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">At the outset, the court in <em>Scott </em>detailed the method for testing illicit narcotics at the Hinton lab and Dookhan\u2019s role in those tests. <em>Id. </em>at 338-342. The court explained that Hinton lab protocols required two levels of testing on each substance submitted for testing. \u201cPrimary tests [were] simple bench top tests [that] have only moderate discriminatory power [to detect a specific substance] .... [Secondary, or confirmatory, tests were conducted [with] sophisticated instrumentation [that] have high discriminatory power, and . . . produce instrument-generated documentation of test results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 340 (quotations omitted). When testing of a sample was complete, a certificate of drug analysis was prepared and signed by the primary chemist and the secondary or confirmatory chemist on one line labeled \u201cAssistant Analyst\u201d and their signatures were notarized, typically by another chemist. <em>Id. </em>at 340-341. \u201cAlthough it is assumed that on the line labeled \u2018Assistant Analyst\u2019 the signature further to the left is that of the primary chemist and the signature further to the right is that of the secondary chemist, nothing on the face of the certificate confirms that assumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 n.9. In this case, Dookhan was the confirmatory chemist.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In addition, the <em>Scott </em>court specifically identified Doohkan\u2019s wrongdoing. In her capacity as a primary chemist, Dookhan lied about having tested all the samples in a group, when she had only tested a select few, and she converted \u201cnegatives to positives.\u201d As a secondary chemist she falsified other chemists\u2019 initials on reports intending to verify the proper functioning of the instrumentation and lied about having verified the proper functioning of the instrumentation. <em>Id. </em>at 341. Her misconduct continued for years, and touched thousands of cases that even she is unable to specifically identify. Because her widespread conduct as a government agent had the capacity to \u201cundermine[ ] the very foundation of [a defendant\u2019s] prosecution,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 348, the court aptly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>described it as \u201ccasting] a shadow over the entire criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. In response the court concluded that in each instance that Dookhan served as the assistant analyst, either as the primary chemist or the confirmatory chemist, the \u201cdefendant is entitled to a conclusive presumption that egregious government misconduct occurred in the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Relying on the reasoning in <em>Scott, </em>it is clear that the initial requirements of both theories presented in this appeal have been established. With respect to the claim of newly discovered evidence, because the breadth and depth of Dookhan\u2019s misconduct was not uncovered until July, 2012, five months after the defendant\u2019s trial, we can readily conclude it is newly discovered. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 306 (1986) (evidence must \u201chave been unknown to the defendant or his counsel and not reasonably discoverable by them at the time of trial\u201d); <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 359. In addition, because there is no question that Dookhan, a government agent, affirmatively identified illicit substances that she had not properly tested, those representations are exculpatory because they undermined the foundation of the defendant\u2019s prosecution and, in turn, triggered the requirement of prosecutorial disclosure. See <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass, at 412 (prosecution obligated to deliver exculpatory evidence to defense); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 824 (1998) (\u201cA prosecutor\u2019s obligations extend to information in possession of a person who has participated in the investigation or evaluation of the case and has reported to the prosecutor\u2019s office concerning the case\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>451 Mass. 310, 327 (2008). See generally <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 347-348.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Thus, the focus in this appeal is the second part of the analysis in each claim, specifically prejudice or materiality. <em>Id. </em>at 360. In either a common-law claim of newly discovered evidence or a constitutional claim of prosecutorial nondisclosure, the defendant must demonstrate essentially the same requirement, namely that there is a \u201csubstantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass, at 306. See <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass, at 406, 413. \u201cThe judge need not be convinced that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different but rather that the evidence would have been a \u2018real factor\u2019 in the jury\u2019s deliberations.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 360. See <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass, at 414 (\u201cIt is enough that, on a full and reasonable assessment of the trial record, the absent evidence would have played an important role in the jury\u2019s deliberations and conclusions, even though it is not certain that the evidence would have produced a verdict of not guilty\u201d). This requirement has been equated with the second prong of \u201cthe <em>Saferian </em>ineffective assistance of counsel standard.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 360, quoting from <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass, at 406, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Here, it is clear that Dookhan\u2019s role as the confirmatory chemist was significant. Only the confirmatory chemist uses sophisticated instrumentation in the testing process that has both a high discriminatory power to identify the substance and the ability to produce instrument-generated documentation of test results. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 340-341. The simple bench top tests conducted by the primary chemist provide neither safeguard. <em>Ibid. </em>Without the secondary test, only the results of the simple bench top tests conducted by the primary chemist are available. By definition these tests are less discriminatory, and it is far from clear that such tests are sufficiently reliable to be admitted. If admitted, standing alone, discriminatory weaknesses provide substantial fodder for cross-examination. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>458 Mass. 137,147-151 (2010). Here, proof of Dook-han\u2019s wrongdoing as it related to the defendant\u2019s case provides its own shadow of reasonable doubt about the nature of the substances tested. In sum, we have no difficulty concluding that evidence of the \u201c \u2018particularly pernicious\u2019 government misconduct\u201d by Doolchan would have been a real factor in the jury\u2019s deliberation on the narcotics charges. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass, at 347, quoting from <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>United States, </em>456 F.3d 278,291 (1st Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence, </em>a. <em>The drugs. </em>The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he intended to distribute the ten rocks of crack cocaine that were found shortly after his apprehension and that the most the Commonwealth could prove was possession. Applying the familiar standard articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), we conclude that the evidence, when viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to satisfy a rational trier of fact of each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, the quantity of the drugs, the packaging of the drugs, and the paraphernalia, such as the scale and the particularly incriminating box of plastic sandwich bags found in the backpack, bolstered by the defendant\u2019s attempted flight and the absence of any smoking paraphernalia either in the apartment or in the defendant\u2019s possession, provided ample evidence for the trier of fact to conclude that the defendant not merely was in possession of the drugs, but also intended to distribute them. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766,771-772 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sepheus, </em>468 Mass. 160, 167-168 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montalvo, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 324, 327 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">To the extent the defendant suggests the evidence is lacking because no expert police testimony was offered, the argument fails to recognize that such testimony is not required.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 427-428 (1985) (no expert testimony was offered and court made clear intent to distribute is factual question which may be proved by circumstantial evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, A1 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 255, 257-259 (1999) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">b. <em>The guns and ammunition in the backpack. </em>The defendant argues that because Moore was in the smaller bedroom where the backpack was found, only conjecture or guesswork would permit a fact finder to choose between two alternative propositions, namely, that Moore had stuffed the guns (and presumably the ammunition) into the defendant\u2019s backpack when he heard the police approaching, or that the guns belonged to the defendant. The difficulty with the claim is that the alternatives are not equally supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Apart from Moore\u2019s presence in the room with the zipped backpack, there is no evidence that ties him to it or the contents therein. Police testimony is devoid of any evidence that Moore was moving quickly or even near the backpack when they entered the room, and he was not arrested or charged in this case. Moreover, one gun was buried at the bottom of the backpack, underneath clothing, and the other placed on the top of the other contents. It is hardly reasonable to think that Moore had the time, the interest, or even the motive to collect and stuff into the back<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>pack all the items found therein, or that he would have buried only one of the weapons and left the other sticking out near the top. In any event, the evidence was sufficient to demonstrate that the backpack and its contents \u2014 which included letters addressed to the defendant at the address he gave to the booking officer in this case and clothing that could have been the size he wore \u2014 belonged to him and that he left it behind in his rush to escape apprehension by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The portion of the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial on the drug charge is reversed, the judgment thereon is reversed, and the verdict set aside. The portion of the order denying the motion for new trial on the firearms and ammunition charges is affirmed, as are the judgments on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We note that the defendant incorrectly identified the loaded firearm charge in his brief as simple possession and the Commonwealth incorrectly identified the counts on which the defendant was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\">The defendant\u2019s direct appeal does not appear to have been consolidated with his appeal from the denial of the motion for new trial, but because the parties have addressed both appeals in a single brief, we will respond in a single decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The second suspect was not apprehended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b602-7\"> Additionally, in four rescript opinions, the Supreme Judicial Court vacated the trial judge\u2019s decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, concluded that the first prong of the analysis in <em>Ferrara </em>v. <em>United States, </em>456 F.3d 278, 290 (1st Cir. 2006), had been established, and remanded each case to allow the trial judge to consider whether the defendant can show a reasonable probability that had he known of the allegations against Dookhan at the time of his plea, he would have refused to plead guilty and insisted on going to trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davila, </em>467 Mass. 1005 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bjork, </em>467 Mass. 1006 (2014); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>467 Mass. 1007 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The Supreme Judicial Court has taken the view that Dookhan\u2019s wrongdoing in her roles as the primary and the confirmatory chemist was equally egregious.
