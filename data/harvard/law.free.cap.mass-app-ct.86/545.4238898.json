The significant issue is the appropriate weight to be given to a defendant\u2019s failure to produce an affidavit from plea counsel, when the defendant makes a substantial showing that he attempted to obtain such an affidavit and counsel refused to respond. In the circumstances of this case, the defendant was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, with an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>tunity to secure plea counsel\u2019s presence by subpoena and for the judge to determine any credibility issues based on live testimony. Accordingly, we vacate the orders denying the defendant\u2019s motions for new trial and for reconsideration and remand the matter for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Background. </em>On May 3, 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty in the Superior Court to distribution of a class B controlled substance, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32A(a) </em>(count one),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40 (count two).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge gave the \u201cimmigration warning\u201d required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, and then asked the defendant where he was born. The defendant answered that he was born in Guatemala, and the judge responded, \u201cI have no way of knowing what the consequences will be in terms of deportation and all. That\u2019s up to the Federal Naturalization Service and not anything I can control. You understand you\u2019re running the risk, though?\u201d The defendant responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The judge then accepted the plea, finding that the defendant was \u201calert and intelligent and that his plea [was] made voluntarily with full knowledge of its consequences.\u201d He imposed a sentence of two years in a house of correction, with six months to serve and the balance suspended, and two years of probation from and after the incarceration. Count two, the conspiracy charge, was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. Six months later, on October 12, 1999, the defendant was deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">On September 6, 2011, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, seeking to withdraw his guilty plea on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. In his motion, the defendant alleged that at the time of the plea, \u201che was affirmatively misinformed by his counsel that the plea and agreed upon sentence would not affect his status as a permanent resident in the United States.\u201d The motion was accompanied by two affidavits, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>signed by the defendant and one by Migdalia Garcia, the mother of his four children. The defendant\u2019s affidavit stated that his attorney had \u201ctold [him] that [he] would not be deported because [he] would not serve more than one year of committed time under the agreed-upon plea. Specifically, [the attorney] stated to the [defendant]: \u2018This is between the Superior Court and you. Immigration has nothing to do with it.\u2019 \u201d The defendant continued that, although the plea judge had warned that his plea \u201ccould have immigration consequences, [he] understood from the conversation with [his] attorney that those consequences would not apply in [his] case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The defendant\u2019s affidavit also stated that he came to the United States in 1977 at the age of seven, and he attended middle school and high school in Boston. At the time of the plea, he was a permanent resident of the United States, he was employed, and he had three children who were United States citizens. His whole family was \u201chere,\u201d and he had \u201cno significant ties to any other country.\u201d Garcia\u2019s affidavit corroborated the defendant\u2019s assertion that the attorney had \u201cspecifically told [the defendant] that he would not be deported as a result of pleading guilty in this case, which was the determining factor to his decision to plead guilty.\u201d In fact, the plea was grounds for deportation, and the defendant was deported in October, 1999, as a result of the conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>The defendant also submitted a third affidavit from one Wendy Wayne, an attorney who described herself as \u201can immigration law specialist with the Committee for Public Counsel Services.\u201d In her affidavit, Wayne explained that under Federal law, \u201call Massachusetts controlled substance offenses other than straight possession\u201d were considered \u201caggravated felonies.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (2012). However, Wayne also stated that some other offenses, including crimes of violence and theft off-ens es, \u201cbecome aggravated felonies only upon a conviction AND the imposition of a one year sentence.\u201d See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), (J), (R), (S) (2012). In Wayne\u2019s experience, \u201cit is a common misperception among criminal defense attorneys that keeping a committed sentence under one year on any offense will avoid an aggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The Commonwealth opposed the defendant\u2019s motion. Although conceding that \u201c[h]ere, as in Padilla, it was \u2018truly clear\u2019 that the defendant\u2019s crime would render him deportable,\u201d the Commonwealth nonetheless maintained that there was no support for the defendant\u2019s position, as his own affidavit was \u201cwholly self-serving\u201d; Garcia\u2019s affidavit was \u201creplete with hearsay, and . . . merely repealed] what plea counsel and the defendant allegedly discussed prior to the plea\u201d; and Wayne\u2019s affidavit was irrelevant, \u201cas she lack[ed] personal knowledge of the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d <em>\u201cMost </em>importantly,\u201d according to the Commonwealth, \u201can affidavit from [plea counsel] is suspiciously absent. Without plea counsel\u2019s affidavit, [the judge] cannot assess any aspect of his advice to the defendant. Thus, the defendant <em>cannot </em>meet his burden of proving that \u2018counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d \u2019 \u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">On November 2, 2011, a judge who was not the plea judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion without a hearing. She described the plea judge\u2019s discussion of the issue of deportation at the plea colloquy as \u201cpainstaking,\u201d and observed that \u201c[i]f the defendant was confused between the advice of counsel and the judge\u2019s explanation he would have made inquiry as he did with another issue.\u201d She noted the absence of an affidavit from plea counsel and described the defendant\u2019s affidavit as \u201cself-serving\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Garcia\u2019s affidavit as \u201chearsay.\u201d The judge also stated that Wayne\u2019s affidavit did \u201cnot assist in the analysis for ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d and the judge \u201cadopt[ed] the legal arguments set forth in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief and incorporated it by reference.\u201d Finally, she determined, without elaboration, that the defendant had not shown prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The defendant then moved for reconsideration, detailing his new lawyer\u2019s attempts to obtain an affidavit from plea counsel, and noting that it was evident from the judge\u2019s order that \u201cthe pivotal and deciding factor in the [cjourt\u2019s determination that the [defendant raised no substantial issue was the absence of an affidavit from [plea counsel].\u201d The motion continued that new counsel had made considerable effort to secure the affidavit and had been unable to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion was supplemented by affidavits from counsel and from his associate. The judge denied the motion for reconsideration without a hearing or further comment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cA motion to withdraw a guilty plea is treated as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30(b)[, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001)]. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 106 (2009). A judge may grant such a motion \u2018if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u2019 Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>467 Mass. 1002, 1004 (2014). \u201cWhen, as here, the motion judge did not preside [at the plea hearing] . . . , we regard ourselves in as good a position as the motion judge to assess the . . . record.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peteta-bella, </em>459 Mass. <em>Ill, </em>181 (2011), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 307 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\u201cIt is well established that a judge has discretion to deny a new trial motion on the affidavits.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 389, 394 (2012). See Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(c)(3), as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). However, when the defendant raises a substantial issue of fact, it is the better practice to conduct an evidentiary hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chatman, </em>466 Mass. 327, 334 (2013), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257-258 (1981) (\u201cIn determining whether a \u2018substantial issue\u2019 meriting an evidentiary hearing . . . has been raised, we look not only at the seriousness of the issue asserted, but also to the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s showing on the issue raised\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, supra </em>at 394-395.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Counsel\u2019s advice regarding the immigration consequences for a permanent resident tendering a guilty plea to controlled substance charges is a serious issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2012). Federal law \u201cspecifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dejesus, </em>468 Mass. 174, 180 (2014), quoting from <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 368. \u201cCounsel therefore was obligated to provide to [the defendant] ... the information that presumptively mandatory deportation would have been the legal consequence of pleading guilty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181. \u201cWithout the benefit of such counsel, a client cannot enter a knowing and voluntary plea.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chleikh, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 718, 723 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The defendant agrees that the case law is replete with comments that, in ineffective assistance claims, the court is entitled to draw a negative inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to secure an affidavit from trial or plea counsel. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 354 (2004) (\u201c[T]rial counsel\u2019s failure to confirm either of these points speaks volumes. When weighing the adequacy of the materials submitted in support of a motion for a new trial, the judge may take into account the suspicious failure to provide pertinent information from an expected and <em>available </em>source. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurston, </em>53</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 548, 553-554 [2002]\u201d [emphasis supplied]). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leng, </em>463 Mass. 779, 787 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 348, 352 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thurston, supra </em>(\u201cThe defendant\u2019s claim in his affidavit that trial counsel was ineffective in his preparation is \u2018conspicuously marred\u2019 by his failure to file an affidavit from his attorney, <em>or... even [to] indicate that he sought to obtain an affidavit from </em>counsel\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The Commonwealth argues that \u201cMassachusetts courts should continue \u2014 as a matter of policy \u2014 to draw an adverse inference from an attorney\u2019s failure to provide an affidavit to a former client raising an ineffectiveness claim.\u201d That goes too far. Certainly, a judge reasonably may draw a negative inference in many such cases and conclude that there is no affidavit from counsel because a truthful affidavit would not assist the defendant. However, other situations are possible. For example, a lawyer who is aware that his assistance some five or ten years earlier was less than exemplary might very well be reluctant to describe that lapse in an affidavit intended for submission to a court where he regularly receives new appointments. In a case such as this one, where successor counsel filed affidavits attesting to plea counsel\u2019s lack of cooperation \u2014 including even the failure to return telephone calls \u2014 the lack of an affidavit cannot be a talisman that, by itself, defeats a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">To succeed on an ineffective assistance claim, the defendant was required to provide factual support showing that trial counsel\u2019s representation fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected of an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dejesus, </em>468 Mass, at 178, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>460 Mass. 30, 45 (2011). If this defendant\u2019s plea counsel in fact informed him that, so long as he served less than a year of incarceration, he was not likely to be deported, that advice was ineffective at this 1999 plea hearing. \u201cAfter the 1996 effective date of amendments to the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, ... \u2018if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense . . . his removal is practically inevitable,\u2019 subject to limited exceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, quoting from <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 363-364. Moreover, Federal law \u201cspecifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Padilla, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Both the Commonwealth and the motion judge describe the plea judge\u2019s colloquy with the defendant on the issue of depor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>tation as \u201cpainstaking.\u201d That is not the issue here. While the judge properly administered the \u201cimmigration warning\u201d required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D, \u201csuch warnings are \u2018not an adequate substitute for defense counsel\u2019s professional obligation to advise [his] client of the likelihood of specific and dire immigration consequences that might result from such a plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, supra </em>at 177 n.3, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 48 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In addition, as noted, the plea judge also stated that he had \u201cno way of knowing what the consequences [would] be in terms of deportation and all. That\u2019s up to the Federal Naturalization Service and not anything I can control. You understand you\u2019re running the risk, though?\u201d As the court observed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, supra </em>at 181, \u201c[tjelling the defendant that he was \u2018eligible for deportation\u2019 and that he would \u2018face deportation\u2019 was not adequate advice because it did not convey what is clearly stated in Federal law.\u201d Such advice could have \u201cconveyfed] that the law requires additional conditions to be met before an individual could be removed and allows for the exercise of discretion in determining whether those conditions are met.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, it appears that, in fact, little more was required and, at least in hindsight, that statement from the judge might have undermined even accurate advice from counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Because the motion judge appears to have based her decision in large part on the defendant\u2019s failure to produce an affidavit from plea counsel, without appearing to consider the circumstances of that failure, this case must be remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The hearing will permit the judge not only to hear from plea counsel, but also to assess first-hand the credibility of the defendant and Garcia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">At the hearing after remand, the defendant also will be required to show that the consequence of counsel\u2019s serious incompetency was prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>460 Mass, at 47, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>quoting from <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, (1985) (\u201cIn the context of a guilty plea, in order to satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant has the burden of establishing that \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The decision on the issue of prejudice will be for the motion judge at the hearing. However, on the record before us, we cannot say that the defendant will be unable to meet this burden. His situation \u2014 a United States resident since early childhood, employed with a family, including a common-law wife and three children who were all United States citizens \u2014 compares very favorably with that of the defendant in <em>DeJesus, </em>and his legal position \u2014 a minor player in a forty dollar street drug transaction \u2014 compares even more favorably. As the prosecutor noted at the time of the plea, this defendant had no \u201cother previous drug offenses,\u201d \u201cthe amount of drugs . . . was minimal,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s role was minor. The defendant in <em>DeJesus, </em>on the other hand, received a straight probation sentence on a charge reduced from trafficking, one that would have carried a five-year mandatory minimum sentence. On this record, it appears that there is at least a reasonable possibility that the defendant in the present case would have chosen to go to trial rather than face \u201ccharges that made his deportation virtually mandatory.\u201d See <em>DeJesus, supra </em>at 179, quoting from <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We vacate the orders denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and for reconsideration and remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The defendant initially was charged with distribution of a class B controlled substance, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(c); that statute provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of one year. At the change of plea hearing, the Commonwealth moved to amend count one, instead charging the defendant under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 <em>32A(a), </em>which carries no mandatory sentence of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\">At the plea hearing, the prosecutor told the judge that, on November 25, 1997, the defendant had facilitated a drug transaction between an undercover police officer and a drug dealer for a forty dollar purchase of cocaine; the police officer afterwards paid the defendant ten dollars for his part in setting up the deal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On April 6, 2011, the defendant was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on a charge of illegal reentry into the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (2012). On March 16, 2012, after denial of his motion to dismiss that indictment, the defendant pleaded guilty to illegal reentry into the United States. On June 25, 2012, he received a sentence of twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment and twenty-four months\u2019 supervised release. He filed a notice of appeal three days later. The record does not indicate the status of that appeal. The Commonwealth suggests that the appeal in the case before us is moot because \u201cvacating the defendant\u2019s [Sjtate conviction would not necessarily affect his [Fjederal prosecution.\u201d As the Commonwealth notes, Federal law in this area is not necessarily clear cut. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Boliero, </em>923 F. Supp. 2d 319, 335-336 (D. Mass. 2013) (defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment charging her with illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326[a], [b][2], was granted because defendant met all three requirements under \u00a7 1326[d] and had shown that a 1992 deportation order, an essential element of the crime with which she was charged, was invalid, and further, the prosecution for illegal reentry was a due process violation where the prosecution was a continuing consequence of a criminal conviction that was vacated ab initia). The Commonwealth argues that the present case is distinguishable. However, because we cannot say what effect vacating the defendant\u2019s conviction would have on his Federal prosecution or status in this country, and because the parties have briefed the issues fully, we have addressed the issues raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\">As Wayne recited in her affidavit, \u201c[a]n aggravated felony is a special class of deportable crimes that subject a noncitizen to nearly automatic deportation, permanent exile from the U.S. and a bar to almost every form of relief from deportation.\u201d See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Specifically, counsel represented to the judge, \u201cDuring the past five months counsel of record and associate attorneys have spoken to [plea counsel] on several occasions.
