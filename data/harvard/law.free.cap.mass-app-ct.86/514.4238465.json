See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. We agree with the plaintiff that his offer of proof was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\"><em>Background</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The decedent died from cardiac arrest after liposuction and abdominoplasty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> procedures performed at Milton Hospital (hospital) by Russo on May 17, 2011. As detailed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Russo in his operation report, after the decedent was brought into the operating room, a general anesthesia was induced. In performing the liposuction procedure, Russo utilized a tumescent solution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> containing xylocaine (lidocaine) and epinephrine delivered through \u201cseveral small stab incisions\u201d into the areas to be suctioned. Approximately one liter of tumescent solution was infused into each side of her waist. In treating the medial thigh and knee areas, approximately 600 milliliters of tumescent solution were infused. When the upper arms were treated, approximately 300 to 400 milliliters of tumescent solution were infused into each upper arm. Russo recorded that the total infusion was 3,800 milliliters (or 3.8 liters). No tumescent solution use was reported for the abdominoplasty.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The two procedures took place between 1:30 p.m. and approximately 6:00 p.m. Russo reported that, as the abdominal wound was about one-half closed, at about 6:03 p.m., the anesthesiologist reported a sudden drop in the decedent\u2019s blood pressure. Code emergency procedures immediately were instituted and performed over the next one and one-half hours. The decedent briefly was stabilized to a normal blood pressure and was transferred to the intensive care unit. After about one hour, she suffered cardiac arrest, was unable to be resuscitated, and was declared dead at 9:50 p.m.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court on April 17, 2012, alleging that the decedent\u2019s death was caused by Russo\u2019s negligence. Russo requested a medical malpractice tribunal pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. Following the submission of an offer of proof by the plaintiff, and a hearing, the tribunal issued a report stating that \u201cthere is not sufficient evidence to raise a legitimate question as to liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d When the plaintiff failed to post the required bond, judgment entered dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. He timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s claim of malpractice essentially is that Russo failed to conform to the requisite standards of care in his administration of the anesthetic solution, which allegedly was given in toxic doses, causing the decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof consists of a memorandum of facts and law; an opinion letter of a medical expert, Dr. Robert M. Stark,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> his curriculum vitae, and the published articles on which he relied; the decedent\u2019s Milton Hospital records; the medical examiner\u2019s records; and Russo\u2019s office records.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We test the sufficiency of an offer of proof by viewing the evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to the plaintiff,\u201d <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Avedikian, </em>412 Mass. 481, 484 (1992), to determine principally whether Russo\u2019s \u201cperformance did not conform to good medical practice,\u201d and whether damage resulted. <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Kim, </em>429 Mass. 130, 133 (1999) (citation omitted). An offer of proof is sufficient if \u201canywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>St. Germain </em>v. <em>Pfeifer, </em>418 Mass. 511, 516 (1994) (citation omitted). See <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 578 (1978) (tribunal\u2019s task similar to trial judge\u2019s function in ruling on defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The principal thrust of Dr. Stark\u2019s opinion is that Russo deviated from the standard of care by ordering the infusion of a toxic dose of tumescent solution, which caused the decedent\u2019s cardiac arrest. Dr. Stark noted that, before the procedures began, by \u201cthe end of one hour, this [intravenous (I.V.)] infusion provided the [decedent] a dose of 1 mg epinephrine and 400 mg of lido-caine. . . . During the ensuing liposuction procedure, Dr. Russo administered a total of 3.85 liters of \u2018tumescent solution\u2019 that. . . delivered an additional dose of 3.8 mg of epinephrine and 1,340 mg of lidocaine to the [decedent\u2019s] subcutaneous tissue.\u201d Given these facts, Dr. Stark opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201c[I]t is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Dr. Russo failed to exercise that degree of skill and care of the average qualified practitioner of medicine in general and as a surgeon of any specialty by: (1) prescribing and ordering the perioperative I.V. infusion of a toxic dose of tumescent anesthetic solution; (2) failing to prevent the I.V. administration of a toxic dose of anesthetic solution by reviewing his orders before performing the procedure; and (3) failing to realize that his patient had received the tumescent anesthetic I.V., thereby compromising further resuscita-tive efforts by the administration of additional lidocaine and epinephrine as part of the Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) protocol. It is my further opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that it was the toxic dose of epinephrine contained in the I.V. and potentiated by the co-administration of lidocaine which caused [the decedent\u2019s] death and that, notwithstanding Dr. Russo undertaking a combination of liposuction and an abdominoplasty under general anesthesia which carries the highest risk of morbidity according to the literature, . . . but for his ordering, allowing and not realizing that she had received an I.V. infusion of the anesthetic solution, [the decedent] would have survived the procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Citing opinions of authorities in published papers that \u201cliposuction by local anesthesia is safer than liposuction by general anesthesia,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that \u201cthere have been no deaths associated with tumescent liposuction totally by local anesthesia without parenteral narcotic analgesia or general anesthesia,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. Stark stated that, based on his \u201cown education, training and experience as a cardiologist, it is my opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that there was no clinical indication or reason to administer perioperative fluids containing epinephrine and lidocaine to [the decedent].\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Dr. Stark concluded that the \u201cventricular ectopy and fibrillation that [the decedent] developed in the [operating room] were, in my opinion to a reasonable degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>medical certainty, the result of an epinephrine overdose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In response, Russo claims that he ordered the tumescent solution only to be administered subcutaneously, and not intravenously. Referring to his preoperative orders, he asserts that he ordered standard lactated \u201cRinger\u2019s\u201d solution,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which does not contain epinephrine or lidocaine, to be administered intravenously; he points to hospital anesthesia records showing that Ringer\u2019s solution was administered intravenously between 1:30 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. However, Dr. Stark points to a hospital \u201cprovider order summary\u201d that shows that a secondary intravenous infusion (IV) was ordered, specified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cStart: 05/17/11 0753</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\u201cStop: 05/17/11 0852</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-8\">\u201cLactated Ringers Volume: 1000 ML</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-9\">\u201cLidocaine 2 20ML Dose: 400MG</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\u201cEpinephrine Dose: 1 MG</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-11\">\u201cRate: 1021 MLS/HR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-12\">\u201cInfusion Site: IV\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">The electronic medication administration record also lists an order for 1,000 milliliters of \u201clactated Ringer\u2019s,\u201d specifying the same amounts of lidocaine and epinephrine as the hospital anesthesia record, and adding \u201clabel cmts: tumescent anesthesia\u201d scheduled for intravenous route.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">Dr. Stark also found that Russo failed to note in his operation report the use of Marcaine (bupivacaine), \u201ca local anesthetic twice as powerful as lidocaine and more cardiotoxic.\u201d The use of Marcaine also had not been recorded with the other medications in the decedent\u2019s chart. Dr. Stark, however, discovered an entry in a nurse\u2019s note that forty-five milliliters of \u201c25 Marcaine &amp; epi[nephrine]\u201d had been administered, apparently during the ACLS protocol. He noted that Marcaine was administered \u201cdirectly into the area where the surgical incision was made to perform the abdominoplasty.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Dr. Stark opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that lidocaine and Marcaine \u201cby themselves can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>cause ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation,\u201d and that \u201csevere and intractable arrhythmia can occur with the accidental IV injection [of lidocaine].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Finally, Dr. Stark stated that the \u201chospital record is incomplete and inconsistent as [to] the amount of I.V. fluids given, but at the time [the decedent] was pronounced dead, she had gained 10.4 kg (22+ lbs) due to I.V. fluids (measured during the autopsy).\u201d He stated that pulmonary edema was unavoidable, and that the toxicology report was unreliable because the analgesic medications and epinephrine had been \u201cmassively diluted\u201d by the IV fluids.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Specifically, Dr. Stark\u2019s letter tracks the breach of Russo\u2019s duty to conform to good medical practice with Dr. Stark\u2019s statements regarding the administration of a toxic dose of tumescent solution, the use of general anesthesia, and the use of Marcaine. Dr. Stark links these actions by Russo to the decedent\u2019s death, satisfying the requirement of causation. Because the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof regarding his claim against Russo contained evidence that, \u201cif substantiated, would reasonably support an inference . . . that [Russo\u2019s] performance did not conform to good medical practice, and that injury to the [decedent] resulted therefrom,\u201d the tribunal erred in holding otherwise. <em>St. Germain </em>v. <em>Pfeifer, </em>418 Mass, at 518. Thus, the plaintiff was not required to post a bond to prevent dismissal of his claim against Russo.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court where the determination of the tribunal is to be substituted by a determination that the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof was sufficient to raise a legitimate question appropriate for judicial inquiry.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-16\">We take the facts from the plaintiff\u2019s offer of proof; they are assumed to be true for purposes of our review. <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper-Ciccarelli, </em>77 Mass.
