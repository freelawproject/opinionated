L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, as a lesser included offense of rape of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>a child under sixteen years of age, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The principal issue in this appeal is the admissibility of first complaint testimony where the victim has no memory of the complaint. In light of the primary purpose of first complaint evidence, we determine that such testimony is admissible. The defendant also contests the admission of testimony of a subsequent complaint, of testimony pertaining to the victim\u2019s bodily functions, and of photographic evidence showing injuries to the victim and her brother. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the facts as a jury could reasonably have found, reserving certain details for discussion with the specific issues raised. The series of incidents underlying the conviction began when the victim was seven or eight years old. The incidents occurred when the victim, S.B., and her older brother, M.B., lived with their great aunt, Tina Dale (Tina), and great uncle, Fred Dale (Fred).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant is the victim\u2019s cousin, the son of Tina and Fred; the victim and her brother referred to him as \u201cUncle Eddie.\u201d During the period of the assaults, the defendant lived in the same house as the victim and had a room of his own. He only stayed in the house several nights a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The victim testified that, on multiple occasions over the course of several years, the defendant would sexually assault her in the Dales\u2019 residence. She testified that the first incident began when the defendant called her into his room after she was in bed. He told her that he was \u201cchecking for scars to see if everything was okay,\u201d and he pulled down her underwear and examined her visually. Because the victim had been subject to a beating that day from Tina, the victim understood the defendant to be checking to see whether the beating had caused any bruises.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the victim returned to the room in which she was sleeping, the defendant called her back into his room, and he told her to lie down on a towel on the floor and to pull down her underwear. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>pulled up the victim\u2019s pajama gown, opened his robe, and pulled out his penis. Lying on top of the victim, he placed his penis against her vagina, and he \u201cpeed on her.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She testified that this pattern was repeated over the course of multiple assaults,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ending only when the defendant moved out of the house.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She testified that the incidents generally occurred in the defendant\u2019s room, which was across the hall from the room where she often slept during the time of the assaults. She also testified that a similar incident happened at least once in a different room of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">M.B. testified as the first complaint witness. He testified that S.B. had told him \u2014 at the time the incidents were ongoing \u2014 that the defendant had touched her and had \u201cpeed on her or something like that.\u201d M.B. did not understand the meaning of this brief account as he was seven or eight years old at the time. But M.B. told his sister, in response, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t sound right.\u201d He testified that his sister looked scared as she told him about the incident. M.B. did not report the abuse or repeat the conversation to others. S.B. testified that she did not remember telling M.B. about the assaults during the time that they were occurring. M.B. also testified to a time, a year or two after her report to him about the assault, when his sister had told him that her urine was bloody and had showed him the bloody results of her urination. He also testified that, in the aftermath of this disclosure, she repeatedly told him that she experienced a burning sensation when she urinated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">S.B. and M.B. were removed from the Dales\u2019 house, in May, 2003, when S.B. was ten and one-half years old, because of physical abuse by the Dales. Both children testified to repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>abuse by Tina and Fred. The Commonwealth introduced photographs of M.B. and S.B. showing injuries to support the testimony with respect to physical abuse. The admission of these photographs, and the Commonwealth\u2019s use of them, is contested on appeal. Shortly after the report of the physical abuse, both siblings were placed in foster care with Orlinda Jones.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> S.B. testified that she told Jones about the sexual abuse four or five years after moving in with her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>First complaint testimony. </em>The first complaint doctrine permits a judge to admit testimony from the recipient of a victim\u2019s initial report of sexual assault. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 218-219, 241-248 (2005), cert, denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006). See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 413 (2013). The first complaint witness may also testify to the circumstances surrounding the complaint, including \u201cobservations of the complainant during the complaint; the events or conversations that culminated in the complaint; the timing of the complaint; and other relevant conditions that might help a jury assess the [complainant\u2019s] veracity . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 246. We review a judge\u2019s decision to admit first complaint evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>461 Mass. 60, 73 (2011) (\u201cThe judge who is evaluating the facts of a particular case is in the best position to determine the scope of admissible evidence, keeping in mind the underlying goals of the first complaint doctrine\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">i. <em>Complaint to M.B. </em>The defendant argues that M.B.\u2019s testimony with respect to S.B.\u2019s initial report to him of the sexual assault is inadmissible because S.B. had no memory of the complaint. Reviewing the purpose of first complaint testimony, we conclude that a victim need not remember a complaint to allow testimony by a first complaint witness. The victim\u2019s memory of the complaint goes to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Together with our understanding of the purpose of the first complaint doctrine, our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 411 (2010), leads us to conclude that the first complaint testimony is admissible in this case. In <em>Wallace, </em>a witness testified that the victim \u2014 his sibling, as in our case \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>had told him that the defendant had \u201cengaged in inappropriate sex with [the victim].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415. But the victim only remembered obliquely referring to the encounter in the conversation with his brother, the witness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>This court held that the judge had not abused her discretion in allowing the testimony, concluding there that the discrepancies in the narratives \u201c[went] to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant argues that <em>Wallace </em>is not controlling. He understands the holding of <em>Wallace </em>to be limited to situations where both the victim and the recipient of a complaint remember the complaint, but where their memories differ with respect to the complaint. We disagree. We read <em>Wallace </em>to stand for the broader principle that <em>any </em>discrepancy between the memory of a victim and the person receiving a complaint \u2014 including a victim\u2019s failure to remember making the complaint \u2014 goes to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">This reading is consistent with \u2014 and animates \u2014 the purpose of first complaint testimony set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra. </em>The main goals of the first complaint doctrine are, first, to refute the stereotype that silence is evidence that the complainant lacks credibility and, second, to provide to the jury as complete an account as possible of how the accusation of sexual assault arose. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>461 Mass, at 72, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 243, 247. The first goal is critical here, where the thrust of the defense was that the victim was not credible, and that she fabricated the allegations in response to outside events at a later time. M.B.\u2019s testimony that his sister reported the abuse to him while the abuse was ongoing rebuts the accusation of fabrication, particularly given that S.B. could not recall mentioning the sexual abuse to anyone until several years after it occurred.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The fact that S.B. did not remember the report to M.B., and that the first complaint that she remembered making was to Jones, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>several years later, was before the jury. The discrepancy between M.B.\u2019s testimony and S.B.\u2019s testimony \u201cprovided fodder for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, supra </em>at 415. The circumstances of the first complaint to M.B. and the subsequent report to Jones are relevant for the jury\u2019s determination of the weight of the evidence, particularly in light of the defense\u2019s theory of fabrication. But they do not preclude the admission of such evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u201cThe [first] complaint doctrine seeks to balance the interest of a complainant (who, as here, may be still a child) in having her credibility fairly judged on the specific facts of the case rather than unfairly by misguided stereotypical thinking, with that of a defendant in reserving a trial that is free from irrelevant and potentially prejudicial testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 228 (2009). The trial judge achieved exactly that balance in admitting the testimony from M.B., allowing the jury to judge the credibility of S.B. and her testimony by the \u201cspecific facts of the case,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>rather than by stereotypes. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 244 (\u201c[T]he doctrine gives the fact finder the maximum amount of information with which to assess the credibility of the . . . complaint evidence as well as the overall credibility of the victim\u201d [citations omitted]). We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting first complaint testimony from M.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">ii. <em>Complaint to Orlinda Jones. </em>The defendant argues that the judge impermissibly admitted testimony from the victim with respect to the complaint about the sexual abuse to her foster parent, Jones, several years after moving in with her that effectively constituted a second first complaint.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We disagree. We reject the suggestion that this was \u201cback-door first complaint testimony.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287,288 (2009). First, the defendant opened the front door to S.B.\u2019s testimony with respect to the complaint to Jones. Second, the Commonwealth limited Jones\u2019s testimony to subjects other than the complaint, and S.B.\u2019s testimony did not transform Jones into a second first complaint witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">This is not a case like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441 (2008), where the judge impermissibly admitted the testimony of two first complaint witnesses \u2014 the recipient of an initial complaint and the recipient of a subsequent complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 447-448. As discussed <em>supra, </em>the judge here properly admitted M.B.\u2019s testimony regarding the victim\u2019s complaint to him. S.B. testified to the circumstances and content of the complaint to Jones, but only after the defendant opened the door to that testimony on cross-examination by seeking to establish that Jones was the first person that the defendant told about the sexual abuse. Indeed, when the defendant began this line of questioning, the trial judge immediately noted that the defendant\u2019s questioning of S.B. would open the door to questioning by the prosecution regarding this complaint, and defense counsel confirmed that he wished to do so. There was no impropriety to S.B.\u2019s testimony given that the defendant had already broached the subject of the complaint to Jones. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass, at 299 (\u201c[Tjhis testimony was allowed not as first complaint testimony but in response to the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of [the witness]\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass, at 220-221, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>439 Mass. 441,456 (2003) (Sosman, J., concurring) (first complaint doctrine does not bar admission of independently admissible evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">b. <em>Other claims, </em>i. <em>Physical symptoms. </em>The defendant argues that the testimony of S.B. and of M.B. about S.B.\u2019s pain during urination and about the blood in her urine was not properly admitted. He argues first that the evidence was not relevant, and second that it was unduly prejudicial because it generated sympathy for the victim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to these statements at trial, and we review for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 563-564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cWhether proffered evidence is relevant and whether its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect are matters entrusted to the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion and are not disturbed absent palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGee, </em>467 Mass. 141, 156 (2014), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>465 Mass. 32, 48 (2013). S.B. testified to her physical symptoms, as well as to her contemporaneous report of the symptoms to her brother. M.B. testified to his observation of the symptoms, as well as to his sister\u2019s report of those symptoms to him. In particular, the testimony that these physical symptoms began after the purported sexual abuse began \u2014 and that it continued while the abuse was ongoing \u2014\u2022 was probative of the fact that the abuse actually occurred. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shan-ley, </em>455 Mass. 752, 758-759 (2010) (sexual abuse resulting in genital pain). The evidence was particularly probative given the defendant\u2019s attacks on the victim\u2019s credibility and his allegation that she fabricated the accusation of assault. Even if the evidence increased the jury\u2019s sympathy for the victim, that result does not render the evidence inadmissible given its probative value here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>441 Mass. 459, 467 (2004) (\u201cRelevant evidence is not rendered inadmissible by its potential to arouse feelings of sympathy in a jury. The evidence remains admissible if its probative value outweighs its potential for sympathy\u201d). The judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">ii. <em>Photographic evidence and appeals to sympathy. </em>The defendant claims that the admission of photographs of the victim and of her brother showing injuries that resulted from physical abuse by the Dales was unduly prejudicial. There was no abuse of discretion in the admission of either set of photographs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u201cThe admissibility of photographic evidence is left to the discretion of the trial judge .... [I]f the photographs possess evidential value on a material matter, they are not rendered inadmissible solely because they are gruesome or may have an inflammatory effect on the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tassinari, </em>466 Mass. 340, 349 (2013) (citations omitted). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 270 (1982) (\u201cIt is a rare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>instance in which the probative value of such evidence is so overwhelmed by its inflammatory potential that a reversal would be warranted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">This is not such a rare instance. The defendant\u2019s case at trial was based, in large part, on undermining the victim\u2019s credibility, in particular with regard to the question why she did not report the sexual abuse until several years after the abuse occurred. The photographs of <em>both </em>siblings corroborated the testimony that each gave of physical abuse at the hands of the Dales; this corroboration was particularly important given the defendant\u2019s attacks on <em>both </em>siblings\u2019 credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Qualls, </em>440 Mass. 576, 586 (2003) (photographs admissible to corroborate testimony). Establishing the extent and brutality of the physical abuse was, in turn, important for the Commonwealth in showing the fear in the household with respect to the Dales that could have led to a delayed report of the sexual abuse.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In addition to explaining the delay in reporting in general, the photographs corroborated the victim\u2019s explanation about how the initial incident of sexual abuse unfolded in particular. When the defendant first inappropriately touched S.B., removing her underwear, he said that he was just checking for scars, and she understood him to be checking her for injuries caused by a beating from Tina earlier that day.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The photographs helped explain both the way the pattern of abuse began and why the victim would have been hesitant to tell the Dales that the incident had unfolded as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s argument that the photographs of M.B.\u2019s injuries were not even relevant \u2014 before balancing the probative value against the prejudicial effect \u2014 the photographs helped explain why M.B. might not have told anyone about S.B.\u2019s revelation that Uncle Eddie had touched her inappropriately. The physical abuse that S.B. and M.B. experienced jointly also reinforced the Commonwealth\u2019s narrative that the siblings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>were close and that they shared private matters with each other \u2014 such as S.B.\u2019s report of sexual abuse \u2014 that they would not share with other family members. We conclude that it was not an abuse of discretion to admit the photographs showing both S.B.\u2019s and M.B.\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We similarly conclude that none of the other elements of the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial, in particular questioning S.B. and M.B. regarding physical abuse at the hands of the Dales and references to the abuse in the Commonwealth\u2019s opening statement and closing argument, constituted impermissible appeals to sympathy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The delay in reporting the abuse and the credibility of S.B. and of M.B. were central issues in the defendant\u2019s case at trial. As with the photographs, the references to the physical abuse helped to explain the victim\u2019s delay in reporting the sexual abuse and, to the extent M.B. was aware of the abuse, his failure to report it.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The jury acquitted the defendant on two indictments charging indecent assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, arising out of separate acts that pertained to the same victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b218-8\">S.B. and M.B. moved into the Dales\u2019 home when their mother was murdered when S.B. was ten months old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\">While the victim and M.B. were growing up, Tina and Fred physically abused them, using beatings to discipline them for breaking house rules. After such beatings, the defendant would comfort the victim and M.B., giving each of them a hug and \u201csayfing] how sorry he was.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The victim testified that at the time of the assault, when she was approximately seven or eight years old, she believed that the defendant was \u201cpeeing\u201d on her. After she had grown older and received sex education, she came to believe that he had ejaculated on her rather than urinated on her. The victim also testified that he had forced her to suck his nipple during the initial incident, as well as during the subsequent incidents. The jury acquitted the defendant of a charge of indecent assault and battery with respect to the victim sucking the defendant\u2019s nipple.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The victim testified in detail to three occasions on which an assault occurred. She also testified that \u201c[i]t would happen pretty much when he was in the house,\u201d referring to the times that the defendant slept in the house during the period that he maintained a room in the house.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b219-9\">It is unclear exactly when the defendant moved out of the house, but it was prior to May, 2003, when the victim and her brother themselves moved out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\">S.B. also testified that she told her brother about the burning sensation during urination and that she showed him her bloody urine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">S.B. continues to live with Jones as her foster child. M.B. moved out within one year of the placement with Jones and was placed in another foster home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Jones testified at trial. She did not testify to S.B.\u2019s report of sexual abuse by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The victim had previously told a police interviewer that he did not remember any conversation with the witness. <em>Commonwealth v. Wallace, supra </em>at 415. Because the victim later remembered having a conversation with the witness, <em>Wallace </em>is not identical to our case. We conclude that this is a distinction without a difference with respect to the question of admissibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the content of the report to M.B. qualified as a complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murungu, </em>450 Mass. 441, 446 (2008) (a report \u201cdoes not constitute a complaint, when, for example, the victim expresses to that person unhappiness, upset or other such feelings, but does not actually state that she has been sexually assaulted\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In <em>King, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court concluded that \u201c[t]he complainant <em>may </em>likewise testify to the details of the first complaint (i.e., what she told the first complaint witness), as well as why the complaint was made at that particular time\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 219. Notably, <em>King </em>did not require that the complainant herself testify as to the circumstances or the content of the complaint. First complaint testimony is only admissible to \u201cassist the jury in determining whether to credit the complainant\u2019s testimony about the alleged sexual assault.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>But that only requires that the complainant testify about the facts of the underlying assault, not that she testify to the complaint itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The Commonwealth moved in limine to present two first complaint witnesses, M.B. and Jones. The judge reserved ruling on the motion until trial. At trial, the Commonwealth did not attempt to present Jones as a first complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287 (2009), is inapposite. See <em>id. </em>at 296 (outlining circumstances justifying two first complaint witnesses).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">While the defendant refers to these statements as inadmissible hearsay in a heading in his brief, the substance of his argument is that the testimony should not have been admitted for reasons unrelated to the hearsay rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The defendant objected to the introduction of the photographs of M.B. but not to the introduction of the photographs of S.B. While we review the former for prejudicial error and the latter for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, the difference in these standards is of no moment since we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">We note also that S.B. knew that Tina was an employee of the Department of Social Services (DSS). S.B. may have feared that any report of the sexual abuse to DSS would be in turn reported to Tina, exacerbating an already difficult living situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\">By stating that he was checking for scars, the defendant contemporaneously linked the physical abuse to the pattern of sexual abuse and attempted to ally himself with the victim in opposition to the Dales. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The fact that this linkage stemmed from the defendant\u2019s own words further justifies both the admission of the photographs and the references of them in order to corroborate the history of physical abuse by the Dales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Even if it were error, there would be no prejudice associated with the admission of the photographs \u2014 let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. The photographs present the Dales in a worse light. But they cast no darker shadow on the defendant than that cast by the detailed testimony from S.B. \u2014 corroborated by M.B. \u2014 of the pattern of sexual abuse. While the photographs would likely have generated sympathy for S.B. in the absence of the other testimony, the victim is a highly sympathetic figure by virtue of the remainder of the evidence \u2014 even without the admission of the photographs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s statement, in her closing argument, that Tina pleaded guilty to beating the siblings was improper because it was not supported by evidence. But it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice given the strength of the over-all evidence supporting the guilty verdict, and given that the evidence showed that Tina was under investigation for physical abuse and that the siblings ceased to live with the Dales because of the allegations of abuse. Moreover, the defendant used the testimony with respect to the investigation to his own advantage in arguing that the victim had ample opportunity to report the sexual abuse during the investigation of physical abuse and that her failure to do so casts doubt on her testimony. We also note that the trial judge instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>465 Mass. 672, 680 (2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
