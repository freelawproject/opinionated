L. c. 265, \u00a7 17; home invasion, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 18C; and kidnapping, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26. On appeal, he argues that (1) the judge erred in not \u2014 sua sponte, and without a defense request \u2014 giving the five factors concerning eyewitness identifications set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>378 Mass. 296 (1979) <em>(Rodriguez); </em>(2) his trial attorney\u2019s failure to request such a full <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction constituted ineffective assistance; (3) the Commonwealth failed to produce a report concerning a photographic (photo) array from which an accomplice to the robbery identified the defendant, notwithstanding the Commonwealth\u2019s representation that no such report exists; (4) it was error for the prosecutor to use, without objection, the defendant\u2019s nickname \u201cRaw\u201d in examination of an accomplice witness who used that nickname to refer to the defendant and in closing when referring to that witness\u2019s testimony; and (5) it was improper to allow the accomplice witness to testify that, prior to the robbery, he had seen the defendant at a barbershop with a MAC-11 firearm and a sawed-off shotgun, even though defense counsel voiced no objection and had elected to inform the jury in his opening statement that no such weapons were found in a search of the barbershop. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The following is a summary of the trial evidence. On June 13, 2010, Gary Leger held one of his regular high stakes poker game at his apartment in North Andover. The game started between 8 and 10 p.m., with four to six card players, and later grew to ten players. Christopher \u201cShorty\u201d Maldonado arrived while the game was in progress. (As shall be seen in further disclosure of the facts, Shorty was an accomplice with the defendant in the planning, and actual robbery, of the poker game.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Around 2:21 a.m., two masked men, their faces mostly hidden by some combination of masks, bandanas, hoods, kerchiefs, ski masks, hats, or caps, came through the back door. One of the intruders, later identified as the defendant, held what Shorty later described to the police as a .380 caliber semiautomatic handgun. The defendant ordered the players around the table to place their cellular telephones (cell phones) and hands on the table, while the other masked man went around the table collecting cash and cell phones and tied up all the players\u2019 hands with zip ties. The second masked man also took $2,000 from the \u201cbank\u201d held by Leger. To make it appear that Shorty was also a victim in the robbery, Shorty\u2019s hands were bound with a zip tie, but the tie was left loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Shorty freed himself from his loosely tied zip tie while the robbery was in progress. At that point, Shorty stood up, took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>handgun from the defendant, and stated to all the card players present, \u201cYeah, it was me. I did it. I set it up.\u201d The robbery lasted approximately thirty to forty minutes. The defendant, Shorty, and the second masked man left via the backdoor.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">One player, Joel Marelis, testified at trial that he and another player, Daniel Perreras, were able to free themselves from their zip ties, looked out the window, and saw the robbers, including Shorty, get into a dark blue Mitsubishi with the license plate number 7777-MF or 777-MF. Both men got into Ferreras\u2019s vehicle and followed the robbers for a few minutes, but stopped when the Mitsubishi took the entrance ramp onto Route 495. Soon afterwards, the two men reported to a North Andover police officer that the vehicle used as the getaway car was a blue Mitsubishi Galant, license plate number 7777 MF.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">At 2:58 a.m., the police determined that the Mitsubishi was registered to a Milagros Fernandez, who was later identified as the defendant\u2019s girl friend. The day after the robbery, the defendant accompanied Fernandez to the North Andover police station. The two were driving a dark blue Mitsubishi, license plate number 7777-MF \u2014 matching the description of the getaway car. The pair requested to speak with Detective Daniel Cronin. Fernandez gave Detective Cronin her Massachusetts driver\u2019s license. The defendant, who referred to Fernandez as \u201chis girl,\u201d produced a business card from Prudential Real Estate with his photograph and name, Santiago Navarro, appearing thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">On June 14, 2010, Detective Cronin arranged a photo array that included Shorty. Nine out of the ten players identified Shorty as the inside man. Three days later, on June 17, Detective Cronin put together another array that included a photograph of the defendant. Only two players, Leger (the game organizer) and Marelis (one of the players who had followed the robbers in the Mitsubishi) were able to identify the defendant. Both men told the detective that their degree of certainty was eight out of ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">2. <em>The identification instructions. </em>On the fourth day of trial, the judge asked counsel to provide him with proposed jury instructions. Defense counsel did not do so. Notwithstanding the lack of such a request, the judge did give eyewitness instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The predicate instruction for all of the identification factors set forth in <em>Rodriguez </em>originates with a request thereof. \u201cFairness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>a defendant compels the trial judge to give an instruction on the</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>possibility of an honest but mistaken identification when the facts permit it and <em>when the defendant requests it\u201d </em>(emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caparrotta, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 476 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>465 Mass. 895, 912 (2013) <em>(\u201c[WJhere requested by the defendant, </em>a judge should provide specific guidance to the jury regarding the evaluation of such eyewitness testimony through some variation of the approved identification instruction\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>423 Mass. 99, 110 (1996) <em>(\u201c[0]n request, </em>specific instructions concerning eyewitness identification are often necessary . . . [and] in certain instances, on request, a jury should be instructed that a witness may have been [honestly] mistaken\u201d [emphasis added]). Hence, in the absence of any request for identification instructions, \u201cthere was no error by the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>457 Mass. 461, 475 (2010). In this case, we conclude that the eyewitness instructions given by the judge were adequate. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">In addition, viewing the full trial record, from all that appears, defense counsel did not render ineffective assistance, vis-a-vis, the identification defense. Defense counsel vigorously pressed the issue of identification, and that defense was squarely placed before the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel methodically cross-examined each eyewitness, relentlessly pressing their opportunities and capacities to accurately observe the faces of the masked intruders, taking each witness step by step through the entire ordeal, repeatedly eliciting testimony that only a narrow band of the defendant\u2019s face \u2014\u2022 from the bridge of his nose to his eyebrows \u2014 was visible, and that the players were scared and focusing on the gun rather than the man holding it. As a result of this insistent line of questioning, defense counsel was able to elicit inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>tencies in the witnesses\u2019 recollections, such as what the intruders were wearing, whether they wore gloves, and even the color of their clothing. Defense counsel also ensured the jury were aware that only two out of the ten players were able to identify the defendant, and that their degree of certainty was only eight out of ten. Defense counsel then expounded on the elicited inconsistencies and \u201cably targeted [the] infirmities in [the] identification[s]\u201d in his closing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willard, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 661 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Furthermore, in concluding that there was neither ineffective assistance of counsel, nor error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we bear in mind that the Commonwealth\u2019s identification evidence proving that the defendant was the gunman was strong. As noted, Shorty, an accomplice in the robbery, testified that the defendant was the gunman and that he and the defendant had planned and carried out the robbery together. Significantly, Shorty\u2019s testimony was corroborated by telephone records. The Commonwealth introduced telephone records that showed that from June 7 to June 14, 2010, a few days before and the night of the robbery, fifty-eight calls were made or attempted between Shorty and the cell phone number he identified as the defendant\u2019s. Eleven of the telephone calls occurred between midnight and 2:21 a.m. on the night of the robbery. Shorty and the defendant also exchanged twenty-one text messages between midnight and 2:09 a.m. on the night of the robbery. In addition, Shorty\u2019s testimony that the telephone number was that of the defendant was corroborated by the record\u2019s showing that fifty-nine calls or attempted calls and seventy-nine text messages were made between that number and the cell phone number of Fernandez, the defendant\u2019s \u201cgirl.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Further corroborating, and bolstering, the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of identification was the license plate number, 7777-MF, reported by the two card players as being the license plate number on the getaway car, a blue Mitsubishi Galant registered to Fernandez. Lastly, the day after the robbery, the defendant and Fernandez, in tandem, went to the police station to speak with Detective Cronin in that very same car.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>3. <em>The photo array report. </em>At trial, Shorty made an in-court identification of the defendant. Shorty testified at trial that he \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d he had viewed a photo array and thought he had \u201cpick[ed] someone out,\u201d but he could not remember signing his name or putting a date on any photograph. Detective Cronin later testified that he thought Shorty had selected the defendant\u2019s picture from a photo array. At a sidebar conference, defense counsel stated that he had not received a report of this identification. The prosecutor indicated that he thought the report existed, but that he would \u201chave to go back and look at everything.\u201d The judge said he would give an instruction to strike the testimony, if a report existed and had not been disclosed. No report was produced, and defense counsel took no further action. The Commonwealth has represented on appeal that, after a diligent search, no such report of a photo array displayed to Shorty exists.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">4. <em>The defendant\u2019s nickname. </em>The defendant next claims, for the first time on appeal, that the prosecutor\u2019s unobjected-to use of his nickname, \u201cRaw,\u201d during Shorty\u2019s examination and in closing argument was error and caused a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. That is not persuasive. Shorty testified only that he knew the defendant by his nickname \u201cRaw.\u201d Thus, the nickname was material to identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>460 Mass. 728, 754 (2011), cert, denied, 132 S. Ct. 2693 (2012), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>458 Mass. 684, 697-698 (2011) (\u201c[A] prosecutor may refer to, or ask witnesses about, a defendant\u2019s nickname . . . when there is a reason to do so\u201d). Further, the use of the nickname \u201cRaw\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was consistent with Shorty\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">5. <em>Reference to the barbershop firearms. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>bad acts. The motion in limine was limited to prior criminal charges or criminal conduct. At the motion in limine hearing, prior to trial, the prosecutor indicated that he did not intend to introduce any bad acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">At trial, during his opening statement, defense counsel, previewing a future challenge to Shorty\u2019s truthfulness, referred to a MAC-11 and a sawed-off shotgun (neither of which was the gun used in the robbery). Defense counsel disclosed to the jury that Shorty had told the police that he had seen those guns at the defendant\u2019s barbershop prior to the robbery,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but no such guns, contrary to Shorty\u2019s story, were found in a search conducted at the barbershop. Given this revelation in the defendant\u2019s opening, near the end of Shorty\u2019s direct examination (before asking any questions about the guns) the prosecutor, at a sidebar conference, requested clarification from the judge concerning whether the defendant\u2019s pretrial motion in limine was intended to include as prior bad acts reference to the MAC-11 and the sawed-off shotgun. The judge noted that it was defense counsel who had referenced the MAC-11 and the sawed-off shotgun in his opening statement and, in effect, had opened the door allowing the prosecutor to ask about those guns. Indeed the judge had specifically stated to defense counsel, \u201cI assume that you wouldn\u2019t object to him asking questions about that.\u201d Defense counsel responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Thereafter, as Shorty\u2019s testimony resumed, Shorty testified that, prior to the robbery, he had seen the defendant at the barbershop with a MAC-11 and a sawed-off shotgun. There was no objection or motion to strike following that testimony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>The defendant now claims that Shorty\u2019s testimony concerning those guns was improperly admitted. There was no error. That line of inquiry was opened up by the defendant\u2019s opening statement. Further, the testimony was admissible to rebut the argument by defense counsel that because such firearms were not found in a police search of the barbershop, Shorty was a liar. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>453 Mass. 331, 342 (2009) (citation omitted) (\u201cRebuttal is legitimate when it responds to the opponent\u2019s case\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anestal, </em>463 Mass. 655, 665 (2012) (prior bad act evidence \u201cadmissible if it \u2018rebut[s] the defendant\u2019s contentions\u2019 made in the course of trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-10\">In his jury charge the judge first highlighted identification as a central contested issue, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>\u201cNow, one of the most important issues in this case is the identification of the defendant as the alleged perpetrator of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The judge then instructed the jury on the potential for honest good-faith mistaken identifications as set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pressley, </em>390 Mass. 617, 620 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u201cNow, in additionf,] in deciding whether or not to believe a witness who identifies the defendant as the perpetrator, remember that you must consider not only whether the witness is trying to tell the truth or is lying, you must also consider whether that witness\u2019s testimony is accurate or instead is an honest mistake. Sometimes people perceive an event erroneously or forget things or become confused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">\u201cIn deciding whether a witness is trying to be truthful is only the first step. You must then go on to decide whether the witness\u2019s testimony on this issue is accurate in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Next, the judge emphasized that the identification burden of proof rests with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-10\">\u201cNow, I once again emphasize that the burden of proof that\u2019s on the prosecutor extends to every element of the crimes charged, and this specifically includes the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crimes for which he stands charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-11\">\u201cIf, after examining the testimony, you have a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the identification, you must find the defendant not guilty. In deciding whether or not to believe a witness who identifies the defendant as the perpetrator, remember that you must not only consider whether the witness is trying to tell you the truth or is lying, you must also decide whether that witness\u2019s identification is accurate or instead may well have been an honest good-faith identification that nonetheless may have been mistaken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">The essence of the above identification instruction, in accord with <em>Pressley, </em>emphasized the potential for honest good-faith mistaken identifications and that the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof extended to proving identification beyond a reasonable doubt. These considerations are very close to the factors set forth in <em>Rodriguez. </em>Indeed, as the Supreme Judicial Court has noted, the identification instruction approved in <em>Pressley </em>\u201csimply identifies more specifically what is intended by the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pires, </em>453 Mass. 66, 71 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">In his credibility instructions, the judge essentially told the jurors to ponder whether the witnesses had the opportunity to see the events and then accurately describe them.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-14\">\u201cDid the witness appear to know what the witness was talking about, what was the opportunity or lack of opportunity that the witness had to see and learn the facts about which he or she was testifying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u201cWhat was the ability of the witness to understand, to recall and to accurately describe those things that a witness was testifying to?\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Defense counsel\u2019s decision not to request the <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction may have been tactical. First, defense counsel may have strategically decided that a <em>Rodriguez </em>instruction would have been counterproductive in that it emphasizes the time within which a perpetrator is seen, that is, <em>Rodriguez </em>instructs jurors to focus on the eyewitness\u2019s \u201ccapacity and opportunity to observe the suspect\u201d and the \u201clength of time before identification! ]\u2022\u201d Here, Shorty clearly spent a lot of time with the defendant. Furthermore, the robbery transpired over thirty minutes during which the two card players observed the robbers, and the identifications were made by the two card players within three days of the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">\u201c[I]f an omission of counsel does not present a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice . . . , there is no basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under either the Federal or the State Constitution.\u201d <em>Willard, supra </em>at 660, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 625 n.4 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Recently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crayton, </em>470 Mass. 228, 241 (2014), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>470 Mass. 255, 265 (2014), the Supreme Judicial Court announced new rules, to be applied prospectively, requiring that, where an eyewitness who was present during the commission of a crime has not participated in a prior, out-of-court identification or has made something less than an unequivocal positive identification of the defendant during a nonsuggestive identification procedure before trial, an in-court showup identification by the witness will be admissible in evidence only where there is \u201cgood reason\u201d for its admission. We do not address whether these new rules apply to the instant case, as the defendant\u2019s trial commenced prior to the release of those decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">The defendant also claimed similar error when Detective Cronin used the nickname \u201cRaw\u201d in his testimony.
