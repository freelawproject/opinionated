See <em>J.W. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. 340 (2013). Amotion for rehearing was allowed, and that opinion was withdrawn pursuant to an order of this court.

L. c. 123B, \u00a73.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>J.W. is a profoundly mentally disabled, visually impaired, and nonverbal individual. He has little or no concept of personal safety, and therefore, while he can walk independently, he cannot negotiate stairs alone. He has been a resident at the Fernald Developmental Center (FDC or Fernald) for nearly his entire life. The FDC is in the process of closing, however, and the policy decision to transfer its residents, all intellectually disabled individuals, to other appropriate care facilities is no longer subject to review by the Federal courts and would require a change in State law to prevent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">In a comprehensive and balanced decision, an administrative magistrate of the DALA approved the plan proposed by the DDS to transfer J.W. from his residence at Malone Park 23 at the FDC to Heffron Hall A, apartment 4, at the Wrentham Developmental Center (WDC). See G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">A judge of the Superior Court, on review, concluded that \u201c[i]f one accepts the Magistrate\u2019s legal rulings \u2014 essentially limiting inquiry to a choice between Fernald and Heffron Hall \u2014 then there is no lack of substantial evidence for the Decision. Nor (on the same assumption) does the Court find any error in \u2018the logic of the analysis that the hearing officer articulated in [his] decision.\u2019 <em>Coveil </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>439 Mass. 766, 782 (2003).\u201d Despite that, the judge concluded that the magistrate erred in his legal ruling by limiting his consideration of J.W.\u2019s best interest to either the existing placement at Fernald or the single alternative proposed by the DDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>On the basis of this legal error, the judge ordered DALA\u2019s decision vacated and remanded the matter to DALA for further proceedings. This appeal followed. Although we agree with the judge\u2019s conclusion that substantial evidence supported DALA\u2019s decision, we disagree with his statutory construction. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case for entry of a judgment affirming DALA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>This appeal is based upon an issue of statutory interpretation; therefore we set out the terms of the governing transfer statute, G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in some detail. The transfer statute provides a specific process that must be followed by DDS in every case where it seeks to transfer an intellectually disabled individual \u201cfrom one residential facility for the intellectually disabled to another.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, first par. The first paragraph of the section establishes DOS\u2019s general duties to consult with the permanent guardian (or nearest relative) of the individual and to give notice \u201cat least forty-five days prior to the proposed transfer.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The second paragraph governs notice, and the section requires DDS to request the consent of the guardians \u201cprior to the transfer .. . from one residential facility for persons with an intellectually disability to another.\u201d G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, second par. The consent must be requested in writing by registered mail \u201cat least forty-five days prior to the proposed transfer.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>DDS must include certain specific information in the written notice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>request for consent to the proposed transfer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The third paragraph of the section governs the adjudicative process in cases, such as this one, where the guardians timely object to the proposed transfer. The statute authorizes a magistrate to conduct a hearing at the request of DDS in order to determine \u201cwhether the transfer should proceed.\u201d G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, third par. DDS has the burden of a proof at the hearing. <em>Ibid. </em>Within thirty days of that hearing, the hearing officer is required, pursuant to the statute, to issue a written decision determining <em>\u201cwhich placement </em>meets the best interest of the ward giving due consideration to the objections to the placement made by the relative or permanent guardian\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">In this case, the judge read the phrase \u201cwhich placement meets the best interest of the ward\u201d to necessarily refer to multiple alternatives, \u201cespecially if it takes an alternative placement to \u2018meet the best interest of the ward.\u2019 \u201d On that basis, the judge ruled that faced with two flawed choices, DALA should have allowed consideration of additional alternative placements or ordered DDS to consider them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree with this interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">We begin, as always, with the text of the statute. See <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, </em>457 Mass. 620, 628 (2010). While the adjective \u201cwhich\u201d could refer to any number of a group of alternative placements, the judge\u2019s adoption of that meaning here improperly ignores, in contravention of fundamental tenets of statutory construction, the plain and unambiguous antecedent language.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>434 Mass. 754, 759-760 (2001); <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 601 (2010). In particular, this interpretation is inconsistent with the process articulated in the second paragraph requiring (1) DDS to propose and to give notice of one alternative placement and (2) guardians opposed to that proposed transfer to object to that placement in writing. The multiple alternatives interpretation is also undercut by the jurisdictional grant limiting DALA to determining \u201cwhether <em>the transfer </em>should proceed\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, third par. Given the Legislature\u2019s consistent use of the singular throughout the statute, \u201ctransfer\u201d can only be understood to refer to the one residential placement proposed by DDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The judge\u2019s interpretation also conflicts with the statutory standard as construed by this court to require a comparison of the proposed placement with the existing placement. See <em>Molly A. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Mental Retardation, </em>69 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Ct. 267, 277-279 &amp; n.18 (2007); <em>G.R. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. 791, 797 (2014) (\u201cIn undertaking this analysis, the magistrate properly compared the proposed services at WDC to the existing services at FDC at the time of the hearing. . . .\u201d); <em>M.M. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>84 Mass. App. Ct. 809, 814 (2014) (\u201cAs required by the statutory standard, the magistrate compared the offerings of the two facilities and weighed the benefits of the transfer against the disadvantages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Read properly as a whole, the transfer statute requires DALA to determine which of the two placements referred to in the second paragraph (current or proposed residential facility) meets the best interest of the intellectually disabled individual. If DALA concludes that DDS failed to prove that the proposed residential placement will meet the individual\u2019s best interest by providing improved services and quality of life, DALA must disapprove the transfer, thereupon ending the formal statutory transfer hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In that case, the intellectually disabled individual will continue to reside at the existing facility, and DDS would have to provide a new forty-five day notice prior to beginning any new proposed transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">We agree with DDS that the planning stage of the transfer process is the most appropriate time to consider multiple alternative placements. See <em>M.D. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 463, 476-477 (2013). Indeed, the guardians did not \u201cdisagree with the notion that alternatives should be considered during the planning process and not at or after the ITP/ISP modification meeting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Ideally, placement planning is intended to be a cooperative, collaborative process between the guardians and DDS. The transfer statute anticipates that by the time the parties arrive at an impasse requiring litigation, DDS will have already identified and offered a number of appropriate placement options. In fact, here the record established that during the planning phase of the placement process, DDS offered the guardians the opportunity to provide input and proposed multiple alternative placements to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>guardians, including placements at WDC where openings existed at the time.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We have considered the guardians\u2019 other claims of error allegedly tainting DALA\u2019s decision and find them foreclosed by <em>M.D. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., supra, </em>unsupported by the evidence or facts of record,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> nonprejudicial, or otherwise lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The judge\u2019s interpretation of the transfer statute was legally erroneous. We vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for the entry of a new judgment affirming the transfer decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b404-17\">The Superior Court judgment also remanded the case to DALA for further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>proceedings. \u201cAn order of remand, by its nature, is generally not final, particularly when the operative verb in the order has been \u2018reconsider.\u2019 \u201d <em>Federman </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Marblehead, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 727, 729 (1994). However,</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u201c[i]f an order of remand allows the administrative tribunal no leeway, the order takes on the character of finality, and an appeal is in order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730. Here, the Superior Court decision does allow DALA leeway in the ultimate disposition of the case. However, the Superior Court has mandated that DALA consider various alternative placements for J.W. based upon a novel interpretation of the statutory requirements for implementing a transfer under G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3. This interpretation was dispositive in the Superior Court decision. In these circumstances, we will address the issue of law concerning statutory interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\"><em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Patrick, </em>544 F.3d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 2008), cert, denied, 556 U.S. 1166 (2009) (disengagement order did not guarantee to class members a particular residential placement, nor must the FDC be maintained by the DDS so long as any resident wishes to remain there).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">At the time DDS proposed this transfer of J.W., the prior version of the statute was in effect. As a result, that version of the statute (G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, as amended by St. 1987, c. 465, \u00a7 28) controls in this case. However, since the 2010 act (St. 2010, c. 239) eliminated the words \u201cmental retardation\u201d from the General Laws and replaced them with \u201cintellectual disability,\u201d and did not otherwise amend the statute, we cite to the current statute. See St. 2010, c. 239, \u00a7\u00a7 46-48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\">Pursuant to DDS regulations, the formal transfer process begins at the agency level. DDS initiates that process by requesting the modification of the intellectually disabled individual\u2019s individual support plan (ISP) to reflect the proposed change of residence. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.25(2)(e) (2009). DDS subsequently convenes the mandatory individual transition plan (ITP)/ISP modification meeting typically involving, among others, representatives from the ISP and ITP teams at the current residential facility, their counterparts from the potential receiving facility, and the guardians. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.25(3)-(4) (2009). Once the area or facility director or his or her designee approves the recommended modification, the requested modification becomes final. See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.25(7) (2009). At that point, DDS invokes the transfer statute, seeking the guardians\u2019 consent to the proposed transfer pursuant to G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, second par.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Pursuant to the statute, the notice of the proposed transfer must include \u201ca statement of how <em>the proposed residential transfer from the current facility </em>to the proposed residential facility will result in improved services and quality of life\u201d for the intellectually disabled individual; specify the location of <em>the proposed facility, </em>include a statement that the guardian may examine <em>the proposed facility </em>and a statement of the legal rights of the guardian under the statute (emphasis added). See G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3. The regulations further provide that the transfer notice shall \u201cspecifically invite the parties to consult with the service coordinator or other designated staff regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed transfer.\u201d See 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 6.63(2)(c) (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">DDS is also prohibited from acting upon the proposed transfer during the pendency of the hearing; the statute provides twenty days for an appeal to the Superior Court. G. L. c. 123B, \u00a7 3, third par.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">The judge suggested several procedures that could be implemented by DALA to meet its purported statutory duty: (1) requiring DDS to submit first and second tier alternatives; (2) implementation of a phased hearing to allow the parties to address the question of alternatives after the magistrate\u2019s review of DOS\u2019s original rationale; and (3) conditionally rejecting the proposed WDC transfer pending exploration of alternatives. None of these procedures appears in or is implied from the language of the transfer statute. See <em>Serrazinas </em>v. <em>Springfield Pub. Schs., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 617,623 (2011), <em>S.C., </em>464 Mass. 1011 (2013), quoting from <em>Carmel Credit Union </em>v. <em>Bondeson, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 (2002) (\u201cwe interpret a statute according to its plain words and will \u2018not add words to a statute that the Legislature did not put there\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In ten recent cases concerning transfers from Fernald that were appealed to the Superior Court, the judges limited their review of DALA\u2019s best interest analysis to a comparison of the current FDC residence with the single residential placement proposed by DDS. Nine of these Superior Court decisions were affirmed by this court. See <em>M.D. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 463, <em>All </em>(2013); <em>T.K. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Sens., </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 1121 (2013); <em>C.T. </em>v. <em>Department of Developmental Servs., </em>84 Mass.
