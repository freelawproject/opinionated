(Google), alleging intentional interference with Skyhook\u2019s contract with Motorola, intentional interference with Skyhook\u2019s advantageous business relations with both Motorola and Samsung, and violations of G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judge of the Superior Court granted Google\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">1. <em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Consistent with summary judgment standards, the facts upon which we rely are either undisputed or taken in the light most favorable to Skyhook. See <em>Drakopoulos </em>v. <em>U.S. Bank Natl. Assn., </em>465 Mass. 775, 777 (2013).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">This case arises from the aborted plans of Motorola and Samsung, manufacturers of mobile electronic devices (including so-called \u201csmart phones\u201d), to license and install Skyhook\u2019s software product, XPS, to provide location services on their \u201cAndroid\u201d mobile devices (described below). Location services identify where the mobile device is physically positioned. Alone and in conjunction with other software applications, they allow the device user to find his or her location, to identify the location of nearby facilities, and to receive marketing information about commercial establishments in the vicinity. Location systems also collect location data from the device and return that data to the software provider for inclusion in its location database. The data then can be used to improve the accuracy of location results, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>well as for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Android is a mobile device operating system developed and maintained by Google. It is an \u201copen source\u201d operating system, meaning that it is publicly available and can be used without charge; however, Google owns and controls the use of the Android tradem\u00e1rk and related trademarks, as well as the use of a group of proprietary mobile services applications known as Google Mobile Services (GMS) Apps. Google requires, by contract, that devices marketed under Android trademarks and including GMS Apps meet Google\u2019s compatibility standards, which are set out in detail in the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) published by Google.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">In addition to a number of well-known software applications (e.g., Gmail, Google Maps, Google Search, and YouTube), GMS Apps include an application known as Network Location Provider (NLP), which helps to supply Google\u2019s location services to mobile devices. In part, NLP works in conjunction with two application programming interfaces (APIs) that are part of the Android operating system:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the GPS Provider API, which determines a device\u2019s location using the United States government\u2019s Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites; and the Network Provider API, which determines location based both on triangulation from nearby cellular communications towers (cell towers) and on the device\u2019s detection of local wireless network access points (\u201cWi-Fi\u201d networks).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Google\u2019s Software Development</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Kit (SDK), which assists third-party developers in creating new applications for use on any Android-compatible device, specifically informs developers which kinds of data are used by the GPS Provider API (satellite) and Network Provider API (cell tower and Wi-Fi) to fix location. The SDK is incorporated in the CDD by reference, and plays a role in determining whether Google\u2019s compatibility standards are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Like Google\u2019s NLP, Skyhook\u2019s XPS also determines the location of a mobile device by collecting information from GPS satellites, cell towers, and Wi-Fi networks. However, XPS operates by integrating the location data received from these three different sources. Through this approach, XPS achieves greater speed in reporting a location result. Another difference between the Google and Skyhook systems is that, unlike Skyhook\u2019s XPS, Google\u2019s NLP includes \u201creverse geocoding\u201d functionality, which converts longitude and latitude coordinates to street addresses and place names.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In supplying location services software to mobile device manufacturers, both Google and Skyhook expect and require that they will be able to collect location information from the mobile devices on which the software is installed. Thus, when enabled on an Android device and subject to the user\u2019s consent, NLP collects \u201cnetwork data\u201d for Google, i.e., information about nearby Wi-Fi networks and cell towers. XPS likewise collects such information for Skyhook. Both companies consider this retrieval of network data, and the accuracy of the data, to be essential to the location databases they maintain as part of their business models.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In April and June of 2009, respectively, Samsung and Motorola <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>entered into contracts with Google allowing them to use the Android trademarks and to preload specified GMS Apps, including NLP,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on their mobile devices. The contracts did not specify that Google would be the exclusive provider of location services software for the manufacturers\u2019 Android devices. However, the contracts did require the devices to meet Google\u2019s Android compatibility standards,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and also required the manufacturers to \u201caccurately reproduce\u201d the GMS Apps on the devices. Under the contracts, the ultimate distribution of the devices was subject to Google\u2019s prior written approval.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Thereafter, unbeknownst to Google, both Motorola and Samsung entered into contracts with Skyhook. In September, 2009, Motorola entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with Skyhook by which Motorola agreed to preload XPS on its Android devices, subject to an exception for devices \u201cwhere Motorola is contractually prohibited by a qualified third party.\u201d The contract defined \u201cqualified third party\u201d to include \u201ca certi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>lying entity which has the right to define and approve the technical specifications required to be a[n] Android-compliant device and which has declared the Embedded Software to be non-compliant.\u201d The Motorola-Skyhook contract also provided that Motorola would not authorize or enable any other party to use XPS or Motorola\u2019s devices to collect location data. Subsequently, in May, 2010, Samsung also entered into a licensing agreement with Skyhook, but on a different basis. Pursuant to its contract with Skyhook, Samsung agreed to pay a guaranteed minimum for the right to install XPS on its Android mobile devices. However, Samsung was not obligated to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">After the execution of the Motorola-Skyhook contract, there was considerable discussion within and between these two companies as to whether XPS was Android-compatible. This discussion was prompted by the fact that XPS was configured to report \u201chybrid\u201d location data \u2014 information derived not only from GPS satellites, but from the network data obtained using cell towers and Wi-Fi networks \u2014 through Google\u2019s GPS Provider API, which was described in Google\u2019s SDK as delivering satellite data alone. Both companies pondered whether XPS would violate Android compliance by giving the incorrect impression that the reported location results came from GPS satellite sources and met the high level of accuracy that users and independent application developers expected from satellite data.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Google remained unaware of Motorola\u2019s contract with Skyhook until April 26, 2010, when, without Motorola\u2019s contractually required approval, Skyhook released a press briefing entitled \u201cMotorola to replace Google with Skyhook,\u201d and stating in part that \u201cMotorola is the first Android device maker to abandon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Google for its location services.\u201d Google employees immediately began to discuss this development and its implications, including the risk that other device manufacturers would switch to Skyhook and Google would suffer a loss in the \u201cability to continue collecting data to maintain and improve [its] location database.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Soon thereafter, on May 7, 2010, representatives of Google and Motorola met to discuss Motorola\u2019s use of XPS to provide location services. At this meeting, Google employees raised the same hybrid location reporting issue that Motorola and Skyhook had been discussing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> A few weeks later, Google informed Motorola that, due to this reporting issue, Motorola\u2019s implementation of XPS would fail to meet Android compatibility requirements. Nevertheless, Google emphasized that if Motorola could implement Skyhook in a way that resolved the reporting issue, then \u201cby all means let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">At the same May 7 meeting, Google identified another issue with XPS \u2014 its inability to convert longitude and latitude coordinates to street addresses and place names. Motorola could not effectively market its devices without this reverse geocoding function, and, as the issue developed over the next few weeks, it became apparent that Motorola also would need to rely on Google\u2019s competing product, NLP, in order to provide for reverse geocoding. Skyhook acknowledged that Motorola\u2019s use of NLP was the only available option, but would agree to its use only if Motorola altered NLP to block its collection of competitive location data for Google.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Motorola and Skyhook began communicating with each other about both the hybrid location reporting issue and the data collection issue. On May 28, 2010, with these issues still unresolved, Google instructed Motorola not to ship its devices with XPS. Motorola complied and removed XPS from devices being prepared for shipment in July. A few days later, on June 4, Skyhook submitted to Motorola revised software that was intended to fix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>the hybrid location reporting issue. Subsequently, Google made it clear to Motorola that it was free to include XPS, as long as the revised software did not deviate from Google\u2019s compatibility standards by returning non-satellite data through the GPS Provider API.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The data collection issue remained an active concern, however. Google remained steadfast that, under its contract with Motorola, Motorola was required to include the applications it licensed from Google (including NLP and other applications that collected location data) in their entirety \u2014 and without neutering their data collection function. Skyhook, for its part, insisted that its contract with Motorola gave it the right to block Google from collecting location data on Motorola devices, and that the data collection function on Google applications would have to be disabled. Faced with these conflicting demands, Motorola eventually notified Skyhook that it was terminating their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">As for Samsung, in March, 2010, and entirely independent of any input from Google, Samsung began to express concerns to Skyhook about the cost of XPS. Several months later, in June, 2010, Google first discovered that Samsung had contracted with Skyhook and that Samsung already had begun shipping some devices containing XPS. Google informed Samsung of the same hybrid location reporting issue it had raised with Motorola, stating that it \u201ccannot approve the current implementation as-is.\u201d On July 10, Samsung notified Skyhook that it was not going to use XPS because \u201cGoogle Locator Was good enough in [the United States] region and [the] financial burden from Skyhook was another reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">On September 15, 2010, Skyhook filed the present action, claiming that Google had, with improper motive or means, intentionally interfered with its contract with Motorola and with its advantageous business relations with both Motorola and Samsung, and that those acts constituted violations of G. L. c. 93A. Google moved for summary judgment, and the judge ruled in its favor. On the interference claims, the judge reasoned that the evidence did not support a finding of improper motive or means. On the c. 93A claim, the judge ruled that no reasonable jury could conclude that the conduct at issue occurred \u201cprimarily and substantially in Massachusetts\u201d as required by c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review the grant of summary judgment de nova to determine \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Go-Best Assets Ltd. </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank of Mass., </em>463 Mass. 50, 54 (2012), quoting from <em>Juliano </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>461 Mass. 527,529-530 (2012). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002); <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 711-712 (1991). While our review is de nova, we have the benefit of the motion judge\u2019s thorough and thoughtful decision. After independently considering the record and the applicable law, we reach the same conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">b. <em>Interference claims. </em>To establish a claim of intentional interference with contractual relations, the plaintiff must prove that (1) the plaintiff had a contract with a third party; (2) the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s actions. <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 812-817 (1990). Similarly, to establish a claim for interference with advantageous business relations, the plaintiff must prove that \u201c(1) [the plaintiff] had an advantageous relationship with a third party (e.g., a present or prospective contract or employment relationship); (2) the defendant knowingly induced a breaking of the relationship; (3) the defendant\u2019s interference with the relationship, in addition to being intentional, was improper in motive or means; and (4) the plaintiff was harmed by the defendant\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Blackstone </em>v. <em>Cashman, </em>448 Mass. 255, 260 (2007). It is undisputed that Skyhook has established the first two elements of each claim. As to file third element, although Google does not concede that its actions constituted interference, we need not confront that issue because, like the motion judge, we conclude that Skyhook\u2019s claims founder because Skyhook cannot demonstrate on this record that any interference by Google was improper in either motive or means. We therefore need not reach the fourth element, harm to Skyhook.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In essence, Skyhook\u2019s arguments are as follows. As to motive, Skyhook takes the position that a jury should be allowed to decide whether Google\u2019s concerns about hybrid location reporting and data collection were a pretext for its true motive, which, according to Skyhook, was to \u201cbully Skyhook out of the market.\u201d As to means, Skyhook takes the position that Google unfairly interpreted its contracts with Motorola and Samsung in order to pressure them to abandon their deals with Skyhook. Neither point has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>i. <em>Google\u2019s contractual rights. </em>We begin with a question of law \u2014 the interpretation of Google\u2019s contracts with Motorola and Samsung. Contrary to Skyhook\u2019s position, those contracts plainly gave Google the right to hold the manufacturers to requirements pertaining to compatibility and functionality.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> With respect to the hybrid location reporting issue, the compatibility standards to which both manufacturers were bound required that, as described in the CDD, \u201c[djevice implementations MUST NOT omit any managed APIs, alter API interfaces or signatures, [or] deviate from the documented behavior.\u201d In addition, the SDK, which was incorporated into the compatibility standards, informed third-party software developers as to the documented API behavior: that the GPS Provider API determined location using GPS satellites, while the Network Provider API did so based upon network data. Because the manner in which XPS reported hybrid location data through the GPS Provider API was in violation of those standards, Google had the contractual right to stop distribution of devices containing XPS as it originally was designed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">With respect to the data collection issue, in order to ship their devices with the Android trademark and Google\u2019s proprietary GMS Apps, the manufacturers were contractually obliged to leave the GMS Apps fully functional. When Skyhook conditioned Motorola\u2019s use of the revised version of XPS on Motorola\u2019s removal of NLP\u2019s data collection function, Google was entitled,</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>under its contract with Motorola, to insist upon the \u201caccurate reproduction\u201d of Google applications, including NLP.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">ii. <em>Motive. </em>We next consider whether, on this record, it reasonably could be found that Google\u2019s assertion of its contractual rights was but a smokescreen for its desire to shut Skyhook out of the Android market. We conclude that no such finding would be warranted. The legitimacy of the reporting issue is illustrated by the fact that long before Google even knew that Motorola was going to use XPS, the same problem had been recognized and debated by engineers at both Skyhook and Motorola. Furthermore, Google never categorically prohibited Motorola\u2019s use of XPS. Google informed Motorola that it had no objection to Motorola\u2019s installation of XPS if it could be installed in a compatible way, and, after June 4, 2010, when Skyhook submitted revised software, Google never instructed Motorola not to use the revised XPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Likewise, the legitimacy of the data collection issue cannot reasonably be questioned. Skyhook, no less than Google, considered the collection of network location data to be essential for operational and business reasons. If anything, Skyhook\u2019s criticism of Google\u2019s position on data collection seems disingenuous. Unlike Google, Skyhook insisted upon being the <em>exclusive </em>recipient of location data. Skyhook also attempted to convince Motorola to disable the data reporting functions on GMS Apps, despite Motorola\u2019s valid concerns about its contractual obligations to Google.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">Although the record substantiates that, upon learning of the Motorola-Skyhook contract, Google was concerned about losing customers for its own location services and the ensuing harm to its valuable location database, advancing one\u2019s own economic interest, by itself, is not an improper motive. <em>Pembroke Country Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Regency Sav. Bank, F.S.B., </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 39 (2004), citing <em>Hunneman Real Estate Corp. </em>v. <em>Norwood Realty, Inc., </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 416,428-429 (2002). Even if, as Skyhook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>insists, its location services were superior to Google\u2019s, it was not improper for Google to be motivated, in part, by competition. Although Skyhook maintains that competitive motivation can be proper only if it will advance better products and services in the marketplace, here the only parties equipped to decide which product was better for their needs at that time and under <em>all </em>relevant circumstances were Motorola and Samsung.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">iii. <em>Means. </em>\u201cThe assertion by a party of its legal rights is not \u2018improper means\u2019 for purposes of a tortious interference claim.\u201d <em>Pembroke Country Club, Inc., supra </em>at 40. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 773 (1979).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As previously discussed, Google had the contractual right to stop shipments of Motorola and Samsung devices unless and until the reporting issue was resolved. Its exercise of that right did not constitute improper means. By the same token, Google had the contractual right to insist that its proprietary applications, including their location data collecting functions, would remain intact. Any economic pressure felt by the manufacturers was simply a product of their preexisting contractual arrangements with Google and their desire to continue marketing their devices under the Android trademarks and with proprietary Google applications. There is no evidence that Google used threats, misrepresented any facts, or used any other improper means.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">b. <em>Violation ofG. L. c. 93A. </em>Under c. 93A, \u00a7 11, it is Google\u2019s burden to demonstrate that \u201cthe center of gravity of the circumstances that [gave] rise to the claim\u201d was not \u201cprimarily and substantially within the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Kuwaiti Danish Computer Co. </em>v. <em>Digital Equip. Corp., </em>438 Mass. 459, 470, 473 (2003). Looking only to the allegedly unscrupulous conduct, factors to examine include, but are not be limited to, the place of conduct, and the \u201csitus of loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472 n.13, 474-475. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>agree with the motion judge that Google has established, as matter of law, that c. 93A does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">At the relevant time, Google\u2019s headquarters was in California, Motorola\u2019s headquarters was in Illinois, and Samsung\u2019s headquarters was in South Korea. All of Google\u2019s allegedly unfair or deceptive acts, including its communications, both physical and electronic, occurred outside the Commonwealth. Although Massachusetts would be the situs of any royalty revenue lost to Skyhook from the sale to Massachusetts consumers of XPS-enabled Motorola and Samsung Android devices, that factor alone does not suffice to bring this dispute within the ambit of c. 93A, particularly in light of the global marketplace for such devices. Compare <em>Yankee Candle Co. </em>v. <em>Bridgewater Candle Co., </em>107 F. Supp. 2d 82, 88 (D. Mass. 2000) (although plaintiff\u2019s headquarters was in Massachusetts, \u00a7 11 requirement not satisfied because alleged deception was \u201cconceived and concocted outside Massachusetts\u201d and was directed at plaintiff\u2019s customers, who were \u201coverwhelmingly . . . persons and entities outside the Commonwealth\u201d), aff\u2019d, 259 F.3d 25, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">On this record, Skyhook\u2019s physical location in Massachusetts was of minimal import. For this reason, if no other, Google was entitled to summary judgment on Skyhook\u2019s c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\"> Google later acquired Motorola, but at all times relevant to this case, Google and Motorola were separate, independent corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The same judge previously had denied Skyhook\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The judge\u2019s comprehensive thirty-five page decision contains an extremely detailed account of the events leading up to this dispute and the technological issues that lie at the heart of it.

In parallel, Motorola needs to determine if we feel that the current approach creates a compliance issue or whether the current XPS implementation is acceptable since it provides a location result using GPS, WiFi, and CelllD information.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Specifically, Google voiced concern that XPS\u2019s use of the Android operating system\u2019s GPS Provider API, rather than the Network Provider API, to report location based on Wi-Fi and cellular data would reduce the accuracy of the information collected by Google and stored in its database about Wi-Fi access point and cell tower locations. Google described this reporting problem as \u201ccontaminating\u201d Google\u2019s location database. Google also voiced concern that XPS\u2019s misreporting of network data as GPS data would adversely affect applications created by third-party developers in reliance on the accuracy of location data reported through the GPS Provider API.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Skyhook does not contend that the preexisting contracts between Google and the manufacturers were unlawful. The gist of its argument is that only the manufacturers, and not Google, had the authority under the contracts to make compatibility determinations; however, this contention is at odds with facts that Skyhook deemed undisputed below, allegations contained in its complaint, the relevant contract language (see notes 10 &amp; 11, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text), and the course of dealing between Google and the manufacturers. Google, Motorola, and Samsung all understood Google to have the authority to make compatibility determinations and to provide standards for the conditions under which devices containing its proprietary applications could be shipped. Furthermore, Skyhook\u2019s own contract with Motorola contemplated that Motorola would be excused from preloading XPS, if doing so was \u201ccontractually prohibited by a qualified third party,\u201d i.e., an entity that \u201chas the contractual right over Motorola to substantially define the features, functions and overall design\u201d of the devices, or \u201ca certifying entity which has the right to define and approve the technical specifications required to be a[n] Android-compliant device and which has declared the Embedded Software to be non-compliant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">To the extent Google\u2019s right to stop shipment was qualified by contract language requiring that its approval not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, see note 11, <em>supra, </em>we conclude that on this record no rational jury could find Google\u2019s actions or timetable unreasonable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The \u201cAccurate Reproduction\u201d section of the contract specifies that Motorola \u201cwill accurately reproduce the Google Applications ... and will not insert into the Google Applications ... other code that is specifically designed to cause the Google Applications to cease operating, or to . . . interfere with any Google Applications or End User data.\u201d Installing a stripped-down version of NLP would not have been an \u201caccurate reproduction\u201d and would have \u201cinterfered\u201d with the functioning of the application, in violation of this section of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\">Section 773 of the Restatement deals with one of several \u201cspecial situations\u201d in which application of enumerated factors for determining whether interference is improper have produced \u201cclearly identifiable decisional patterns\u201d that warrant a more specific rule.
