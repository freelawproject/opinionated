(the defendants), is permissible as of right under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. Philippino principally challenges the trial judge\u2019s ruling that a dimensionally conforming commercial structure is not, by virtue of its employment for a nonconforming use, a nonconforming structure for purposes of the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, first par. We conclude, as did the trial judge, that where the project does not work a \u201cchange or substantial extension,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>of the preexisting non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>conforming commercial use, the reconstruction and replacement of the existing dimensionally conforming structure with a new dimensionally conforming structure is lawful as a matter of right and not subject to the second sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, which provides that preexisting nonconforming structures or uses may only be extended or altered by special permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendants\u2019 100-bed nursing home facility, built in 1968, is a dimensionally conforming commercial structure situated on a large (5.5 acre) conforming lot in a residential zone. Use of the facility as a nursing home predates the adoption of the Newburyport zoning ordinance, and thus is a lawful preexisting nonconforming use. The defendants plan to replace the old structure with a modernized 121-bed facility that will meet the dimensional requirements of the current zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Newburyport zoning board of appeals (board) issued a special permit that authorized the defendants to proceed with the project, and abutters Philippino and her husband appealed under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. After trial, a Land Court judge concluded that the project (1) does not constitute a \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of the lawful preexisting nonconforming commercial use, and (2) is therefore permissible as of right under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and not subject to the more restrictive special permit requirements of the local zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">On appeal from the judgment, Philippino\u2019s primary claim is that a conforming structure used for a nonconforming purpose is treated as a nonconforming structure under the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. Consequently, she argues, reconstruction and replacement of such a structure is subject to the provisions of the second sentence of that section,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and of its cognate section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Newburyport zoning ordinance, Section IX-B.2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree. Because both the existing and replacement structures are dimensionally conforming structures, the judge\u2019s determination under the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, that the project does not entail a \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of the lawful preexisting nonconforming commercial use ends the inquiry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The protections afforded under the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, govern, and the provisions of the second sentence of \u00a7 6 are not implicated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201c[T]he primary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute.\u201d <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983). The first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201cExcept as hereinafter provided, a zoning ordinance or bylaw shall not apply to structures or uses lawfully in existence . . . but shall apply to any change or substantial extension of such use,... to any reconstruction, extension or structural change of such <em>structure </em>and to any alteration of a structure ... to provide for its use for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>manner or to a substantially greater extent...\u201d (emphases supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">By its plain language, the statute makes an important distinction between preexisting <em>nonconforming uses </em>and <em>nonconforming structures, </em>and articulates different bases upon which each loses its grandfathering protection. Nonconforming <em>uses </em>lose their protection against subsequently enacted local zoning ordinances when there is \u201cany change or substantial extension of such use.\u201d Nonconforming <em>structures, </em>on the other hand, lose their protection when there is \u201cany reconstruction, extension or structural change of such structure,\u201d or modification that amounts to \u201calteration of a structure ... for its use for a substantially different purpose or for the same purpose in a substantially different manner or to a substantially greater extent.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Barron Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>419 Mass. 404, 409-410 (1995). Significantly, there is no language in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, suggesting that its grandfathering provisions for nonconforming uses and structures have application to <em>conforming </em>uses and structures. We view the omission of reference to <em>conforming </em>structures as significant. See <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 803 (1999), and cases cited (court will not add words to statute that Legislature did not put there).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">With respect to prior nonconforming uses and structures that have lost grandfathering protection for the reasons just specified, the second sentence of \u00a7 6 (see note 4, <em>supra) </em>provides that \u201c[preexisting nonconforming structures or uses may be extended or altered\u201d if the proper local authority makes a finding \u201cthat such change, extension or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming [structure or] use to the neighborhood.\u201d See <em>Barron Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danvers, supra </em>at 412-413.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The judge below recognized the important statutory distinction between nonconforming <em>uses </em>and <em>structures, </em>and the inapplica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>bility of the statute\u2019s provisions regarding loss of grandfathering protection when the \u201creconstruction, extension, or structural change\u201d relates to a conforming structure. Because the defendants\u2019 existing nursing facility and its proposed replacement are dimensionally <em>conforming </em>structures that serve a nonconforming use, the judge appropriately directed his focus to the sole question of import: whether the project proposed a \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of the nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">To answer that question, the judge correctly invoked the familiar three-pronged test described in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Barnstable, </em>363 Mass. 648, 653 (1973): (1) whether the proposed use reflects the nature and purpose of the use prevailing when the zoning ordinance took effect, (2) whether there is a difference in the quality or character, as well as the degree, of use, and (3) whether the proposed use is different in kind in its effect on the neighborhood. Measuring the project against those considerations, the judge concluded that the project did not work a \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of the use because (1) the locus was operated and would continue to operate as a nursing home, (2) operation of a nursing home with 121 beds rather than 100 beds would not alter the quality, character, or degree of that use, and (3) the project would not have any adverse effect on the neighborhood different in kind from the existing use, but would have a \u201cmitigating impact.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In consequence, the judge concluded that the project fell within the protection of the first sentence of \u00a7 6 and was permissible as of right. See <em>Schiffenhaus </em>v. <em>Kline, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 605 (2011) (local zoning ordinance or by-law cannot conflict with statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The determination that the project does not work a \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of the prior nonconforming use as a nursing home is amply supported by the factual findings, and Philippine does not seriously contest this aspect of the judge\u2019s decision. Rather, she argues that the judge erred when he concluded that the project does not fall within the \u00a7 6 limitation on grandfathering protection for \u201creconstruction, extension or structural change\u201d of a nonconforming structure. That is so, Philippino <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>argues, because notwithstanding that both the existing and proposed structures comply with existing dimensional and density regulations, they are devoted to a nonconforming use. Put differently, Philippino argues that a nonconforming structure for purposes of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, encompasses a structure devoted to a nonconforming use even when there is no nonconformity in the structure itself. Under Philippino\u2019s view of the statute, a dimensionally conforming structure devoted to a nonconforming purpose is subject to the \u201creconstruction, extension or stmctural change\u201d provision of the statute, which, in turn, renders the project subject to regulation under the Newburyport zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">We conclude that the plain language of the statute does not support such strained interpretation. The fundamental flaw in Philippino\u2019s argument is that it conflates stmctures and uses \u2014 measuring stmctural conformity by reference to the use of the stmcture, and treating reconstruction of a conforming commercial structure that serves a nonconforming use as if it were a nonconforming stmcture. The statute treats structures and uses differently.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">As discussed earlier, in enacting \u00a7 6, the Legislature focused on the grandfathering rights to be accorded to nonconforming uses and nonconforming stmctures, drawing a clear distinction in the protections afforded. See <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Gloucester, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 331, 338 n.10 (2011); Bobrowski, Massachusetts Land Use and Planning Law \u00a7 6.01 (3d ed. 2011). We discern nothing in the language of \u00a7 6 that reflects the Legislature\u2019s intent to treat the nonconforming use of a structurally conforming building as creating stmctural nonconformity. Rather, the expressed statutory test for loss of grandfathering protection for a nonconforming <em>use </em>is whether there is a \u201cchange or substantial extension\u201d of the use; that for a nonconforming <em>structure </em>is whether there is \u201creconstruction, extension or stmc-tural change\u201d of the nonconforming stmcture.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">While we are aware of no case holding that replacement of a conforming stmcture devoted to a nonconforming use that does not result in a change or substantial extension of the use is permissible as of right under the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00a7 6, no case holds otherwise. Such cases as approach the issue concern the replacement of prior <em>nonconforming structures </em>devoted to a prior nonconforming use and, further, suggest that the statute\u2019s reach is limited to nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures, not conforming structures devoted to a nonconforming use. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Barnstable, </em>363 Mass, at 658 n.4 (\u201c[T]he existence of a lawful nonconforming use does not permit the erection of additional buildings for <em>the extension or enlargement of that </em>use\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Fal-mouth, </em>385 Mass. 205,215 (1982), which involved a change from a resort hotel for older customers to an entertainment complex catering to young nonguests, the court noted that \u201ca valid nonconforming use does not lose that status merely because it is improved and made more efficient,\u201d provided the changes are \u201cordinarily and reasonably adapted to the original use and do not constitute a change in the original nature and purpose of the undertaking\u201d (citations omitted). Similarly, in <em>Barron Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>419 Mass, at 409, which involved whether certain changes to signage constituted changes in prior nonconforming <em>uses, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court noted that under \u00a7 6, \u201ca by-law does not apply to a prior <em>nonconforming use or structure, </em>but does apply to \u2018any change or substantial extension of such use . . . [and] any reconstruction, extension or structural change of <em>such structure </em>... \u2019 \u201d (emphases supplied) (quoting from G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6). As previously discussed, the court emphasized that the right of a municipality to regulate changes under the second sentence of \u00a7 6 \u201cis limited to the changes, extensions, reconstructions and alterations to <em>prior nonconforming uses and structures </em>to which, under the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, zoning ordinances and by-laws apply\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 413. Because the changes there did not constitute a \u201cchange, extension, reconstruction or alteration\u201d of a prior nonconforming use or structure to which, under the first sentence of \u00a7 6, zoning ordinances and by-laws apply, the town could not regulate them. See <em>Derby Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>407 Mass. 703,713 (1990) (nature and purpose of use \u2014 \u201cbulk deliveries by ocean-going vessels, bulk tank storage and wholesale distribution\u201d \u2014 were unchanged despite fact that product changed from fuel to liquid asphalt and facilities were altered to allow for this change).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We do not read <em>Berliner </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>363 Mass. 767, 770 (1973), on which Philippine primarily relies, as requiring a different result. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Berliner </em>did not involve the grandfathering protection afforded to a preexisting nonconforming use under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. Rather, it involved interpretation of the provisions of a <em>local zoning by-law </em>regarding whether a preexisting nonconforming structure (an inn) that was damaged or destroyed by fire might be rebuilt. Because <em>Berliner </em>concerned the reconstruction of a preexisting nonconforming structure devoted to a nonconforming use (conducting an inn in a residence district), to the extent that the statutory predecessor of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was implicated at all, the applicable provision was that allowing for local regulation when there is a \u201creconstruction, extension or structural change\u201d of a nonconforming structure. See <em>id. </em>at 771, 773, 774. See also Healy, Massachusetts Zoning Manual \u00a7 6.7.2 (4th ed. 2007) (building in <em>Berliner </em>appeared to be dimensionally nonconforming). Accordingly, the court\u2019s statement to the effect that the statute \u201cdoes not confer the right to erect a new building in place of an existing building used for a nonconforming purpose,\u201d <em>Berliner </em>v. <em>Feldman, supra </em>at 770, must be read in that limited context.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In sum, the judge did not err in ruling that the project was permissible as of right under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Alternatively, the judge ruled that if a special permit were required for the project, the board correctly determined that the new building was not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing structure or use, and was not an intensification or extension of the use under Section IX-B.2.B(1) of the local zoning ordinance. See note 5, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The second sentence provides, \u201cPre-existing nonconforming structures or uses may be extended or altered, provided, that no such extension or alteration shall be permitted unless there is a finding by the permit granting authority or by the special permit granting authority designated by ordinance or by-law that such change, extension or alteration shall not be substantially more detrimental than the existing nonconforming [structure or] use to the neighborhood.\u201d G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, second sentence, inserted by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3.

We agree with the trial judge and the board that the twenty-foot front-yard setback specifically designated for a building used as a nursing home, rather than the general setback for a residential district, controls. See Section VI-A of ordinance, \u201cTable of Dimensional Requirements.\u201d If each nursing home in Newburyport had to comply with the front-yard setback of the district in which it was located, there would be no purpose in the zoning ordinance specifying a twenty-foot setback for nursing homes. See <em>Shirley Wayside Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Shirley, </em>461 Mass. 469, 475 (2012) (according deference to local board\u2019s reasonable interpretation of its own zoning by-law).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Because the judge was correct in ruling that the protections of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, afford the defendants the right to construct the project, we do not address the judge\u2019s alternative conclusion that if a special permit were required, the board correctly ruled that the project would not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming use and would not result in any intensification or extension of an existing nonconformity or addition of a new nonconformity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We are not concerned here with the second \u201cexcept\u201d clause of the first sentence of G.

See <em>Bransford </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Edgartown, </em>444 Mass. 852, 859-862 (2005) (Greaney, J., concurring) (considering whether reconstruction of dimensionally conforming structure on undersized lot increases nonconforming nature so as to remove protections of second \u201cexcept\u201d clause).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Here, the judge cited evidence of several salutary aspects of the proposed facility\u2019s design, including that the reconstructed building would stand further from the neighborhood\u2019s residences and closer to the nearby industrial zone, that improvements in lighting and screening would result in less glare into the neighborhood, and that the relocation of the loading dock would address noise concerns of the Philippinos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The distinction between stmctures and uses within \u00a7 6, and the potential for confusion arising from the frequent references to the two terms in common, was the subject of discussion in <em>Willard, </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Orleans, </em>25 Mass.
