(Follett), to investigate the cause of their leaky roof. Follett reported that the roof had been installed a number of years earlier over fiberboard roof insulation that was soaking wet, thereby causing the later leakage. The Downeys then sued the installer of the roof, Chutehall Construction Co., Ltd. (Chutehall), for substandard workmanship, and Chutehall brought third-party defamation and G. L. c. 93A claims against Follett, asserting that the statement about installing the roof over the soaking wet fiberboard insulation was false and defamatory. A Superior Court judge granted Follett\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Chutehall\u2019s claims against Follett. Follett then filed a motion for the entry of a separate and final judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974), which Chutehall opposed. The judge allowed Follett\u2019s motion, judgment entered, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">On appeal, Chutehall argues that the judge erred in deciding as a matter of law (1) that Follett\u2019s report about the roof constituted a statement of opinion not fact, (2) that Follett was not negligent in making the statement, and (3) that the statement was protected by a conditional privilege. Chutehall also argues that the judge erred in allowing the motion for entry of separate and final judgment. We conclude that the statement by Follett was protected by a conditional privilege that was not abused and, therefore, summary judgment was properly allowed on the defamation claim. As the c. 93A claim depends on the merits of the defamation claim, summary judgment was properly allowed on this claim as well. There was no error in the entry of judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 2005, the Downeys entered a contract with Chutehall pursuant to which Chutehall installed a new rubber roof system on the Downeys\u2019 townhouse in the Beacon Hill section of Boston. In 2009, another contractor, hired by the Downeys to install a rooftop heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit for their home, cut a hole in the roof and discovered that the underlying roof system was wet. At the contractor\u2019s suggestion, the Downeys engaged Follett and J.M. Lydon Corp. (Lydon), both roofing contractors, to inspect the roof. In addition, the Downeys hired Gregory R. Doelp, a structural engineer, to evaluate the roof and any proposals submitted by Follett and Lydon. After Follett, Lydon, and Doelp performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>their on-site investigations of the roof, the Downeys requested that they each prepare written findings of their observations. Specifically, the Downeys requested that Follett help them understand why the roof was wet and what had caused the leakage problems. Follett\u2019s written report, titled \u201cRoof Observations,\u201d stated, \u201cThis roof was installed over a EPDM roof system that had fiberboard roof insulation that was soaking wet.\u201d Follett recommended that the entire roofing system be removed and replaced. The Downeys ultimately hired Follett to carry out this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">In 2010, the Downeys filed a complaint in Superior Court against Chutehall to recover damages to their townhouse allegedly caused by substandard roofing work performed by Chutehall in 2005. In response to the Downeys\u2019 lawsuit, Chutehall asserted third-party claims against Follett for defamation and violation of G. L. c. 93A, alleging that Follett\u2019s statement that the roof was installed over wet insulation was false and defamatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chutehall\u2019s c. 93A claim is based entirely on its allegation of defamation. On Follett\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Superior Court judge ruled that the alleged defamatory statements were not statements of fact, but of Follett\u2019s professional opinion; that the statements were not negligently made; and that, in any event, they were conditionally privileged. The judge further ruled that because Chutehall\u2019s c. 93A claim rested entirely on the allegation of defamation, that claim must fail as well. A separate and final judgment entered pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and Chutehall filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>The defendant must prevail on its motion for summary judgment \u201cif [it] demonstrates, by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), unmet by countervailing materials, that the [plaintiff] has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of [its] case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). \u201cA complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the [plaintiff\u2019s] case renders all other facts immaterial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711. We view the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See <em>Currier </em>v. <em>National Bd. of Med. Examiners, </em>462 Mass. 1, 11 (2012); <em>Dragonas </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Melrose, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 430 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">a. <em>Chutehall\u2019s defamation claim. </em>In order for Chutehall to recover on its defamation claim, it must establish that (1) Follett published a defamatory statement of and concerning Chutehall; (2) the statement was a false statement of fact (as opposed to opinion); (3) Follett was at fault for making the statement and any privilege that may have attached to the statement was abused; and (4) Chutehall suffered damages as a result, or the statement was of the type that is actionable without proof of economic loss. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 858-859 (1975); <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>May Dept. Stores Co., </em>443 Mass. 52, 55-56 (2004); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 558, 599, 600 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">i. <em>Distinction between opinion and fact. </em>To determine whether the statement in question is defamatory, the court must decide whether it is an assertion of fact or opinion. The distinction is often subtle and difficult, particularly at the summary judgment stage. <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 709 (1987), cert, denied, 485 U.S. 940 and 485 U.S. 962 (1988), quoting from <em>Janklow </em>v. <em>Newsweek, Inc., </em>788 F.2d 1300, 1302 (8th Cir.), cert, denied, 479 U.S. 883 (1986) (\u201cIt is hard to draw a bright line between \u2018fact\u2019 and \u2018opinion\u2019 \u201d). The determination is considered a question of law only when it is unambiguous. See <em>ibid. </em>See also <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Milton Academy, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 296 (2007); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>St. Martin\u2019s Press, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 243, 248 (1st Cir. 2000), cert, denied, 531 U.S. 1075 (2001). In contrast, \u201cthe determination whether a statement is a factual assertion or a statement of pure opinion is a question of fact if the statement reasonably can be understood both ways.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., supra. </em>See <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>398 Mass. 731, 733-734 (1986). Therefore, in a defamation action, \u201cthe defendant is entitled to summary judgment if the challenged statement cannot reasonably be construed as a statement of fact.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., supra. </em>\u201cHowever, if a statement is susceptible of being read by a reasonable person as either a factual statement or an opinion, it is for the jury to determine.\u201d <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In determining whether an assertion is a statement of fact or opinion, \u201cthe test to be applied ... requires that the court examine the statement in its totality in the context in which it was uttered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>or published. The court must consider all the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence. In addition, the court must give weight to cautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement. Finally, the court must consider all of the circumstances surrounding the statement, including the medium by which the statement is disseminated and the audience to which it is published.\u201d <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Bdcst. Co., </em>386 Mass. 303, 309, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 1037 (1982), quoting from <em>Information Control Corp. </em>v. <em>Genesis One Computer Corp., </em>611 F.2d 781, 784 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">We do not consider this assertion an unambiguous statement of opinion appropriate for summary judgment. The defamatory statement on its face appears directly and definitively factual:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThis roof was installed over a EPDM roof system that had fiberboard roof insulation that was soaking wet.\u201d Importantly, in contrast to statements of opinion, statements that present or imply the existence of facts that can be proven true or false are actionable. See <em>Levinsky\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>127 F.3d 122, 127 (1st Cir. 1997), citing <em>Milkovich </em>v. <em>Lorain Journal Co., </em>497 U.S. 1, 18-19 (1990); <em>Gray </em>v. <em>St. Martin\u2019s Press, Inc., </em>221 F.3d at 248, also citing <em>Milkovich, supra </em>at 18-20. Here, Follett stated that the Downeys\u2019 roof had been installed over wet insulation. This appears to be an assertion of fact that, at least in theory, could be verified as either true or false.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Nevertheless, as the motion judge pointed out, the installation of the roof was done four years earlier when Follett was not present, and thus the motion judge concluded that the statement \u201ccan reasonably be understood only as an expression of Follett\u2019s professional judgment, based on its observations at the time it examined the roof.\u201d The published statement is not, however, in any way introduced as an expression of opinion. See, e.g., <em>Information Control Corp. </em>v. <em>Genesis One Computer Corp., </em>611 F.2d at 784 (statement \u201ccautiously prefaced as representing \u2018the opinion of . . . management\u2019 \u201d). Nor is the statement expressly qualified or limited as being based on the results of particular observations. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 comment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>c &amp; illustration 4 (\u201cA writes to B about his neighbor C: \u2018He moved in six months ago. He works downtown, and I have seen him during that time only twice, in his backyard around 5:30 seated in a deck chair with a portable radio listening to a news broadcast, and with a drink in his hand. I think he must be an alcoholic.\u2019 The statement indicates the facts on which the expression of opinion was based and does not imply others. These facts are not defamatory and A is not liable for defamation\u201d). Finally, the audience, i.e., ordinary homeowners, could, we conclude, reasonably be expected to understand Follett\u2019s statement as one of determined fact and not just a qualified opinion, despite their understanding that Follett did not personally observe the installation. See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Westinghouse Bdcst. Co., </em>386 Mass, at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In sum, although it is a close question, we conclude that the unqualified factual assertion here, which might have been proven true or false, could reasonably be construed as a defamatory statement of fact. Summary judgment should not have been granted on the ground that it was an unambiguous opinion. We therefore turn to the questions of fault and privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">ii. <em>Demonstration of fault. </em>Private persons or entities may recover on defamation claims on proof that the defendant was negligent in publishing defamatory statements, which reasonably could be interpreted to refer to the plaintiff, assuming proof of all other elements of a claim for defamation has been provided. See <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass, at 858; <em>New England Tractor-Trailer Training of Conn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>395 Mass. 471, 477 (1985). If, however, a conditional privilege applies to the communication, negligence is not enough, as at least recklessness is required. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 514 (1984). We turn to the privilege issue next, as we consider it dispositive in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">iii. <em>Conditional privilege. </em>\u201cThe burden is on the defendant! ] to prove, when the issue is properly raised, the existence of a privilege to publish a defamatory communication.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786, 802 (1987). Where, as here, a defendant in a defamation action establishes the existence of a privilege, the burden rests upon the plaintiff to raise a trial-worthy issue of an abuse of that privilege. See <em>Judd </em>v. <em>McCormack, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 167, 173 (1989); <em>Dragonas </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Melrose, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 438. In this case, this would require Chutehall to have introduced sufficient evidence to establish that Follett published the statements recklessly. Based on our review of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>record, we conclude that Chutehall\u2019s defamation claim failed as a matter of law because the statement is conditionally privileged, and there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Under Massachusetts law, a publication will be deemed conditionally privileged if the publisher of the statement and the recipient have a common interest in the subject and the statement is \u201creasonably calculated to further or protect that interest.\u201d <em>Shee-han </em>v. <em>Tobin, </em>326 Mass. 185, 190-191 (1950) (citation omitted). See <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>National Semiconductor Corp., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 133 (1984) (privilege applies to employee of one company making disparaging comments about performance of employee of another company with which first has business relationship); <em>Flotech, Inc. </em>v. <em>E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>814 F.2d 775, 778 (1st Cir. 1987) (privilege applies to company\u2019s statement that it views its own product as ineffective for particular purpose even if statement implies ineffectiveness of third party\u2019s product); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 596. The courts have consistently recognized the common interest privilege within the business context. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass, at 512-513 (\u201cMassachusetts courts have recognized that a person may possess a conditional privilege to publish defamatory material if the publication is reasonably necessary to the protection or furtherance of a legitimate business interest\u201d); <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>National Semiconductor Corp., supra </em>at 133-134.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Despite Chutehall\u2019s assertions to the contrary, Follett\u2019s statement involved a common business interest between Follett and the Downeys, i.e., the evaluation of the likely source of the roof\u2019s leak so that repairs could be made. Follett\u2019s statement furthered this common business interest as it affected the Downeys\u2019 decision on how they should proceed in addressing the roof\u2019s leakage. Additionally, the statement was made in Follett\u2019s professional capacity and only after the Downeys specifically requested Follett to explain the source of the leak. The exchange between Follett and the Downeys is assuredly of the type contemplated by the privilege, and to claim otherwise would rob the privilege of its intended purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">This conclusion is supported by case law from other jurisdictions as well. As seen in <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>984 P.2d 1113, 1121 (Alaska 1999), the common business interest privilege was applied to a statement made by a contractor to his client regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the work of prior contractors. The Alaska Supreme Court emphasized that the business privilege is \u201cclearest when a legal relationship exists between the defendant and the person on whose behalf\u2019 he is making the contested statement, and the communication serves the purposes of that legal relationship. <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). In <em>Briggs, </em>as in the instant case, the defendant and his client had a contractual relationship related to the need for repair work on the house, and the communication was included in a document that was designed to explain the need for such repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that this conditional privilege was forfeited by Follett. Massachusetts case law maintains that a publisher may abuse, and lose, a conditional privilege in a number of ways, including if the plaintiff offers proof that the defendant (1) acted out of malice, (2) knew the information was false, (3) had no reason to believe the information to be true, (4) acted in reckless disregard of the truth or the defendant\u2019s rights, or (5) published the information unnecessarily, unreasonably, or excessively. See <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass, at 513-515; <em>Dragonas </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Melrose, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. at 438-439. As underscored by the Supreme Judicial Court, \u201cwhatever the manner of abuse, recklessness, at least, should be required\u201d to overcome the privilege. <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., supra </em>at 515. See <em>Dexter\u2019s Hearthside Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Whitehall Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 217, 223 (1987) (\u201cRecklessness is the minimum level of misconduct\u201d). Negligence is not enough to cause the loss of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Recklessness is a difficult standard to meet. \u201c[R]eckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published or would have investigated before publishing.\u201d <em>HipSaver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, </em>464 Mass. 517, 530 (2013), quoting from <em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968). Rather, the defendant\u2019s conduct is measured by what the defendant had reason to believe. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>400 Mass. 82, 95-96 (1987). \u201cThere must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication.\u201d <em>HipSaver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74 (1964) (equating \u201creckless disregard\u201d with \u201chigh degree of awareness of . . . probable falsity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Follett\u2019s deposition, through its designee, Donald Follett, demonstrates that he undertook an investigation before proffering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>conclusion that the most recently installed roof had been put in over wet insulation. Donald Follett conducted two on-site inspections of the roof and made several test cuts in the roofing system. He determined that the top roof membrane and insulation was dry but the underlying roof materials were soaking wet. He also concluded that the wetness at the higher elevations was consistent with the wetness at the lower areas. He stated that at the very top area of the roof there were \u201cno penetrations for water to get in.\u201d These test cuts and observations led him to conclude that the uppermost roofing system had been installed over wet insulation. Indeed he stated at his deposition that \u201cit would have been impossible that that roof . . . insulation was not wet\u201d when the roof was installed. He described himself as \u201cconvinced,\u201d so much so that once he made the test cuts, he did not do further investigation regarding leaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Similarly, the facts led Lydon, the other roofing contractor that examined the Downeys\u2019 roof, to conclude, \u201cThis roof would be adequate if it was not installed over a wet roof.\u201d Doelp, the engineer hired by the Downeys to evaluate the roof and the repair proposals made by Follett and Lydon, testified that Follett\u2019s conclusion was plausible, and that Donald Follett, a roofer, would be in a \u201cbetter position than I would be to make that judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Doelp did, however, acknowledge some uncertainty. Based on his own investigation, Doelp testified that he could not be sure Chutehall\u2019s 2005 work on the Downeys\u2019 roof was the source of the leakage problems, as he had also identified other potential sources of the wetness of the insulation and leakage. He noted, for example, that there were potential leak problems around the head house, chimney, and metal parapet. He further stated that the water \u201ccould have been there when they put the roof over. [But] [i]t could have happened later.\u201d He did not know. He speculated that he \u201ccould figure that out, but... was never asked to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The record here does not support a finding of recklessness. The facts at Follett\u2019s disposal provided solid reasons to believe the statement it made to the Downeys. Donald Follett testified that he was firmly convinced by his investigation. Although there is a question whether Follett should have done more to investigate the source of the leak, and that leads to some uncertainty about the correctness of its conclusions, in the absence of any evidence that Follett \u201centertained serious doubts as to the truth of [the] publication,\u201d <em>HipSaver, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kiel, </em>464 Mass, at 530, Chutehall has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact regarding recklessness. The judge did not err in allowing Follett\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>for summary judgment on Chutehall\u2019s defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">b. <em>The G. L. c. 93A claim. </em>As conceded by Chutehall, its G. L. c. 93A claim is based on the alleged defamatory statements made by Follett. Accordingly, this claim rises or falls on the outcome of the defamation claim. <em>Dulgarian </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>420 Mass. 843, 853 (1995) (\u201c[Wjhere allegedly defamatory statements do not support a cause of action for defamation, they also do not support a cause of action under G. L. c. 93 A\u201d). Therefore, the trial judge properly allowed Follett\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Chutehall\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">c. <em>Final and separate judgment. </em>Under Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), \u201cthe court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties . . . upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d \u201cWhether there are multiple claims in an action and whether those claims have been finally adjudicated are matters of law subject to plenary review by an appellate court.\u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 386 (2000). \u201cThe determination of the presence or absence of a just reason for delay, on the other hand, is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and is subject to reversal only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The record supports the trial judge\u2019s decision that there was no just reason for delay given that Chutehall\u2019s claims against Follett were independent of the claims between Chutehall and the Downeys.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We decline to vacate the entry of separate and final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed above, the judge did not err in allowing Follett\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Chutehall\u2019s defamation and c. 93A claims or in entering a separate and final judgment as to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Originally, Chutehall\u2019s defamation claim was based on two statements: the statement made by Follett in the \u201cRoof Observations\u201d report, and a written statement made by Christopher Downey in a prelitigation demand letter to Chutehall, in which Downey wrote that Follett \u201cnoted that the roofing workmanship was in fact poor and substandard.\u201d Chutehall has waived the issue of this second statement on appeal, and the only statement we consider is Follett\u2019s written statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In his deposition, Follett states that it would have been \u201cimpossible\u201d for the insulation not to have been wet when the roof was installed.
