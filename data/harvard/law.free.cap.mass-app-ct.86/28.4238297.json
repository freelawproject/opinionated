See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A; G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. Two weeks after sentencing, the trial judge, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a), 378 Mass. 899 (1979), sua sponte convened a hearing and thereafter increased the defendant\u2019s sentence for the conviction of rape of a child by force. The defendant appeals from his convictions and from the imposition of the increased sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Background. </em>1. <em>Facts. </em>The jury heard the following evidence. In New Bedford, from approximately 1994 and into 1997, the victim, Michael,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> lived with his mother, two older sisters, and the defendant. The defendant cared for Michael when his mother was at work. Michael, who was twenty-two years old at the time of trial, testified that on multiple occasions the defendant entered his bedroom, touched his penis and buttocks, and manually penetrated his rectum. He recounted that the defendant had threatened to \u201cchop [him] into little pieces\u201d if he disclosed the abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">2. <em>Sentencing. </em>At the time of sentencing, the defendant was serving a term of fifteen to twenty-five years in State prison for a conviction in 1999 of rape by force of one of Michael\u2019s sisters. On March 15, 2012, at the conclusion of a subsequent offender bench trial, the judge sentenced the defendant to seven to ten years in State prison on the conviction of rape of a child by force, subsequent offense; and five to seven years on the conviction of indecent assault and battery on a person under the age of fourteen years, subsequent offense. The judge imposed those sentences to be served concurrently with each other and with the sentence in progress on the rape by force of Michael\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Two weeks later, after the defendant had filed his notice of appeal, the judge, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a), sua sponte conducted a hearing and increased the defendant\u2019s sentence for the conviction of rape by force of Michael to twelve to eighteen years. He left the sentence for the conviction of indecent assault and battery of Michael at five to seven years. The effect of the revision was to increase the defendant\u2019s length of incarceration by approximately six to seven years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Sentence increase under Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a). </em>The defendant contends that the trial judge\u2019s exercise of authority under rule 29(a) to increase a sentence after submission of a defendant\u2019s notice of appeal exerts an impermissible chilling effect on the right to appeal. With exclusive reliance on <em>North </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 723-726 (1969), he proposes that the timing of such a spontaneous revision creates a presumption of vindictiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Rule 29(a), entitled \u201cRevision or Revocation of Sentence,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that a \u201ctrial judge upon his own motion or the written motion of a defendant filed within sixty days after the imposition of a sentence . . . may . . . revise or revoke such sentence if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d The purpose of the rule \u201cis to permit a judge to reconsider the sentence [which] he has imposed and determine, in light of the facts as they existed at the time of sentencing, whether the sentence was just.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>436 Mass. 340, 344 n.3 (2002), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291, 295 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vith Ly, </em>450 Mass. 16, 20 n.5 (2007). A judge may adjust a sentence upward or downward. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 532-533 (2011). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCulloch, </em>450 Mass. 483, 487 (2008), quoting from <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>342 Mass. 119, 128 (1961) (\u201cOccasions inevitably will occur where a conscientious judge, after reflection or upon receipt of new probation reports or other information, will feel that he has been too harsh or has failed to give due weight to mitigating factors which properly he should have taken into account. In such cases the interests of justice and sound judicial administration will be served by permitting the trial judge to reduce the sentence within a reasonable time\u201d), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Derry, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 12 (1988) (Smith, J.) (\u201cIt is well settled that a sentencing judge has the authority under rule 29 [a] to increase a sentence previously imposed, provided that the revision takes place within sixty days of the imposition of the original sentence\u201d), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 390 (1992) (judge can increase severity of sentence if it appears justice may not have been done), and cases cited. The authority of a sentencing judge under rule 29(a) \u201cis consistent with the general responsibility of a judge to safeguard both the rights of the accused and the interest of the public in the due administration of the law.\u201d <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 260, 269 (1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Pearce </em>as authority for a presump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tian of vindictiveness is misplaced. In each of the two cases comprising the <em>Pearce </em>appeal, the chronology of events consisted of a conviction, a successful appeal, a retrial, a reconviction, and a resulting harsher sentence without explanation. 395 U.S. at 713-715. The Court concluded that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited retaliatory sentencing as an inhibition of the right to appeal and, as a remedy in cases of increased sentencing, ordered that a statement of reasons \u201cmust affirmatively appear[,] ... based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">This case obviously differs from the categorical circumstances of the <em>Pearce </em>prosecutions. We do not have a successful appeal, a retrial, and a new conviction, as the suspected origin and motivation creating a more severe sentence. A defendant receiving an upwardly revised sentence outside the <em>Pearce </em>circumstances still may pursue an argument of vindictiveness on the part of the judge. <em>See Alabama </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 799-800 (1989) <em>(Pearce </em>presumption extends to circumstances of \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d of vindictiveness). See also <em>Wasman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 559, 569 (1984) (where prophylactic rule of <em>Pearce </em>does not apply, defendant still may obtain relief if he can show \u201cactual vindictiveness\u201d); <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>359 Mass. 661, 665 (1971) (\u201cIrrespective of the holdings in the <em>Pearce </em>case, allegation and proof of vindictiveness on the part of a judge may be a violation of due process in <em>any </em>case\u201d). The defendant here does not develop the details of such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">If we were to infer a contention of likely or actual vindictiveness, the record would not furnish any basis for it. Under rule 29, a judge \u201cmust give adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard to the criminal defendant. He should also state clearly on the record why it appears that \u2018justice may not have been done\u2019 by the terms of the original sentence.\u201d <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 276. Where, as here, the judge increases a sentence, \u201cfindings and a statement of supporting reasons are important to demonstrate that improper considerations did not motivate the judge\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sitko, </em>372 Mass. 305, 314 (1977). The judge here complied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>with this procedure. He gave notice of the resentencing hearing, provided the defendant with an opportunity to be heard, and delivered the reasons for his revision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record is devoid of any indication of vindictiveness or retaliation against the notice of appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thibeau, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 680 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">2. <em>Witness\u2019s reference to prior offense. </em>Before trial, the judge excluded from evidence any reference to the case of Michael\u2019s sister. In the course of her direct examination as a witness for the Commonwealth, Michael\u2019s social worker remarked that he once had told her of \u201cother events that took place regarding [the defendant] and his sister and . . . .\u201d An immediate objection cut off her testimony. The judge sustained the objection and gave a prompt and forceful curative instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the judge wrongly denied his subsequent motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The standard of review of such a denial is abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>460 Mass. 12, 19 (2011). In the circumstances, no abuse is visible. The reference was fleeting and vague; it did not apprise the jury of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 892 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cunneen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 223-224 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 272 (1995). The responsive instruction was immediate and strong. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>357 Mass. 45, 49 (1970); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>426 Mass. 31, 37-38 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bolling, </em>462 Mass. 440, 455 (2012). Except for extraordinary circumstances absent here, we presume that the jury will obey such instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>385 Mass. 660, 668 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>441 Mass. 459, 470 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Thad T., </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 497, 508 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The defendant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-10\">If the defendant serves time to the midpoint of each sentence differential, the completion date of the 1999 sentence of fifteen to twenty-five years would lie in the vicinity of 2019, and the completion date of the original 2012 sentence of seven to ten years in this case would lie in 2021. In contrast, the completion date of the revised 2012 sentence of twelve to eighteen years would lie in the vicinity of 2027.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In <em>Aldoupolis, supra, </em>the court noted that the Reporter\u2019s Notes to Mass. R. Crim. R 29, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 474 (1979), errantly state, \u201c[T]hat an increase in the sentence once execution has commenced is not permitted has, however, long been settled.\u201d We take this oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>tunity to repeat that this language, still in the Notes, remains inaccurate. The only time limit on the judge\u2019s authority is the sixty-day period set by the rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The judge reasoned (1) that, if the charges of the abuse of Michael had gone to trial with those of the abuse of his sister in 1999, an enhanced sentence would have been appropriate at that time; (2) that the delayed revelation of the abuse of Michael and the later trial in 2012 had resulted from the defendant\u2019s intimidation of Michael; and (3) that the increased sentence fell within the range recommended by the guidelines of the Massachusetts sentencing commission, see G. L. c. 21 IE, \u00a7 3. We observe that the sentence fell within the statutory bounds. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, as appearing in St. 2008, c. 205, \u00a7 2 (person convicted of rape of child by force \u201cshall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life or for any term of years\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The judge stated, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about any relationship with anyone else in this case.... The jury is to disregard that remark. If there is any inference that might be drawn, it should not. It\u2019s not part of this case. The jury is totally to disregard it, and it\u2019s stricken.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
