Litchfield appeals the decision of the reviewing board of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) which affirmed a decision of an administrative judge of the department. The administrative judge determined that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36(l)(j), benefits for permanent loss of psychiatric function were not available to Litchfield. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\"><em>Factual and procedural background. </em>The following facts are taken from the administrative judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact and are not in dispute. Litchfield \u201cworked as a heavy equipment mechanic for the [tjown of Westford, the employer . . . , from 1984 until suffering an industrial injury to his elbow and shoulder in 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Litchfield \u201cnever suffered from anxiety and depression prior to his industrial injury but has since. His depression prevents him from working or doing the things he used to enjoy including interacting with his family. ... He spends his days watching television, playing computer games and performing light housework. He does get out of the house each day and works as a municipal poll worker on election days. His elbow and shoulder pain are always present. . . . The pain and inability to work, directly caused by the physical injuries, have caused his psychiatric conditions of depression and anxiety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">He has received compensation for these injuries under various sections of G. L. c. 152. In 2004, he was awarded \u00a7 35 partial incapacity benefits for his physical injuries. In 2007, he was awarded \u00a7 34 temporary total incapacity benefits for these injuries. A panel of this court affirmed that award in <em>Litchfield\u2019s </em>Case, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (2009). Also in 2007, his \u00a7 36 claim for loss of function benefits for his shoulder and elbow was adjusted. Finally, in 2009, he was awarded \u00a7 34A permanent and total benefits for these injuries. Later, he filed a claim for permanent loss of psychiatric function under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36(l)(y). The denial of this claim is now before us on appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Authority to determine which version of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment applies. </em>The insurer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> argued that the department does not have the authority to determine which edition of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides) applies to the reviewing board\u2019s proceedings and that the AMA Guides (5th ed. 2001) (AMA Guides 5th edition) had been previously adopted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Compare AMA Guides (6th ed. 2008) (AMA Guides 6th edition). See Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 80.07 (rev. ed. 2013) (Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation). While the insurer has not raised this issue on appeal, we will nevertheless address it because we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>determine which edition of the AMA Guides applies to our determination whether this employee is entitled to additional specific compensation in his G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36(l)(y), claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The reviewing board and the administrative judge are both \u201cadministrative tribunal[s] and, accordingly, \u2018possess[ ] only such authority and powers as have been conferred upon [them] by express grant or arise therefrom by implication as necessary and incidental to the full exercise of the granted powers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>Case, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 497 (1998). The reviewing board is charged with reviewing the decision of the administrative judge and \u201creversing] the decision of an administrative judge only if it determines that such administrative judge\u2019s decision is beyond the scope of his authority, arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C. The administrative judge must file a written order concerning whether \u201cweekly compensation or other benefits\u201d are due after conducting a conference, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A(2)(a), and if that is appealed, after a hearing, the administrative judge must issue a decision addressing the issues that were before the judge. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">A determination of benefits available for injuries under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, \u201c[w]here applicable, . . . shall be determined in accordance with standards set forth in the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairments.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36(2). However, the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions provide no guidance regarding which edition of the AMA Guides should be used.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Some States have specified by statute or regulation which edition of the AMA Guides is to be applied when rating an impairment, ranging from the AMA Guides 3d edition (as revised) to the AMA Guides 6th edition. See, e.g., Ark. Work. Comp. Commn. Rule 34 (1995) (4th edition); Colo. Rev. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00a7 8-42-107 (2013) (3d edition); R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 28-33-18 (2013) (6th edition); Vt. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 648 (2013) (5th edition). In these States a newer edition can be applied to a claim only pursuant to a change in the applicable statute or regulation. Some States have provided that the \u201cmost recent edition\u201d shall be applied. See, e.g., Ariz. Admin. Code \u00a7 R20-5-113. Other States provide that impairment ratings shall be based on the \u201ccurrent\u201d edition of the AMA Guides.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See, e.g., 820 111. Comp. Stat. 305/8. lb. Massachusetts, however, does not provide in either statute or regulation which edition of the AMA Guides should be applied when rating an impairment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Determining which edition shall be applied in the absence of any explicit guidance \u201cis necessary and incidental\u201d to the reviewing board\u2019s power under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C. See <em>Perkins\u2019s </em>Case, 278 Mass. 294, 299 (1932) (reviewing board has powers that are a necessary implication from those expressly granted by the statute). The reviewing board must determine whether the administrative judge acted within the scope of his authority in determining impairment ratings pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a736.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In the present case, the reviewing board determined that it was \u201cappropriate for the administrative judge to utilize the edition of the [AMA] Guides which reflects \u2018the most current scientific and clinical knowledge,\u2019 ... at the time the adopted medical opinion was given. This will ensure that an outdated methodology is not utilized to determine functional impairment ratings, or, in the case of mental and behavioral disorders, that there is a methodology for making that determination.\u201d Both of the physicians who offered impairment evaluations here did so after publication of the AMA Guides 6th edition. We agree with the reviewing board that the AMA Guides 6th edition, \u201cas the most up-to-date version,\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>appropriately considered and applied in this case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\"><em>Reviewing board\u2019s interpretation of the AMA Guides 6th edition. </em>Chapter 14 of the AMA Guides 6th edition, for the first time, recognizes and quantifies psychiatric losses of function, providing \u201cratings for permanent impairment relating to [mental and behavioral disorders].\u201d AMA Guides 6th edition, <em>supra </em>at 348. Compare AMA Guides 5th edition, <em>supra </em>at 167-176.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The AMA Guides 6th edition \u201cdiscusses impairments [which are due] to mental disorders and considers mental and behavioral impairments that may result from them.\u201d AMA Guides 6th edition, <em>supra </em>at 347. The AMA Guides 6th edition currently only considers impairments for selected well-validated major mental illnesses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Litchfield argues that he is eligible for benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36(l)(y),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> for his loss of psychiatric function. He argues that rating for this loss of function is recognized for the first time in chapter 14 of the AMA Guides 6th edition and it does not matter that the psychiatric loss is a secondary result of his physical injury or that he has already received compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34, 34A, 35, and 36, for the physical injury from which the psychiatric loss stems. The reviewing board concluded however, and we agree, that the provisions of chapter 14 do not apply to Litchfield\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The explanatory principles of assessment in chapter 14 of the AMA Guides 6th edition provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201cDisorders that are not ratable in this chapter include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cPsychiatric reaction to pain: It is inherent in the [2008] AMA Guides that the impairment rating for a physical condition provides for the pain associated with that impairment. <em>The psychological distress associated with a physical impairment is similarly included within the </em>rating\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">AMA Guides 6th edition, <em>supra </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The principles of assessment also provide the rules for using the mental and behavioral ratings in chapter 14. The rules provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">\u201cIn most cases of a mental and behavioral disorder accompanying a physical impairment, the psychological issues are encompassed within the rating for the physical impairment and the mental and behavioral disorder chapter should not be used. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201cIn the presence of a mental behavioral disorder without physical impairment or pain impairment, utilize the methodology outlined in this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>12</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">The strategy of this scheme is reiterated throughout the various chapters of the AMA Guides 6th edition. For example, chapter 17 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">\u201cUnder most circumstances, however, [the] impairment rating for mental health disorders related to the stressors that often accompany a chronic, disabling musculoskeletal disorder, is captured within the rating for the musculoskeletal disorder itself.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Furthermore, chapter 3 of the AMA Guides 6th edition, regarding pain-related impairment, explains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cthis edition of the [AMA] Guides does, for the most part, construe pain as one of many manifestations of injuries or diseases, and impairment ratings attempt to take into account the pain that typically occurs in various disorders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 36.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">And \u201c[i]n no circumstances should the [pain related impairments] developed using this chapter be considered as an add-on to impairment determinations based on the criteria listed in [c]hapters 4 to 17.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Finally chapter 2, regarding practical application of the Guides, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201c[t]he impairment ratings in the body organ system chapters make allowance for most of the functional losses accompanying pain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">The presence of a \u201cphysical impairment\u201d and the pain associated with that impairment appear to be the key factors when determining whether a psychiatric impairment can be rated under chapter 14. The administrative judge found facts which indicated that Litchfield\u2019s injuries \u201ccontinue to cause him pain and continue to preclude him from returning to work. This pain and inability to work, <em>directly caused </em>by [Litchfield\u2019s] physical injuries, <em>have caused </em>his psychiatric conditions of depression and anxiety\u201d (emphasis added). Litchfield does not dispute these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">Litchfield, however, argues that psychiatric loss of function is awarded independently in jurisdictions that permit recovery for mental injuries. He points out that the rules for using chapter 14 provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">\u201cIn the event of a mental and behavioral disorder that is judged <em>independently compensable by the jurisdiction involved, </em>the mental and behavioral disorder impairment is combined with the physical impairment\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 349. Since Massachusetts, as do most jurisdictions, allows recovery for mental consequences of industrial injuries, Litchfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>argues that the language in the AMA Guides 6th edition entitles him to recover for his psychiatric loss of function under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, and as rated by chapter 14.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the reviewing board rationally interpreted the term \u201cindependently compensable\u201d to require that the psychiatric injury \u201cbe caused by the industrial accident itself.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Moreover, Litchfield misapprehends the meaning of this rule for the use of chapter 14. Assuming that the psychiatric loss of function is independently compensable in a particular jurisdiction and is ratable under chapter 14, the rule indicates that a chapter 14 rating can be combined with a rating from a different chapter in order to determine a whole person rating. See AMA Guides 6th edition, <em>supra </em>at 20-22 &amp; table 2-1 (explaining the procedure for combining impairment ratings in different chapters to obtain a whole body impairment rating). That, however, is not the situation that is presented here.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Section 36 of the statute compensates for specific individual loss of bodily function whether or not this loss is causing total or partial disability. The \u00a7 36 rating and compensation scheme is separate and distinct from any determination of the extent that an employee\u2019s ratable losses affect earning capacity. Since \u00a7 36 provides specific consideration for a specific injury, a combined rating is not considered in determining benefits under its authority. Section 36 has nothing to do with determining loss of earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Chapter 14 of the AMA Guides 6th edition is clear in its definition, and the limitation, of its rating of mental and behavioral disorders. The chapter neither rates \u201cpsychiatric reaction to pain\u201d nor the \u201cpsychological distress associated with a physical impairment\u201d as these disorders are already included and compensated within the rating methodology for the physical impairment under other chapters. An injured employee, under this scheme, who has been rated for his physical impairment under other chapters of the AMA Guides 6th edition has already been compensated for his pain and the psychological distress resulting from that pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Therefore, under the over-all scheme of the AMA Guides, Litchfield\u2019s claim for specific compensation under \u00a7 36 for his pain and resulting depression and anxiety is not rated, and is specifically excluded under the principles of assessment, including the rules for using chapter 14.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Litchfield remains totally disabled due to the continuing physical consequences of his injuries and due to the resulting pain, anxiety, and depression.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The administrative judge and the reviewing board correctly concluded that a psychiatric reaction to pain is not ratable under chapter 14 of the AMA Guides 6th edition, because \u201cthe impairment rating for a physical condition provides for the pain asso-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>dated with that impairment\u201d and \u201c[t]he psychological distress associated with a physical impairment is similarly included within the rating.\u201d AMA Guides 6th edition, <em>supra </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u201cWe ordinarily accord an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations considerable deference.\u201d <em>Ten Local Citizen Group </em>v. <em>New England Wind, LLC, </em>457 Mass. 222, 228 (2010) <em>{Ten Local Citizen Group), </em>quoting from <em>Warcewicz </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>410 Mass. 548, 550 (1991). The AMA Guides 6th edition acts as an adjunct to the workers\u2019 compensation statute. It is required to be used, where applicable, by the statute and is referred to in the regulation. We therefore treat its interpretation by the reviewing board as we would the board\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. \u201cThe party challenging an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rules has a \u2018formidable burden\u2019 of showing that the interpretation is not rational.\u201d <em>Ten Local Citizen Group, supra. </em>Here, the reviewing board\u2019s interpretation of chapter 14 is rational because the chapter clearly states that when a psychiatric disorder is the result of a physical impairment, the psychiatric disorder is not rated under the guidance provided by chapter 14 but is included in the compensation for the physical injury itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Our standard of review is controlled by the provisions of G.
