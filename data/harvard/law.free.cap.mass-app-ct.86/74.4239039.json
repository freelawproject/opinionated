L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, as a lesser included offense of aggravated rape of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>23A(a). </em>A second Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>jury convicted the defendant of carrying a dangerous weapon when arrested upon a warrant, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 <em>10(b). </em>In this consolidated appeal, the central question is whether the admission of the defendant\u2019s statement that he was attracted to younger boys \u2014 a category that includes the victim \u2014 was reversible error because it amounted to impermissible character or propensity evidence suggesting that the defendant was likely to have committed the sexual assault. The defendant also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the dangerous weapon conviction. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>Background. </em>1. <em>The party incident. </em>The first jury could have found the following. On the evening of April 1, 2010, the defendant attended a party at the townhouse of the victim\u2019s mother, Mona.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victim, Billy, lived in the townhouse with Mona and his sister, Sarah. At the time of the incident, Billy was nine years old and Sarah was twelve. During the party, several adults \u2014 including the defendant and Nirva Guirand, a friend of the defendant and of Mona \u2014 were gathered upstairs in the mother\u2019s bedroom and drinking alcohol. At the relevant time, Billy was asleep on the couch downstairs in the living room. Sarah testified that she left her bedroom late at night to go down to the kitchen. When she had partially descended the flight of stairs, she saw Billy lying asleep on the living room couch.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She saw that his shirt was raised and his pants were pulled down mid-way. Sarah testified that the defendant was leaning over Billy and licking his genital area. She testified that lights were on in the living room and that she was able to see the incident clearly.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Sarah returned upstairs and told Mona about what she saw, generating substantial commotion in the household. After Billy woke up, he told Guirand that the defendant had not touched his leg and that he did not notice any change to his clothing or to the sheet covering him while he was asleep.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Mona and Sarah testified that Billy was a sound sleeper.) The defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>testify, but in a statement to the police, he said that on the night in question he was intoxicated, and went downstairs and smoked a cigarette in the back yard and spoke to Billy, who was awake. The results of forensic testing of Billy\u2019s underpants and pajama pants for sperm, seminal fluid residue, and amylase (a component of saliva) were negative. The chemist who processed the sexual assault evidence collection kit testified that it is easy for amlyase to rub off or be washed off clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Immediately after the incident, Guirand went downstairs and found the defendant in the back yard, smoking a cigarette. She asked him if Sarah \u201cmight have seen him touching himself or using the bathroom,\u201d and the defendant said no. Several days after the incident, the defendant called Guirand by telephone. In response to Guirand\u2019s question, \u201cDid you touch [Billy]?\u201d the defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Then the defendant stated to Guirand that \u201clately he\u2019s been finding himself attracted to younger guys,\u201d particularly between the ages of nine and fourteen, because they had not yet \u201cdeveloped and ... started to have facial hair.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">2. <em>The arrest. </em>The second jury had the following evidence before them. On April 7, 2010, an arrest warrant was issued for the defendant with respect to the April 1 incident. Detective Beth Halloran of the Cambridge police department called the defendant and asked him to meet to \u201cdiscuss some paperwork.\u201d She planned to arrest him at the meeting but did not inform him of that. The defendant chose the location \u2014 near Central Square in Cambridge \u2014 and asked to meet Detective Halloran alone. Prior to this planned meeting, Detective Halloran had had several telephone conversations and one face-to-face meeting with him at the police station during her investigation. For safety reasons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Detective Halloran arranged for three other detectives, in plain clothes, to station themselves at various locations surrounding the scene of the planned arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">When the defendant arrived at the agreed-upon location for the meeting, at approximately 8:30 p.m., Detective Halloran and the defendant recognized each other based on their previous meeting. When the defendant approached Detective Halloran, who was standing still, he kept walking. She testified as to their interaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">\u201cHe proceeded to continue walking past me, so I joined in with his walk, and I said, \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 And he said, \u2014 I said, \u2018What are we doing,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Keep walking.\u2019 So, I walked with him, and I said, \u2018Where are we going,\u2019 and he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to the tracks.\u2019 And I said, \u2018What tracks?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Detective Halloran was aware of nearby train tracks and joined the defendant in walking toward them. One of the other police officers, Detective James Diggins, began walking toward Detective Halloran and the defendant. When they approached each other, both officers took the defendant to the ground and then told him that he was under arrest. The defendant initially resisted but was quickly subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">When Detective Diggins first took hold of the defendant, he noticed an object sticking out of the top of the backpack that the defendant was wearing. When the defendant was forced to the ground, both detectives noticed a knife on the ground outside of the bag. The knife was later identified as a large kitchen knife. It measured fourteen and one-quarter inches in total length, including a nine-inch blade. There was no evidence that the defendant ever held the knife during the meeting or arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Defendant\u2019s statement. </em>With respect to the defendant\u2019s statement that he was attracted to young boys, which was admitted over the defendant\u2019s objection (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>the defendant argues first that it was impermissible character or propensity evidence suggesting that he was likely to have committed a sexual assault on a boy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, the defendant argues that, even if the statement were probative of his motive, intent, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>state of mind, it should have been excluded because its unfair prejudicial effect substantially exceeded its probative value. We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201c[A]s a general rule, evidence of a person\u2019s character is not admissible to prove that he acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>445 Mass. 821, 829 (2006), quoting from Liacos, Brodin, &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.1, at 130 (7th ed. 1999). But otherwise inadmissible character evidence may be admitted for a proper purpose, such as proving motive or intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 579 (2001) (defendant\u2019s statement showing state of mind admissible notwithstanding that \u201cin other circumstances [it] could tend to prove guilt by evidence of bad character\u201d). See generally Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 404 (2014). Whether evidence is relevant is \u201centrusted to the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The judge admitted the statement for a limited purpose. Before the testimony was given, the judge correctly instructed the jury, \u201cYou may consider it solely on the limited issue of whether or not the defendant had a motive to commit the crime that was charged in this indictment, and as to his state of mind and intent.\u201d We agree with the trial judge that the statement was relevant with respect to the limited issues of motive, state of mind, and intent. The defendant\u2019s statement that he was attracted to boys between the ages of nine and fourteen is relevant to explaining why he would touch a nine year old boy like Billy sexually and what the defendant might have been thinking the night that the incident occurred. Not only did the defendant make this statement within several days after the incident, but he also did so in response to Guirand, his friend, asking him whether he had touched Billy. Only after the defendant answered, \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d did he proceed to explain that recently he had been attracted to younger boys. That his uncertain denial was followed with a statement that he was attracted to young boys reveals that the attraction he described was probative of a motive to engage in the alleged sex act and of his state of mind at the time when the incident occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewin (No. 2), </em>407 Mass. 629, 631 (1990), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonomi, </em>335 Mass. 327, 347 (1957) (\u201cAn admission in a criminal case is a statement by the accused, direct or implied, of facts pertinent to the issue, which although insufficient in itself to warrant a conviction tends in connection with proof of other facts to establish his guilt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Just as \u201cevidence of the commission of similar crimes by the same parties though committed in another place, if not too remote in time, is competent to prove an inclination to commit the [acts] charged in the indictment... and is relevant to show the probable existence of the same passion or emotion at the time in issue,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464,470 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>242 Mass. 582,585 (1922), so too is the defendant\u2019s statement about his sexual attraction admissible to prove the \u201cprobable existence of the same passion or emotion\u201d at the time the incident occurred. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanlon, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 810, 817 (1998) (evidence of sexual acts admissible to show common plan or scheme). It is plausible that the defendant may never have acted on his stated proclivity, in contrast to a case involving the admission of evidence of similar crimes \u2022\u2014 where a defendant has already committed those acts. But the evidence here is sufficiently probative with respect to questions of motive, intent, and state of mind that it survives the threshold inquiry into relevance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sicari, </em>434 Mass. 732, 750 (2001) (\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has \u2018a rational tendency to prove an issue in the case,\u2019 or render a \u2018desired inference more probable than it would be without [the evidence]\u2019 \u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Second, the defendant argues that even if there were a proper purpose for the testimony, such as showing motive or intent, it should not have been admitted because the prejudicial effect substantially exceeded the probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u201cWe review a judge\u2019s decision whether the probative value of evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>461 Mass. 586, 596 (2012). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2014). We will not overturn such a decision absent palpable error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>445 Mass, at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Here, the judge carefully engaged in the required balancing of prejudice and probative value. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>453 Mass. 766, 772 (2009). The judge acknowledged the potential prejudicial effect and admitted the postincident statement only after careful analysis as to its probative value. Indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>judge excluded a second statement by the defendant, made one year prior to the incident, that he was attracted to young boys, because of its unduly prejudicial effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paulding, </em>438 Mass. 1, 12 (2002) (selective admission of several of defendant\u2019s prior convictions indicative of judge\u2019s proper balancing of prejudicial effect and probative value). With respect to the statement that was admitted, the judge provided a contemporaneous instruction, repeated in her final charge to the jury, correctly limiting the use of the statement to possible motives for the alleged act and the defendant\u2019s state of mind and intent at the time of the incident; she also instructed the jury explicitly that they could not use the information for propensity purposes. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 650 (1994), and on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaSota, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 15 (1990), is misplaced. The circumstances of those cases bear little resemblance to those we address here. In <em>Darby, </em>this court concluded that it was reversible error to allow the Commonwealth to introduce two photographs: one of the child victim fondling himself while naked and one of the defendant clothed but with his erect penis exposed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Darby, supra </em>at 652, 655-656. With respect to the photograph of the victim, we concluded that its relevance, limited to the issue of the child\u2019s sexual knowledge, was \u201cmarginal at best\u201d and that there already was \u201ca plethora of evidence\u201d on that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 654. We concluded that the photograph of the defendant was \u201cnot, directly or inferentially, relevant to any issue in the case.\u201d But it would have a prejudicial effect, encouraging the jury to convict him because he was a \u201clewd man.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaSota, supra </em>at 27. While inferential leaps could not connect the photographs in <em>Darby </em>to the issues in that case, here not even a small jump is necessary to link the defendant\u2019s statement to a central issue in this case: several days after the incident the defendant acknowledged that he was sexually attracted to a category of people that included the victim of the alleged sexual assault. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 579 (2001) (\u201c[I]n balancing the probative value against the risk of prejudice, the fact that evidence goes to a central issue in the case tips the balance in favor of admission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Similarly, this court\u2019s conclusion in <em>LaSota </em>that the admission of evidence that purportedly bore on sexual proclivities was reversible error is a far cry from what is at issue in this case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>LaSota, </em>where the defendant was charged with several sexual offenses against his minor daughter, we held that the admission of a pamphlet extolling the virtues of incest was reversible error. 29 Mass. App. Ct. at 17, 22, 28. We concluded that the material had no relevance: the Commonwealth did not establish a link between the pamphlet, found in the defendant\u2019s attic among other papers, and the defendant\u2019s beliefs or behavior. <em>Id. </em>at 25-26. In contrast with <em>LaSota, </em>where there was \u201cno evidence that the defendant... approved of [the pamphlet\u2019s] content,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 25, there is no daylight between the content at issue here and the defendant\u2019s own beliefs: it is his own statement about his own attraction that is at issue. Moreover, whereas the defendant in <em>LaSota </em>testified that he received the pamphlet at least several years before the claimed abuse began, <em>id. </em>at 23, here the defendant\u2019s statement was made within several days of the incident and in response to a friend\u2019s questions with respect to the incident.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>LaSota </em>was also \u201cnot a case in which the disputed evidence had direct connection with the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, this case provides precisely that sort of connection. The judge did not abuse her discretion in admitting the defendant\u2019s statement to Guirand.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">2. <em>Dangerous weapon. </em>General Laws c. 269, \u00a7 10(6), as appearing in St. 1974, c. 649, \u00a7 2, prohibits a person, \u201cwhen arrested upon a warrant for an alleged crime,\u201d from being \u201carmed with or ha[ving] on his person,... a... dangerous weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe statute is designed to \u2018discourage[ ] the carrying of dangerous weapons which can be used against arresting officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 825, 827 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 974, 974 (1983). \u201c[T]he term \u2018dangerous weapon\u2019 embraces objects that are dangerous per se, i.e., objects that are \u2018designed and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm\u2019 \u2014 objects, in other words, that are \u2018designed for the purpose of bodily assault or defense\u2019 \u2014 and objects that are dangerous as used, i.e., \u2018those things that become dangerous weapons because they are \u201cused in a dangerous fash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ion.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 828 (citations omitted). \u201cThe essential question, when an object which is not dangerous per se is alleged to be a dangerous weapon, is whether the object, as used by the defendant, is capable of producing serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrero, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 922 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">This case turns on \u201cwhether the evidence permitted the fact finder to conclude that the defendant used or handled the knife in a manner that made it a dangerous weapon.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 829. The defendant argues that, because he never removed the knife from his bag to use or even hold it, it was not dangerous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The defendant is correct that merely carrying a kitchen knife, without more, would not be prohibited by the statute. See <em>id. </em>at 830. However, this case is not like <em>Turner </em>where, \u201c[wjhatever the knife\u2019s potential for harm at other times and in other circumstances, the defendant did not use it in a manner that was capable of causing serious harm or even the apprehension of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829. In <em>Turner, </em>the defendant\u2019s knife was folded in his back pocket, invisible to the arresting officers, and the defendant consented to a patfrisk because he had nothing \u201con him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 826. By contrast, here, the defendant had positioned a large kitchen knife such that its handle was protruding from the top of his backpack, both making it visible and providing the defendant easy access to an unsheathed knife even without removing the backpack he was wearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The context of each arrest is important as well. In <em>Turner, </em>the defendant was simply stopped on the street after the driver of the vehicle he was riding in committed a traffic violation, <em>ibid.; </em>here, the defendant was meeting at an arranged location with a police officer whom he knew to be conducting an investigation of him. Moreover, the defendant had asked Detective Halloran to meet him alone and then asked her to walk with him to a relatively secluded area, at night, from the busy location at which they had agreed to meet.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The manner in which the defendant carried the knife and the circumstances surrounding his carrying the knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>defeat any suggestion that he was doing so with an innocent purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blavackas, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 748, 752-753 (1981) (kitchen bread knife with eight-inch blade found in defendant\u2019s purse would not support conviction under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10[6], if defendant was carrying it \u201cfor an innocent purpose\u201d). Under the circumstances, even though the defendant never wielded the knife, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that the defendant used the knife \u201cin a manner that was capable of causing serious harm,\u201d placing him within the ambit of the statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Turner, supra </em>at 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Pursuant to G.
