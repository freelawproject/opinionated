L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and of accosting a person of the opposite sex, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. Appealing from his conviction of open and gross lewdness, he argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss, alleging that the statute prohibiting open and gross lewdness is unconstitutionally vague. The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty and in instructing the jury on a definition of the word \u201cexposure.\u201d We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\"><em>Background. </em>The following facts are not in dispute. On April 5, 2011, the defendant entered a Target store in Kingston. On that occasion, he chose to wear white \u201csee-through\u201d compression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>shorts. On his way into the store, the defendant asked an employee whether it was \u201cokay\u201d to wear his shorts inside. Several Target employees testified to seeing the defendant\u2019s buttocks and the \u201cflesh color of his skin\u201d through the shorts. One witness testified that she could \u201cclearly\u201d see that the defendant was not wearing underwear. Another witness described seeing the outline of the defendant\u2019s \u201csemi-erect\u201d penis. On redirect, the witness stated that she saw a semi-erect penis through the shorts. The witness also testified that she saw the defendant\u2019s testicles through the shorts. Various witnesses described their shock. A store employee notified the police. The police responded as the defendant was pulling on a pair of jeans over his compression shorts outside of the store. The defendant was arrested and charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the statute prohibiting open and gross lewdness was unconstitutionally vague. That motion was denied. At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty. That motion was also denied. The defendant requested that the trial judge instruct the jury that \u201cexpose\u201d means \u201can act of exposing or the state of being exposed\u201d and \u201cto lay bare or uncover.\u201d The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">\u201c[Wjhat does it mean to expose one\u2019s genitals or buttocks[?] The word expose is not a technical legal term but is to be understood in its common meaning. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines exposed in part as \u2018to cause to be visible or open to view,\u2019 or \u2018to display.\u2019 Whether the defendant exposed his genitals or buttocks is a question of fact to be resolved by you, the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The defendant objected to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motion to dismiss. </em>On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss because G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree. Statutes \u201cmust be sufficiently specific so as to give fair notice as to what conduct is forbidden.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 270 (1983). A statute lacks the required specificity where \u201cmen of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>430 Mass. 683, 689 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 110 (1980). Unspecific statutory language \u201cmay nonetheless be sufficiently definite because of \u2018judicial construction, common law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>meaning, or the statutory history of particular terms\u2019... and such a statute may be rendered \u2018constitutionally definite by giving it a reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass. 492, 499-500 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 581 (1977), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 16, criminalizes \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior.\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court has clearly and specifically set forth the meaning of those terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cIn order to satisfy the constitutional standard of specificity, we construe G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, to prohibit the intentional exposure of genitalia, buttocks, or female breasts to one or more persons. The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the defendant exposed his or her . . . genitals, buttocks, or female breasts to one or more persons; (2) the defendant did so intentionally; (3) the defendant did so \u2018openly,\u2019 that is, either he or she intended public exposure, or he or she recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of public exposure, to others who might be offended by such conduct; (4) the defendant\u2019s act was done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock; and (5) one or more persons were in fact alarmed or shocked by the defendant\u2019s exposing himself or herself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Notwithstanding this enunciation of the elements, the defendant argues that the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to him,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it fails to define the term \u201cexposure\u201d and provide him with notice that his conduct was criminal. In reviewing the statute as challenged, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 622, 627 (2004). In that light, there is no question whatsoever that the defendant displayed his genitals and buttocks through his compression shorts. There is also no question that exposing one\u2019s genitals or buttocks, in conjunction with the other elements of the crime, violates the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 497-499.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Accordingly, the crux of our inquiry is whether exposure requires a naked display or whether it is possible to expose a body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>part through a covering. We turn to \u201ccommon understanding and practices\u201d to assist our analysis. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971) (\u201c[I]f the language which is challenged conveys sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices, it is constitutionally adequate\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. King, 374 Mass. 5, 12 (1977) (turning to \u201ccommon understanding for definition\u201d of \u201clewd, wanton, and lascivious speech\u201d and \u201cprostitution\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arthur, </em>420 Mass. 535, 540 (1995) (considering whether pubic hair fell within the \u201ccommonly understood meaning\u201d of \u201cgenitalia\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, 461 </em>Mass. 371, 378 (2014) (turning to common understanding to define \u201cpartial nudity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We consider the hypothetical scenario of a person wearing shorts made from cellophane instead of the material that the defendant wore. We think that such conduct certainly falls within a common understanding of exposure, as the person\u2019s genitals and buttocks would be completely visible, regardless of the covering.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We see no meaningful difference between wearing cellophane shorts and the defendant\u2019s choice to wear shorts that were sufficiently revealing to a degree that the public could see the \u201cflesh color of his skin,\u201d his buttocks, and his genitals. While we are sensitive to the fine line between an individual\u2019s freedom of expression and the criminal nature of the conduct prohibited by the statute, the defendant\u2019s conduct in this case went far beyond the reasonable bounds of permissible expression. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. 125, 126 (2008) (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, is not facially unconstitutional, even though it restricts \u201cexpressive conduct,\u201d because our case law limits the statute\u2019s reach to conduct \u201cimposed upon an unsuspecting or unwilling audience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">We also consider that the Supreme Judicial Court recently opined that exposure is \u201cgenerally defined as \u2018an act of exposing,\u2019 \u2018a condition or instance of being laid bare or exposed to view,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cto lay open to view; lay bare; make known.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, supra </em>at 377, quoting from Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 802 (2002), and American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 626 (4th ed. 2006). The defendant in this case certainly \u201copened,\u201d or \u201cexposed,\u201d his genitals and buttocks \u201cto view\u201d and made them \u201cknown.\u201d We think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>displaying something such that it is clearly visible, even while wearing shorts of the sort worn by the defendant, fits within these definitions of \u201cexposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">In concluding that the defendant\u2019s conduct fell within a common understanding of exposure and that the statute was not vague as applied to the defendant, we note that the vagueness doctrine recognizes \u201cthe practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass, at 580, quoting from <em>Colten </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 110 (1972). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass, at 496 (\u201c[M]ere difficulty in determining whether certain marginal of-fences are within the meaning of the language under attack as vague does not automatically render it unconstitutional for indefiniteness\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miozza, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 567, 570 (2006), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 301-302 (1994), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 508 (1995) (\u201c[A] statute is not vague merely because \u2018it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard\u2019 \u201d). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>439 Mass, at 501 (holding that the defendant could not be prosecuted under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, \u201cfor exposing his buttocks\u201d because all prior cases at that time involved genitalia, which is commonly understood to include reproductive organs, not the buttocks).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Although our case law does not directly address exposure through a covering,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant nonetheless had fair warning that his conduct was prohibited because a common understanding of exposure certainly includes his conduct in the Target store. We believe that a person of \u201ccommon intelligence\u201d would not have difficulty imagining that the statute proscribes displaying one\u2019s genitals and buttocks through sheer material. Accordingly, we conclude that a person indeed exposes himself or herself where his or her genitals, buttocks, or female breasts are clearly visible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to the public, regardless of whether the person is naked or wearing a see-through covering.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the trial judge did not err in denying the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">2. <em>Motion for a required finding. </em>The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty because the judge did not apply the rule of lenity in defining \u201cexposure\u201d and because there was insufficient evidence that the defendant intentionally or recklessly exposed himself to the public.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In reviewing a denial, we ask, \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arce, 461 </em>Mass. 329, 333 (2014), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Under the rule of lenity, we interpret ambiguous statutory language in a criminal defendant\u2019s favor. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maloney, 441 </em>Mass. 577, 584-585 (2006). \u201cHowever, the rule of lenity \u2018is a guide for resolving ambiguity, rather than a rigid requirement that we interpret each statute in the manner most favorable to defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roucoulet, </em>413 Mass. 647, 652-653 (1992). Just as we concluded that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, is not void for vagueness, we also conclude that the statute is not ambiguous. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, exposure is a word with a commonly understood meaning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>431 Mass. 44, 47 (2000) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s vagueness and ambiguity arguments where the phrase, \u201cany escape from custody of the department,\u201d was \u201cwithin common understanding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Moreover, even if we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s most favorable suggested definition of exposure, \u201cto lay bare or un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>cover,\u201d a rational trier of fact could have returned a guilty verdict. Based on the testimony presented at trial, a rational juror could have found that the defendant was \u201cbared\u201d or \u201cuncovered,\u201d in that he wore \u201csee-through\u201d shorts that displayed his skin tone, genitals, and buttocks instead of the pants he later used to cover himself when the police arrived. We again consider the hypothetical scenario regarding cellophane and suggest that a rational juror could find that a person wearing cellophane shorts was \u201cbare\u201d or \u201cuncovered,\u201d just as a rational juror could have made such a finding here. We also conclude that a rational juror could have found that the defendant acted intentionally or recklessly given that, among other behavior indicating intent, the defendant asked permission to wear his shorts in the store and immediately covered himself with pants when the police arrived. The denial of the motion was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in providing a jury instruction that did not include the defendant\u2019s suggested definition of exposure. We review the instruction, to which the defendant objected, for prejudicial error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Szlachta, </em>463 Mass. 37, 45 (2012). In doing so, we are mindful that a trial judge has discretion in giving jury instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Robinson, 449 Mass. 1, 7-8 (2007). Specifically, a trial judge may use a dictionary in instructing jurors on statutorily undefined terms. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>442 Mass. 185, 194-195 (2004) (trial judge did not err in using Webster\u2019s Dictionary to define \u201cpoison\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 624, 629 (2009), <em>S.C., </em>456 Mass. 135 (2010) (trial judge did not err in using a dictionary definition where the definition embodied the word\u2019s \u201cusual and accepted meanings\u201d). Here, although the trial judge did not use the exact definition suggested by the defendant, the judge provided an acceptable dictionary definition couched in important language that \u201c[t]he word expose is not a technical legal term\u201d and the term should \u201cbe understood in its common meaning.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, supra </em>(we consider the charge as a whole). We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in giving the instruction because he did not apply the doctrine of lenity in defining \u201cexposure.\u201d We, again, note that exposure is not ambiguous and that the doctrine of lenity does not apply. We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>elude that there was no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The statute is not unconstitutionally vague on its face. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ora, </em>451 Mass. 125, 126 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Indeed, defense counsel conceded, at oral argument, that wearing shorts made from \u201cSaran Wrap\u201d would constitute exposure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>we considered whether a defendant who was caught \u201cmasturbating in a pair of women\u2019s underpants near a window in the master bedroom\u201d indecently exposed himself under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 181-182 (1987). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984) (stating that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, which criminalizes \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d are similar). We held that there was insufficient evidence to convict because the defendant\u2019s conduct was not \u201cpublic.\u201d We did not address whether the defendant had \u201cexposed\u201d himself while wearing underwear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We acknowledge that there may be a fine line regarding the acceptable opacity of clothing. We limit our holding to the facts in this case, where the defendant\u2019s genitals and buttocks were clearly visible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty on both counts: open and gross lewdness, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, and accosting a person of the opposite sex, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53. While he moved genetically on the count charging accosting a member of the opposite sex, the main focus of his argument was that the provisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, are unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, he does not press his argument as to the count charging a violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, nor did he do so at oral argument. In light of our decision herein, however, we are persuaded that the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to support convictions on both counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
