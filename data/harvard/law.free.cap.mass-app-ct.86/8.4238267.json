L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. He raises three issues on appeal: (1) whether a qualified examiner may testify regarding his evaluation of the credibility of various statements made by the petitioner during the clinical interview; (2) whether the trial judge properly excluded from the trial the results of a penile plethysmograph assessment (PPG test) by the treatment center, including references to the assessment in a qualified examiner\u2019s report, when there had been no attempt to establish the reliability of the assessment; (3) whether the judge also properly excluded evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>on the possible effects of reduced testosterone resulting from aging on the likelihood of reoffending, when the petitioner had never been tested and therefore could submit no evidence of his own testosterone levels. We affirm, as we discern no error in any of the trial judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>Background. </em>The petitioner is currently civilly committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. At trial, the Commonwealth presented the reports and testimony of two qualified examiners, Michael Henry, Psy.D., and Gregg Belle, Ph.D., as well as the testimony and report of a member of the community access board (CAB), Katrin Rouse-Weir, Ed.D. All diagnosed the petitioner with pedophilia and determined that he remained a sexually dangerous person (SDP). The petitioner presented the testimony of Eric Brown, Psy.D., and Joseph J. Plaud, Ph.D, each of whom opined that Gammell was no longer an SDP.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The jury were warranted in finding the following facts regarding the petitioner\u2019s history of offenses. The petitioner, age fifty-four at the time of trial, first offended at the age of twelve or thirteen, when he engaged in sexual activity with his eleven year old neighbor. He was adjudicated delinquent of indecent assault and battery and placed on probation. While on probation, he again engaged in sexual activity with the same girl. His probation was revoked. In 1991, when he was thirty-four, he sexually molested a two year old girl at least twenty times over a seven or eight month period, including fondling the child\u2019s chest, buttocks, and vagina. He was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to eight to ten years in State prison, three to serve, for indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen. While on probation, he was convicted of an assault and battery on his girlfriend and was sentenced to serve the remainder of his sentence. Testimony was also presented regarding the petitioner\u2019s admission that he sexually assaulted his girlfriend\u2019s eight year old daughter in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Testimony regarding the petitioner\u2019s credibility. </em>At trial, one of the qualified examiners, Michael Henry, testified regarding various statements made by the petitioner to him during a 2006 clinical examination provided for by statute. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(a). In response to the petitioner\u2019s denial of having sexual fantasises about children, Henry said, \u201c[M]y impression then and my impression remains that it\u2019s inaccurate. It\u2019s a falsehood, that he is not telling the truth.\u201d Elsewhere, Henry referred to his report: \u201cMr. Gammell stated that he only sexually assaulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>[the two year old girl] on one occasion and denied previous reports that he molested the child on multiple occasions .... I didn\u2019t credit it as a truthful statement.\u201d He also explained that the petitioner \u201ctalks about sort of a very improbable process of, in his mind, turning a two year old child into an 18 year old, that goes from a toddler-age person to someone with large breasts and buttocks and, essentially, that\u2019s what he was truly interested in____It\u2019s very improbable, so I didn\u2019t really credit it as a truthful statement. I saw it as his attempt to be deceptive and avoid the obvious topic [that he] molested a child.\u201d Henry stated that he did not \u201ccredit\u201d Gammell\u2019s statement that he had his last fantasy about a child after his arrest for his offense with the two year old child in 1991. Discussing the petitioner\u2019s attraction to children, Henry said that Gammell was not \u201cbeing open and frank and truthful about his problem or that he has any kind of appreciation about what this means about him and what he\u2019s going to need to do to keep himself and other people safe in the future.\u201d There were no objections to any of these statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">We have not previously addressed the question whether a qualified examiner can testify as to his opinion regarding the credibility of statements made by a petitioner during the clinical examination as part of his evaluation of the sexual dangerousness of the petitioner. Relying on criminal cases, and the general rule set out therein, the petitioner states, \u201cNo witness, expert or not, may offer an opinion as to the credibility of another witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polk, </em>462 Mass. 23, 36 (2012). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ianello, </em>401 Mass. 197, 201-202 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 504 (1991). We conclude, however, that the distinct statutory responsibilities of the qualified examiners create an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\u201cThere can be no question that qualified examiners are central to the statutory scheme designed to evaluate the likelihood of a sex offender to reoffend. . . . Within that scheme, the qualified examiners are established as independent, court-appointed experts. They are integral to nearly every step of the civil commitment process set out in G. L. c. 123A.\u201d <em>Johnstone, petitioner, </em>453 Mass. 544, 551 (2009) (quotation and citations omitted). Unless at least one of the qualified examiners concludes that a petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>is sexually dangerous, the petitioner cannot be civilly committed. \u201c[I]f the petitioner in a discharge proceeding refuses to be personally interviewed by examiners and lacks good cause for doing so, \u2018such person shall be deemed to have waived his right to a hearing on the petition and the petition shall be dismissed upon motion filed by the [Commonwealth. \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551-552, quoting from G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The statute also provides a \u201c \u2018very radical departure\u2019 from ordinary evidentiary rules,\u201d particularly in regard to the qualified examiners. <em>McHoul, petitioner, </em>445 Mass. 143, 147 (2005), quoting from <em>Andrews, petitioner, </em>368 Mass. 468, 473 (1975). According to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(c), \u201cJuvenile and adult court probation records, psychiatric and psychological records and reports of the person named in the petition, <em>including the report of any qualified examiner, . . . </em>police reports relating to such person\u2019s prior sexual offenses, incident reports arising out of such person\u2019s incarceration or custody, oral or written statements prepared for and to be offered at the trial by the victims of the person who is the subject of the petition and any other evidence tending to show that such person is or is not a sexually dangerous person shall be admissible at the trial if such written information has been provided to opposing counsel reasonably in advance of trial.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The statute further provides that \u201cthe court shall supply to the qualified examiners copies\u201d of many of the reports and much of the information referenced above. G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(6). If such reports have been admitted in evidence, it is permissible for the qualified examiners \u201cto reference that evidence in their own expert testimony.\u201d <em>McHoul, petitioner, supra </em>at 146. The court has rejected arguments that the qualified examiners \u201cshould not have been permitted to testify to the jury about out-of-court statements the petitioner made to others and observation of the petitioner\u2019s conduct made by others on which the [qualified examiners] based their opinions,\u201d so long as those statements and observations appeared in reports made admissible by the SDP statute itself. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>In this context, we conclude that the Legislature also intended that the qualified examiners be permitted to testify concerning the credibility of statements made by the petitioner to the qualified examiner in the clinical evaluation required by statute, if such credibility determinations figure into their opinion regarding the sexual dangerousness of the petitioner. The qualified examiner\u2019s opinion regarding the sexual dangerousness of the petitioner is critical to the entire evaluation process. Essential to that evaluation is the qualified examiner\u2019s opinion regarding the information being provided by the petitioner during the clinical evaluation. This includes whether the petitioner is being truthful regarding his prior sexual offenses, his present attraction to children, and his future ability to control his sexual impulses. Not allowing such testimony by the qualified examiner would require qualified examiners to present to the jury an incomplete and distorted basis for their opinions. The statute clearly intends just the opposite: the qualified examiners are to be presented all relevant information and provide a thorough report of their analysis, which is to be presented to the jury, notwithstanding the ordinary rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">To ensure that the qualified examiners do not usurp the role of the jury, the petitioner must be able to present his own experts, who will have similar freedom to opine on the credibility of the petitioner\u2019s testimony during their own clinical evaluations. See <em>Santos, petitioner, </em>461 Mass. 565, 570 (2012). That is exactly what occurred in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">2. <em>Exclusion of penile plethysmograph evidence. </em>Prior to trial, the Commonwealth moved to exclude from trial all evidence of the results of a PPG test administered to the petitioner during his commitment to the treatment center, including references to the PPG test in the petitioner\u2019s experts\u2019 reports, or the reports of the qualified examiner or the CAB. The Commonwealth moved to exclude the evidence on the ground that PPG testing did not meet the Daubert-Lanigan<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> standards for admissibility. The petitioner opposed the motion, claiming the PPG test was reliable. When the issue was raised on the day of trial, the judge concluded that the evidence was inadmissible without a <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>hearing, which the petitioner had not requested. During the trial, the pet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>itioner asked the judge to reconsider her exclusion of the PPG evidence, but the request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">On appeal, the petitioner argues that the <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>requirements are inapplicable to G. L. c. 123A cases. He relies on the language in the statute making reports of the qualified examiners and the CAB admissible, as well as the decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradway, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 280 (2004), and <em>Santos, petitioner, supra. </em>In <em>Bradway, </em>this court concluded, based on well-established precedent, that the Legislature could expressly overrule evidentiary requirements. See <em>Bradway, supra </em>at 284-285. See also <em>McHoul, petitioner, </em>445 Mass, at 147-148 (\u201c[W]e have repeatedly applied the evidentiary rules prescribed by the Legislature for such proceedings\u201d). We explained that the qualified examiners\u2019 clinical evaluations, reports, and testimony were all required, and were made admissible by statute, as the \u201cLegislature has made a considered decision to draw on qualified and experienced professionals in the field to bring to bear their knowledge and informed judgment on the necessary, but difficult, task of evaluating whether sex offenders are likely to reoffend.\u201d <em>Bradway, supra </em>at 287. We therefore rejected the petitioner\u2019s contention in that case that <em>\u201cDaubert-Lanigan </em>assessment is required, and will not be satisfied, because the qualified examiners\u2019 opinion testimony is inherently unreliable, particularly when it is based on clinical evaluation rather than actuarial factors.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In <em>Santos, </em>the court \u201cagree[d] with the petitioner that excluding his experts\u2019 reports could create an unfair imbalance of evidence, especially because it would otherwise be difficult for petitioners to respond to the information in the CAB and qualified examiner reports, much of which is hearsay.\u201d <em>Santos, supra </em>at 569. The court further explained that \u201c[t]he petitioner\u2019s experts\u2019 reports ought to be have been admitted, but only on the same basis as those of the qualified examiners and the CAB.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573 n.ll. That basis, the court explained, included redactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The petitioner extrapolates from these cases to argue that PPG testing evidence is not subject to <em>Daubert-Lanigan </em>review, and there could be no redaction of any references to PPG testing in the reports prepared by the qualified examiners, the CAB, or the petitioner\u2019s own experts. The ultimate question is again whether the Legislature intended to override the ordinary rules of evidence. Unlike the clinical evaluation addressed in <em>Bradway, supra, </em>PPG testing is not expressly provided for by statute as an essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tial aspect of a qualified examiner\u2019s own review. Rather, it is an assessment device that was employed by the treatment center in this case, and only referenced in passing in the CAB report and in one of the qualified examiner\u2019s reports. The petitioner nevertheless relies on these references, and the reasoning in <em>Bradway </em>and <em>Santos, </em>to argue that the PPG testing evidence is per se admissible. But the Legislature\u2019s requirement that the qualified examiners\u2019 reports be admissible does not mean that everything in the reports is automatically exempt from further review for admissibility and redaction. Moreover, whether particular redactions are permissible or required in the otherwise admissible reports and testimony of these experts is not resolved in <em>Bradway </em>and <em>Santos </em>but, rather, must be analyzed according to the standards set out in <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 335-337 (2002); and <em>McHoul, petitioner, supra </em>at 149-151.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In <em>Markvart, </em>the court was presented with the admissibility in c. 123A proceedings of police reports and witness statements from a nol pressed complaint that had been considered by qualified examiners. See <em>Markvart, supra </em>at 332. The court concluded that the reports were not independently admissible according to the statute, as they were not reports or statements related to convictions or adjudications, and were therefore subject to redaction from the qualified examiners\u2019 reports presented to the jury according to the principles set out in <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, supra. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 336-337. The court further explained that the statute expressly contemplated that \u201cqualified examiners may use \u2018such other information as may be pertinent or helpful to the examiners in making the diagnosis and recommendation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(A). In determining what information meets that requirement the court stated: \u201cQualified examiners, as expert witnesses, may base their opinions on (1) facts personally observed; (2) evidence already in the records or which the parties represent will be admitted during the course of the proceedings . . . ; and (3) <em>facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible </em>and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\" <em>Id. </em>at 337, quoting from <em>Department of Youth Servs., supra. </em>The court also noted that a voir dire may be required to determine whether the facts or data are independently admissible, and defense counsel may request such a voir dire. <em>Id. </em>at 337 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We interpret this line of cases to draw a distinction between evidence that is independently made admissible by statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>evidence that remains subject to further consideration and redaction. We conclude that the PPG tests here fall into the latter category. They are not expressly made admissible by statute, nor are they an essential part of the qualified examiners\u2019 evaluation as set out in the statute. Rather, they are an assessment device employed by the treatment center that must be independently admissible and constitute a permissible basis for a qualified examiner to rely on in formulating an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Here, we have no basis from the record or case law to determine whether PPG tests constitute a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion. This is not an ordinary medical procedure, test, or report. The petitioner made no attempt to \u201clay an adequate foundation either by establishing general acceptance in the scientific community or by showing that the evidence is reliable or valid through alternate means.\u201d <em>Canavan\u2019s Case, </em>432 Mass. 304, 310 (2000). Nor did he request a voir dire. See <em>Markvardt, supra </em>at 337 n.5. The one case provided by the petitioner to the trial judge to support the admission of the testing, <em>Commitment of Sandry, SCI </em>Ill. App. 3d 949 (2006), is from out of State and is inconclusive. In these circumstances, we discern no error in the redaction of the report to exclude the PPG test.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">3. <em>Reduced testosterone levels. </em>Finally, the petitioner claims that the judge erred in sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to questioning on the effects of declining testosterone resulting from aging on the risk of reoffending. We conclude that the judge properly rejected this line of questioning as entirely speculative as there had never been testing of the petitioner\u2019s testosterone levels, and thus there was no evidence to present on the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b40-9\">For cases applying a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice standard to SDP cases, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starkus, </em>69 Mass.

The court concluded that the reports made admissible by statute, \u201cby their nature, often include the gathering of information from a variety of hearsay sources,\u201d thus signifying \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s determination that such hearsay should be admitted in sexually dangerous person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153.
