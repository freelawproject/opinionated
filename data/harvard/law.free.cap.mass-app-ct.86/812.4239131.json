L. c. 265, \u00a7 26 (count 1); assault by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B(\u00bf&gt;) (count 2); assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A (count 3); assault and battery causing serious bodily injury, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(6)(i) (count 4); and malicious destruction of property, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127 (count 5). On appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court determined there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction on count 4, assault and battery causing serious bodily injury, and ordered that judgment enter for the defendant on that count.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The case was remanded for resen-tencing on the remaining counts of the indictment. See <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>464 Mass. 355, 364 (2013). At resentencing, the judge (who was not the trial judge) retained the original sentences on counts 1, 3, and 5. On count 2, for which the defendant had already completed his original sentence of from two to five years in State prison concurrent with count 1 (see the Appendix to this opinion), the judge imposed a five-year term of probation from and after the committed sentence in count 1. The defendant maintains that this aspect of the resentencing violated principles of double jeopardy and due process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cam-ming, </em>466 Mass. 467 (2013) <em>(Camming). </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leggett, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. 730 (2012) <em>(Leggett). </em>We vacate the sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was originally sentenced on December 20, 2007, to a period of from eight to ten years in State prison on count 1, the kidnapping conviction, and to a period of two to five years in State prison on count 4, the since-vacated conviction, to run on and after the sentence on count l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was sentenced to concurrent terms of incarceration of up to five years on the remaining counts of the indictment. See Appendix. Resentencing occurred over five years later, on April 30, 2013. By this time the concurrent terms of incarceration had been fully served, including the original sentence of from two to five years in State prison on count 2, assault by means of a dangerous weapon. See Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The judge reimposed the eight- to ten-year sentence on count 1, the kidnapping conviction. Relying on <em>Leggett, supra, </em>he resentenced the defendant to a five-year term of probation on count 2, to run on and after the sentence on count l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The original aggregate sentence of a maximum fifteen years\u2019 incarceration was converted to an aggregate sentence of up to ten years\u2019 incarceration and five years\u2019 probation. This was accomplished, however, by vacating the original sentence (which had already been served) on count 2, and adding a new probationary term on and after the original sentence on count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\"><em>Double jeopardy. </em>The double jeopardy clause, which protects a defendant against \u201cmultiple punishments for the same offense,... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>\u2018represents a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant\u2019s benefit\u2019 in criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass. 11, 19 (2010), quoting from <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 260, 271-272, 274, cert, denied, 459 U.S. 864 (1982). \u201cIn this Commonwealth, the subject of double jeopardy generally has been treated as a matter of common law rather than as a question under the Constitution of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, supra </em>at 20, quoting from <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 271 n.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The defendant asserts that it was impermissible to resentence him to an additional term of probation on count 2, because he had already served the two- to five-year sentence in full at the time of resentencing. The Commonwealth contends that the defendant had no expectation of finality in his sentence until all of the aggregate sentence had been served, and that so long as the aggregate sentence on resentencing does not exceed the original aggregate sentence, there is no infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\"><em>Leggett </em>held that a defendant \u201cdoes not have a reasonable expectation of finality in any one part or element of [an interdependent] bundle of sentences, but rather, in the entirety of the scheme.\u201d <em>Cumming, </em>466 Mass, at 471, quoting from <em>Leggett, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 736-737. In <em>Leggett, </em>the defendant challenged the entire bundle of sentences on the ground of improper comments made by the judge during sentencing. After a successful appeal from the denial of his motion for resentencing, Leggett\u2019s original aggregate sentence of from nineteen to twenty years was vacated, and he was resentenced to a term of from sixteen years to sixteen years and one day and five years of postrelease probation. 82 Mass. App. Ct. at 732-733. Leggett contended that the new probationary terms were illegal because they were imposed with respect to sentences already fully served. <em>Id. </em>at 733-734. In a divided opinion, we held that the \u201cvacation of a sentencing scheme creates a clean slate for resentencing,\u201d and rejected the notion that \u201ca reasonable expectation of finality vests in a fully served component sentence of a scheme of multiple sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">A trio of cases decided since <em>Leggett </em>calls into question the breadth of its holding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Cumming, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court, citing <em>Leggett, </em>held that a defendant who files a motion to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the illegal component of an interdependent sentence \u201cknowingly expose [s] himself to the possibility that his entire sentencing scheme might be restructured.\u201d <em>Cumming, </em>466 Mass, at 471. The court limited that restructuring, however, to (1) component sentences that were still outstanding at the time of resentencing, and (2) a sentencing scheme that did not exceed the maximum aggregate sentence of the lawful sentence originally imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 472-474, citing <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>387 Mass. 291, 296 (1982). As the court later reiterated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>468 Mass. 294, 311 (2014) <em>(Cole), </em>in holding that resentencing was barred where the probationary sentence had been served in full, resentencing \u201c[can]not increase the \u2018aggregate punishment\u2019 imposed under the original sentence because of the defendant\u2019s right to be free from double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, quoting from <em>Cumming, supra </em>at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parrillo, </em>468 Mass. 318 (2014) <em>(Parrillo), </em>decided the same day as <em>Cole, </em>again stated that \u201cto accord with double jeopardy principles, resentencing must not result in any increase in the aggregate punishment and must be \u2018quantitatively fair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, quoting from <em>Leggett, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 737. <em>Parrillo </em>also expressly stated that which was implicit in <em>Cumming.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That is, where a component sentence in an interdependent sentencing scheme has been served, the defendant may not be resentenced in a manner that increases his or her punishment on the component sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">\u201cThe judge may not resentence the defendant on the two convictions for which the defendant has already served his sentence, because any such resentencing would result in an increase in punishment in violation of double jeopardy principles. See <em>Cumming, </em>466 Mass, at 473-474. The judge in his sound discretion may resentence on the [conviction for which the defendant is currently on probation under a suspended sentence], provided the new sentence satisfies the double jeopardy principles set forth in <em>Cumming, supra.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\"><em>Parrillo, </em>468 Mass, at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Both parties to this appeal have proceeded on the basis that it is governed, at least in part, by <em>Cumming. </em>In this case, the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>issue before the Supreme Judicial Court in the defendant\u2019s first appeal was the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conviction on count 2, assault and battery causing serious bodily injury, and the sole relief sought was the entry of judgment for the defendant on that count. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>464 Mass, at 360, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979); <em>id. </em>at 356, 364. No challenge was made to the other convictions or component sentences, and the \u201clawful components of the defendant\u2019s sentences were in one sense final\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy. <em>Cumming, </em>466 Mass, at 472. Here, by arguing successfully that there was insufficient evidence to support one of his convictions, the defendant eliminated one component of a sentencing scheme, and thereby exposed himself (at most) to the risk inherent in resentencing in light of the interdependent nature of the original sentences imposed. Compare <em>Cumming, Cole, </em>and <em>Parrillo, supra </em>(defendants did not challenge their convictions, but succeeded in eliminating one component of a sentencing scheme).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">That risk is delimited by our common law of double jeopardy, which requires that the restructured scheme be \u201cquantitatively fair.\u201d <em>Cumming, supra </em>at 472.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant had a legitimate expectation of finality in his sentence once served.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Parrillo, </em>468 Mass, at 321. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selavka, </em>469 Mass. 502, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>503, 514 (2014) (Commonwealth\u2019s effort to correct illegal sentence barred by double jeopardy where defendant had a reasonable expectation of finality in a partially served illegal sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">This case is therefore controlled in all material respects by the reasoning of <em>Porrillo.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Having served his entire original sentence on count 2, the defendant could not be resentenced on that conviction. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that a term of probation does not constitute an additional punishment, see <em>Leggett, </em>82 Mass. App. Ct. at 739, is foreclosed by <em>Cumming, </em>which holds that the prospect of incarceration for a violation of probation constitutes punishment for purposes of double jeopardy. 466 Mass, at 473-474, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass, at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant may not be resentenced on counts 2, 3, or 5, for which he has already served his sentences. If the defendant has not yet completed his sentence on count 1, the judge, in his sound discretion, may resentence the defendant on that count, provided the new sentence satisfies the double jeopardy principles set forth in <em>Cumming, Cole, </em>and <em>Parrillo. </em>The defendant\u2019s sentences are vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"aya-dedup-1\">Sentences, Commonwealth vs. Scott, No. HDCR2007-00088.</p>\n<p id=\"ate-dedup-0\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\">In a decision pursuant to our rule 1:28, this court had affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions.
