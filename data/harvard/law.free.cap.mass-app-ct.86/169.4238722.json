L. c. 208, \u00a7 49(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\"><em>Background. </em>The facts are uncontested. After eight years of marriage the parties divorced on November 9, 2010. The parties entered into a separation agreement addressing various topics, including the division of marital assets, payment of the expenses of medical insurance and education for the couple\u2019s children, and the parties\u2019 respective obligations to maintain life insurance. Germane to the issue raised on appeal, the parties also stipulated to two lump sum payments of $500,000 in lieu of periodic alimony payments. The payments were due to be paid by the wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to the husband on or before December 1, 2013, and on or before December 1, 2018. Unpaid amounts were subject to a four percent annual interest payment commencing December 1, 2011. These annual payments were terminable upon the death of either party or upon the payment in full of the two lump sums, whichever occurred earlier. The agreement was incorporated into the judgment of divorce, specifically provided that it would survive the judgment, and contained no other provision for termination of these enumerated obligations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The husband remarried in June of 2012, after the first four percent annual payment was made. Shortly thereafter the wife filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Probate and Family Court asserting that all alimony obligations \u201cwere terminated by operation of law.\u201d She appeals from the dismissal of her complaint and the subsequent denial of her motion to alter or amend the judgment. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\"><em>Proceedings in the Probate and Family Court. </em>The husband\u2019s motion to dismiss the wife\u2019s complaint relied on the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s statement in <em>Keller </em>v. O\u2019Brien, 420 Mass. 820, 826 (1995), that remarriage would \u201cnot of itself automatically terminate alimony\u201d unless \u201cotherwise provided in the judgment of divorce or in an agreement between the parties.\u201d The wife countered this citation with a motion for judgment on the pleadings invoking G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 <em>49(a), </em>a provision of the Alimony Reform Act, which became effective on March 1, 2012, and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>vides that \u201c[gjeneral term alimony shall terminate upon the remarriage of the recipient.\u201d The wife also pointed to St. 2011, c. 124, \u00a7 4(6), which provides that \u201c[ejxisting alimony awards shall be deemed general term alimony.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In a further response the husband invoked St. 2011, c. 124, \u00a7 4(c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which states that certain enumerated sections of c. 208, including \u00a7 49 on which the wife relied, do not \u201cprovide a right to seek modification of an existing alimony judgment ... in which the parties have expressed their intention that their agreed alimony provisions survive the judgment and therefore are not modifiable.\u201d The wife thereupon disputed the applicability of \u00a7 4(c) with the argument that she was not seeking to \u201cmodify\u201d a surviving agreement but, rather, to eliminate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The judge discharged her unenviable task of distilling these numerous salvos by dismissing the wife\u2019s complaint with a succinct order noting the parties\u2019 agreement to incorporate the stipulation into a judgment, and the clear language that it would survive the judgment. The judge pointed out that the Alimony Reform Act was pending at the time the parties entered into the agreement, and that the lump sum payments were inextricably entwined with a general asset and property division which was \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>In their agreement, the parties denominated the lump sum payments in question here not as \u201calimony,\u201d but as payments made as consideration for the husband\u2019s \u201cwaiver of periodic alimony.\u201d Two sentences later, in the same document, the four percent interest payments due on unpaid portions of the lump sum payments are described as \u201cannual alimony payment^].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We conclude that the judgment of divorce, incorporating the language of the agreement, renders the four percent interest payments alimony. The lump sum payments, however, are specifically classified as payments that are not alimony, but replace it. The legal arguments advanced by the parties, both in the Probate and Family Court and on appeal, refer exclusively to alimony obligations. As it does not change the result in either instance, we affirm the judge\u2019s decision on two different rationales.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>1. <em>Lump sum payments. </em>As stated, the complaint does not properly address this obligation. The termination of all alimony payments resulting from remarriage alleged by the wife, even if correct, would not affect payments that the wife herself agreed to make in consideration of the husband\u2019s waiver of alimony. The judge\u2019s finding that the over-all division of marital property was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d is particularly pertinent in this context.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">2. <em>Four percent interest payments. </em>We consider these payments, agreed upon to provide the husband with income generated by the unpaid amount of the lump sum funds (and possibly as an incentive for the wife to pay the lump sum prior to the due dates) to be alimony, consistent with the language used by the parties. Accordingly, we consider the statutory provisions invoked by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We do not view the Alimony Reform Act as a direct contradiction of the holding in <em>Keller </em>v. O\u2019Brien, 420 Mass, at 826-827. Rather, it represents a change of emphasis in that alimony, deemed not to terminate \u201cautomatically\u201d by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Keller, </em>now cannot be modified under the statute if the parties have agreed that alimony survives the judgment of divorce. See St. 2011, c. 124, \u00a7 4(c). As the husband aptly points out, the parties\u2019 agreement in this case provides that it shall survive the judgment of divorce, excepting only the provisions relating to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We consider the wife\u2019s argument that she is not seeking to \u201cmodify\u201d alimony, hence that St. 2011, c. 124, \u00a7 4(c), is inapplicable here, unavailing. The clearly expressed legislative intent of the statute is to provide finality to alimony agreements that the parties have designated as final, either by designating them as \u201cnot modifiable\u201d or achieving the same result by agreeing that alimony provisions shall \u201csurvive the judgment.\u201d In this context we consider termination to be no more than a maximum form of modification, all the more disfavored as a result. We note the use of interspersed terms such as \u201csuspended, reduced or terminated\u201d in describing the consequence of a recipient spouse\u2019s cohabitation, G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 <em>49(d), </em>as well as the use of \u201cmodified in duration\u201d as a substitute for termination. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 49(e). The wife\u2019s argument, taken to its logical conclusion, would interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the statute to prohibit reduction of an alimony obligation to one dollar, but to allow elimination altogether. See, e.g., <em>Bridgewater State Univ. Foundation </em>v. <em>Assessors of Bridgewater, </em>463 Mass. 154, 160 (2012) (court should adopt statutory interpretation that is most \u201creasonable and sensible in the circumstances\u201d), citing <em>Mailhot </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>375 Mass. 342, 348 (1978) (where strict, literal interpretation of statute \u201cis seen ... to lead to an awkward and even intolerable result, [it will be] abandoned for a more liberal or more encompassing approach\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion to amend judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-16\">See St. 2011, c. 124, codified at G.

The parties\u2019 respective waivers of alimony shall survive the entry of a Judgment of Divorce Nisi. In consideration for the Husband\u2019s waiver of periodic alimony from the Wife, the Wife shall pay to the Husband the sum of $500,000.00 on or before December 1, 2013, and a further sum of $500,000.00 on or before December 1, 2018, as non-taxable alimony to the Husband, and non-deductible by the Wife. In addition, the Wife shall pay to the Husband annually commencing Dec. 1, 2011, an amount for alimony equal to 4% of the outstanding indebtedness for lump sum alimony referred to above. This annual alimony payment and only the annual alimony payment, shall be taxable to the Husband and deductible by the Wife, and shall terminate on the Husband\u2019s death, the Wife\u2019s death or the payment of all sums due for lump sum alimony, whichever first occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">\u201c(16.)
