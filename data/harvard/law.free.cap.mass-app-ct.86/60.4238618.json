Pacific and the Levkoffs sued Preferred and its insured, Michael Lampro, principal of the landscaping company Steven Michael Designs (SMD), after SMD damaged the Levkoffs\u2019 property while performing tree and brush removal work. On appeal, Pacific claims that the Superior Court judge erred by concluding that the damage to the Levkoffs\u2019 property was not covered by SMD\u2019s commercial general liability insurance policy. Pacific argues that judgment on the pleadings should not have entered for Preferred on Pacific\u2019s G. L. c. 93A claim because, even if the Levkoffs\u2019 property damage fell outside of SMD\u2019s insurance policy, Preferred\u2019s conduct violated G. L. c. 93A. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In January, 2009, the Levkoffs contracted with SMD to perform landscaping services on their land in Monterey, Massachusetts. The Levkoffs were insured under a homeowners\u2019 insurance policy issued by Pacific, and SMD held a commercial general liability insurance policy through Preferred. The Levkoffs planned to build a vacation home on their property, which borders Lake Garfield and is considered an environmentally sensitive area. Prior to contracting with SMD, the Levkoffs presented their building and landscaping plans to the Monterey Conservation Commission (commission). The permits issued by the commission allowed the Levkoffs to pursue their landscaping plans so long as they did so in compliance with environmental regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The Levkoffs and SMD executed a $24,000 contract to remove trees and brush \u201cin accordance with\u201d the commission\u2019s permits and the Levkoffs\u2019 engineering plans. The contract held SMD \u201cresponsible for damage to new or existing work on the project to the lake, improper execution of work or failure to [take] the necessary precautions to prevent damages.\u201d The contract also required SMD to \u201crepair or replace such damage, and also obtain general liability insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">SMD hired a subcontractor to perform the landscaping on the Levkoffs\u2019 property. Although a preconstruction meeting was required by the commission, neither SMD nor its subcontractor consulted with the commission before carrying out the work. The subcontractor, for reasons not clear on the record, failed to follow the conditions outlined in the permits or the engineering plans. As the judge noted in his memorandum and order, the subcontractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u201cfailed to follow the restrictions in cutting the brash and trees and exceed[ed] the scope of work sanctioned by the permits. Instead, [he] cut a swath of trees and brush on the Levkoffs\u2019 property down to Lake Garfield.\u201d The land sloping near Lake Garfield was clear-cut, resulting in what the judge described as \u201can environmental nightmare for the Levkoffs.\u201d Although the damage was extensive, it was confined to the Levkoffs\u2019 property. Shortly after the incident, a representative of SMD met with the commission and accepted responsibility for the subcontractor\u2019s error. The lakeside slopes required costly remediation. Pacific paid over $100,000 on behalf of the Levkoffs to restore the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In July, 2009, Pacific notified SMD and Preferred of its sub-rogation claim. On March 16, 2010, Pacific sent SMD and Preferred settlement demands pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, and requested payment of \u201cthe full amount of damages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Preferred responded the next month and explained that it was still investigating the claim and stressed that the questions of liability and coverage were not clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On June 17, 2010, Pacific and the Levkoffs brought an action against SMD and Preferred alleging negligence and breach of contract against SMD for the improper work performed, and two violations of G. L. c. 93A for failure to settle their claim, one against SMD and the other against Preferred. Preferred successfully moved to sever and stay the G. L. c. 93A claim against it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the settlement of the first three counts, Preferred filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), to resolve the remaining c. 93A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">In a comprehensive and thoughtful memorandum, the judge allowed the motion for judgment on the pleadings and determined that the damages to the Levkoffs\u2019 land were excluded, on multiple grounds, from coverage by SMD\u2019s insurance policy. First, he held that SMD\u2019s faulty workmanship was not an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined by the policy and, consequently, was excluded from cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>age. Additionally, the judge held that two of the \u201cbusiness risk exclusions\u201d in SMD\u2019s insurance policy applied to the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cA defendant\u2019s rule 12(c) motion is \u2018actually a motion to dismiss ... [that] argues that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 529 (2002), quoting from J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 12.16 (1974). Our review is de nova. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers 1-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011). We accept as true the allegations in the complaint and draw every reasonable inference in favor of Pacific. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">a. <em>Chapter 93A. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, persons engaged in trade or commerce are prohibited from engaging in \u201c[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2. The law \u201cdistinguishes between \u2018consumer\u2019 and \u2018business\u2019 claims, the former actionable under \u00a7 9, the latter actionable under \u00a7 11.\u201d <em>Frullo </em>v. <em>Landenberger, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 814, 821 (2004). The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to specify whether Pacific\u2019s c. 93A claim against Preferred fell under \u00a7 9 or \u00a711. Instead, the plaintiffs claim they are entitled to recovery under both sections. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">After the clear-cutting, Pacific brought the c. 93A claim against Preferred, \u201cas subrogee of the Levkoffs\u201d and made settlement demands, \u201cas subrogee of the Levkoffs.\u201d Pacific did not bring any claims, in its capacity as an insurance company, against Preferred. See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Porter Leasing Corp., </em>386 Mass. 425, 427 (1982) (if a subrogee pays an obligation, \u201cit succeeds to the rights of the party it has paid\u201d). The \u201cbad faith\u201d that Pacific alleges concerned the settlement of the Levkoffs\u2019 subrogation claim, a matter related to damage to the Levkoffs\u2019 land, not any business activity. Because the Levkoffs were not \u201cengaged in trade or commerce,\u201d we treat the claim as one arising under \u00a7 9. See <em>Szalla </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>421 Mass. 448, 451 (1995) (\u201cc. 93A[, \u00a7 11,] requires that there be a commercial transaction between a person engaged in trade or commerce with another person engaged in trade or commerce\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">General Laws c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), outlines various \u201cacts and omissions\u201d that may constitute an \u201cunfair claim settlement practice.\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9). Included among them is the assertion made by Pacific that Preferred failed to \u201ceffectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(/). A violation of c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), is explicitly included as actionable conduct under c. 93A, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u00a7 9(1). See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indent. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 754 (1993). While the majority of c. 93A actions in this field involve an insured\u2019s attempt to enforce its rights against its own insurer, \u201cthe specific duty contained in subsection [3(9)](/) [of c. 176D] is not limited to those situations where the plaintiff enjoys contractual privity with the insurer.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass. 413, 419 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u201cOur standard for examining the adequacy of an insurer\u2019s response to a demand for relief under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9(3), is \u2018whether, in the circumstances, and in light of the complainant\u2019s demands, the offer is reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, citing <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Center, Inc., </em>392 Mass. 228, 234 (1984). A review of the reasonableness of an offer to settle necessarily includes an assessment of the underlying claim, because \u201ca duty to settle does not arise until \u2018liability has become reasonably clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421. Determining whether a claim is covered by the policy is essential to evaluating the reasonableness of the insurer\u2019s response to a demand. See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indent. Co., supra </em>at 763, citing R. Keeton &amp; A. Widiss, Insurance Law \u00a7 9.5(b)(l)(i), at 1046 (1988) (\u201cthe insurer is liable for any good faith settlement within the policy limits \u2014 subject, of course, to the insurer\u2019s right to an adjudication that the coverage applied to the loss\u201d). See also <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 168 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">An insurer may choose to defend its insured but disclaim a duty to indemnify. This is because the \u201cduty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 366, 368 (1996). <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>445 Mass. 502, 527 (2005). Accordingly, absent contractual provisions to the contrary, where there is no duty to defend, there can be no obligation to indemnify. See <em>A.W. Chesterton Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, supra </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">While virtuous because of its simplicity, the plaintiffs\u2019 theory, that \u201cliability is clear\u201d because SMD took responsibility for the clear-cutting, ignores the difference between identifying a responsible tortfeasor and asserting a successful claim for indemnification. The fact that SMD may be liable for the damages does not, on its own, resolve the question of Preferred\u2019s duty to indemnify. To determine Preferred\u2019s duty to indemnify, we examine whether the damage to the Levkoffs\u2019 property is a covered loss under SMD\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>b. <em>Coverage. </em>Questions concerning the interpretation of an insurance contract, including the applicability of coverage exclusions, are questions of law. See <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Allianz. Ins. Co., </em>413 Mass. 473,476 (1992); <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>First Fin. Ins. Co., </em>448 Mass. 1, 5 (2006). The burden is on the insurer to show the applicability of an exclusion. <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tal-houni, </em>413 Mass. 781, 785 (1992). We strictly construe exclusions in favor of coverage, but we \u201cread the policy as written\u201d and \u201care not free to revise it.\u201d See <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers \u2019 Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 281 (1997), quoting from <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Gilbane Bldg. Co., </em>391 Mass. 143, 147 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">i. <em>Occurrence. </em>The insurance policy that Preferred issued to SMD covered property damage caused by an \u201coccurrence,\u201d a term defined in the policy as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d Pacific claims that because SMD exceeded the scope of the work that it was hired to perform, its actions should be deemed accidental.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree. While SMD regrettably failed to follow the directions in the permit and engineering plans, that failure was not \u201can unexpected happening without intention or design.\u201d See <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>407 Mass. 354, 358 (1990) (noting the common definition of the term \u201caccident\u201d). Cutting more trees than directed to is not a fortuitous or unexpected consequence of performing tree removal work. See <em>Smartfoods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Northbrook Property &amp; Cas. Co., </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 242 (1993) (explaining that the word accident, \u201cby definition, implies the unexpected\u201d). As the judge noted, in the landscaping trade, \u201cthe possibility that unintended trees may be cut is clearly a normal, foreseeable, and expected incident of doing business,\u201d and not a \u201cfortuitous event for which liability insurance was designed.\u201d SMD\u2019s actions were, in retrospect, undesirable, but they were not accidental. As the judge properly determined, the clear-cutting was not an \u201coccurrence\u201d and, therefore, is not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">ii. <em>Business risk exclusions. </em>In addition to our conclusion that the clear-cutting was not an occurrence, the contract\u2019s business risk exclusions also provided Preferred an alternative defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>\u201cGeneral liability coverage is not intended as a guarantee of the insured\u2019s work, and for that reason, general liability policies contain \u2018business risk\u2019 exclusions.\u201d <em>Dorchester Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>First Kostas Corp., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 651, 654 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">SMD\u2019s policy contains two exclusions relevant here. Exclusion (j)(5) makes coverage inapplicable to damage to \u201c[t]hat particular part of any property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations, if the \u2018property damage\u2019 arises out of those operations.\u201d Exclusion (j)(6) bars coverage for \u201c[t]hat particular part of real property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \u2018your work\u2019 was incorrectly performed on it.\u201d The policy defines \u201cyour work\u201d as \u201c[w]ark or operations performed by you or on your behalf\u2019 and also includes \u201cfailure to provide warnings or instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Pacific claims that the business risk exclusions do not apply because SMD exceeded the scope of the permits. We disagree. SMD was hired to perform a variety of work on the Levkoffs\u2019 land. In addition to tree and brush removal, SMD was contracted to install pathways, create a beach area, and build a shed. The contract authorized SMD to operate throughout the Levkoffs lakeside property, and as a result, under (j)(5), the areas that were improperly clear-cut included \u201creal property on which [SMD\u2019s]... subcontractor ] . . . performed] operations.\u201d SMD was not excluded from any part of the Levkoffs\u2019 property, but even in circumstances where \u201cdamage occurred to property on only part of which the insured was retained to work, courts have held that the exclusion applies to the entire property.\u201d <em>Jet Line Servs. Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 711 (1989). Accordingly, we conclude that exclusion \u00ae(5) applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The goal of a general liability policy \u201cis to protect the insured from the claims of injury or damage to others, but not to insure against economic loss sustained by the insured due to repairing or replacing its own defective work or products.\u201d <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Betty Caplette Builders, Inc., </em>420 Mass. 87, 92 (1995), quoting from 2 R. Long, Liability Insurance \u00a7 11.09(2) (1993). When assessing whether exclusion (j)(6), the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion, is applicable, we distinguish between improper work performed by the insured that damages the property of a party to the contract, and damage done to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Clarendon Natl. Ins. Co., </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 660-662 (2010) (Clarendon), we held that certain business risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>exclusions in a general liability policy, similar to those in SMD\u2019s policy, did not apply to the damaged property of a third party. There, the contractor did not have authorization to invade the real property of a neighboring land owner. The claimant in <em>Clarendon </em>was an abutter to the insured\u2019s property who did not have a \u201ccontractual or other business relationship with the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. In contrast, the Levkoffs are seeking restoration costs for damages that resulted when work that they contracted with SMD to perform, on their own property, was improperly done. This claim fits squarely within exclusion (j)(6).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Lusalon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>400 Mass. 767, 770-771 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">3. <em>Preferred\u2019s conduct. </em>Pacific claims that, even if the damages to the Levkoffs\u2019 property lay outside SMD\u2019s insurance policy, its c. 93A claim was improperly dismissed. Policy coverage aside, Pacific claims that Preferred\u2019s \u201cthree years of deliberate deception and gamesmanship\u201d and the late assertion of its coverage defense, amounted to \u201cbad faith\u201d actionable under c. 93A. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">When arguing in support of the survival of its c. 93A claim, Pacific relies heavily on alleged conduct that occurred after the plaintiffs filed their complaint. The thrust of Pacific\u2019s argument focuses on Preferred\u2019s alleged bad faith during \u201cthe several years of this litigation.\u201d We interpret the inclusion of facts not pleaded in the complaint as Pacific\u2019s request to convert the motion for judgment on the pleadings into one for summary judgment, see Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), and we decline the invitation. Instead, our review of Preferred\u2019s conduct during the claims settlement process is limited to the allegations and related inferences found in the complaint, and the two contracts at issue here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Boston </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number><em>Med. Center Corp. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Health and Human Servs., </em>463 Mass. 447, 450 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A right of action under c. 93A for a violation of G. L. c. 176D, reflects \u201cthe commonplace ethical view that a claims facilitator ought not wear out the claimant by unduly delaying settlement when liability is clear.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Risk Mgmt. Foundation of the Harvard Med. Insts., Inc., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 411, 418 (1994). Here, the culpability of SMD for damaging the Levkoffs\u2019 land was clear, but Preferred\u2019s duty to indemnify was not. Both Pacific and Preferred are sophisticated marketplace actors, accustomed to waging strategic, nuanced, and even incongruous defenses of their insured. While Preferred could have acted more forthrightly and spent less time investigating the indemnification claim, \u201c[o]ur decisions interpreting the obligations contained within G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), in no way penalize insurers who delay in good faith when liability is not clear and requires further investigation.\u201d <em>Clegg </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>424 Mass, at 421. Since Preferred had no duty to settle the claim, there can be no liability under G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9)(/) (an unfair claim settlement practice includes the failure \u201cto effectuate prompt, fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has <em>become reasonably deaf\u2019 </em>in favor of the claimant) (emphasis supplied). As the judge properly determined, in light of Preferred\u2019s multiple valid defenses to coverage, Pacific\u2019s c. 93A claim failed to \u201cplausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.\u201d See <em>Dartmouth </em>v. <em>Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High Sch. Dist., </em>461 Mass. 366, 374 (2012), citing <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint described $106,977.72 in remediation costs covered by Pacific, and $37,915.91 in additional expenses, paid by the Levkoffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">SMD impleaded the subcontractor, the Levkoffs\u2019 architect, and the engineering firm.

Preferred offered little, telling Pacific that it was investigating and needed more time to determine questions of liability and coverage. On March 16, 2010, Pacific sent Preferred a demand for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D. In a letter dated April 14, 2010, Preferred conveyed its position that questions of liability were not clear, and reiterated that its client still was investigating. Pacific sent Preferred a final demand letter dated June 15, 2010, expressing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>position that \u201cliability has already been resolved,\u201d because SMD took responsibility for the clear-cutting before the Commission.
