App. Ct. 547, 553 (2006). \u201cA conflict of interest arises whenever an attorney\u2019s regard for one duty, such as that owed to a third party or in service of his own interests, leads the attorney to disregard another duty, such as that owed to his client.\u201d <em>Perkins, supra </em>at 851. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass. 16, 20 (1986) (\u201cAn actual or genuine conflict of interest arises where the independent professional judgment of trial counsel is impaired, either by his own interests, or the interests of another client\u201d [quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In the present case, a serious, potential conflict of interest became apparent shortly before trial commenced. Appropriate steps were taken by the judge to identify the risks of defense counsel\u2019s continued representation of the defendant. The judge was warranted in concluding that, based on the evidentiary landscape prior to trial, defense counsel\u2019s prospective testimony as the sole witness to a statement made by one of the victims would not be required. We commend the judge for conducting a thorough colloquy with the defendant prior to the trial to ensure that the defendant was fully informed of his attorney\u2019s potential conflict of interest and could make a voluntary decision to continue to have counsel represent him. See <em>Perkins, supra </em>at 856 (emphasizing \u201cthe importance of trial judges being vigilant about conflicts of interest\u201d). We also have considered the evidence as it developed at trial and conclude that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice resulting from defense counsel not testifying as a witness. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant was charged with, and ultimately convicted of, one count of rape of a child (G.L. c. 265, \u00a7 23), five counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B), and four counts of indecent assault and battery on a person fourteen years of age or older (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13H). There were three victims, each of whom testified that the defendant committed various acts against her, including one victim who testified that she was raped; numerous instances of indecent and unlawful acts were described by each of the victims. Two of the victims were the children of the defendant\u2019s girl friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Following the defendant\u2019s arraignment, one of the victims, who by this time was an adult, expressed reservations about testifying against the defendant due to concerns about the impact it would have on her family. She related her concerns to her mother who, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>in turn, spoke to the defendant. The defendant suggested that the victim speak to the defendant\u2019s lawyer. The victim\u2019s mother outlined options for the victim including testifying that the incidents of rape and sexual abuse did not occur, testifying that the victim was confused and did not remember what had happened, and simply telling the truth. The victim\u2019s mother brought the victim to defense counsel\u2019s office, where the victim spoke alone with counsel. The January 20, 2010, interview was not recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Shortly before trial, these developments came to the attention of the Commonwealth. On April 22, 2011, the Commonwealth filed a motion in limine seeking clarification of defense counsel\u2019s status as counsel or a witness and requesting rulings of law. After conducting a hearing, the judge entered an order in which he recognized that a potential conflict of interest existed and outlined a procedure to address it. The judge appropriately invited the Commonwealth to review a written summary of the interview with the victim (summary) that was submitted by defense counsel prior to trial to ascertain whether she disagreed with any statements she may have made to defense counsel, and, if so, whether they were material to the issues at trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the answer to these questions was \u201cyes,\u201d defense counsel would be given an opportunity to be heard on whether his disqualification from representing the defendant would work a substantial hardship on his client. Even if the answer to either question was \u201cno,\u201d the judge stated he would conduct a colloquy with the defendant to ensure that he understood the risks of proceeding with his current attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Prior to the selection of the jury, the judge conducted a further hearing. The Commonwealth reported that a State police officer reviewed the summary with the victim, who stated that she agreed with it subject only to two minor exceptions that did not involve material facts. After conferring with the Commonwealth, defense counsel answered in the affirmative to the judge\u2019s inquiry whether he was \u201csatisfied that there will be at this point nothing coming out of [the victim\u2019s] testimony which would be so different that [he] would have to take the stand to rebut it in order to effectively represent [his] client.\u201d Counsel also reported that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>had discussed the issue with the defendant who desired that counsel continue representing him. The judge conducted an extensive colloquy<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and found that the defendant had been informed of the potential conflict, but wanted to retain his present attorney as defense counsel for the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">At trial, thq victim in question testified that as a very young child she had been sexually abused by her stepfather prior to the time that the defendant came into her mother\u2019s life. She also testified that during her grammar school years, she had been sexually abused by the defendant, including one instance in which he digitally penetrated her vagina. This victim also testified about the statement she had given to the police, her reservations about testifying against the defendant, and the statement that she had given to defense counsel. Further details of her testimony are reserved for the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Pretrial assessment of conflict of interest. </em>It is the defendant\u2019s burden to prove a genuine conflict of interest by presenting \u201cdemonstrative proof detailing both the existence and the precise character of th[e] alleged conflict of interest; we will not infer a conflict based on mere conjecture or speculation.\u201d <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass, at 20. The defendant\u2019s principal argument on appeal is that the judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on two decisions by the Supreme Judicial Court: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass. 408 (1979), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>432 Mass. 767 (2000).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Rondeau, </em>the defendant was convicted of an armed robbery of a Worcester credit union. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified at a hearing on a motion for a new trial that he saw the defendant in the courthouse on the morning when the defendant was alleged to have committed the crime. Although there were other alibi witnesses, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel was the only alibi witness without a criminal history. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on his determination that counsel\u2019s alibi testimony lacked credibility and thus its unavailability at trial was not a source of prejudice. Although the Supreme Judicial Court upheld that portion of the judge\u2019s ruling, it determined that counsel\u2019s failure to abide by his ethical obligations to withdraw created an actual conflict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>interest. <em>Rondeau, supra </em>at 416-417.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court explained that an actual conflict of interest exists once it becomes apparent to defense counsel that \u201chis testimony might be necessary to the proper defense of his client.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414. An actual conflict of interest denies the defendant his right to representation by an attorney with undivided loyalty. <em>Id. </em>at 414-415. Counsel\u2019s failure to withdraw in such a case is constitutionally ineffective assistance, without the need to show prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, 376 </em>Mass. 777, 781-782 (1978). \u201c[Ujnder art. 12, if a defendant establishes an actual conflict of interest, he is entitled to a new trial without a further showing; he need not demonstrate that the conflict adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance or resulted in actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosher, </em>455 Mass. 811, 819 (2010).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Similarly, in <em>Patterson </em>the court noted that within a few days of the defendant\u2019s arraignment, it should have been evident to defense counsel that an actual conflict of interest existed because counsel was present when the defendant reportedly made statements to the police. Further, counsel was the only witness (other than the defendant) who could contradict the police version of the defendant\u2019s statement that the Commonwealth intended to offer at trial. <em>Patterson, </em>432 Mass, at 777-778.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Avoiding the consequences of an actual conflict of interest is a shared responsibility of counsel and the court. Under the Code of Professional Responsibility, both the prosecutor and defense counsel have a duty to notify the court and take appropriate steps to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>withdraw from a case when an actual conflict arises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge also has an obligation to \u201ctake early and effective action,\u201d as the judge did in this case, whenever the existence of a potential or actual conflict of interest comes to the court\u2019s attention.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Ron-deau, supra </em>at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The present case is clearly distinguishable from <em>Rondeau </em>and <em>Patterson </em>because, prior to trial, the judge determined, and both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>counsel and the defendant agreed, that there was no reason to believe that the victim would testify in a manner that was inconsistent with what she had told defense counsel during the interview. Under these circumstances, there was thus no basis for defense counsel to believe he would be required to testify about his interview, and there was no actual conflict of interest. As for the potential conflict of interest that remained, \u201c[a] defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel due to a potential conflict of interest will be entitled to a new trial only if he can establish \u2018material prejudice\u2019 to his defense resulting from the alleged conflict.\u201d <em>Mosher, </em>455 Mass, at 823, quoting from <em>Shraiar, </em>397 Mass, at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel during trial. </em>We address two remaining questions. First, whether the potential conflict of interest that existed at the outset of the trial developed into an actual conflict of interest as the evidence unfolded. Second, we examine the record to determine whether the defendant has established that he was materially prejudiced in some concrete way by his counsel\u2019s decision not to testify. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 508-509 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">a. <em>Absence of actual conflict of interest during trial. </em>We begin by reiterating that the burden rests with the defendant to demonstrate the existence of an actual conflict of interest. See <em>Shraiar, supra. </em>Conjecture about what might have occurred is not a substitute for credible evidence of an actual conflict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balliro, </em>437 Mass. 163, 168 (2002). It is unnecessary to determine whether the judge\u2019s pretrial colloquy was an effective waiver of the right to conflict-free counsel because the differences between the victim\u2019s testimony at trial and what counsel and the judge anticipated her testimony would be at the outset of the trial were not significant, and, thus at no time did circumstances arise creating an actual conflict of interest that required defense counsel to withdraw in order to be a witness for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">b. <em>Absence of material prejudice. </em>The defendant does not point to anything his counsel did or failed to do at trial that resulted in material prejudice. The record indicates that defense counsel conducted a vigorous defense on behalf of his client. See <em>Shraiar, supra </em>at 25. Defense counsel effectively impeached the victim. Counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the victim brought out that she made previous inconsistent statements regarding whether the defendant touched her inappropriately. Specifically, she testified that she told counsel that she did not think the defendant\u2019s hugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>were \u201csexual,\u201d that she might have confused the defendant\u2019s conduct with that of her stepfather, including the act of digital penetration, and that she was unsure whether the defendant had touched her breasts. When she did not recall a portion of the interview with defense counsel, he read aloud the entire paragraph from the written summary of the interview. The defendant\u2019s argument that, had his attorney testified, the jury would have heard a \u201cclear recitation\u201d of the interview he conducted with the victim is speculative, for the written summary is dated some fifteen months after the interview occurred. Moreover, as the Commonwealth points out, a fair reading of the defense counsel\u2019s written summary of the interview is not that the victim recanted her earlier statements; rather, as the victim acknowledged forthrightly at trial, she made inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>When a judge becomes aware that an attorney in the case may have a conflict of interest, the \u201cbest practice\u201d is to address it promptly by initiating a colloquy with counsel. <em>Perkins, </em>450 Mass, at 856. Here, the judge took appropriate steps to identify that a serious, potential conflict of interest existed, determined its precise nature, and then determined that it was not an actual conflict of interest that required the withdrawal or disqualification of counsel. His findings and rulings are supported by the evidence. The judge also wisely conducted a thorough colloquy with the defendant to ensure that the defendant was aware of the potential conflict and wished to have counsel continue to represent him. See Appendix. Our review of the evidence at trial leads us to conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that he suffered any material prejudice as a result of the potential conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"asv-dedup-0\">\n<em>Pretrial colloquy concerning potential conflict of interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">The judge: \u201cIt is my understanding, through discussions with counsel, that your attorney met with one of the alleged victims in this case who will be a witness in this case.

Do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aic-dedup-0\">The defendant: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAs\">The judge: \u201cAnd then it creates a situation where the attorney becomes a witness and, if we\u2019re aware of that ahead of time we have to recuse the attorney or have him step aside and have another attorney come in to take his place. Do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVD\">The defendant: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Apz\">The judge: \u201cNow, that creates some issues, because it delays the trial, you\u2019d have to get a new attorney and things of that nature. But it\u2019s done to protect your interests, to make sure you have all the witnesses available to you during the course of the trial. Do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">The defendant: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6W\">The judge: \u201cNow in going through this issue, as you probably heard, the witness does not intend at this point to contradict what she said to your attorney at the time of the hearing except for two minor points.

Do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACB\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyA\">The judge: \u201cSo the question becomes: First of all, are you aware of all of these circumstances?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The defendant: \u201cYes, your Honor, I am.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Avf\">The judge: \u201cAnd are you also aware that you are entitled under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be represented by counsel and to have that counsel free from any possible conflict of interest, do you understand that?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6T\">The defendant: \u201cYes, I do, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1a\">The judge: \u201cAnd do you understand by this information coming out and determining what the witness is likely to say, that your attorney, Mr. Curtiss, is able to effectively represent you during the course of this trial?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ALiq\">The defendant: \u201cYes, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4B\">The judge: \u201cNow, do you also understand \u2014 we can\u2019t guarantee what people are going to say, we are often surprised and something may come up during the course of the trial we can\u2019t anticipate and we\u2019ll have to deal with at that point.

That appeal was dismissed for lack of prosecution. This subsequent appeal is solely from the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The summary prepared by defense counsel states that the victim disclosed prior abuse by her stepfather (a person other than the defendant). Otherwise, it states that with respect to the essential points related by the victim to the police about the defendant\u2019s unlawful acts, she did not clearly recall the details and may have confused acts committed by her stepfather with those she said had been committed by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The colloquy, including the judge\u2019s findings and rulings, is reproduced in an Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The trial judge was aware of these decisions and appropriately relied on them in addressing the issues prior to the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In <em>Rondeau, </em>378 Mass, at 414, the court reasoned that the conflict of interest was defined by counsel\u2019s violation of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 5, Disciplinary Rule 5-102(A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 779 (1981), which established counsel\u2019s duty to withdraw from representation at trial, subject to only limited exceptions which were not applicable, when counsel learned he ought to be called as a witness to testify on behalf of his client. The current rule that corresponds to its predecessor is Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.7, 426 Mass. 1396 (1998). It prohibits a lawyer from acting as trial counsel \u201cat a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness.\u201d See <em>Patterson, </em>432 Mass, at 778 nn.12-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u201cThe conflict lies in the fact that the client\u2019s interests would be better served by having the attorney testify while the attorney\u2019s interests would be better served by not testifying.\u201d <em>Patterson, supra </em>at 780. See <em>id. </em>at 780 n.18 (explaining that once a conflict arises, counsel\u2019s decision to remain as trial attorney cannot be defended as a legitimate strategic choice because counsel is no longer in a position to render independent professional judgment on behalf of her client).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The Code of Professional Responsibility is self-executing. See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 787-788 (1979) (\u201cIf an attorney is unsure whether in a given case his conduct violates the code, he should terminate the questionable conduct or seek the advice of the appropriate Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility. If he persists in questionable conduct, he risks disciplinary action including disbarment. When a lawyer, exercising his best judgment, determines that his employment will not bring him into conflict with the code, disqualification may occur only if the trial court determines that his continued participation as counsel taints the legal system or the trial of the cause before it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">It should be noted that a conflict of interest does not exist merely because an attorney interviews one or more of the witnesses scheduled to testify at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>376 Mass. 725, 734 (1978). This case, however, illustrates the risks when counsel interviews a witness alone. \u201cTo avoid lawyer-witness problems, it is typical and advisable for lawyers to conduct witness interviews [in the presence of an investigator] so that a third person can be called as an impeachment witness if the interviewee testifies inconsistently at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>171 Wash. App. 518, 546 (2012). The same advice applies to prosecutors. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>690 E2d 638, 645 (7th Cir. 1982) (en banc). See also ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function, Standard 4-4.3(e), Relation With Prospective Witnesses (3d ed. 1993); Committee for Public Counsel Services Assigned Counsel Manual, Policies and Procedures, Chapter IV, Part I, \u00a7 ELE, Preliminary Proceedings &amp; Preparation \u2014 Special Concerns, http://www.publiccounsel.net/private_counsel _manual/CURRENT_MANUAL_2012/MANUALChap4CriminalStandards.pdf [http://perma.cc/A4A4-E5CL] (\u201cCounsel should take advantage, where appropriate, of opportunities to interview witnesses who may be present in court. Counsel must avoid becoming a witness in his/her own case. Therefore, interviews of prosecution witnesses should be \u2018witnessed\u2019 by another person (e.g. another defense attorney) to avoid later problems with proving an impeaching statement at trial\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\">A judge has discretion to decline to accept the defendant\u2019s waiver of conflict-free counsel in circumstances in which the judge determines that it is unlikely that counsel will be able to provide effective representation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 810 (2000), citing <em>Wheat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>486 U.S. 153,163 (1988). In <em>Wheat, </em>the Supreme Court observed that although there is a \u201cpresumption\u201d in favor of the defendant\u2019s counsel of choice, \u201cthat presumption may be overcome not only by a demonstration of actual conflict but by a showing of a serious potential for conflict. The evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case under this standard must be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
