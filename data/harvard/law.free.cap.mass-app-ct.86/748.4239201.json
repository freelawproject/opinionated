The defendant was the record owner of the disputed property, which the plaintiff claimed based on adverse possession. The parties agree that the nature and length of the plaintiff\u2019s use of the land generally was sufficient to establish title by adverse possession. The only contested issue is one of law; whether the plaintiff may count the time during which title to the land was held by one of the defendant\u2019s predecessors-in-title, the city of Fall River (city), toward the requisite twenty-year period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>of continuous adverse use. Relying on G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, the defendant argues that the plaintiff\u2019s adverse possession claim did not begin to run until the city transferred the property to a private party. In a thoughtful decision issued after a trial on stipulated facts, a Superior Court judge rejected this argument as a matter of law. She ruled that a private record owner of once-public land opposing an adverse possession claim cannot invoke G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, as a defense. We agree and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>By 1975, the city of Fall River had acquired a parcel of land located at 1082 Davol Street in Fall River (Mechanic\u2019s Mill parcel).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The property included \u201ca large building [that] had been used for manufacturing purposes.\u201d The record does not reveal what actual use the city itself made of the parcel, but the parties stipulated that the city \u201cheld\u201d the property \u201cfor a public purpose as defined in Chapter 260, Section 31 of the General Laws.\u201d In 1989, the city sold the Mechanic\u2019s Mill parcel to a private corporation. Since then, the property has continued in private ownership, and it is now owned by defendant Mechanic\u2019s Mill One LLC (record owner).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In 1975, Paul and Albert Berube acquired the property at 1148 Davol Street, which lies adjacent to the Mechanic\u2019s Mill parcel. After purchasing that property, the Berubes began to use as their own a strip of the Mechanic\u2019s Mill parcel \u2014 totaling approximately 25,000 square feet in size \u2014 that lies along the boundary of the two properties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties stipulated that the Berubes and their successors-in-title \u201cexercised undisturbed dominion over the [disputed strip] which was actual, open, notorious, and adverse to the claims of all others, and [that it] continued for thirty-two (32) years, namely from 1975 to 2007.\u201d After plaintiff 1148 Davol Street LLC acquired the Berubes\u2019 parcel in 2007, a dispute over the ownership of the strip ensued. This action followed in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201cA party claiming title to land through adverse possession must establish actual, open, exclusive, and nonper-missive use for a continuous period of at least twenty years.\u201d <em>Tot-man </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>431 Mass. 143,145 (2000). As noted, the only issue in dispute is whether the plaintiff can count toward that twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>year period the time that title to the Mechanic\u2019s Mill parcel was held by the city. If the adverse possession \u201cclock\u201d did not start until the city transferred the property to a private party in 1989, then it is undisputed that the twenty-year period had not fully run when this action was filed. Therefore, as the parties agree, the resolution of the legal issue before us is dispositive of the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">To support its argument, the record owner seeks to invoke G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31. That section is a statute of limitations that governs \u201caction[s] for the recovery of land ... commenced by or in behalf of the commonwealth.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the plaintiff points out, the current action between two private parties indisputably is not an action \u201ccommenced by or in behalf of the commonwealth.\u201d The statute therefore has no direct application here. Viewed in its best light, the record owner\u2019s argument rests not on \u00a7 31\u2019s direct application, but on the statute\u2019s potential interaction with background common-law principles. In order to evaluate the validity of such arguments, we need to examine \u00a7 31 in historical context.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">a. <em>The common-law rule. </em>At common law one could not claim prescriptive rights against the sovereign. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Revere Copper Co., </em>152 Mass. 444, 449-450 (1890). This principle was embodied in the maxim \u201cnullum tempus occurrit regi.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449. The United States Supreme Court once observed that this \u201cancient rule of the common law, that time does not run against the State... has been settled for centuries, and is supported by all courts in all civilized countries.\u201d <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>81 U.S. (14 Wall.) 120, 145 (1872) (Armstrong). This axiom raised the question of what rules should apply where the land that is the subject of an adverse possession claim is private land that was formerly held by a State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>and where the adverse use bridged the change in ownership. Under the common law, the party claiming adverse possession could not count toward the applicable limitations period the time he adversely occupied the land while title was held by the State. <em>Id. </em>at 144, 145, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hoar, </em>26 F. Cas. 329 (C.C.D. Mass. 1821) (No. 15,373). <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Lessee of Miller, </em>31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 666, 673 (1832). Instead, adverse possession began to run only when the land was transferred into private hands. See <em>id. </em>at 146.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>\u201cNo action for the recovery of land shall be commenced by or in behalf of the commonwealth, except within twenty years after its right or title thereto first accrued, or within twenty years after it or those under whom it claims have been seized or possessed of the premises; but this section shall not apply to the province lands in the town of Provincetown lying north and west of the line fixed by section twenty-five of chapter ninety-one, to the Back Bay lands, so called, in Boston, or to any property, right title or interest of the commonwealth below high water mark or in the great ponds; <em>provided, further, that this section shall not bar any action by or on behalf of the commonwealth, or any political subdivision thereof, for the recovery of land or interests in land held for conservation, open space, parks, recreation, water protection, wildlife protection or other public </em>purpose\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>b. <em>The 1835 statute. </em>In Massachusetts, the common-law principle that one cannot obtain title to public lands by adverse possession was superseded by statute enacted in 1835. <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Revere Copper Co., </em>152 Mass, at 450 (citing R.S. c. 119, \u00a7 12). Under that enactment, the Commonwealth was held to the same limitations period that applied to real estate recovery actions brought by private parties. As a result, \u201ca title by disseisin [could] be acquired against the Commonwealth as readily as against a private person.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Even though the statute did not include an express reference to the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201csubdivisions\u201d until 1987, it has long been interpreted as applying to cities and towns in addition to the Commonwealth. <em>Inhabitants of Cohasset </em>v. <em>Moors, </em>204 Mass. 173, 178 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">At least on its face, the 1835 statute applied to all Commonwealth lands without exception. However, the statute underwent modest modifications in 1852, 1854, and 1867, all of which exempted certain limited categories of property from the statute\u2019s reach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>With that statutory framework in place, the Supreme Judicial Court eventually had occasion to consider whether a tax taking interrupted a third party\u2019s otherwise continuous adverse use. <em>Harrison </em>v. Dolan, 172 Mass. 395 (1899) <em>(Harrison). </em>Because Massachusetts generally had abrogated the axiom that time cannot run against the sovereign, the court declined to adhere to the common-law counting rules recognized in <em>Armstrong, </em>81 U.S. at 145, and similar cases, at least in the context in which the case was presented. In <em>Harrison, </em>authored by Justice Holmes, the court reasoned that \u201csuch cases have no application to this case, if for no other reason, because the statute runs against the Commonwealth as well as against private persons.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, the court held that the tax taking by itself did not interrupt the continuity of the adverse use.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">c. <em>The 1987 amendment. </em>Subject to the minor amendments mentioned above, the 1835 statute eventually was recodified as G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, and it lay unmodified until 1987. As the record owner accurately highlights, the 1987 amendment was significant. See St. 1987, c. 564, \u00a7 54 (inserting the language in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, highlighted in note 3, <em>supra). </em>Specifically, while keeping intact the then-existing statutory language, the Legislature added a general proviso that greatly expanded the categories of public property not subject to any limitations period in land recovery actions brought by the Commonwealth or its subdivisions. That proviso applies not only to land put to various enumerated environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>and recreational uses, but also more generally to land held for \u201cother public purpose[s].\u201d We have interpreted the \u201cother public purpose\u201d language broadly. See <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Boston Redev. Authy., </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 804, 808 (2006) (redevelopment authority not barred from recovering land it held for urban renewal project notwithstanding a private party\u2019s having adversely occupied the land for more than twenty years).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">d. <em>Evaluating the record owner\u2019s arguments. </em>In light of the sweeping nature of the 1987 amendment, the record owner argues that the Legislature broadly intended that State or municipal \u201cland put to a \u2018public purpose\u2019 could never be subject to adverse possession.\u201d On this basis, it argues that the limitations period cannot run while the property is held by a public party against whom adverse possession cannot accrue. In effect, the record owner is arguing that the 1987 amendment has brought us full circle back to a legal regime under which, at least as a general matter, time cannot run against the sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Although characterizing public lands as now being incapable of being subject to adverse possession is in some respects a tempting shorthand, it is not strictly speaking accurate. Nothing in the statutory language immunizes such lands from having an adverse possession claim begin to accrue during the period of public ownership. Nor does the new language manifest a wholesale embrace of the superseded common-law axiom that time cannot run against the sovereign (the doctrinal foundation on which <em>Armstrong </em>is based).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the language signals a Legislative intent that adverse possession claims involving public property be treated merely as a limitations issue governed by statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">With such overarching observations in place, we have little dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ficulty rejecting the record owner\u2019s argument. In interpreting legislative intent, we, of course, look primarily to the language of the relevant statutes. See <em>Northeast Energy Partners, LLC </em>v. <em>Mahar Regional Sch. Dist., </em>462 Mass. 687, 692 (2012) (citing <em>Simon </em>v. <em>State Examrs. of Electricians, </em>395 Mass. 238, 242 [1985]). By its plain terms, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, as amended, St. 1987, c. 564, \u00a7 54, is limited to addressing when the Commonwealth and its subdivisions may bring actions to recover land. While the 1987 amendment undeniably added broad protections allowing the Commonwealth and its subdivisions to recover land held for public purposes, nothing in the statute evinces an intent that such protections also benefit a subsequent private owner. Notably, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 21, the statute of limitations that applies to private actions to recover land, was left unchanged by the 1987 enactment, and it sets forth no exception involving properties formerly held by the Commonwealth or its subdivisions. See <em>Boswell </em>v. <em>Zephyr Lines, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 241, 247 (1993) (related statutes must be construed in harmony with one another \u201cso as to give rise to a consistent body of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Nor has the record owner demonstrated that its interpretation is supported by the public policy considerations that animated the 1987 enactment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The doctrine of adverse possession serves to clear titles and to promote economic development. <em>Sandwich </em>v. <em>Quirk, </em>409 Mass. 380, 384 (1991). The addition of the proviso language in 1987 reflects a legislative judgment that such interests are outweighed by those furthered by letting the Commonwealth and its subdivisions bring actions to recover land held for public purposes. However, the countervailing interests in preserving land held for public purposes no longer come into play once the land in question has been transferred to a private party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the trial judge aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201cThe purposes enumerated in G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31 concern land uses, which benefit the public at large. Therefore, by preventing the Commonwealth from losing its right of action to recover such lands, the statute facilitates the continued protection of that land in the interest of preserving those public benefits. The statute grants the Commonwealth the ability to recover such lands so that they may continue to be held for those same purposes, which provide a benefit to the general public. To allow a private corporation the ability to take advantage of a law clearly designed to benefit the State would be inapposite to the purpose of that law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Finally, we note that our conclusions are supported by case law in other jurisdictions. For example, the Supreme Court of Virginia has long distanced itself from the common-law rule recognized in <em>Armstrong, </em>81 U.S. at 145, even though that case arose under Virginia law. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Young, </em>196 Va. 1166, 1177 (1955) (tax taking under State statute did not as matter of law interrupt the continuity of third party\u2019s adverse use, in part because \u201c[t]he Commonwealth\u2019s immunity to the running of the statute of limitations cannot be used as a shield to the advantage of [the record owner] \u2018who alone will enjoy the benefits\u2019 \u201d), quoting from 1 Am. Jur. Adverse Possession \u00a7 104. See also <em>Lovey </em>v. <em>Escambia County, </em>141 So. 2d 761, 765 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1962) (\u201cThe right to assert sovereign immunity from the operation of the statute of limitations does not extend, however, to [the government\u2019s] assignee or transferee where the suit is brought for the private benefit, and to enforce the rights of a private person\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because we agree with the judge that G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, does not aid a private party in defending an otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>valid adverse possession claim, we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The facts are drawn from the parties\u2019 bare bones stipulation, even though some of the stipulated facts appear somewhat at variance with documents referenced in the stipulation. In any event, the discrepancies are not material.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The stipulation does not flesh out what the actual adverse use entailed. The verified complaint alleged that the Berubes paved the area, cordoned it off with a fence and other means, and used it for parking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">In its current form, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 31, inserted by St. 1987, c. 564, \u00a7 54, reads in full as follows:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"><em>Armstrong </em>provides a vivid illustration of this principle. Long after the party claiming title by adverse possession had begun its adverse use, the Commonwealth of Virginia gained title to the property by operation of law when the record owner failed to pay applicable taxes. 81 U.S. at 133. The record owner eventually redeemed title. <em>Id. </em>at 137. The adverse use in fact continued throughout, lasting for an uninterrupted period that far exceeded the fourteen-year limitations period then applicable in Virginia. <em>Id. </em>at 144. Nevertheless, the Court ruled, as a matter of law, that because no adverse possession could run against the State, the State\u2019s holding title by itself broke the adverse possessor\u2019s \u201ccontinuity of possession,\u201d and the applicable limitations period began to run only when the record owner reclaimed his title. <em>Id. </em>at 146, citing <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gittings\u2019 Lessee, </em>2 H. &amp; J. 112 (Md. 1807).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In 1852, the Legislature expressly repealed the 1835 statute with respect to its application to the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in certain \u201clands or flats\u201d in the Back Bay area of Boston, and it stated that \u201cno adverse possession or occupation [of the Back Bay lands] ... for any period of time, shall be sufficient to defeat or divest the title of the Commonwealth therein.\u201d St. 1852, c. 253, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>1854, the statute was amended further to exempt \u201call the Province lands within the town of Provincetown,\" through language that declared the specified lands to be free from claims of adverse possession. St. 1854, c. 261, \u00a7 8. These amendments were eventually codified in the general statutes of 1860, G. S. c. 154, \u00a7 12. The statute was amended once more in 1867 to exclude from adverse possession the \u201cgreat ponds\u201d and rights in waterfront property below the high-water mark. St. 1867, c. 275, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\">The court in <em>Harrison </em>also distinguished <em>Armstrong </em>on the ground that there, Virginia had held title to the land by operation of law, while here, \u201cthe commonwealth never had even a momentary title to the land.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>172 Mass, at 396. The court noted that some argument could be made that had the tax taking proceeded to foreclosure, this would restart the adverse possession clock, but declined to reach this \u201cmore subtle argument.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Almost a century later, the court faced the reserved question in a case in which the land at issue had been foreclosed upon but was still held by the municipality. <em>Sandwich </em>v. <em>Quirk, </em>409 Mass. 380, 383 (1991). The court declined to resolve the question whether a subsequent change in the law exempted the city from being subject to the twenty year limitations period (see note 7, <em>infra), </em>but held that \u201ct]he statute of limitations starts to run against a municipality, if at all, when it takes adversely possessed land for nonpayment of taxes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">Compare <em>Sandwich </em>v. <em>Quirk, </em>409 Mass, at 382 &amp; n.6 (noting, without resolving, the question whether land obtained by municipality through tax taking is held for \u201cpublic purpose\u201d within meaning of G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 30).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Unlike the amendments to the limitations period enacted during the Nineteenth Century, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>the 1987 amendment did not repeal the 1835 statute as it applied to the exempted properties, nor did it abrogate the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of sovereign immunity. Indeed, in form, the new proviso language is stated merely as an exception to the general rule that the Commonwealth is subject to the same twenty-year limitation period as private parties (albeit an exception that may, as a practical matter, \u201cswallow the rule\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b783-10\">We acknowledge the interpretive principle that radical departures from the common law are not to be \u201clightly inferred.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>Mc-Menimen, </em>461 Mass. 279, 290 (2012). However, the Legislature unquestionably broke with the common law in 1835. The question here is whether in 1987 the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Legislature intended a wholesale re-adoption of the common law, including its corollary counting rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The amendment to \u00a7 31 was included as part of a comprehensive environmental measure titled, \u201cAn Act Providing for an Environmental Enhancement and Protection Program for the Commonwealth.\u201d St. 1987, c. 564. One of the main purposes of the bill was to promote the acquisition and public enjoyment of land for recreational uses. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 8 (appropriating funding for municipalities\u2019 acquisition of land for \u201cmunicipal park and recreation purposes and for the restoration and rehabilitation of such . . . lands\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> Of course, this means that purchasers will need to exercise diligence in keeping an eye out for potential adverse possession claims regardless of whether there is a public entity in the chain of title. We see no hardship or unfairness in this result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">There are other cases, to the same general effect, that arrive at that result through a somewhat different doctrinal framework. For example, California appellate courts have highlighted that even if an adverse possessor cannot gain rights against the government during the period of public ownership, he \u201cmay nevertheless adversely possess the land as against others.\u201d <em>Abar </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>23 Cal. App. 3d 506, 512 (1972). Meanwhile, the Connecticut Supreme Court has held that a record owner who obtained title following a tax taking cannot invoke a statute that protected municipalities from adverse possession claims involving land held for public use, on the ground that the land was never put to public use. <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Quadrato, </em>142 Conn. 398, 402, 403 (1955).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b786-6\">It is not clear on this record whether the city acquired title through purchase, eminent domain, tax foreclosure, or some other means. In any event, the record owner has not argued that the mode through which the municipality acquired title \u2014 as opposed to the fact of its holding title \u2014 mandates a restarting of the adverse possession clock. Compare <em>Sandwich </em>v. Quirk, 409 Mass, at 385 (in the tax foreclosure context, adverse possession cannot begin to run against municipality at least until it takes the land).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
