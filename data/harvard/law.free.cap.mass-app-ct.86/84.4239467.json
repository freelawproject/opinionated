L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(6), on two indictments for assault and battery upon a child by having care and custody of said child and committing an assault and battery, or wantonly or recklessly permitting or allowing another to commit an assault and battery resulting in <em>sub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>stantial bodily injury </em>to the child,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and on five indictments for assault and battery upon a child by having care and custody of said child and committing an assault and battery, or wantonly or recklessly permitting or allowing another to commit an assault and battery resulting in <em>bodily injury </em>to the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time the child (the defendant\u2019s four month old son), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>whom we shall call Rory,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sustained his injuries, he was living with his eighteen month old sister, his mother, his aunt, and his maternal grandfather. The child\u2019s oldest injuries coincided closely with the-first day of his mother\u2019s return to work full time, after which time the defendant was the child\u2019s primary caretaker, looking after the child at the child\u2019s home, although the defendant did not reside there.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In this consolidated appeal, the defendant argues that five of the seven convictions were duplicative; the evidence was insufficient; and a single justice of this court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of execution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In this case, the particularized injuries to the child as charged in the seven indictments were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Left thorax: Posterior fractures to the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth ribs, and fractures to the sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs. Indictment no. 7 \u2014 bodily injury Bruises on the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">1. <em>Double jeopardy, </em>a. <em>Introduction. </em>On appeal, the defendant submits that five of the seven convictions predicated upon the aforementioned particularized bodily injuries to the child were duplicative, in violation of double jeopardy rights protected by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Massachusetts law. In essence, in advancing this duplicative conviction challenge (which is raised for the first time on appeal), the defendant argues that only two of the child\u2019s injuries were proven to have been inflicted by separate acts or on separate occasions, and thus, the remaining five convictions and punishments were barred by principles of double jeopardy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In counter, the Commonwealth submits that the \u201cunit of prosecution\u201d underlying G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(\u00bf&gt;), rests on an elemental predicate of the discrete and particularized bodily injury to a child, and that, in \u00a7 13J(A), the Legislature sought to enact the broadest protection for children vulnerably placed in the care of a person who commits an assault and battery upon a child<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or recklessly or wantonly permits the infliction of particular injuries upon a child. The Legislature, the Commonwealth submits, has the power to enact and define criminal offenses, by an indictable unit of prosecution, such as set forth in \u00a7 13J(ri), without treading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>on double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude as follows: first, that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(b), reflects a clear legislative intent that the unit of prosecution may be predicated upon, and indictments may be brought (as specifically categorized in the statute), for discrete and particularized injuries to a child occurring while the child is with a caretaker who commits or recklessly or wantonly permits the infliction of such injuries upon the child being cared for; and, second, that this unit of prosecution does not violate double jeopardy, in light of \u201cthe legislative power to define offenses,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass. 345, 347 (1982), and the legislative intent of \u00a7 131(b) \u201cto authorize imposition of multiple punishments for concurrent violations,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>430 Mass. 683, 686 (2000), with respect to discrete and particularized injury to the child held in a caretaking setting. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The issues presented in this appeal involve the third prong of double jeopardy, that is, whether multiple punishments are being imposed. \u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against three distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; <em>and multiple punishments for the same </em>offense\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 278, 283 (1993). It is this last multiple punishment issue which is presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We address first the question whether (as the Commonwealth submits) the Legislature, in enacting G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(b), intended to authorize as the indictable unit of prosecution \u2014 for which there may be imposed multiple punishments \u2014 discrete and particularized \u201cbodily injury\u201d and/or discrete and particularized \u201csubstantial bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">We then consider whether \u2014 given a legislative intent to define the offense prosecution unit based on specific particularized bodily injuries to the child \u2014 such a defined offense prosecution unit in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(b), violates double jeopardy, as giving rise to multiple punishments for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">b. <em>The unit of prosecution under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(b). </em>We turn to the first step in our double jeopardy analysis directed to what unit of prosecution was intended by the Legislature as the punishable act in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(b). \u201cThe inquiry requires us to look to the language and purpose of the statutes, to see whether they speak directly to the issue of the appropriate unit of pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ecution, and if they do not, to ascertain that unit . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>431 Mass. 123, 128 (2000). See generally <em>Bell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 83 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Here, there are a number of persuasive points that we discuss herein, supporting our conclusion that the intended unit of prosecution under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>13J(b), </em>is the discrete and particularized bodily injury inflicted upon a child. At the outset, it is clear that, on its face and by its plain terms, there is no question that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(b), is of that class of criminal laws wherein the \u201cpurpose of the statute\u201d is to prevent violence perpetrated upon children who are ever so vulnerable in a caretaking setting. The act inserting \u00a7 13J into G. L. c. 265 was titled \u201cAn Act Prohibiting Certain Acts Against Children.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See St. 1993, c. 340. To the end of protecting the very vulnerable child placed in a caretaker\u2019s hands, in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(b), the Legislature covered a child with a wide protective blanket in a caretaking setting. We believe that enveloping protection for victim-children, and the core prosecution unit of \u00a7 13J(b), is codified within the specific and discrete enumerated bodily injuries precisely defined in \u00a7 131(a) for \u201cbodily harm\u201d and \u201cserious bodily harm.\u201d These key definitional terms are central to understanding the expanse of protection the statute affords, and the unit of prosecution envisioned by the Legislature. For ease of reference, we repeat the material definitional terms here: \u201c[bjodily injury\u201d encompasses \u201csubstantial impairment of the [child\u2019s] physical condition including any burn, fracture of any bone, subdural hema-toma, injury to any internal organ, any injury which occurs as the result of repeated harm to any bodily function or organ including human skin or any physical condition which substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tially imperils a child\u2019s health or welfare.\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(a). \u201cSubstantial bodily injury\u201d includes \u201ca permanent disfigurement [of the child], protracted loss or impairment of a function of a body member, limb or organ, or substantial risk of death.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(The full definitions are set forth in note 3, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Given the especial vulnerability of a child held in a caretaking custody, we read G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(\u00bf&gt;), as an informed and quite purposeful enactment by the Legislature defining the unit of prosecution predicated upon the victim-child\u2019s injuries \u2014 <em>not </em>the often unknowable inflicting actions or omissions by a caretaker or another. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roderiques, </em>462 Mass. 415, 422 (2012) (\u201cThe elements of \u00a7 <em>13J[b\\, </em>fourth par., are [i] a child under fourteen; [ii] in care and custody; [iii] a substantial bodily injury; [iv] the defendant wantonly or recklessly permitted this substantial bodily injury, or wantonly or recklessly permitted another to commit an assault and battery on the child causing substantial bodily injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The prosecution of cases involving injuries to a child \u201cstands in the not particularly unfamiliar posture of a child left in the custody of an identified adult, who suffers injuries of a type that are inconsistent with the explanation given by the custodian and not attributable in the circumstances to ordinary accidental causes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 733,735 (1997), <em>S.C., </em>427 Mass. 1006 (1998).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Measured by the core protections contained in the clear definitional terms of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(a) \u2014\u2022 all of which are crafted to surround the child and insulate against any injury to be suffered while in the custody of a caretaker, whether inflicted deliberately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>or recklessly, the Commonwealth, as prosecutorial entity, may bring indictments under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(\u00bf&gt;), even if the duration, the precise manner and means of the infliction of the injuries, and the number of blows struck are unknowable because delivered closed from view (meaning without witness thereto) in a private caretaking setting. \u201cUnder c. 265, \u00a7 13J, it does not matter who committed the batteries, and each person having the care and custody of the child may be found guilty of the offense of permitting anyone to commit an assault and battery.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 424 (1999). The Commonwealth is not required to prove precisely how the designated injuries occurred, or how the person charged under \u00a7 13J either inflicted or permitted the infliction of the discrete and particularized injury upon the child. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 752, 759 (2009). General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 <em>133(b), </em>reaches both active, affirmative acts of commission, as well as inactive, passive omissions that permit injury, or that allow another to inflict bodily injury upon the child. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Further reflecting the legislative intent to set the unit of prosecution as the discrete and particularized bodily injury suffered by the child is the staircasing of the penalties, with enhanced criminal sentences tied to injuries to particularized body parts. Specifically, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(\u00bf\u00bb), provides greater, harsher penalties for acts and omissions that lead to <em>substantial bodily injury </em>versus less serious <em>bodily injury. </em>This differential in the statute is categorized and defined by black-letter definitions in \u00a7 131(a) expressly linked to bodily parts (i.e., \u201c[bjodily injury\u201d defines, for example, injuries by a bum, bone fracture, subdural hematoma, damage to internal organs, and to bodily functions; and \u201c[substantial bodily injury\u201d defines, for example, permanent disfigurement, loss of a function of a body member, limb or organ, or injury posing substantial risk of death). See note 3, <em>supra </em>(full definitions).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that the seven indictments in this case under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(\u00bf), are based on an appropriate unit of prosecution and are consistent with the legislative intent that the unit of prosecution may be predicated upon, and indictments may be brought for, any discrete and particularized injury to a child held within the control of a caretaker who commits or recklessly or wantonly permits such discrete and particularized injuries, or permits another to commit an assault and battery re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>suiting in such injuries to the child being cared for.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">c. <em>The multiple punishment issue. </em>Given our determination that the unit of prosecution is the discrete and particularized bodily injury to the child, the next level of analysis involves whether double jeopardy is violated because multiple punishments may flow from convictions on multiple indicted units of prosecution \u2014 in other words, multiple convictions on multiple indictments for the child\u2019s discrete bodily part injuries, as in this case. We conclude not. \u201c[F]cw, if any, limitations are imposed by [the double jeopardy] clause on the legislative power to define offenses.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass, at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">That a unit of prosecution predicated on discrete and particularized injuries (such as charged in the seven indictments in the present case) does not violate double jeopardy harkens back to the legal principles of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383 (1944). In the <em>Welansky </em>case, there were nineteen manslaughter convictions based on the same predicate wanton and reckless acts and omissions that created the inherently dangerous conditions leading to the inferno of the Boston Cocoanut Grove fire. In response to the defendant\u2019s argument that the indictments should have been quashed, the court wrote as follows: \u201cThe Commonwealth did specify the nature of the mortal injuries suffered by the different victims . . . and the harmful consequences to which acts or omissions of the defendant exposed the several victims and which could have been foreseen by the defendant.\u201d <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass, at 394. \u201cFor constitutional purposes all that is required is that the indictment, read with the bill of particulars, be sufficient fully, plainly, substantially and formally to give the defendant reasonable knowledge of the crime with which he is charged\u201d (quotations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Indeed, of further legal pertinence to this case, where the defendant was convicted only of wanton or reckless acts or omissions, see notes 1 and 2, <em>supra, </em>is the <em>Welansky </em>definition of \u201cwanton or reckless,\u201d which is embedded in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(6). As <em>Welansky </em>held and as G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>13J(b), </em>tracks, \u201cThe essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>will result to another.\u201d <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass, at 399.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Where, as here, there were numerous injuries occurring over a period spanning close to thirty days, it was open to the Commonwealth to seek multiple indictments, each specifically identifying the discrete injury suffered. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 641 (1994) (no error in imposing successive sentences for unnatural rape and rape occurring in the course of a single criminal episode; \u201c[t]he realities of the multiple attacks on the victim warranted \u25a0\u2014\u2022 although they did not require \u2014 multiple indictments and consecutive sentences\u201d).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dingle, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 274,277,282-283 (2008) (no double jeopardy violation in charging the defendant on three indictments for possession with intent to distribute child pornography where police found, inter alla, 945 photographs, 177 videotapes, and multiple floppy discs; because possession of a single image constitutes a violation of the statute, \u201cthe Commonwealth could have indicted the defendant separately for each image he possessed or distributed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Also consistent with our conclusion that multiple injuries to a child, such as are predicated in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(\u00bf&gt;), may be the subject of separate indictments and punishments without violating the multiple punishment bar of double jeopardy is <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>430 Mass. 683 (2000). In <em>Crawford, </em>as in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>case, the court focused analysis on the third multiple punishment category of double jeopardy protection, and held that \u201cthe Legislature intended to authorize imposition of multiple punishments for concurrent violations of the [manslaughter] statute arising out of a single transaction\u201d because the appropriate unit of prosecution for such crimes is the person killed, not the underlying criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at 686-687.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cThere is no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that he may not be punished for two homicides when he fired only one shot. The \u2018probable harmful consequences\u2019 of a single gunshot, like the fire started by a single match or the car running out of control due to a single reckless miscalculation, are not limited to one death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, 367 </em>Mass. 743, 747 (1975). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>436 Mass. 291,295 (2002) (\u201ca single act can result in multiple convictions if there are multiple victims\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass, at 350-351 (no error in sentencing the defendant on two convictions of armed robbery of two individuals in the course of a single incident; no double jeopardy violation because the statute was directed to the assault element of robbery).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Applying the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), we are persuaded that there was sufficient evidence to support the seven convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The following is a summary of the evidence from the trial record. On September 17,2007, four month old Rory was brought to Winchester Hospital by his father (the defendant) and the child\u2019s mother. The parents referred to swelling in the child\u2019s shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Examination at that hospital revealed seventeen rib fractures at different stages of healing, a fractured humerus, a fractured tibia, and a fractured iliac crest (a bone in the pelvis). There were bruises <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>over the baby\u2019s entire body including on the left buttocks, leg, head, and right shoulder. There was a notable bruise on Rory\u2019s rib cage which virtually \u201clooked like a handprint.\u201d The child was subsequently taken to Children\u2019s Hospital by ambulance. Further review by the Children\u2019s Hospital child abuse protection team also discovered that the baby had suffered a lacerated spleen and a lacerated liver. According to the trial testimony of Dr. Alice Newton, one of the treating physicians from the child protection team at Children\u2019s Hospital, the multiple injuries were not consistent with having been caused by any accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The medical evidence concerning the time frame within which the injuries were inflicted upon Rory (commencing on August 21, 2007, and continuing up to the hours just before the September 17 hospitalization) was proximate to the first day the defendant became the child\u2019s primary caretaker as the mother returned to full-time work. That is, commencing on August 21, 2007, the defendant became Rory\u2019s primary full-time caretaker, and stayed with the baby at the mother\u2019s house during the daytime work hours, and sometimes at night and during weekends. Prior to the September 17 hospitalization, at the child\u2019s last doctor visits for routine care, on August 7 and August 15, 2007, the medical providers saw nothing amiss. The particular time frame concerning particular injuries is discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">a. <em>The indictments corresponding to the particular injuries inflicted. </em>In addressing the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we set forth the discrete and particularized bodily injuries to the child, and the trial evidence relating thereto for each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">(1) <em>The lacerated liver (indictment no. 1; substantial bodily injury). </em>When Rory was brought to Children\u2019s Hospital, he had \u201cmarkedly elevated\u201d liver enzymes, which, according to the medical evidence, was an indication of liver damage. A computerized tomography scan of the baby\u2019s liver showed a grade \u201c4-5\u201d (of 6) laceration of the liver, an injury which represented \u201cvery serious and severe damage to the liver.\u201d Dr. Newton described the liver injury as reflective of \u201cvery violent trauma\u201d consistent with \u201csome type of blow or crushing of the area.\u201d This type of injury is not seen \u201cin household falls\u201d or in \u201cclumsy handling of infants.\u201d In a baby of the victim\u2019s age, this type of liver injury would be like \u201cbeing hit in the abdomen or . . . either being stepped on or hit or crushed____\u201d There was \u201ca very large area of damage to the liver,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>and extensive bleeding so pronounced that the baby \u201ccould have bled to death at the time of the injury.\u201d In Dr. Newton\u2019s medical opinion and diagnosis, the child\u2019s liver injury had happened recently, probably within a \u201cfew days\u201d preceding the September 17, 2007, hospital admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">(2) <em>The lacerated spleen (indictment no. 2; substantial bodily injury). </em>The injury to Rory\u2019s spleen comprised \u201can area of contusion or laceration that went from the front to the back of the spleen.\u201d This kind of injury is very painful and very dangerous. The injury to the spleen had been inflicted within days of the September 17 hospitalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">(3) <em>The fractured humerus (indictment no. 3; bodily injury). </em>According to the medical evidence, the fracture of Rory\u2019s humerus bone had occurred relatively recently in relation to the September 17 hospital admission. This dating rested on the fact that there was not present any \u201cnew . . . bone formation\u201d such as would be expected if the injury had existed for seven to ten days. Further, according to the medical evidence, the baby\u2019s humerus bone fracture was caused by a very different kind of traumatic event than that which could have caused the laceration of the child\u2019s liver and spleen. This fracture was in an unusual location, where the upper arm meets the shoulder socket, and this humerus fracture would require \u201ca lot of force.\u201d That degree of force would be caused by an unreasonable \u201cjerking\u201d of the child or \u201cswinging the child by the arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">(4) <em>The fractured tibia (indictment no. 4; bodily injury). </em>There was a \u201cspiral\u201d fracture to Rory\u2019s lower leg bone, which was an \u201cacute\u201d or new injury. In order to have been inflicted, the \u201cspiral\u201d fracture to the tibia required \u201csome kind of torsion or torque, almost twisting movement, in order to develop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">(5) <em>The fractured iliac crest (indictment no. 5; bodily injury). </em>The injury to the iliac crest, located \u201cby the hip bone,\u201d was, in the doctor\u2019s opinion, a \u201cvery uncommon\u201d injury that would be inflicted by means of \u201ca tremendous amount of violence and force.\u201d The infliction of this substantial bodily injury would be the result of either a \u201cdirect blow or some type of movement that would force [the child\u2019s] leg kind of up into the pelvis or force it back in a forceful way to create pulling or attraction or direct trauma to that bone.\u201d Such major pelvic trauma with resulting iliac crest fracture, as the physician testified, would be comparable to fractures suffered in car crashes.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(6) <em>The fractured ribs (indictment no. 6; bodily injury). </em>Seventeen of Rory\u2019s ribs were fractured. Thirteen rib fractures showed \u201ccallus formation,\u201d which indicated that the force causing the fracture may have occurred in the range of seven to ten days before the September 17 hospital admission. Four of the other fractures bore no callus formation, reflecting a more recent infliction, within approximately seven days of September 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">There was evidence that \u201cdifferent types of trauma can lead to different locations of fractures in the rib.\u201d The four \u201cyounger\u201d fractures on the left side of the child\u2019s body were inflicted by means of a \u201cdifferent pressure and a different mechanism\u201d from the manner in which the other, older, thirteen fractures were inflicted. The older rib fractures as well as the tibia fracture were \u201cclearly not at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">(7) <em>Bruises (indictment no. 7; bodily injury). </em>There were four separate bruises. The child\u2019s body was marked by separate distinct bruises including finger-shaped bruises on his abdomen, a singular large bruise on his abdomen, and other bruises on his arm and the right side of his forehead.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">b. <em>Assessing the evidence. </em>Given the above evidence, and applying the <em>Latimore </em>standard, we find no merit in the defendant\u2019s arguments that the circumstantial evidence was inadequate; that the evidence was so equivocal as to result in \u201cconviction[s] based on conjecture\u201d; or that the Commonwealth failed to prove that any inaction on the part of the defendant \u201cresulted\u201d in the child\u2019s injuries, or that the liver and spleen injuries were so severe as to conform to the definition of \u201csubstantial bodily injury\u201d in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J. Nor is there any merit in the defendant\u2019s argument that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the defendant\u2019s failures to act amounted to wanton or reckless conduct. See <em>Commonwealth v. Welansky, </em>316 Mass, at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The defendant not only challenges the over-all insufficiency of the evidence which we address above but also, in a further variation, contends that there was insufficient evidence that the child\u2019s injuries would have been so apparent that a reasonable person would have known that the injuries existed and, thus, the defendant could not be deemed under the statute to have \u201cpermitted\u201d the injuries to have happened. This insufficiency challenge is also unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">In the special verdicts, the jury expressly found that the defendant, under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 131(6), third and fourth pars., having care and custody of the child, wantonly or recklessly permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>substantial bodily injury (indictment nos. 1 and 2) or bodily injury (indictment nos. 3-7) to the baby or wantonly or recklessly permitted another to inflict those injuries. For all the reasons previously stated, and based on the analysis of the evidence set forth therein, there was more than ample evidence to support those verdicts. To argue, as the defendant does, that an \u201cordinary normal man\u201d would not have \u201csensed grave danger\u201d to the child from many of the patently obvious injuries inflicted upon the baby\u2019s body and what must have been cries of anguish is simply not a sustainable contention.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We bear in mind, as referenced earlier, that this case \u201cstands in the not particularly unfamiliar posture of a child left in the custody of an identified adult, who suffers injuries of a type that are inconsistent with the explanation given by the custodian and not attributable in the circumstances to ordinary accidental causes.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 735. The host of discrete and particularized injuries to the child\u2019s body parts \u2014 a phrase that is wholly inadequate to describe the horrific damages to this four month old baby\u2019s body and the number of blows that would have been delivered to cause the baby\u2019s physical damage and suffering \u2014 provides the quintessential explanation for why the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>13J(b), </em>to define the unit of prosecution by the discrete and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>particularized injury to the child committed by or permitted to be committed by the wanton and reckless caretaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Order of single justice affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On these two indictments, the defendant was convicted on special verdicts under G.

More than an omission to act was required. In a concurrence, Justice Abrams, noting that \u2018a majority of State Legislatures have enacted criminal child abuse statutes which proscribe acts of omission as well as the affirmative infliction of harm,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 189-190, and noting also that \u2018compelling arguments can be made for and against criminalizing\u2019 acts of omission, stated: \u2018It is for the Legislature to determine whether expanding that duty by criminalizing acts of omission would better protect the Commonwealth\u2019s children.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 191-192.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J(6), is ambiguous and therefore the rule of lenity should apply. Rather, the statute, as we discuss above, reflects a clear and plain statutory offense structure based on discrete and particularized injuries to a child\u2019s body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The controlling holding in <em>Welansky </em>\u2014 indeed the holding for which the case is most \u201cfamous\u201d \u2014 is the common-law criminal pronouncement that, \u201c[i]f by wanton and reckless conduct bodily injury is caused to another, the person guilty of such conduct is guilty of assault.. . [and] if death results he is guilty of manslaughter.\u201d <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 401. However, in the affirmance of the multiple indictments for and convictions of the multiple deaths, <em>Welansky </em>also supports that the proper unit of prosecution was predicated upon indictments returned for each of the victims who died as a result of the defendant\u2019s single course of reckless and wanton conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\">As to the quoted statement in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, supra, </em>compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>61 Mass.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J[\u00bf&gt;], first par.; evidence showed that the child was well before being placed into the defendants\u2019 care for approximately one month), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. at 421-422 (notwithstanding medical evidence showing twenty-six rib fractures, a skull fracture, fractures of both clavicles, and two fractures of the leg, and expert testimony identifying \u201cat least two and probably three different times during which the injuries occurred,\u201d only two indictments were returned against each defendant under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J[\u00a3&gt;], and each defendant was convicted on only one of the indictments).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Where a statute governing an offense does not focus on a discrete injury to an individual (unlike G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13J[6]) but, rather, the conduct of the offender, the Supreme Judicial Court has found that the correct unit of prosecution does not take into account the number of discrete victims. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>443 Mass. 521, 524 (2005) (holding that the unit of prosecution under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24[2][o 1/2] [2], for leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident was the driver\u2019s conduct, not the number of potential victims affected by the conduct). The <em>Constantino </em>court observed that, in that case, \u201cthe fact that [the] statute is listed as a motor vehicle offense under G. L. c. 90, rather than a crime against a person under G. L. c. 265, further supports the view that the act is scene related.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We further reject the defendant\u2019s contention that only two of the injuries occurred on separate occasions. That contention is belied by the great weight of the medical trial evidence. Even were one to put aside the discrete and particularized injuries to the child, and focus on time-dating the violent act or acts as different \u201coccasions\u201d in point of time (as the defendant would have us do), the medical evidence in this case dated the injuries in five of the indictments as bearing indicia of infliction at different points in time. It was only the massive injuries in the lacerations to the liver and spleen (indictment nos. 1 and 2), and the fractures of the tibia and iliac crest (indictments nos. 4 and 5) that were not susceptible to precise time-dating in the medical testimony. As to the spleen and liver lacerations, Dr. Newton testified that it was not possible to determine whether the injury to the spleen might have been inflicted at the same time as the injury to the liver, because, given the extreme trauma that would lead to both the deep lacerations to the liver and spleen, it was \u201clogically\u201d possible that the blow or blows causing the lacerations of the two organs may have been delivered close in time or at the same time. Similarly, it was also not possible, given the physical characteristics of the respective bone structures, to differentiate by time-dating when the tibia fracture and the iliac crest fracture were inflicted and whether these bones were broken and fractured within the same time frame, or indeed could have happened at the same time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
