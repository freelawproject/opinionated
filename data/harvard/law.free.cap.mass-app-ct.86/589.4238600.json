L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, and poses the question whether, in cases where an injured employee receives workers\u2019 compensation benefits and then sues and successfully negotiates the allocation of noneconomic damages to the employee in a lawsuit against a third-party tortfeasor, the \u00a7 15 lien attaches to the noneconomic damage recovery, such as for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>We conclude that this interlocutory appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 4from an order denying the plaintiff\u2019s amended petition for settlement is controlled by this court\u2019s previous decision in <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 592 (2011) <em>(Curry).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Curry </em>held that an insurer\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, did not reach the settlement proceeds of an employee\u2019s third-party action that were allocated to the worker for his pain and suffering and to his spouse for loss of consortium. The fact that <em>Curry </em>was a wrongful death action brought by the estate of a deceased worker, and that this case is a tort action brought by an injured worker, does not, we believe, provide a meaningful basis on which to distinguish <em>Curry, </em>and not apply its rationale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the <em>Curry </em>court pointed out, a deceased worker\u2019s legal representative \u201cstands in the shoes of the deceased\u201d worker for purposes of \u00a7 15. <em>Curry, supra </em>at 595 &amp; 597 n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We begin by noting that the holding in <em>Curry </em>has been followed by the Department of Industrial Accidents. See Circular Letter No. 341, issued by the department on April 12, 2012, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">\u201cThe department is presently revising its \u00a7 15 interactive calculator [for allocations under G.

Amounts so allocated are beyond the reach of the workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s lien, and therefore are not subject to offset against the employee\u2019s entitlement to c. 152 benefits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">See Nason, Koziol, and Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 27.12, at 100 &amp; n.9.50 (Supp. 2014) (\u201cThe Massachusetts Appeals Court has clearly settled this debate, holding [in Curry] that the double recovery [prohibition] is limited to compensation payments; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>therefore, the insurer cannot receive reimbursement from that portion of the third party recovery attributable to payment for the employee\u2019s conscious pain and suffering.\u201d) The settled interpretation of a statute \u201cought not to be lightly disturbed.

App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (2006) (\u00a7 15 does not apply to settlement payments based on loss of consortium claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Accordingly, we vacate the order denying the amended petition for settlement and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>The essential facts are not in dispute. On October 11, 2004, Robert M. DiCarlo (DiCarlo) suffered serious personal injuries as a result of an accident while working as an electrician at a construction site. He was out of work for two and one-half years and collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his medical expenses ($48,431.16) and lost wages ($233,387.95) from his employer\u2019s insurer, Twin City Fire Insurance Company (insurer). In March, 2007, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, DiCarlo filed a third-party lawsuit against the general contractor and owner of the property where the injury occurred (Suffolk Construction, Inc., and Walker Brook Crossing, LLC). DiCarlo amended his complaint, without opposition, to add a loss of consortium claim on behalf of his wife, Deborah. The parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>participated in mediation and settled DiCarlo\u2019s lawsuit for $100,000, which was to be paid by the insurer of the defendants and third-party defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The Superior Court judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on DiCarlo\u2019s amended petition for settlement and allowed counsel for the parties to inquire of both DiCarlo and his wife. DiCarlo also submitted certified copies of his medical records. G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G. The judge made detailed findings of fact in which she found DiCarlo and his wife \u201cto be credible in every particular.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge found that the evidence supported DiCarlo\u2019s proposed thirty-five percent allocation of the settlement funds as compensation for his pain and suffering and thirty-five percent allocation as compensation for his wife\u2019s claim for loss of consortium.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, the judge went on to conclude that the proposed allocation to DiCarlo of thirty-five percent of the settlement proceeds for pain and suffering was subject to the insurer\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Approval of the proposed settlement was consequently denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, DiCarlo contends that this case is controlled by <em>Curry. </em>We agree. As previously referenced, in <em>Curry </em>this</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>court held that damages for conscious pain and suffering recovered by the estate of a deceased worker, and damages for loss of consortium recovered by the decedent\u2019s family members in a third-party action, were not reimbursable to the insurer under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, because conscious pain and suffering and loss of consortium are not compensable injuries under G. L. c. 152. <em>Curry, supra </em>at 594-595. Accordingly, an insurer\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, did not reach a claim for loss of consortium recovered in a third-party action because such claims were \u201centirely independent and distinct from the personal injury claims of the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, quoting from <em>Huitin </em>v. <em>Francis Harvey &amp; Sons, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. at 695. The <em>Curry </em>court made it clear that it was the distinction between the types of damages an injured employee can recover under G. L. c. 152 (lost wages and medical expenses) compared to what can be recovered in a tort action (loss of earning capacity, medical expenses, and pain and suffering) that was determinative of the scope of an insurer\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. See <em>Curry, supra </em>at 596-597 &amp; n.7. The <em>Curry </em>decision relies on the following precedent, which is summarized in the decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cIn <em>Eisner </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., supra </em>at 129, the Supreme Judicial Court was charged with answering the following certified question from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit: \u2018Whether a workmen\u2019s compensation insurer is entitled to reimbursement under [\u00a7 15] of the portion of the net proceeds of a third party settlement for the loss of consortium of the widow.\u2019 The court answered in the negative, observing that \u2018[s]ection 15 does not require reimbursement for an injury not compensable under c. 152. The wife received no separate compensation payments for loss of consortium. Nowhere does c. 152 suggest that loss of consortium is a compensable injury.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 133-134. See <em>Hultin </em>v. <em>Francis Harvey &amp; Sons, Inc., supra </em>at 695 (\u2018claims of the spouse of an injured employee for loss of consortium ... are entirely independent and distinct from the personal injury claims of the employee\u2019); <em>Wilson\u2019s Case, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (2006) (settlement payments based on claimant\u2019s loss of consortium claim \u2018are related to the claimant\u2019s own independent loss stemming from the workplace incident. As such, the settlement payments are not subject to a lien by the employer, and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, which is designed to guard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>against double recovery by an employee or dependent, does not apply\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\"><em>Curry, supra </em>at 595-596.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The holding in <em>Curry </em>is consonant with the statutory purposes underlying the workers\u2019 compensation laws in G. L. c. 152, which is to protect workers. This principle has been consistently reaffirmed by the Supreme Judicial Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201cIt has long been recognized that the Act \u2018was enacted as a \u201chumanitarian measure\u201d in response to strong public sentiment that the remedies afforded by actions of tort at common law did not provide adequate protection to workers.\u2019 It is designed to provide financial compensation for the impairment of an injured worker\u2019s earning capacity. The Act is \u2018a remedial statute and should be given a broad interpretation, viewed in light of its purpose and to \u201cpromote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u2019 \u201d Further, it must be analyzed \u2018as a whole ... so that the various portions taken together shall constitute a harmonious and consistent legislative enactment.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-8\"><em>Spaniol\u2019s Case, </em>466 Mass. 102, 106-107 (2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Thus, we follow <em>Curry </em>as the binding precedent of this court and hold in this case that DiCarlo\u2019s compensation for pain and suffering was not subject to the G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, insurer\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">The order denying the amended petition for settlement is reversed, and a new order shall enter consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\">Leave to file an interlocutory appeal was granted by a single justice of this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The Supreme Judicial Court denied further appellate review in <em>Curry. </em>See 461 Mass. 1103 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b620-12\">In denying the amended petition, the judge relied on the distinction that <em>Curry </em>was a wrongful death case, a distinction that we reject.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\">We note that the Legislature is \u201cpresumed to be aware of the manner in which its statutes have been interpreted.\u201d <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>461 Mass. 519, 524 (2012), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wynton W., </em>459 Mass. 745, 751 (2011). Our research into legislative activity post-Curry indicates that no bills were filed to amend G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, in response to this court\u2019s holding in <em>Curry </em>regarding allocations for independent noneconomic-based causes of actions, such as for pain and suffering.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the National Association of Subrogation Professionals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Pursuant to court order, this agreed-upon settlement amount was placed in a trust account.

He could not work. He became moody and irritable .... He required considerable pain medication which made him somewhat incoherent.

This court credits the complaints by [DiCarlo] of constant pain and interference with quality of life that are consistent with and corroborated by the medical record. Moreover, each member of this couple suffered near-equally as a result of [DiCarlo\u2019s] injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\">DiCarlo\u2019s settlement proposal requested that approximately thirty-five percent of the settlement be awarded to him for his pain and suffering, approximately thirty-five percent be awarded to his wife for her loss of consortium, and approximately thirty percent to the insurer to satisfy its lien, with each portion again assigned a pro rata share of the attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The insurer proposed that it should receive no less than ninety percent of the settlement and that no more than ten percent be awarded to DiCarlo\u2019s wife if the court found her claim for loss of consortium supported by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\">The judge also ruled that an allocation of thirty-five percent of the settlement proceeds resulting from the third-party action to the wife for her consortium claim was <em>not </em>subject to the insurer\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15. This aspect of the judge\u2019s decision has not been not challenged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b624-12\">Agnes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABo\">(concurring in the result). I agree with the majority\u2019s decision to rely on <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 592 (2011) <em>(Curry), </em>and to hold that the workers\u2019 compensation insurer\u2019s lien under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, does not reach the damages for pain and suffering recovered by the injured worker in a third-party action. However, my concurrence is based solely on the doctrine of stare decisis. In my view, a panel of this court should follow a recently published decision of the court on a question of statutory interpretation in the absence of any intervening action by the Legislature or a decision by the Supreme Judicial Court that overrules or calls into question the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Appeals Court opinion. I write separately because, based on earlier decisions by the Supreme Judicial Court, I have reservations whether <em>Curry </em>was decided correctly. Because this case involves an issue of considerable importance to the administration of justice, an outline of the reasons why a different outcome in this case should be reached may assist the Supreme Judicial Court or the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The appropriate starting point is the statute, bearing in mind that when the words are plain and unambiguous, our sole function is to enforce the law as written. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boe, </em>456 Mass. 337, 347 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">General Laws, c. 152, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 39, provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-7\">\u201cWhere the injury for which compensation is payable was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the insured to pay damages in respect thereof, the employee shall be entitled, without election, to the compensation and other benefits provided under this chapter. Either the employee or insurer may proceed to enforce the liability of such person, but the insurer may not do so unless compensation has been paid in accordance with sections seven, eight, ten A, eleven C, twelve or nineteen nor until seven months following the date of such injury. <em>The sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the insurer, unless such sum is greater than that paid by it to the employee, in which event the excess shall be retained by or paid to the employee. </em>For the purposes of this section, \u2018excess\u2019 shall mean the amount by which the gross sum received in payment for the injury exceeds the compensation paid under this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The language \u201c[t]he sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the insurer,\u201d is not otherwise qualified or limited in \u00a7 15 or elsewhere in G. L. c. 152. This language has been part of our workers\u2019 compensation law since it was enacted in 1911. <em>Rhode </em>v. <em>Beacon Sales Co., </em>416 Mass. 14, 17 (1993) <em>(Rhode). </em>The phrase \u201cthe sum recovered\u201d does not differentiate between the types of damages that may be recovered by or on behalf of an employee in a third-party action. In Rhode, the court observed that the language was designed to establish \u201can insurer\u2019s right to full reimbursement of benefits.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>It is also instructive to examine the cases prior to <em>Curry </em>which have interpreted \u00a7 15, but which are not considered and distinguished in <em>Curry. </em>In <em>Rhode, </em>an employee obtained a recovery from the tortfeasor in excess of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits he had received. He argued that because \u201che was recovering only a fraction of the value of his injuries,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16, from the tortfeasor, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer was not entitled to the full amount of the lien. He claimed that the Superior Court judge could make an equitable allocation between the employee and the insurer in approving a settlement under \u00a7 15 based on the most recent amendment to the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. The court rejected this argument and held that \u201ca judge has no discretionary power to review and to determine the fair allocation of proceeds between an insurer and the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. Instead, the Supreme Judicial Court explained that the only allocation that \u00a7 15 allows is between the employee and his family members. Except for that allocation, \u201c[ujntil an \u2018excess\u2019 recovery exists, the <em>entire recovery </em>is for the insurer\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 19. The court observed that \u201cthis court has consistently recognized an insurer\u2019s right to full reimbursement of benefits,\u201d and that the 1991 amendment \u201cdid not in any way alter this language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. See <em>Dufresne\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 81, 85-86 (2001) (noting that \u201cthe purposes of the offset are first to preclude double recovery by the employee . . . and, second, to maintain the policy of reimbursement for the compensation insurer\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contrast G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 46A (as to liens held by health insurers and medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>providers, the Department of Industrial Accidents may compromise their claims to the proceeds of a third-party action and assign priority to the recovery by the injured employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The interpretation of \u00a7 15 set forth in <em>Rhode </em>was followed in <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Plymouth Restaurant Group, </em>440 Mass. 469 (2003) <em>(Lane), </em>where the Supreme Judicial Court stressed that reimbursement of the insurer was a primary goal of \u00a7 15 and held that at the hearing to approve a settlement of a third-party tort action in which a workers\u2019 compensation insurer has a lien, a judge must allow the workers\u2019 compensation insurer to present evidence regarding the fair allocation of settlement proceeds among the insurance beneficiaries. See <em>id. </em>at 472-473.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Consideration of <em>Bongiorno </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>417 Mass. 396 (1994) <em>(Bongiorno), </em>raises additional concern about the reasoning in <em>Curry. </em>In <em>Bongiorno, </em>the issue was whether a workers\u2019 compensation insurer was entitled to a lien on a settlement obtained in a legal malpractice action, where the employee had sued his lawyers for malpractice after they had failed timely to serve a complaint against a third-party tortfeasor who was allegedly responsible for the employee\u2019s workplace injury. <em>Id. </em>at 397-399. The employee maintained that the \u00a7 15 lien did not apply to the settlement proceeds resulting from the malpractice lawsuit because otherwise the injured employee would not be made whole. <em>Id. </em>at 402. The Supreme Judicial Court rejected this argument and concluded that the purpose of \u00a7 15 is not to ensure that plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>are fully compensated, but rather to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurers with the first priority in the allocation of third-party recoveries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cIn enacting G. L. c. 152, the Legislature chose to favor certainty and relative administrative convenience over the opportunity for an injured party to obtain full redress in court. It may indeed be the case, as the plaintiffs argue, that they have not been fully compensated even by the total of the benefits received under G. L. c. 152 and the settlement with the [lawyers]. Nevertheless, we think that the intent and purpose of G. L. c. 152 are better served by treating the malpractice recovery as a third-party recovery subject to Liberty Mutual\u2019s lien under \u00a7 15. The malpractice recovery serves to compensate indirectly for the same injuries that the workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid by Liberty Mutual compensated directly. To enforce the legislative intent of reimbursing workers\u2019 compensation insurers before awarding full tort damages to an injured worker, the malpractice recovery should be subject to Liberty Mutual\u2019s claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 402.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The reasoning in <em>Curry </em>is also problematic in light of the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cinjury\u201d in that portion of the statute quoted above in the text. The word \u201cinjury\u201d in \u00a7 15 and throughout G. L. c. 152 as a whole appears to refer to the personal injury sustained by the employee as a result of the work-related accident. Section 15 begins with the phrase \u201cthe injury for which compensation is payable,\u201d using the term \u201cinjury,\u201d I believe, to refer to the personal injury, and the term \u201ccompensation\u201d to refer to the wage benefits and medical expenses payable under G. L. c. 152. Section 18, which pertains to independent contractors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>subcontractors, further explains that workers\u2019 compensation benefits and medical expenses are not the \u201cinjury\u201d but rather are paid \u201con account of any injury to the employee.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18. Additional sections of G. L. c. 152 use the term \u201cinjury\u201d in a manner that suggests it refers to the personal injury suffered by the employee and not the category of damages awarded on account of an injury resulting from the tortious conduct of a third party.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Legislative recognition of an insurer\u2019s right to be made whole for amounts it has paid to an injured employee in workers\u2019 compensation benefits before the employee retains any portion of an award of damages or settlement in a third-party action is grounded in equitable considerations. By electing to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits, an injured employee is relieved of the need to bring a lawsuit, to prove negligence, and to risk suffering the consequences of comparative negligence and a reduction or loss of the right to recover any damages which may result if a tort action was brought instead of a claim for benefits under G. L. c. 152. See <em>Richard </em>v. Arsenault, 349 Mass. 521, 524 (1965).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although there is an equitable argument to be made on behalf of the employee, namely, that pain and suffering damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>recovered in a third-party action provide relief that is not available under G. L. c. 152, prior to <em>Curry </em>this view did not animate the discussion in the cases interpreting \u00a7 15. Instead, the Supreme Judicial Court has written that the goal of \u00a7 15 is to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurers with first priority in the allocation of third-party recoveries. <em>Bongiorno, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Another problem with the reasoning in <em>Curry </em>is that it requires the phrase \u201cthe sum recovered,\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 15, to refer not to the entire amount recovered in the third-party action, nor to the \u201cgross sum received in payment for the injury,\u201d as the statute provides, but instead to some lesser amount of that \u201cgross sum\u201d consisting exclusively of damages awarded for lost wages and medical expenses. This requires a strained reading of the statute\u2019s text. It is based on speculation about a distinction that the Legislature could have made between economic and noneconomic damages, but that does not appear in the statute. See <em>Saab </em>v. <em>Massachusetts CVS Pharmacy, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 564, 572 (2008) (\u201c[I]t is not the role of courts to create a more comprehensive or logical system of compensation. . . . That is a task for the Legislature\u201d). In order to read such a distinction into the law we would have to disregard the Legislature\u2019s specific direction to courts about how to read statutes, see G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as well as our own canons of construction. \u201c[T]he statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">While the law in other States relating to the scope of the insurer\u2019s lien is not a certain guide, it is noteworthy that a majority of courts in other jurisdictions with statutes comparable to \u00a7 15 include damages for pain and suffering recovered in a third-party action within the scope of the insurer\u2019s lien. See 6 Larson\u2019s Workers Compensation Law \u00a7 117.01[1] &amp; accompanying digest (2014 ed.) (collecting cases).

L. c. 152, \u00a7 15: \u201cAt such hearing the court shall inquire and make a finding as to the taking of evidence on the merits of the settlement, on the fair allocation of amounts payable to the employee and the employee\u2019s spouse, children, parents and any other member of the employee\u2019s family or next of kin who may have claims arising from the injury for which are payable, under this chapter in which the action has been commenced after an opportunity has been afforded both the insurer and the employee to be heard on the merits of the settlement and on the amount, if any, to which the insurer is entitled out of such settlement by way of reimbursement, and on the amount of excess that shall be subject to offset against any future payment of benefits under this chapter by the insurer, which amount shall be determined at the time of such approval. In determining the amount of \u2018excess\u2019 that shall be subject to offset against any future compensation payment the board, the reviewing board, or the court in which the action has been commenced shall consider the fair allocation of amounts payable to and amongst family members who may have claims arising from the injury for which said compensation is payable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"><em>Curry </em>appears to be premised on the notion that the goal of preventing an injured employee from receiving a double recovery in a third-party action under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\u00a7 15 is maintained by shielding the employee\u2019s recovery for pain and suffering from the reach of the lien because a recovery for pain and suffering is not permitted in an action under G. L. c. 152. See <em>Curry, supra </em>at 595. However, the bar against permitting double recovery is defined more broadly to mean that \u201can employee should not recover both workmen\u2019s compensation benefits and damages at law for the same injury.\u201d <em>Eisner </em>v. <em>Hertz Corp., </em>381 Mass. 127, 131 (1980), quoting from <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Employers\u2019 Liab. Assur. Corp., </em>288 Mass. 170, 174 (1934). When an injured employee receives compensation under G. L. c. 152 and then brings a third-party action, whether the recovery segregates the award of damages for loss of earning capacity, medical expenses, and pain and suffering or not, there are two recoveries for the same injury. Under \u00a7 15, it is only when the recovery in the tort action is \u201cin excess\u201d of the compensation paid by the insurer under G. L. c. 152 that it is received by the employee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">In <em>Lane, </em>the dispute was over the allocation of the proceeds of a third-party action in which the judge approved a settlement in the amount of $237,500, by allocating only ten percent toward the decedent\u2019s personal injury, and thus recoverable by the insurer, with the remainder allocated to cover claims for loss of consortium and negligent infliction of emotional distress on the part of the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse and four sons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Additional cases decided by the Supreme Judicial Court and cited by the insurer make the same point.

The obvious disposition of the matter is to give the employer so much of the negligence recovery as is necessary to reimburse him for his compensation outlay, and give the employee the excess. This is fair to everyone concerned: the employer, who, in a fault sense, is neutral, comes out even; the third person pays exactly the damages he would normally pay, which is correct, since to reduce his burden because of the relation between the employer and employee would be a simple windfall to him which he has done nothing to deserve; and the employee gets a fuller reimbursement for actual damages sustained than is possible under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>the compensation system alone.\u2019 Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 71.20.
