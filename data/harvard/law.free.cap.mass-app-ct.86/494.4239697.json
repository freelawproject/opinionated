Brisson is an attorney who was representing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>four potential witnesses who were cooperating with the Commonwealth in the pending murder charges against the defendant, Derek Hunt. Counsel for the defendant asked for permission to subpoena the documents, and the judge ordered them produced; when Brisson refused to turn them over, he was found in contempt. We vacate the order of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\"><em>Background. </em>The significant facts are not in dispute. On March 30, 2009, the defendant was indicted on charges of murder and carrying a firearm without a license. Approximately two years later, in April of 2011, at the request of the defendant, Brisson was appointed to represent four potential witnesses, on the ground that their testimony could violate their rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judge described the witnesses\u2019 testimony as \u201ccritical to the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d Shortly before the scheduled trial, the \u201cclient-witnesses disclosed to the District Attorney\u2019s Office alleged improper conduct of defense counsel and/or her investigator, which sought to influence their testimony at trial.\u201d Thereafter, the four witnesses appeared before a separately convened grand jury investigating the claims against defense counsel and her investigator and, during that process, the four were given immunity for their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In the meantime, apparently believing that there were credibility issues in the witnesses\u2019 proposed trial testimony, defense counsel filed a motion \u201cto authorize [her] to subpoena to the clerk\u2019s office of Fall River Superior Court any and all records, notes, documents, and recordings in the possession of Attorney Donald Brisson relative to his representation\u201d of the four witnesses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brisson opposed the motion through counsel, claiming the attorney-client and work product privileges; Brisson also argued that the motion failed to meet the minimum requirements required for production of documents by a third party. On January 20, 2012, defense counsel filed a \u201cmotion for summons for non-privileged records of Attorney Donald Brisson,\u201d pursuant to rule 17(a)(2), along with her affidavit and a supporting memorandum of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Brisson filed a supplemental opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>On January 23, 2012, after a hearing, the judge ordered Brisson to produce, on or before January 26, 2012, a list of materials which the judge had reformulated from defense counsel\u2019s request into five specific categories.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brisson filed an emergency petition in the Supreme Judicial Court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking review of the order. A single justice denied the petition, finding that \u201c[t]he material sought is non-privileged,\u201d Brisson \u201cha[d] not been held in contempt, and his petition [was] premature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">On January 30, 2012, at the scheduled pretrial hearing, Brisson\u2019s attorney argued that, because defense counsel had not reduced the judge\u2019s order to a summons and served Brisson, he (Brisson) was unable to object to the request through the proper procedural mechanism of a motion to quash. The judge disagreed, stating that because Brisson had been afforded \u201cample due process,\u201d the issuance of a subpoena would \u201cadd[ ] little, if anything\u201d to the January 23 order because a hearing on \u201ca motion to quash would raise the very same issues that were already raised and argued before [him] and taken to the [Supreme Judicial Court].\u201d Brisson declined to produce the materials; he was held in civil contempt, with a penalty of $500 per day until he complied with the order, the penalty to begin the following day. Brisson timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Brisson also immediately filed a petition in this court seeking a temporary stay of the contempt order pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 6(a), as appearing in 454 Mass. 1601 (2009). On February 2, 2012, after hearing, a single justice determined, among other things, (1) that defense counsel\u2019s affidavit filed in support of her request for a summons upon Brisson was insufficient under Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a)(2), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004), and (2) that the contempt order failed to comply with the \u201cspecific protocols set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass. 122, 145-150 (2006).\u201d The motion for a stay was allowed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On February 6, 2012, the defendant served Brisson with a summons requiring him to appear at the defendant\u2019s trial beginning that day, and requiring him (Brisson) to bring the materials described in an attached list.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Brisson filed a motion to quash the subpoena, and it was denied. The defendant took no further action to obtain the materials; on February 13, 2012, he was acquitted of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Contempt order. </em>Brisson first argues that the materials sought by the defendant were protected by safeguards that require a certain protocol be followed prior to obtaining access, and that the defendant did not follow the protocol. Brisson claims that, because a summons for the materials never was issued before the contempt order was issued, he was deprived of the proper mechanism to object to the document request, rendering the contempt order unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">When a defendant seeks pretrial inspection of presumptively privileged records of a third party, that defendant must adhere to the protocols grounded in rule 17. See <em>Dwyer, </em>448 Mass, at 139. See also Mass.R.Crim.P. 17(a)(2); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1108 (2014). A party in a criminal case may file a motion to compel production of documents from the third party so long as the materials \u201cmay contain relevant information that has evidentiary value to the defense,\u201d and \u201cthe motion [is] supported by an affidavit that shows that \u2018the documentary evidence sought has a \u201crational tendency to prove [or disprove] an issue in the case.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caceres, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 747, 750 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265, 269-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>270 (2004). The accompanying affidavit must meet the requirements of rule 13(a)(2), and <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 270. <em>Dwyer, supra </em>at 147 (Appendix 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Prior to issuing a summons for the materials, a judge must determine whether the moving party has made a showing sufficient to satisfy the four-requirement standard outlined in <em>Lampron. Id. </em>at 141-142. Specifically, the moving party must establish good cause for the production of third-party documents, which is \u201csatisfied by a showing \u2018(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974). \u201c[RJule 17(a)(2) <em>must </em>be satisfied before any documents of any kind may be summonsed from any third party prior to trial.\u201d <em>Dwyer, supra </em>at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In this case, defense counsel\u2019s affidavit accompanying the rule 17 motion is not specific and contains conclusory statements that fall short of meeting the required showing. Contrast <em>Caceres, supra </em>at 750-751. Compare <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>451 Mass. 113, 122 (2008), where the defendant satisfied each of the four requirements under <em>Lampron </em>by providing a lengthy and detailed affidavit establishing \u201ca specific basis for the relevancy of the requested documents, and identifying] the source . . . and reliability of the hearsay.\u201d In this case, the judge\u2019s January 23, 2012, order to provide the materials was issued in error and the defendant does not now contend otherwise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">2. <em>Mootness. </em>Defense counsel argues, rather, that Brisson\u2019s appeal is moot and frivolous because the contempt order against him was stayed and never was reinstated, and no sanction ever was imposed upon him. For support, she cites <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rape Crisis Servs. of Greater Lowell, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 190, 193 (1993), where the court stated that \u201c[u]nlilce its criminal counterpart, civil contempt is not punitive but \u2018intended to achieve</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>compliance with the court\u2019s orders for the benefit of the complainant.\u2019 <em>Furtado </em>v. <em>Furtado, </em>380 Mass. 137, 141 (1980). Vindication may be proper where a conviction of contempt results in the imposition of a punitive sentence and incarceration, but such is not the case here, where the finding of civil contempt was meant simply to coerce. Judicial economy and the lack of an adversary quality to this proceeding seal its fate.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anastos, </em>438 Mass. 846, 849-850 (2003). In both <em>Rape Crisis Servs. of Greater Lowell, Inc., </em>and <em>Anastos, </em>however, the judgment of contempt had been vacated prior to the appellate decision and, therefore, the appeal indeed had been moot. Here, the contempt order remains outstanding. In addition, as with an abuse prevention order under G. L. c. 209A, or a harassment order under G. L. c. 258E, the effect of maintaining the contempt order against Brisson may have continuing consequences, even though the order was intended only to be coercive. See, e.g., <em>Seney </em>v. <em>Morhy, </em>467 Mass. 58, 62 (2014); <em>Wooldridge </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 638 (1998); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 133 (2006). For that reason, we are not persuaded that this appeal is moot or frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">3. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>Brisson also argues that defense counsel\u2019s actions amounted to misconduct and that, as a result, she should be ordered to pay the expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in his effort to vacate the contempt order as well as for his own time expended in that effort. We disagree. Although the method defense counsel used in her attempt to obtain the materials was defective, we accept the judge\u2019s finding that the request was made in good faith. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odgren, </em>455 Mass. 171, 188 (2009). In addition, this issue was raised for the first time on appeal and, therefore, is waived. See <em>Martins </em>v. <em>University of Mass. Med. Sch., </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 623, 634 n.17 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\n<em>Order of contempt vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The motion provided \u201c[a]s reasons therefor\u201d that the materials \u201ccontain discoverable material with respect to the case herein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Other than her name and her representation that she was an attorney in good standing, defense counsel included in her affidavit only one statement of fact supporting her document request: \u201c4.
