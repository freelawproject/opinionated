The count alleges that the defendant sold marijuana within one hundred feet of a \u201cpublic park or playground\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, as amended by St. 1993, c. 335. The issues presented are whether \u00a7 32J applies only to \u201cpublic\u201d playgrounds and whether that category excludes playgrounds located on private property, even if accessible to members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\"><em>Background. </em>The following facts are agreed upon for purposes of the reported questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">\u201cOn October 28, 2011, the defendant is alleged to have sold marijuana to an undercover officer. The sale is alleged to have taken place within 100 feet of the outdoor playground at the Windsor Meadows Apartment Complex, a private apartment complex, located at 135 Broadmeadow Street, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Marlborough, Massachusetts____The playground has a fence that does not completely surround it and thus anyone can enter the playground without needing to open any gate or door. . . . There are no signs regarding who may access the playground. Among other play structures, there is a slide, climbing structure, and swing set with four swings within the playground.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">After the defendant was arrested and the complaint issued, the defendant moved to dismiss one count alleging violation of \u00a7 32J, on the basis that the playground at the Windsor Meadows Apartment Complex is not \u201cpublic.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing, the judge denied the motion, ruling \u201cthat the law was clearly intended to protect children and the word \u2018playground\u2019 should not be so narrowly construed to only include playgrounds open to the general public but should and does include playgrounds where children [play on private property].\u201d The judge then agreed to report the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201c1. With reference to the phrase \u2018public park or playground\u2019 in G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, does the word public modify both park and playground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201c2. Is it within the purview of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, if the incident occurs within 100 feet of a playground on private property?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cIf, prior to trial,... a question of law arises which the trial judge determines is so important or doubtful as to require the decision of the Appeals Court, the judge may report the case so far as necessary to present the question of law arising therein.\u201d Mass.R.Crim.P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004). Whether to report a question is within the judge\u2019s discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagleton, </em>402 Mass. 199, 208 (1988). Reported questions are appropriate for appellate court review only where, as here, \u201cit appears that they present serious questions likely to be material in the ultimate decision, and that subsequent proceedings in the trial court will be substantially facilitated by so doing.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry\u2019s Drywall Co., </em>362 Mass. 552, 557 (1972), quoting from <em>John Gilbert Jr. Co. </em>v. <em>C.M. Fauci Co., </em>309 Mass. 271, 273 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">1. The first question in this case is whether \u00a7 32J applies only to playgrounds that are \u201cpublic\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The defendant argues that it does, asserting that the word \u201cpublic\u201d should be read to modify both \u201cpark\u201d and \u201cplayground.\u201d The Commonwealth contends that because the word \u201cpublic\u201d directly precedes only the word \u201cpark,\u201d the statute applies to any playground, public or private.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\u201cAs with all matters of statutory interpretation, we look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mogelinski, </em>466 Mass. 627, 633 (2013). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>463 Mass. 620, 624 (2012) (\u201cThe ordinary language of the sentence guides our interpretation\u201d). \u201c[Wjhere the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Thurdin </em>v. <em>SEI Boston, EEC, </em>452 Mass. 436, 444 (2008). On the other hand, where ambiguity exists in a criminal statute we must resolve it in favor of the accused. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass. 422, 436-437 (2011), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The applicable version of \u00a7 32J requires an automatic from and after sentence when a person commits any of certain drug offenses</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">\u201cwhile in or on, or within one thousand feet of the real property comprising a public or private accredited preschool, accredited headstart facility, elementary, vocational, or secondary school whether or not in session, or within one hundred feet of <em>a public park or playground . . </em>.\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J, as amended through St. 1998, c. 194, \u00a7 146.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute contains no definitions for the operative terms. No Massachusetts appellate opinion has decided whether the final quoted phrase of \u00a7 32J applies to a private playground, and the only case we have found touching on this part of the statute dealt with its constitutionality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 25 (1998). In <em>Davie, </em>we were asked to decide whether the word \u201cpark\u201d is void for vagueness and, in response to a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>fense argument that the statute applied only to parks which contain playgrounds, we held that \u201cthe use of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 [between the words \u2018park\u2019 and \u2018playground\u2019] unambiguously serves to distinguish places in or near which an offense may be committed under the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. We were not asked in that case to interpret the full language at issue here; rather, \u201c[w]e look[ed] to whether the word \u2018park\u2019 would permit a person of average intelligence to know what the statute proscribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Here, we must interpret the statute to decide whether the Legislature intended it to apply only to \u201cpublic\u201d playgrounds. \u201cIn the absence of specific precedent on the meaning of a word or phrase in a statute, we are guided by accepted principles of construction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>368 Mass. 58, 68 (1975). \u201cAs a matter of statutory construction, \u2018ordinarily the coupling of words denotes an intention that they should be understood in the same general sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass, at 432, quoting from 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:16, at 352-353 (7th ed. 2007). Additionally, \u201c[w]here general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432 n.12, quoting from 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:17, at 358-360 (7th ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Another principle of statutory construction \u201cleads us to relate the words in question to the associated words and phrases in the statutory context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, supra. </em>We must \u201cconstrue the various provisions of a statute in harmony with one another, recognizing that the Legislature did not intend internal contradiction.\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 491 (2009). In \u00a7 32J, the phrase \u201cor within one hundred feet of a public park or playground\u201d follows language applying the statute to \u201creal property comprising a public or private accredited preschool, accredited headstart facility, elementary, vocational, or secondary school.\u201d We have held previously that the word \u201caccredited\u201d applies only to private preschools and private headstart facilities, because public institutions had been covered by the statute since its 1989 enactment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 323, 325 (2008). Thus, while the term \u201caccredited\u201d modifies only \u201cprivate . . . preschool\u201d and \u201c[private] headstart facility,\u201d the words \u201cpublic or private\u201d modify every type of institution listed prior to the phrase at issue here (which tellingly includes the word \u201cpublic\u201d but omits the word \u201cprivate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>These considerations lead us to conclude that the general term \u201cplayground\u201d must be understood in conjunction with the more specific term \u201cpublic park.\u201d The modifier \u201cpublic\u201d is not separated by a comma from the word \u201cplayground,\u201d and the words \u201cpublic or private\u201d modify every entity listed in the first part of the statute. Accordingly, and as a matter of plain meaning, we interpret the word \u201cpublic\u201d to modify both \u201cpark\u201d and \u201cplayground,\u201d such that the statute applies only to public playgrounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">This conclusion is also supported by the fact that \u201cplayground,\u201d while not defined in c. 94C, is defined in the Federal school zone statute, the precursor and counterpart to \u00a7 32J, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">\u201cany outdoor facility (including any parking lot appurtenant thereto) intended for recreation, <em>open to the public, </em>and with any portion thereof containing three or more separate apparatus intended for the recreation of children including, but not limited to, sliding boards, swingsets, and teeterboards\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(e)(1) (2012). \u201cWhen a statute does not define its words we give them their usual and accepted meanings,\u201d deriving such meanings \u201cfrom sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). See G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. Moreover, while dictionary definitions of \u201cplayground\u201d do not contain a public/private distinction, this court recognizes \u201cthat <em>public </em>facilities had been included within the zone of protection [under \u00a7 32J] . . . from the time of the statute\u2019s adoption\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra. </em>Finally, \u201c[0]ur respect for the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment dictates that we interpret the statute to be sensible, rejecting unreasonable interpretations unless the clear meaning of the language requires such an interpretation,\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass, at 490-491, and it would be unreasonable to interpret \u00a7 32J to require an automatic minimum two-year sentence for selling drugs within one hundred feet of someone\u2019s backyard play area. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>449 Mass. 227, 233 (2007) (\u201c[A] court does not interpret a statute so as to produce an illogical result\u201d). Because \u00a7 32J applies only to \u201cpublic\u201d playgrounds, we answer the first reported question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">2. We turn briefly to the second reported question, whether the statutory category \u201cpublic . . . playground\u201d may include a play<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>ground located on private property. According to the Commonwealth, a privately owned playground such as the one in this case may nonetheless be sufficiently open to the public as a factual matter that it should be considered \u201cpublic\u201d under \u00a7 32J. While plausible, this construction does not flow inevitably from the plain language. The phrase may as reasonably be read to draw a simple, easily applied distinction between playgrounds owned by public and private parties. Either result is justifiable as a matter of policy, but it is up to the Legislature to pronounce its judgment clearly on the subject. Absent that, because we must resolve the ambiguity in the meaning of \u201cpublic . . . playground\u201d in the defendant\u2019s favor, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass, at 436-437, we conclude that privately owned playgrounds fall outside the scope of \u00a7 32J, and we therefore answer the second reported question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">3. In conclusion, we answer the first and second reported questions \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno,\u201d respectively. Furthermore, \u201c[tjreating the reported question [s] as raising the issue of the correctness of the judge\u2019s ruling! ] on the motion! ] to dismiss,\u201d we conclude the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been allowed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davie, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 29. We remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-10\">In their briefs, both parties state that the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss also applied to a second count under \u00a7 32J, one involving Vicodin on a different date. However, the motion included in the record appendix refers only to the marijuana-related count and the agreed statement of facts refers only to marijuana. We need not resolve the disparity. For discussion purposes we refer only to the marijuana-related charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The crimes alleged in this case predate St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 30, 31, which amended the quoted language of \u00a7 32J in ways not relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
