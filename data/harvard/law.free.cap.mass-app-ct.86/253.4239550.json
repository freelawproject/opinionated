See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 21A, 17; G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B. This is his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">During deliberations, the jurors sent the judge a question which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>read: \u201cIt has come to the group\u2019s attention that one juror fell asleep during the presentation of evidence and is not willing to accept others\u2019 recollection of what was missed. Is this grounds to have the juror dismissed?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Although the prosecutor sought a voir dire, the judge declined to conduct one. He reasoned, \u201c[I]f I were to voir dire this issue the only way to voir dire it would be to ask questions that get into the deliberative process.\u201d The judge did say that he had \u201clooked at the jury numerous times.\u201d And, apparently assuming he knew which juror the question referred to, he said, \u201cEvery time I looked over ... he never had his eyes shut for a significant period of time. And every time I looked at him it seemed that he was alert [and] paying attention .... I made a decision every time I looked over that he didn\u2019t seem to me to be asleep. I gave it serious [consideration] numerous times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">A subsequent jury question read, \u201cWe have a juror (#1) who seems to be biased towards police in general. He laughs every time the word police even comes up and refuses to even contemplate a witness\u2019s testimony because he believes the police gave a deal. Is this grounds for an alternate juror to be used?\u201d The judge seems to have concluded that the juror referred to in the first question was the same juror referred to in the second question, although there is no basis in the record for a conclusion that both notes refer to the same juror. Nonetheless, the judge stated, \u201c[I]f you read between the lines here ... the reason for the disagreement isn\u2019t that somebody might be asleep but has a different [view] of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>The first jury question. </em>We turn first to the jury question about a sleeping juror. Our appellate courts have had a substantial amount to say about this in the past several years, and of course we recognize that the trial judge in this case did not have the benefit of this teaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u201c[A] judge\u2019s receipt of reliable information\u201d that a juror was asleep during evidence requires prompt judicial intervention, which typically includes a voir dire of one or more of the jurors. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beneche, </em>458 Mass. 61,78 (2010), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Dancy, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 181 (2009). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Braun, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 904, 905 (2009). The failure to conduct a voir dire in the face of a substantial reason to think a juror is sleeping during trial is reversible error when it prevents the judge from determining the extent of the sleeping and so from having the ability to exercise properly his or her discretion in handling the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s observations and his concerns about juror disagreement, none of his conclusions amounts to a finding that the juror was not asleep. In the face of a question from the jury, of which the juror in question was a member, reporting that a juror was in fact asleep during evidence \u2014 receipt of reliable information that a juror was asleep \u2014 the judge ought under <em>Braun </em>to have conducted a voir dire. \u201cBy not conducting a voir dire, the judge prevented himself from obtaining the information necessary to a proper exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Braun, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Indeed, part of the reason a voir dire is necessary in circumstances such as these is that \u201c[ujncertainty that a juror is asleep is not the equivalent of a finding that the juror is awake.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge\u2019s concerns about juror deliberations were appropriate, but, subsequent to the trial in this case, we have explained how to conduct a \u201csensitive\u201d voir dire of the jurors about sleeping during trial without getting into questions about deliberations. As we explained in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. at 181, \u201cthe inquiry must,\u201d of course, \u201cstay clear of the juror\u2019s personal recollections of the substance of the evidence he saw or observed. Inquiry into that area would inevitably reveal aspects of the juror\u2019s thought processes, thus entering an area where judicial exploration is prohibited. Instead, the inquiry should focus on how much of the evidence the juror has heard and witnessed and any impediments he or she may have to hearing and seeing the rest.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The Commonwealth puts forward an independent argument that reversal is unwarranted because there was no objection from the defendant to the failure to voir dire the jury. In <em>Dancy, </em>we indicated that a sleeping juror was \u201ca structural error . . . that so infringes on a defendant\u2019s right to the basic components of a fair trial that it can never be considered harmless.\u201d 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 182, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 906 (1999). And in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyous, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 512-514 (2011), we reversed in a case where the defendant did not object to the trial judge taking no action in the face of a report of a possibly sleeping juror, and neither party sought voir dire in the trial court. Although structural rights may be waived \u2014 even the right to a trial may be waived through a guilty plea colloquy \u2014 <em>Dyous </em>stands for the proposition that, in the face of a judge\u2019s receipt of reliable information a juror was asleep, failure to request a voir dire is not sufficient to waive the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>protections that insure \u201cthe defendant\u2019s and the public\u2019s right\u201d to a conscious jury. <em>Id. </em>at 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Further, even if an objection were otherwise required, in the circumstances of this case we would not insist upon it. The prosecutor asked for a voir dire, and the defendant did not oppose the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. The judge ruled that he would not conduct a voir dire because he concluded that he could not do so without improperly invading the jury\u2019s deliberative process. In light of that reasoning, a further objection by the defendant would have been futile. At least in these circumstances \u2014 where the judge had an opportunity to consider the question, the defendant did not oppose the voir dire, and the judge explained that he did not believe he could properly conduct a voir dire \u2014 it would elevate form over substance to require the defendant to interpose a futile objection in order to preserve his rights. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 357 n.9 &amp; 358-359 (2010) (surveying futility jurisprudence and holding that \u201cbecause an objection to the admission of a drug certificate would have been futile, the rationale for denying the defendant a more favorable standard of review is not applicable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u201cBecause there was no voir dire hearing and there were no findings establishing that the juror had been attentive and was capable of rendering a verdict based on all of the evidence, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt as to the juror\u2019s attentiveness and is therefore entitled to a new trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyous, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. at 514.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">2. <em>Other issues, </em>a. Our conclusion obviates the need to address most of the defendant\u2019s other claims. We must, however, address the alleged insufficiency of the evidence to prove intent permanently to deprive the victim of his car at the time of the assault. The evidence included the following: The victim\u2019s car was a \u201cfully loaded\u201d 1995 beige Acura Integra, described by the victim as a \u201chigh profile\u201d car with custom paint, rims, and exhaust. Prior to the alleged carjacking, the defendant, a passenger in a red vehicle driven by Steve Kenney, a friend of the victim in this case, left the red car, approached the victim outside a convenience store, and asked details about the car. When the victim drove away from the convenience store, Kenney, at the defendant\u2019s instigation, followed him. And, immediately before the carjacking, when the Acura stopped in front of the house of a friend of the victim, the red car pulled up alongside it and Kenney asked the victim details about the vehicle, if it was for sale, and how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>much it was worth. Given these questions showing interest in the car, the evidence with respect to intent permanently to deprive the victim of his car was sufficient under the familiar <em>Latimore </em>standard to support the defendant\u2019s conviction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">b. As to the judge\u2019s allowing eighteen or nineteen prior convictions to be introduced for impeachment should the defendant choose to testify, which the defendant asserts was an abuse of discretion, we trust that should there be a retrial the judge will be attentive to insure that convictions allowed for impeachment purposes will not present a risk that the jury will conclude that the defendant is of a criminal character, warranting punishment because of that character rather than because of the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">c. Finally, we must address an appeal from denial of a motion by the defendant seeking relief on the basis of undue delay in the appeal. The longest delay, from 2007 to 2010, which was apparently related to the ordering and production of transcripts, does not appear to have been the result of any intentional act. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>368 Mass. 268, 279-280 (1975) (\u201c[D]e-liberate blocking of appellate rights or inordinate and prejudicial delay without a defendant\u2019s consent, may rise to the level of constitutional error\u201d). The defendant focuses his challenge on a stay of appeal obtained by the Commonwealth in 2013 to allow it to expand the record to include a document that was before the judge during sentencing and that was necessary to allow this court to understand the judge\u2019s ruling with respect to the use of prior convictions for impeachment. As to this delay, we cannot conclude, absent a showing that the procedure undertaken by the Commonwealth was designed deliberately to interpose a delay in the appeal, that, as the defendant suggests, the Commonwealth was required to explain the relevance of the document to the defendant and to seek a stipulation to its inclusion in the record, rather than going through the formal procedure for expansion of the record. Consequently, the denial of the motion is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\n<em>Order denying motion to vacate convictions due to appellate delay affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
