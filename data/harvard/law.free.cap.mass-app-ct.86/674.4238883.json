There, she complained of various symptoms, and the defendant, Hilarie Cranmer, M.D., examined, treated, and discharged her. After she returned home, Washington suffered a stroke overnight, which caused permanent neurological damage.

Washington reported that for the past twenty-four hours she had been experiencing body weakness, left arm weakness, difficulty keeping her balance, increased blood sugars, dizziness, and blurry vision. A triage nurse conducted the initial patient intake, and recorded Washington\u2019s blood pressure at 234/153. Intake records also show that Washington had a \u201cgait disturbance\u201d that made her a \u201cfall risk,\u201d that she was \u201cslow to respond\u201d to questions, and that she had some difficulty with finding words (described in a later record as \u201cmild dysarthria\u201d). In addition, despite her relative youth, Washington already had a rich medical history that included diabetes, chronic hypertension, high cholesterol, and \u2014 in 2004 \u2014 a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Dr. Cranmer apparently first saw Washington at 10:10 a.m. After conducting physical and neurological examinations, Dr. Cranmer concluded that Washington was alert, ambulatory, and oriented to person, place, and time; that her neurological exam was \u201cnormal\u201d apart from her being hypertensive; and that she had a \u201cregular\u201d heart rate and rhythm and \u201c[n]o obvious. . . motor or sensory deficits.\u201d Washington also exhibited no chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, or fever. Washington confirmed that she had not taken her blood pressure medication that morning (March 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">In response, Dr. Cranmer directed the assisting nurses to give Washington two medications (labetalol and hydrochlorothiazide) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>to lower her blood pressure. At 10:45 a.m., Washington received the prescribed medication orally. Dr. Cranmer also ordered a computer tomography (CT) scan of Washington\u2019s head and various \u201clab work,\u201d and placed Washington on a cardiac monitor and electrocardiogram (EKG) monitor. Two hours later, at 12:45 p.m., Washington\u2019s blood pressure had fallen to 126/73.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The radiology report from the CT scan did not reveal any intracranial hemorrhage or other acute abnormalities.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Except for Washington\u2019s elevated blood sugar (258), her laboratory results were found to be within normal limits. At 1:07 p.m., Dr. Cranmer ordered \u201cMRI/A\u201d (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging/angiography) scans in order to evaluate Washington for a \u201cHead Stroke.\u201d In addition, Dr. Cranmer admitted Washington to the emergency department observation section (OBS) and ordered that she be monitored for a transient ischemic attack (TIA)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and for continued blood pressure control. Dr. Cranmer instructed that Washington\u2019s OBS admission was subject to the \u201ctransient neurologie\u201d protocol, and she identified aspirin, MRI/A scans, and \u201cconsultation\u201d on an as-needed basis as the appropriate interventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">By the early afternoon, Dr. Cranmer had made plain that her plan of continued treatment and care for Washington was contingent on the results of the MRI/A scans that she had ordered. Specifically, Dr. Cranmer intended to discharge Washington after her dinner meal, unless there were \u201cnew CVA [cerebral vascular accident] findings on the MRI/A\u201d scans. Dr. Cranmer noted that there was \u201cno need for urgent neuro unless MRI/A is as above [i.e., new CVA findings].\u201d The nurses continued to monitor Washington while she rested in the OBS, and they administered aspirin to her at 1:45 p.m. Meanwhile, Washington\u2019s blood pressure had begun to rise again. By 2:00 p.m., it had risen to 153/101, and at 2:45 p.m., it was at 165/107.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">At approximately 3:30 p.m., in advance of the scheduled MRI/A scans, the nursing staff administered medication to Washington in an effort to treat her anxiety regarding the proposed procedure. Ultimately, Washington\u2019s claustrophobia prevented her from going through with the MRI/A scans. After the failed MRI/A attempt, Washington was returned to the OBS. The same \u201cE[mer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>gency] Department] progress note\u201d that stated that Washington was \u201cunable to do the MRI\u201d also noted that Washington reported that \u201cher speech still isn\u2019t baseline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">By 4:00 p.m., Washington\u2019s blood pressure had risen to 174/106, and it remained at that elevated level (174/105) at 6:00 p.m. when she was discharged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Before she was discharged, Washington received another dose of blood pressure medication orally, and Dr. Cranmer issued instructions to \u201cTAKE YOUR MEDS\u201d and to \u201cRETURN FOR ANY WORSENING ANYTHING.\u201d Dr. Cranmer also directed Washington to follow up with a neurologist and her primary care physician within two weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">At home that night and the following morning (March 23), Washington\u2019s condition declined. She returned to the BWH emergency department by ambulance at 9:45 a.m. on March 23, presenting with left-sided facial droop as well as left-sided weakness. Her \u201cmild dysarthria\u201d from the day before had \u201cworsened,\u201d and her speech was now \u201cslurred.\u201d In addition, her blood pressure had risen to 218/139 and she was hyperglycemic. Washington was given labetalol to lower her blood pressure and insulin to lower her blood sugar. A new CT scan did not evidence signs of a stroke. However, follow-up tests, including MRI/A scans, revealed that Washington had suffered one.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">On April 2, 2008, Washington was discharged from BWH and transferred to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (SRH). Eventually, she was discharged from SRH. Washington now is confined to a wheelchair and, although she can feed herself, \u201c[s]he needs assistance for all other activities of daily living.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">b. <em>Expert opinion. </em>Before the tribunal, Washington submitted her medical records and an expert opinion letter that had been prepared by Kenneth C. Fischer, M.D., a board-certified neurologist. Among his other conclusions, Dr. Fischer opined that Washington had sustained a \u201cstroke and resultant severe and permanent neurological injury as the direct result of the substandard care and treatment\u201d rendered by Dr. Cranmer on March 22, 2008. According to Dr. Fischer, the average qualified emergency medicine physician would (a) \u201crecognize and appreciate\u201d the complaints and medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>history presented here as signs and symptoms of a \u201chypertensive emergency\u201d and TIA; (b) \u201cadminister intravenous antihyperten-sive agents\u201d to the patient in order to lower her blood pressure; and (c) order an \u201cimmediate neurology consultation\u201d and admit the patient to the neurology intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring and treatment. Dr. Fischer further opined that if Dr. Cranmer had acted in conformance with this course of treatment, then Washington would have received blood thinner medication \u201cat the new onset of symptoms and, more likely than not, she would not suffer from the severe and permanent neurological injury with which she lives today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>As the record amply reveals, when Washington arrived at the BWH emergency department on March 22, she presented with multiple causes for serious concern. In sum, a patient who already had experienced a stroke at age thirty-three \u2014 and who had chronic hypertension and poorly controlled diabetes \u2014 was experiencing severely high blood pressure, difficulty walking and finding words, and paresthesia. However, the record also reveals that Dr. Cranmer\u2019s initial course of action in responding to Washington\u2019s symptoms and medical history generally conformed to the standard of care set forth in Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinion letter. Far from ignoring the serious concerns that Washington\u2019s case presented, Dr. Cranmer understood that Washington was in a hypertensive crisis that presented attendant risks for a TIA or stroke. This is well demonstrated by the initial actions she took: conducting a neurological examination, prescribing blood pressure medication, ordering laboratory work and a CT scan of Washington\u2019s head, and scheduling MRI/A scans to evaluate her for a stroke.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, Dr. Cranmer\u2019s own appellate brief highlights that the actions she pursued were done in an effort to address the TLA and stroke risks that Washington presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>By midday, the medication that Dr. Cranmer ordered had reduced Washington\u2019s blood pressure to normal limits, and the testing that was done did not reveal any significant abnormalities. However, Dr. Cranmer herself recognized the inconclusiveness of these promising indicators and was awaiting the results of the MRI/A scans.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Her contemporaneous notes indicate that she considered the MRI/A scans critical, stating that the patient could be discharged based on the MRI/A findings and that no urgent neurological care was needed unless the MRI/A results were abnormal.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Once Washington\u2019s claustrophobia prevented her from going forward with the MRI/A scans, this in turn prevented Dr. Cranmer from having the benefit of the MRI/A results that she considered critical. Nevertheless, Dr. Cranmer went ahead and discharged Washington even though her blood pressure had risen significantly since its midday low, and at midaftemoon, Washington reported that she continued to have difficulty speaking. In our view, there is a sufficient dispute over whether Dr. Cranmer did enough prior to Washington\u2019s discharge to preclude the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>from being dismissed at the initial tribunal stage.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">To be sure, Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinion letter does not grapple directly with Washington\u2019s inability to go forward with the MRI, and that omission diminishes the letter\u2019s force. However, it does state that \u201cimaging studies\u201d should be conducted in order to rule out stroke. Although one imaging study was performed (the initial CT scan), Dr. Cranmer discharged Washington without ever having received the additional benefit of another imaging study (the MRI/A) that she herself deemed important in order to rule out a stroke. Thus, Dr. Cranmer\u2019s own course of action provides support for Dr. Fischer\u2019s assertions that she diverged from the applicable standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Moreover, Washington\u2019s offer of proof is based on the overarching theory that BWH discharged a high-risk patient in the throes of a \u201chypertensive emergency\u201d before that emergency was adequately resolved, and there was record support that the crisis had not been resolved.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As noted, Dr. Fischer specifically opined, inter alla, that Dr. Cranmer should have admitted Washington to the neurology intensive care unit for \u201cclose monitoring and treatment,\u201d and that had this been done, the administration of blood thinner medication likely would have prevented Washington\u2019s injuries. In contrast, Dr. Cranmer discharged Washington after giving her more blood pressure medications, and telling her to come back if she presented new symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We emphasize that the details of what transpired between the failed MRI/A attempt and Washington\u2019s discharge are not well developed in the current record. In the end, the evidence at trial may show that Dr. Cranmer acted entirely reasonably under the difficult circumstances presented and that she fully complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the applicable standard of care.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, that is not something that can be resolved on the current record without straying into the inappropriate role of weighing the evidence. See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Cooper-Ciccarelli, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. at 91. We conclude that Washington has satisfied her initial burden of \u201crais[ing] a legitimate question of liability appropriate for judicial inquiry.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The claims were based on negligence and related theories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 60B, the medical malpractice tribunal statute, applies broadly to \u201call treatment-related claims\u201d involving a \u201cprovider of health care.\u201d <em>Vasa </em>v. <em>Compass Med., P.C., </em>456 Mass. 175, 177 (2010), quoting from <em>Little </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>376 Mass. 573, 576 (1978).

For example, Dr. Cranmer administered blood pressure medication orally instead of intravenously, and there is no evidence that she consulted with a neurologist. Given the grounds on which we rest, we need not decide whether Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinion letter adequately explained how any such differences mattered. Additionally, we note that neither party has addressed the potential inconsistency between Dr. Cranmer\u2019s conclusion that Washington\u2019s neurological examination was normal, and near contemporaneous observations made by the triage nurse that Washington had both a \u201cgait disturbance\u201d and difficulty finding words. We do not rest on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In his opinion letter, Dr. Fischer stated that \u201c[a] hypertensive emergency is a severe and persistent elevation in the blood pressure with acute impairment of an organ system (end-organ dysfunction) including, but not limited to, arm and leg weakness, paresthesia, gait disturbance, blurry vision, and difficulty with word finding.\u201d Based on that statement, the dissent posits that Washington could not have presented with \u201chypertensive emergency\u201d because \u201c[t]he laboratory work, imaging studies, and [EKG] results here furnished no indication of acute end-organ damage.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 683. Thus, according to the dissent, \u201cDr. Fischer\u2019s opinion (and by extension the plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim) rests on an ill-based factual assumption, namely, the presence of a hypertensive emergency, which, in the end, is not supported by anything in the record.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 684. This conclusion rests on a misreading of what Dr. Fischer actually said. He characterized a hypertensive emergency principally by a set of symptoms, all of which were present on Washington\u2019s arrival at the emergency department. He did not state, or even imply, that a patient who exhibits those very symptoms cannot present with a hypertensive emergency absent independent proof of \u201cend-organ dysfunction\u201d through laboratory tests and the like. The dissent reads Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinion with a gloss that, at a minimum, is unduly demanding at the tribunal stage. In addition, it passes over the fact that Dr. Cranmer herself recognized that the testing results were inconclusive and that MRI/A scans should be done. Further, it bears noting that the additional CT scan done after the stroke was itself negative (unlike the MRIs), thus corroborating Dr. Cranmer\u2019s own views regarding the limited diagnostic role that CT imaging plays in this context. Especially given our duty to read the record in the light most favorable to Washington, we disagree with the dissent\u2019s conclusion that, as a matter of law, no reasonable jury could have concluded that she presented a \u201chypertensive emergency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Dr. Cranmer highlights that one hospital record characterized Washington\u2019s discharge from BWH on March 22, 2008, as her having \u201cleft against medical advice.\u201d However, that statement was not contemporaneous, but instead appears in a much later BWH report that followed Washington\u2019s stroke. If a patient who faced an obvious stroke risk was in fact discharged against the medical advice of the attending physician, a reasonable juror might expect to see that point noted in a hospital record that accompanied her discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">In one BWH record, Dr. Cranmer suggested that she was comfortable discharging her patient because Washington had become \u201casymptomatic.\u201d However, that statement manifestly was not true at the time that Washington was discharged given the elevation in her blood pressure over the course of the afternoon. A different BWH record more accurately states that Washington \u201cwas discharged after getting <em>some </em>symptomatic relief\u2019 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">We do not mean to suggest that this case necessarily should proceed to trial.

Driven by the critical shortcomings of the plaintiff\u2019s case, which I conclude fall woefully short of the standard demanded by G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 60B, I respectfully dissent. The vital question here, as to which the parties sharply disagree, is whether the plaintiff\u2019s proof permits an inference that the defendant did not, in fact,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conform to good medical practice. See <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Lea, </em>403 Mass. 430, 433 (1988); <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Silva, 36 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 16, 20 (1994). As is true in most instances, this inquiry can be answered only with the aid of expert opinion. <em>Kapp </em>v. <em>Ballantine, </em>380 Mass. 186, 190 &amp; n.4 (1980). The expert\u2019s opinion, however, must be rooted in the record evidence and not be based on speculation, conjecture, or assumptions not supported by the evidence. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Lea, supra </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">When comparing Dr. Kenneth C. Fischer\u2019s expert opinion as to what would have been good medical practice against the record evidence memorializing the <em>actual </em>treatment rendered by the defendant, Dr. Hilarie Cranmer, a remarkable convergence emerges between the expert opinion and the treatment provided to the plaintiff on March 22,2008, in the emergency department at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital (BWH). Promptly, upon interviewing and examining the plaintiff, Dr. Cranmer recognized and appreciated the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms and history as involving a hypertensive crisis and transient ischemic attack (TIA), as is demonstrated by her orders to administer antihypertensive agents to lower the plaintiff\u2019s blood pressure; perform a computer tomography (CT) scan of the plaintiff\u2019s head; conduct laboratory work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of the plaintiff\u2019s blood and fluids; and schedule magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/A) scans to evaluate the plaintiff for a head stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As of 12:45 p.m., while under the care of Dr. Cranmer and assisting medical personnel, the plaintiff\u2019s blood pressure had stabilized within normal limits. Neither the laboratory tests nor CT scan revealed or suggested an acute end-organ dysfunction. Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinion and ultimate conclusion \u2014 i.e., that Dr. Cranmer failed to conform to good medical practice \u2014 hinges entirely upon the presence of acute end-organ dysfunction or ongoing damage. On this record, there is no evidence at all to permit an inference that the plaintiff suffered, on March 22 at the BWH emergency department, from acute end-organ damage or dysfunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">It is undisputed that Dr. Cranmer assigned the plaintiff to the emergency department observation section (OBS) for monitoring of a possible TLA and continued blood pressure control. Dr. Cranmer also scheduled MRI/A scans for the latter part of the afternoon. It is also undisputed that, due to the plaintiff\u2019s unwillingness to undergo the MRI/A scans, Dr. Cranmer did not have the benefit of this essential medical diagnostic resource.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Dr. Fischer explicitly defined a \u201chypertensive emergency\u201d as \u201ca severe and persistent elevation in the blood pressure with acute impairment of an organ system (end-organ dysfunction).\u201d \u201c[A]rm and leg weakness, paresthesia, gait disturbance, blurry vision, and difficulty with word finding\u201d may suggest dysfunction, but do not demonstrate the presence of actual acute impairment of an end-organ system. The laboratory work, imaging studies, and electrocardiogram (EKG) results here furnished no indication of acute end-organ damage. Under no view of the evidence was it demonstrated that the plaintiff, while treated at the BWH emergency department on March 22, presented a \u201chypertensive emergency\u201d as that medical term was defined by Dr. Fischer. Rather, it cannot be reasonably disputed that on March 22, the plaintiff presented a nonemergent hypertensive condition, for which Dr. Cranmer pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>scribed, and the plaintiff received, oral antihypertensive medication, and gradually, over a two-hour period, the plaintiff\u2019s blood pressure was lowered to the normal range. Dr. Cranmer then arranged for the plaintiff to be monitored in the OBS for a TIA and blood pressure control. Dr. Cranmer also requested MRI/A scans to evaluate the plaintiff for a stroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The plaintiff refused to undergo the MRI/A scans, and thus we can only speculate what the MRI/A scans would have revealed. Moreover, the next day\u2019s MRI/A scan results shed no light on what they might have revealed the day before.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">In short, up to the time of the plaintiff\u2019s discharge on March 22, there were no \u201cindicators\u201d that should have impelled Dr. Cranmer to act other than she did,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>LaFond </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 233, 234 (1997); rather, Dr. Fischer\u2019s opinion (and by extension the plaintiff\u2019s malpractice claim) rests on an ill-based factual assumption, namely, the presence of a hypertensive emergency, which, in the end, is not supported by anything in the record. Given this material shortcoming in the proof, combined with the undeniable fact that the plaintiff was unwilling to have the MRI/A scans on March 22, the plaintiff\u2019s proof is legally insufficient to permit an inference in her favor. An inference must be based on \u201cprobabilities\u201d not possibilities. <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 627 (1976).
