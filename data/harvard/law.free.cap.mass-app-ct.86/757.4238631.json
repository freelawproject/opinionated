Mendonca had sought review pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44, of a decision by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>the Civil Service Commission (commission) upholding his layoff by the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD). Mendonca alleged that the layoff violated his rights as a disabled veteran. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><em>Background. </em>Mendonca is a disabled Vietnam War veteran. He holds a bachelor of science degree in business management from Suffolk University and a master\u2019s degree in business administration from the University of Massachusetts. Mendonca\u2019s extensive work history includes management, training, and marketing in the human resources field. He has negotiated and managed labor agreements to ensure labor law compliance; he has established and implemented human resources systems for various companies; he has recruited and trained staff; and he has secured competitive State abandoned property audit contracts for private companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">On May 3,1999, the Commonwealth hired Mendonca as a provisional Administrator III. A Management Questionnaire (MQ) describing Mendonca\u2019s position shows that Mendonca was responsible for administering the Commonwealth\u2019s federally funded Job Search/Job Readiness Program (JS/JR). Mendonca worked closely with several State agencies, including the Departments of Transitional Assistance (DTA), Unemployment Assistance (DUA), and Career Services (DCS), and ensured that JS/JR \u201c[wa]s operated according to Federal, State and contractual requirements.\u201d Mendonca\u2019s duties included negotiating and drafting interdepartmental service agreements; specifically, he \u201c[r]ec-ommend[ed] amounts and conditions for reimbursement, scope of services, program requirements, key performance objectives, budget provisions and staffing configurations to ensure contractual goals are achievable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">On March 29, 2007, the human resources division of EOLWD determined that the title Program Coordinator II more accurately reflected Mendonca\u2019s duties. However, Mendonca retained the title Administrator III. Mendonca was laid off on April 10, 2008, when his position was eliminated as a result of budget cuts. Four other Administrator III positions existed at that time: Web services manager, deputy director of contracts and procurement (deputy director), Hurley Building superintendent (superintendent), and manager of the office of multilingual services. The individuals holding these positions included one veteran holding a permanent original appointment, and three nonveterans</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The MQ for each respective position lists its requirements. The Web services manager must hold a \u201cBachelor\u2019s degree in Fine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>Arts\u201d and have five to ten years\u2019 experience developing and managing Web sites. The superintendent position \u201crequires a high degree of technical knowledge in building systems including fire detection/alarm systems; HVAC<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> systems; plumbing and electrical systems; elevator systems; State and local building codes; and [Americans with Disabilities Act] requirements.\u201d The superintendent \u201cmust be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and must be prepared to immediately bring resources to bear to resolve emergency situations.\u201d For example, the superintendent must be able to resolve dangerous building conditions and malfunctioning heating or air conditioning systems. The manager of the office of multilingual services must be bilingual in English and Spanish, and the position \u201crequires mastery of several foreign languages\u201d and a \u201cLinguistics degree.\u201d Finally, the deputy director \u201cadvise[s] agency personnel on procurement matters associated with the Commonwealth\u2019s operations and policy to ensure ... compliance with all applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations.\u201d The deputy director position entails managing and training staff in matters \u201crelating to procuring goods and services; managing multi-year encumbrances of state and federal funds for Federal/ State programs, grants; Interdepartmental Service Agreements and miscellaneous Agreements; writing proposals ...; approving attorney fee requests; and contract review.\u201d The deputy director analyzes and recommends action on issues relating to procurement and contracts with private entities, \u201censuring compliance with state and federal laws and Executive Orders.\u201d The position requires \u201ca minimum of an Associate[\u2019]s Degree in Accounting and or Business Management,\u201d along with five years\u2019 experience in accounting, finance, and contract and procurement management.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">EOLWD determined that Mendonca could not be retained because he was not qualified for any of the other Administrator III positions. Mendonca appealed EOLWD\u2019s decision to the commission, which held a hearing on August 3, 2009. David E. Olsen, human resources director for EOLWD, testified that he was responsible for laying off Mendonca. He noted Mendonca\u2019s veteran status and stated that he understood G. L. c. 31 to require \u201c[t]hat veterans shall be retained in title until all other similarly situated offices are eliminated.\u201d Olsen therefore investigated the remaining Administrator III positions to determine whether Mendonca could be retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Olsen concluded that Mendonca could not be retained as an Administrator III because the remaining positions were \u201cvery different\u201d from Mendonca\u2019s job, and \u201cMendonca\u2019s skill and his personnel file, his resume, his background, had always been in either human resources, job placement type of work.\u201d Olsen did not consider Mendonca for any positions outside of the Administrator III title because the positions were \u201cnot similarly situated\u201d; they either had different job classifications or dealt with the public instead of staff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Olsen testified that, in evaluating Men-donca\u2019s case, he \u201cwas operating within the scope of [his] interpretation of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Dana Johnson testified for Mendonca. Johnson is a rehabilitation counselor. She evaluates individuals to determine \u201cif somebody\u2019s under employed or if somebody actually is employable or what it would take to make somebody employable.\u201d She often provides expert testimony in insurance and divorce cases. Johnson testified that transferable skills are those \u201cthat you can take from one job and bring them to another.\u201d Nontransferable skills are those limited to a particular position or field. In Johnson\u2019s opinion, Mendonca\u2019s position as JS/JR coordinator required transferable skills including: evaluating a government program and determining what training or further resources the employees may need to improve performance; budgeting; handling State reimbursements; coordinating services with other government agencies; and assessing vendor contracts to ensure that the Commonwealth\u2019s money is well spent. Mendonca was required in his position to read, analyze, and follow through on contracts, which Johnson also considers to be transferable skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">On December 15, 2011, the hearing officer issued a written decision which contained thirty-three findings of facts. Of particular relevance to our discussion is the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-7\">\u201c30. In regard to the position of Deputy Director of Contracts and Procurement, [Mendonca] has no experience in contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>procurement activities and the laws regarding trade and procurement regulations. He has not reviewed procurement contracts, granted agreements or approved fee requests from attorneys representing [DUA] Unemployment Insurance clients. [Mendonca] does not possess knowledge of [EOLWD]\u2019s Affirmative Market Program or of the laws and regulations on trade such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u2018NAFTA\u2019) and the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. Furthermore, [Mendonca] does not possess knowledge, skills or abilities relating to the MARS system (the state\u2019s accounting system), financial systems, or GAP (general accounting principles) policies and procedures specific to the comptroller\u2019s office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The hearing officer concluded, based on her findings, that (1) Mendonca is not entitled to relief under the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A, because his position is \u201cclassified\u201d; (2) as a matter of law, Mendonca is not entitled under the Disabled Veterans\u2019 Act, G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, to an absolute preference in employment; (3) Mendonca is not entitled to relief under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 39, because he was a \u201cprovisional\u201d employee; and (4) EOLWD\u2019s decision that Mendonca was not qualified for any of the other Administrator III positions was supported by substantial evidence. Mendonca sought Superior Court review pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 44. On October 11, 2013, the Superior Court judge upheld the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standards of review. </em>The commission was required \u201cto determine, on the basis of the evidence before it, whether [EOLWD] sustained its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there was reasonable justification for the action taken by [EOLWD].\u201d <em>Brackett </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>447 Mass. 233, 241 (2006). \u201cReasonable justification in this context means \u2018done upon adequate reasons sufficiently supported by credible evidence, when weighed by an unprejudiced mind, guided by common sense and by correct rules of law.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Selectmen of Wakefield </em>v. <em>Judge of First Dist. Ct. of E. Middlesex, </em>262 Mass. 477,482 (1928). The judge was required to uphold the commission\u2019s decision if supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\u201c[W]e review the commission\u2019s decision to determine if it violates any of the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>cases construing those standards.\u201d <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>426 Mass. 1, 5 (1997). While we are \u201cbound to accept the findings of fact of the commission\u2019s hearing officer, if supported by substantial evidence,\u201d <em>Leominster </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 726, 728 (2003), \u201cwe are required to overturn commission decisions that are inconsistent with governing law.\u201d <em>Plymouth, supra. </em>We review conclusions of law de nova, <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>446 Mass. 611, 615 (2006), and ask \u201cwhether, on the basis of the transcript of evidence before the [hearing officer] and the [hearing officer]\u2019s findings and conclusions, the commission substantially erred in a way that materially affected the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>408 Mass. 292, 297 (1990). Mendonca bears the burden of proving the invalidity of the commission\u2019s decision. See <em>Brackett, supra </em>at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">2. <em>Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act. </em>The hearing officer concluded that Men-donca was not entitled to additional rights under the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act, G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A, because Administrator III is a classified position. Under that statute, veterans holding positions not classified under the civil service laws may not be laid off except in accordance with G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45. G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A, as amended by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 8. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45, require that a layoff be for \u201cjust cause,\u201d and that the employee have notice, a hearing, and review of the decision. If layoff of a veteran holding an unclassified job \u201cresults from lack of work or lack of money,\u201d the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act provides that such veteran \u201cshall not be separated . . . while similar offices or positions in the same group or grade ... exist unless all such offices or positions are held by such veterans.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The Administrator III position is classified under the civil service laws, see G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 45(1), and the Veterans\u2019 Tenure Act applies, by its terms, to veterans holding positions that are not classified. See <em>Aquino </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 541 (1993) (applying the \u201cwell-known maxim\u201d that \u201cexpression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d). Because Mendonca\u2019s position was \u201cexpressly exempted by the language of [G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 9A,]\u201d there was no error in the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion. <em>Barkin </em>v. <em>Milk Control Commn., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 517, 520 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Indeed, as a \u201cprovisional\u201d employee, Mendonca could not achieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>tenure<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and could be terminated at any time. See G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 14; <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Commerce &amp; Dev., </em>351 Mass. 462, 465 (1966); <em>Dallas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 768, <em>111 </em>(1974); <em>Fall River </em>v. <em>AFSCME Council 93, Local 3177, AFL-CIO, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 404,408 n.4 (2004). EOLWD did not need to show just cause for its action, <em>Rafferty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 718, <em>123 </em>(1985), and Mendonca was not entitled to a hearing because he was not \u201cdischarged as a result of allegations relative to his personal character or work performance.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">3. <em>Disabled Veterans\u2019 Act. </em>Under the Disabled Veterans\u2019 Act, \u201c[a]n appointing authority shall appoint a veteran in making a provisional appointment under section twelve,\u201d and \u201c[a] disabled veteran shall be retained in employment in preference to all other persons, including veterans.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 26, represents \u201ca legislatively created mechanism under which veterans receive a preference over non-veterans in certain types of civil service employment.\u201d <em>Aquino, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 539. Because the statute requires that \u201cdisabled veterans be[ ] kept on the payroll in preference to others,\u201d <em>Provencal </em>v. <em>Police Dept, of Worcester, </em>423 Mass. 626, 630 (1996), \u201call employees having the same title in a particular departmental unit who are not disabled veterans must be laid off first according to seniority, followed by such employees who are disabled veterans according to seniority.\u201d 1980 Op. Atty. Gen., Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12 at 98 (July 21, 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Here, EOLWD laid off Mendonca while retaining three Administrator Ills who are not veterans, and one Administrator III who is not a disabled veteran. The hearing officer concluded that EOLWD\u2019s actions did not violate G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, because \u201csubstantial evidence established that [Mendonca] could not show that there were any other Administrator III positions for which he was qualified within EOLWD into which he could have been transferred.\u201d Massachusetts courts have recognized a \u201cbasic requirement that the veteran being preferred be otherwise qualified to perform the duties of the office or position to which he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>appointed.\u201d <em>Hutcheson </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv., </em>361 Mass. 480, 497-498 (1972) (Quirico, 1, dissenting), and cases cited. Men-donca offered his resume and Johnson\u2019s testimony to demonstrate his qualification for two of the remaining Administrator III positions \u2014 Hurley Building superintendent and deputy director of contracts and procurement. The hearing officer relied on Olsen\u2019s testimony, the documentary evidence, and Johnson\u2019s testimony regarding transferable skills in concluding that Mendonca was not qualified for any other Administrator III positions. While the record supports the hearing officer\u2019s findings concerning the Hurley Building superintendent position, we cannot agree that it provides substantial evidence that Mendonca was unqualified for the deputy director position.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">\u201c \u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). While Olsen testified that Mendonca\u2019s job \u201cwas very different\u201d from those performed by the other Administrator Ills, the title Administrator III is \u201capplied to a position or to a group of positions having similar duties and the same general level of responsibility.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11 (defining \u201cTitle\u201d). To avoid this reality, Olsen testified that Mendonca\u2019s duties more closely resembled those of a program manager, which is a \u201cline oriented\u201d position. Olsen then stated that he did not consider Mendonca for a program manager position because they were \u201cline oriented\u201d as opposed to \u201cstaff oriented\u201d and therefore not \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to Mendonca\u2019s Administrator III position. Thus, according to Olsen\u2019s testimony, Mendonca was not qualified for the Administrator III positions because those are \u201cstaff oriented\u201d and Mendonca was a \u201cline manager,\u201d and Olsen did not need to consider Mendonca for a \u201cline oriented\u201d program manager position because Administrator III is \u201cstaff oriented\u201d and G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 26, only requires Olsen to investigate \u201csimilarly situated offices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In hiring Mendonca as a provisional employee, EOLWD was required to substantiate that Mendonca \u201cmeets the proposed requirements for appointment to the position [of Administrator III] and possesses the knowledge, skills and abilities necessary to perform such duties.\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 13, amended by St. 1985, c. 257, \u00a7 4. \u201cA provisional appointment . . . shall be terminated\u201d whenever it is determined \u201cthat the person appointed does not, in fact, possess the approved qualifications or satisfy the approved requirements for the position,\u201d G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 14, inserted by St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>1978, c. 393, \u00a7 11; however, Mendonca\u2019s provisional employment was not terminated when he was reclassified as a \u201cline oriented\u201d Program Coordinator II. Olsen\u2019s stated justification for not retaining Mendonca either in his titled Administrator III position or in the Program Coordinator II position was that an individual rarely possesses the skills to work in both \u201cstaff oriented\u201d and \u201cline oriented\u201d positions. Olsen also testified that Mendonca\u2019s experience was in human resources (a \u201cstaff oriented\u201d field), and that his duties as JS/JR coordinator more closely resembled those of a \u201cline manager.\u201d We do not think that \u201cunder the substantial evidence test,\u201d Olsen\u2019s inconsistent testimony and circular logic could \u201creasonably form the basis of impartial, reasoned judgment.\u201d <em>Cobble </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept, of Social Servs., </em>430 Mass. 385, 393 n.8 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The deputy director position requires an associate\u2019s degree in business administration. Mendonca has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business management and a master\u2019s degree in business administration. While the hearing officer found that Mendonca \u201cdoes not possess knowledge, skills or abilities relating to the\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s accounting system, financial systems, and general accounting policies and procedures specific to the comptroller\u2019s office, Mendonca\u2019s MQ shows that he was responsible for \u201creconciling statewide claimed earnings, invoicing, determining and accounting for specific Career Center earnings,\u201d and working closely with other EOLWD departments \u201cfor successful program outcomes and adherence to approved budgets.\u201d Moreover, Johnson testified that Mendonca\u2019s experience \u201cworking with the state reimbursement,\u201d \u201cdo[ing] some of the budgeting work and working] within the system\u201d were transferable skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The hearing officer found that Mendonca \u201chas no experience in contract procurement activities and the laws regarding trade and procurement regulations\u201d despite crediting Johnson\u2019s testimony that Mendonca\u2019s transferable skills include \u201cbeing able to analyze contracts, being able to work with vendors,... being able to work with other state agencies, [and] being able to read and analyze the requirements for submitting . . . requests.\u201d Mendonca\u2019s position as JS/JR coordinator involved reading, analyzing, and following through on contracts while following State procedures. Men-donca\u2019s experience in labor relations undoubtedly involved reading, analyzing, and applying Federal laws and regulations, and his resume demonstrates that he has experience with cash management and audits in relation to compensation and benefits. As an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Administrator III, Mendonca \u201creconcile^] performance earnings for the JS/JR program,\u201d \u201c[r]ecommend[ed] amounts and conditions for reimbursement,\u201d and \u201c[m]onitor[ed] the preparation of documents to validate DCS compensation, resolve discrepancies and prepare invoice to DTA to secure program funding.\u201d Thus, contrary to the hearing officer\u2019s finding, Mendonca does \u201cpossess knowledge, skills or abilities\u201d relating to financial systems and general accounting policies and procedures specific to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">While \u201cthe substantial evidence test accords an appropriate degree of judicial deference to administrative decisions,\u201d reversal by a reviewing court is required \u201cif the cumulative weight of the evidence tends substantially toward opposite inferences.\u201d <em>Cobble, supra </em>at 391. The evidence in this case demonstrates that Men-donca is a disabled veteran, that he is qualified for the Administrator III position, and that EOLWD laid him off while retaining four Administrator Ills who are not disabled veterans. General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 26, mandates a preference for disabled veterans in continuing the employer-employee relationship, <em>Provencal, </em>423 Mass, at 628, and applies with respect to other employees in the same title. <em>Andrews, </em>446 Mass, at 616-617. \u201cPreference to veterans must be a reality[;] [i]t cannot be made illusory or a mere gesture\u201d by performing only the most cursory consideration of a veteran\u2019s qualifications for similarly situated positions. <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>324 Mass. 736,744 (1949). Olsen\u2019s stated reasons for not retaining Mendonca cannot be considered \u201csufficiently supported by credible evidence\u201d to overcome the preference which the statute provides, <em>Selectmen of Wakefield, </em>262 Mass, at 482; nor does his testimony provide substantial evidence in support of the hearing officer\u2019s findings. The judge\u2019s decision upholding the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions is not \u201clegally tenable\u201d in light of the statutory preference for disabled veterans, <em>School Comm, of Brockton </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 486, 490 (1997), quoting from <em>Gloucester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv.

Mendonca was an Administrator III; however, Olsen testified that Mendonca\u2019s duties more closely resembled those of a \u201cProgram Manager.\u201d Olsen stated that he did not consider Mendonca for any Program Manager positions because \u201c[t]hose jobs were line oriented as opposed to staff oriented,\u201d and it would be very unlikely that a \u201cstaff oriented\u201d manager would \u201ccross over\u201d to become \u201cline oriented\u201d because it is rare that \u201c[a]n individual could possess both skills.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\u201cA tenured employee in the civil service system is one who initially occupied a position by original appointment pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 6, and has completed the probationary period, or one who has received a \u2018promotional appointment\u2019 on a permanent basis as provided in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 8.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>446 Mass, at 613.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The defendants argue that Mendonca has waived his right to be reinstated as an Administrator III because the JS/JR program has been eliminated and he only sought reinstatement to his \u201cold job\u201d in Superior Court. However, Mendonca also sought from the Superior Court \u201ca Decision ... finding that the lay off from his position was not justified.\u201d Because Mendonca is entitled to the veterans\u2019 preference, which applies to those holding the same title, <em>Andrews, supra, </em>he has not waived his right to be reinstated as an Administrator III.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
