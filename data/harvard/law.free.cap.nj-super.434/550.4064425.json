As a consequence of a juvenile adjudication requiring registration pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2, he is required to register as a sex offender, and he complied with that obligation. His offense involved a victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>under the age of eighteen. The grand jurors for Ocean County charged defendant with a crime of the third degree \u2014 participating in a \u201cyouth serving organization\u201d despite being \u201can excluded sex offender,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-23a, specifically that he held a position in \u201c[X] High School Marching Band \u2018Pit Crew.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The Pit Crew is a committee of a larger association organized for \u201ccharitable and educational purposes.\u201d By its constitution, the association\u2019s purpose is promoting interest in the school\u2019s band programs. Its members pay annual dues fixed by its board of directors, and its membership \u201cconsists of parents and/or [sic] guardians, and interested persons of members of the ... band programs.\u201d J.B.W. is a friend of a parent of a member of the band.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The association\u2019s constitution provides for it to work \u201cin cooperation with the Board of Education, the administration, the faculty, the band director, unit advisors and students\u201d of the high school. By its constitution, the association\u2019s board of directors includes the \u201cband director and assistant band director\u201d and the \u201cfaculty band advisor(s).\u201d The association\u2019s bylaws describe the Pit Crew\u2019s duties as working with the band\u2019s director, assistant band director and staff \u201cto acquire, assemble, store and transport\u201d band equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The question presented in the trial court and on this appeal, is whether the term \u201cyouth serving organization,\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-22, excludes organizations that work in cooperation with a public school and its staff to promote a school program. The trial court concluded that this group was not excluded and, for that reason, denied the motion to dismiss the indictment. This court, however, must consider the interpretation of a statute de novo and without affording any deference to the trial court. <em>State v. Buckley, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>249, 260-61, 78 A.3d 958 (2013); <em>In re Liquidation of Integrity Ins. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J. </em>86, 94, 935 A.2d 1184 (2007). We also conclude that the statute applies to such organizations, and we set forth our reasons in the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>A court\u2019s primary goal in interpreting a statute is determining the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hosp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 418, 780 A.2d 327 (1999). That inquiry begins with the language of the statute, which generally controls when the meaning is clear. <em>Ibid. </em>When the statutory language is susceptible of different meanings, courts \u201cseek to effectuate the fundamental purpose for which the legislation was enacted\u201d and may look to legislative history to identify the intended goals. <em>Klumb v. Bd. of Educ. of Manalapan-Englishtown Reg\u2019l High Sch. Dist. </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>14, 24-25, 970 A.2d 354 (2009) (internal quotations omitted); <em>Daidone v. Buterick Bulkheading, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>557, 565-66, 924 A.2d 1193 (2007). Where a criminal statute defining a crime is at issue, language \u201csusceptible of differing constructions,\u201d must be interpreted \u201cto further\u201d the \u201cgeneral purposes\u201d stated in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:l-2a and the \u201cspecial purposes\u201d of the provision at issue. <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:l-2a, c. Most important here is the Code\u2019s purpose of giving \u201cfair warning of the nature of the conduct proscribed,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:l-2a(4). Fair notice of prohibited conduct is the fundamental principle underlying the rule of construction calling for resolution of ambiguities in criminal statutes against the State. <em>State v. Gelman, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 950 A.2d 879 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The crime at issue here is defined in two sections of the Code, one setting forth the elements and the other defining the critical terms, respectively <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-23 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-22. The prohibited conduct is defined in plain and unambiguous language. In pertinent part, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:7-23 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">a. Except as otherwise provided in subsection e. of this section, [which is not implicated in this ease,] it shall be unlawful for an excluded sex offender to hold a position or otherwise participate, in a paid or unpaid capacity, in a youth serving organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">b. A person who violates subsection a. of this section is guilty of a crime of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">There is no question that the language set forth above warns a person who is \u201can excluded sex offender\u201d that he or she commits a crime of the third degree by holding any position or in any way participating in \u201ca youth serving organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The definition of the term \u201cexcluded sex offender\u201d is equally plain and unambiguous. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-22 provides: \u201c \u2018Excluded sex offender\u2019 means a person who has been convicted, adjudicated delinquent or found not guilty by reason of insanity for the commission of a sex offense, as defined in subsection b. of section 2 of P.L. 1994, c. 133 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2], which involves a victim under 18 years of age.\u201d As previously noted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-2 is the statute that identifies the crimes that require a person convicted to register as a sex offender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The question here is whether the association to which defendant belongs falls within the statutory definition of the term \u201cyouth serving organization.\u201d That term is defined to \u201cmean[ ] a sports team, league, athletic association or any other corporation, association or organization, <em>excluding public and nonpublic schools, </em>which provides recreational, educational, cultural, social, charitable or other activities or services to persons under 18 years of age.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-22 (emphasis added). Defendant argues that the language excluding \u201cpublic and nonpublic schools\u201d excludes his organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The plain meaning of the statutory definition does not permit the reading of the statute defendant urges, which is that the language emphasized excludes his association as a school. But the definition reaches all organizations except schools, and the Pit Crew is a committee of an association that is distinct from the school. Granted, the association and its Pit Crew are affiliated with the high school in the sense that its members work with school employees, but that does not make the committee a school. Pit Crew members hold positions and participate in the association, not the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">If the Legislature intended to exclude from the reach of this crime associations that have connections with or assist a school similar to the arrangement enjoyed by this association, then it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>could have done that. For example, the Legislature could have stated that it was excluding public and nonpublic schools and organizations participating with or assisting public or nonpublic schools. But the Legislature did not so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">To the extent defendant attempts to bring himself within the exclusion on the ground that the band program is a school program, the definition does not permit that interpretation either. It plainly covers organizations that provide \u201cactivities <em>or </em>services to persons under 18 years of age.\u201d Thus, while the association, through its Pit Crew, does not provide the band activity, it does provide \u201cservices to persons under 18 years of age\u201d who are members of the band. In fact, in the brief submitted on defendant\u2019s behalf, the responsibilities of the Pit Crew are described as \u201chelping \u2018the band members [by] loading their equipment and unloading their equipment at football games or band[ ] competitions.\u2019 \u201d (quoting the grand jury transcript with alterations).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We have no question that the statutory definition provides fair warning to any \u201cexcluded sex offender\u201d who participates in this association. Defendant, who as a member of the Pit Crew committee, was responsible for helping band members by transporting the band\u2019s equipment to events, falls within its plain terms. He provided a service for members of the high school band through participation in the Pit Crew committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Even if we were to conclude that the exclusion of schools is sufficiently ambiguous to warrant reliance on legislative history, the legislative history does not east doubt on the statute\u2019s plain meaning. The legislative statements on which defendant relies simply state: \u201cThe bill does not apply to employees and volunteers of public and nonpublic schools, as criminal background checks and employment restrictions of these persons are governed under separate law. <em>(N.J.S. </em>18A:6-4.13 et seq., <em>N.J.S. </em>18A:6-7.1 et seq.).\u201d <em>Introduction to S. 532 </em>at 3; <em>accord Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee Statement to S. 532 </em>at 1; <em>Senate Law and Public Safety Committee Statement and Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Statement to S. 532 </em>at 1 (Feb. 14, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Like the statutory language, the statements refer to persons who are \u201cvolunteers of public and nonpublic schools.\u201d Neither the statements nor the statute suggests an exemption for persons who volunteer to help in a school activity by virtue of a position they hold in an organization that is not in fact a school.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In contrast, an individual who volunteered to provide the same service informally \u2014 for example through the band director, the principal, or school board rather than as a member of an organization \u2014 is in a different position than defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Defendant argues that if he is not considered a volunteer for the school, then the school would be prohibited from requiring volunteers of his association and others like it to undergo a background check. Even if that is so, it is beside the point. This is a policy argument better addressed by the Legislature than a court. <em>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>578, 619, 74 A.3d 893 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">True, our courts will construe a statute to avoid an absurd result even when it appears to be dictated by a literal interpretation of the statutory language. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 1:1-1; <em>Hubbard ex rel. Hubbard v. Reed, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>387, 392-93, 774 A.2d 495 (2001). But there is nothing patently absurd about the Legislature\u2019s obvious intention. The intention is to rely on schools and the laws governing their hiring and acceptance of volunteers to exclude those who are unfit and to rely on the deterrent impact of criminal sanctions to exclude those who provide services for minors as holders of positions in an organization that is not a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-8\"> <em>N.J.S.A. 20.1-2 </em>has been amended by <em>L. </em>2013, <em>c. </em>214. The amendment has no relevance here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\"> It is not clear why the Legislature excluded volunteers for public and nonpublic schools from this law adopted in 2009. <em>L. </em>2009, <em>c. </em>139. When this law was enacted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-4.13 to -4.17 addressed background checks for employees of nonpublic schools, and N.J.S.A. 18A:6-7.1 to -7.2, simply permitted background checks for volunteers at facilities under the supervision of the Department of Education or a board of education caring for or involved in the education of children under the age of 18. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-7.1 as amended by <em>L. </em>2007, c. 82, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>2010, c. 122, \u00a7 3; <em>L. </em>2011, <em>c. </em>72, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">The State has presented an alternative argument based on statutes related to education, which we do not find persuasive and have no reason to address.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
