In affirming, we conclude the mother failed to exercise the minimum degree of care required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Appellant E.D.-O. (Eleanor, a fictitious name) acknowledges that late in the morning of May 6, 2009, she: parked her car approximately 150 feet from the front door of a Dollar Tree store in South Plainfield; left her sleeping nineteen-month-old child belted into her car seat in the vehicle; and kept the engine running and the doors locked with windows opened approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>one inch while she entered the store. Five to ten minutes later, Eleanor exited the store to find, by her car, police officers called by a mall security guard, who had observed the unattended child. Eleanor was arrested, charged with child endangerment and released on her own recognizance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Division of Youth and Family Services, now known as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (the Division), immediately investigated and a Division representative spoke with Eleanor the same afternoon. Eleanor was tearful and remorseful; she was described by her husband as a \u201cgood and caring mother.\u201d All their children,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as the Division then learned, were appropriately dressed, current on their immunizations, and covered by health insurance. Two of the older three children<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> said their mother, who was not employed outside the home, had never left them alone. The home was well cared for and free of safety hazards. Consequently, the Division\u2019s concern was essentially limited to the incident in question, which was substantiated, thereby requiring Eleanor\u2019s inclusion in the child abuse registry pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>9:6-8.11. A family safety plan was implemented.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Two weeks later, the Division filed a Title Nine action, seeking care and custody of all four children. On September 3, 2009, the Division agreed the family was in no further need of intervention, and the action was consensually dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Eleanor filed an unsuccessful administrative appeal and now appeals the Director\u2019s final agency decision, arguing she was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and claiming the Director\u2019s determination was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>We find no error in the Director\u2019s rejection of Eleanor\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. Although controversies based on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b) have generally been referred to as \u201cquite fact sensitive,\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. S.N.W., </em>428 <em>N. J.Super. </em>247, 253, 52 A.3d 200 (App.Div.2012), the material facts we described at the outset were not disputed, and the Director properly applied the procedure outlined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>l:l-12.5(b), which tracks <em>Rule </em>4:46-2(c)\u2019s method for summarily resolving factually undisputed civil actions. <em>See E.S. v. Div. of Med. Assistance Health Servs., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 350, 990 A.2d 701 (App. Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">This appeal presents only a legal question: whether the material facts support a finding of abuse or neglect. That question is governed by <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4), which states that an \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d means a child under the age of eighteen years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">whose physical, mental, or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired as the result of the failure of his parent or guardian ... to exercise a minimum degree of care ... (b) in providing the child with proper supervision or guardianship, by unreasonably inflicting or allowing to be inflicted harm, or substantial risk thereof!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The Legislature provided no further clarity as to the reach of the phrase \u201cminimum degree of care,\u201d but our Supreme Court ascertained it means \u201cgrossly or wantonly negligent, but not necessarily intentional\u201d conduct. <em>G.S. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 178, 723 A.2d 612 (1999). In that sense, a parent fails to exercise a minimum degree of care when \u201caware of the dangers inherent in a situation,\u201d the parent \u201cfails adequately to supervise the child or recklessly creates a risk of serious injury to that child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 181, 723 A.2d 612. The parent is held to what \u201can ordinary reasonable person would understand\u201d in considering whether a situation \u201cposes dangerous risks\u201d and whether the parent acted \u201cwithout regard for the potentially serious consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 723 A.2d 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">More recently, the Court reaffirmed that its \u201c \u2018cautionary act\u2019 language ... is informed by\u201d <em>G.S.\u2019s </em>\u201cgrossly negligent or reckless standard,\u201d but further explained that \u201cevery failure to perform a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>cautionary act is not abuse or neglect\u201d; that is, \u201c[w]hen the failure to perform a cautionary act is merely negligent, it does not trigger\u201d the statute. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. T.B., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>294, 306-07, 24 A.3d 290 (2011); <em>see also S.N.W., supra, </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 254, 52 A.3d 200. The focus on the parent\u2019s level of culpability in assessing whether a minimum degree of care has been exercised</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">is in synchronieity with the Legislature\u2019s expressed purpose to safeguard children. Indeed, where a parent or guardian acts in a grossly negligent or reckless manner, that deviation from the standard of care may support an inference that the child is subject to future danger. To the contrary, where a parent is merely negligent there is no warrant to infer that the child will be at future risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\"><em>[T.B., supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 307, 24 A3d 290.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">This standard is best appreciated by specific examples contained in our case law, as the <em>T.B. </em>Court instructed in expressly referring to two of our prior <em>decisions </em>\u2014 N.J. <em>Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.R., </em>419 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 17 A.3d 850 (App.Div.2011) and <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. J.L., </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>159, 980 A.2d 488 (App.Div.2009). The facts in <em>T.B. </em>further illustrate the statute\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">In <em>A.R., </em>we found a parent to have been grossly negligent when he placed a ten-month-old child on a twin bed without rails next to a radiator and then closed the door behind him, concluding that \u201c \u2018an ordinary reasonable person\u2019 would understand the perilous situation in which the child was placed.\u201d 419 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 545-46, 17 A.3d 850. A different outcome was warranted in <em>J.L., </em>where the mother of three- and five-year-old sons permitted them to \u201creturn home alone\u201d while she remained in a nearby outdoor play area, because she had trained the boys to leave ajar the door, which was equipped with a child-proof cover, if they entered the home without her; on the occasion in question, the door accidently closed behind the boys, thereby locking them in and prompting one of the boys to call 9-1-1. 410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 161-62, 980 A.2d 488. Although the mother was \u201carguably inattentive or even negligent,\u201d we held the facts did not meet the statutory standard. <em>Id. </em>at 168, 980 A.2d 488. And, in <em>T.B., </em>the Court found the statutory standard was not violated when a mother, who resided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>with her four-year-old child in a separate apartment but in the same structure as her parents, assumed her parents were home and mistakenly left the sleeping child home alone. 207 <em>N.J. </em>at 296-97, 24 A.3d 290. The Court held that \u201c[the mother\u2019s] failure to perform the cautionary act of calling upstairs to assure [the grand]mother\u2019s presence was clearly negligent^,] [but] [u]nder all of the circumstances known to her[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] ..., it did not rise to the level of gross negligence or recklessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310, 24 A.3d 290. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">These eases illustrate what <em>T.B. </em>referred to as a \u201ccontinuum between actions that are grossly negligent and those that are merely negligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 24 A.3d 290. In applying that framework, we consider the analogous yet somewhat different circumstance of leaving a child alone in a motor vehicle \u2014 analogous because the circumstance involves a young child being left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>alone but different because the child was not only left alone in public but in a motor vehicle, a circumstance that compounded the risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Such events are apparently not as uncommon as might be hoped; the parties have cited no less than six fairly recent unreported decisions of this court dealing with young children left unattended in motor vehicles. Although there may be instances in which such an act may be fairly labeled \u201cmerely negligent,\u201d we need not describe at any length the parade of horribles that could have attended Eleanor\u2019s neglect in concluding, as did the Director, that the act of leaving a child alone in a motor vehicle with its engine running, to enter premises 150 feet away, is a reckless act enveloped by the standard contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6 \u2014 8.21(c)(4)(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>As we have observed, the standard we must apply is whether \u201can ordinary reasonable person,\u201d <em>G.S., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 723 A.2d 612, would recognize the peril. We have no hesitation in answering that question in the affirmative. A parent invites substantial peril when leaving a child of such tender years alone in a motor vehicle that is out of the parent\u2019s sight, no matter how briefly. Eleanor recognized the danger when she felt it necessary to lock the vehicle\u2019s doors and lower both front windows by an inch.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In fact, she repeated in her appellate brief what she stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>to the Division caseworker at the time: \u201cshe now knew that what she did was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In drawing this conclusion, we do not mean to suggest there are no circumstances in which a child might be left unattended in a motor vehicle without running afoul of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b). For example, Eleanor greatly relies on an unreported decision involving a mother, whose husband was out of town and unavailable, leaving a sick and sleeping two-year-old in a locked and warm vehicle for approximately ten minutes to enter a store to purchase medicine for the child. In that case, we found the circumstances militated against finding the mother grossly negligent. Even were we to assume such conduct would fall short of the statutory requirements \u2014 a question we need not decide\u2014 the child here was not sick, Eleanor was only purchasing items for a party, and other adults were available to watch the child at home while Eleanor ran her errand. There being an absence of any extenuating circumstances, we conclude the Director reasonably found Eleanor\u2019s conduct was grossly negligent. <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\"> The record does not disclose the results of the criminal charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\"> The child in question was the youngest of four, the others were born in 1999, 2002 and 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-10\"> One child was too bashful to speak to the Division representative.

The actual consequences did not in those cases, however, govern the result because the statute does not require that a court \u201cwait to act until a child is actually irreparably impaired by parental inattention or neglect.\u2019\u2019 <em>In re Guardianship of D.M.H., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>365, 383, 736 A.2d 1261 (1999); <em>see also N.J.

V.T., </em>423 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 330, 32 A.3d 578 (App.Div.2011). Indeed, the abuse/neglect finding often arises because of a legitimate and reasonable inference\u2014 stemming from the act or omission in question \u2014 that \"the child is subject to <em>future </em>danger.\u201d <em>T.B., supra, </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>at 307, 24 A.3d 290 (emphasis added). We need look no further than the statute itself to conclude that abuse or neglect has occurred when a child\u2019s \u201cphysical, mental, or emotional condition ... is in imminent danger <em>of becoming impaired </em>as the result of the failure of his parent or guardian ... to exercise a minimum degree of care.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b186-6\"> Many states have criminalized the same conduct, although without any uniformity in approach. <em>See Cal.

And the risk is by no means alleviated when the vehicle's engine is turned off; on a hot day, the temperature inside a motor vehicle can quickly spike to dangerously high levels, just as it may rapidly and precipitously dip on a cold night. Not long ago a sister state\u2019s legislature made the following findings regarding unattended children in motor vehicles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">[Ljeaving a child unattended in a car can too often have tragic consequences, either because the child suffers from exposure to excessive heat, is injured when the car is stolen, or releases the emergency brake, inadvertently starts the car, or puts the car in gear. On average, thirty-six children per year across the country die in hot vehicles. About forty per cent of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>deaths occur when caregivers forget that children are in the car. About twenty per cent of children who die are intentionally left in vehicles by caregivers who do not know any better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">[W]ith an outside temperature of approximately eighty-five degrees, the inside air temperature in a car will reach one hundred-thirty degrees or more. Under those conditions, a small child, whose body temperature increases three to five times faster than an adult\u2019s, can succumb to the heat in as short a time as fifteen minutes. External temperatures as low as sixty-six degrees can be fatal. As a result, the five-minute trip to the bank that ends up taking a half-hour can be deadly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-13\">[2008 <em>Haw. Sess. Laws, </em>c. 170, \u00a7 1.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b188-14\"> Eleanor strenuously argues the type of neighborhood \u2014 she claims the Middle-sex Mall in South Plainfield, where this incident occurred, is \"upscale\" \u2014 is highly relevant in ascertaining the degree of her negligence. In assuming only for present purposes the accuracy of Eleanor's description of the Middlesex Mall, we disagree with the point she urges. Although it may be fair to conclude that leaving a child unattended in a high crime area would constitute a risky undertaking, the risk is not substantially reduced when the conduct occurs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>less crime-ridden locales. Even tie most upscale of neighborhoods and shopping centers are troubled by crime. Moreover, as we have endeavored to explain, the risk to the child is not limited to exposure to criminality; the health risks of leaving a young child in an unattended motor vehicle no doubt produce more deaths or greater injuries than those caused by criminals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
