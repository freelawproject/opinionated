Because it has not been shown that plaintiff will likely be able to enter Canada due to his criminal conviction for an assault on defendant, and because the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement (PSA), which was executed a few months earlier, clearly and unambiguously stipulated that New Jersey would continue to be the exclusive jurisdiction for parenting-time disputes, we conclude that the judge misapplied <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">In May 2011, defendant G.M.P. (Glenda) filed a domestic violence action and, on June 14, 2012, obtained a final restraining order (FRO) against her husband of ten years, plaintiff S.B. (Stephen).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stephen pleaded guilty to a third-degree offense with regard to the event that gave rise to the FRO. On July 13, 2012, Stephen began a three-year probationary term.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">On May 3, 2012, the marriage was dissolved by way of a dual judgment of divorce, which incorporated the parties\u2019 PSA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>parties have four children, and the PSA stipulated that Glenda could remove the minor children from New Jersey to Brighton, Ontario, Canada. Stephen\u2019s consent to removal was conditioned on Glenda\u2019s \u201cexpressed] and irrevoeabl[e] consent[]\u201d that, until their youngest child was emancipated, New Jersey would \u201cretain continuing exclusive jurisdiction over all matters and proceedings pertaining to child custody, child support, and parenting time.\u201d She also agreed: that any orders regarding custody, support or parenting time entered by our courts would \u201csupersede any such orders entered in Canada and shall have and be given full force and effect in Canada\u201d; that by entering into the PSA, she \u201cexpressly and irrevocably assent[ed] and submitted]\u201d to personal jurisdiction in our courts; that she \u201cirrevocably consent[ed]\u201d to receiving service of any pleadings at her residence in Canada; and that she \u201cexpressly and irrevocably waive[d] any claim or defense of improper service, lack of personal jurisdiction, improper venue or forum non conveniens or any similar basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Glenda moved with the children to Canada, on August 2, 2012. On or about September 13, 2012, slightly more than one month later and a mere four months after the PSA\u2019s execution, Stephen moved in the trial court, asserting that Glenda had failed to provide him with parenting time over the Labor Day weekend. In considering the motion, and notwithstanding the parties\u2019 stipulation in their PSA that the trial court would retain jurisdiction over custody and visitation issues, the motion judge advised the parties that, in the judge\u2019s words, he would \u201csua sponte [consider] whether Ontario was a more appropriate forum under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71 as interpreted\u201d by <em>Griffith v. Tressel, </em>394 <em>N. J.Super. </em>128, 925 A.2d 702 (App.Div.2007). For reasons expressed in a written opinion, the judge found New Jersey was \u201can inconvenient forum within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71 and that it is appropriate for Ontario to exercise jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In moving for enforcement of the PSA\u2019s parenting-time provisions, Stephen argued that the designation of Canada as the location for the exercise of some of Stephen\u2019s parenting time was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>no longer feasible because his criminal conviction barred his entry into Canada. This possibility was anticipated in the PSA, which stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">If, for any reason, the Husband is refused entry into Canada and prevented from exercising the parenting time set forth in subparagraphs (h) through (j) above,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] the parties shall agree on reasonable equivalent parenting time for the Husband at an agreed upon location in the United States. The parties reserve the right to apply to the [c]ourt for a determination of this issue in the event that they cannot reach an agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In light of this provision and his assertion he would not be able to cross the border into Canada, Stephen sought an order requiring that Glenda bring the children to Cortland, New York, approximately halfway between Glenda\u2019s residence in Canada and Stephen\u2019s in New Jersey for the Canadian parenting time referred to in the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Although she opposed the awarding of any relief \u2014 in fact, Glenda chiefly argued that parenting time should be suspended pending a psychological evaluation of Stephen \u2014 Glenda did not argue for a Canadian forum. Whether the forum should be changed was a matter unilaterally raised by the judge. After requesting additional submissions on that topic, the trial judge held, without conducting an evidentiary hearing, that a consideration of the factors outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71 compelled a declination of jurisdiction in favor of Canadian proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The November 28, 2012 order in question was stayed by the judge for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>forty-five days pending the filing of a suit in Canada. The judge also ruled on a number of ancillary monetary issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In considering the judge\u2019s declination of jurisdiction, the first question to be considered \u201cis whether this state acquired \u2018exclusive, continuing jurisdiction\u2019 over custody determinations involving th[e] family when the initial order was entered.\u201d <em>Griffith, supra, </em>394 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 139, 925 A.2d 702 (internal citations omitted). There is no question that that is so; the parties and children resided in New Jersey when the judgment defining the custody and parenting issues was entered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\"> The next question concerns \u201cwhether, during the time between the initial order and the filing of the motion for modification, circumstances have changed so as to divest this state of that jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 925 A.2d 702. Certainly, there have been changes; with Stephen\u2019s consent, the children have moved to Canada with their mother. But there is no question that New Jersey has not lost jurisdiction based on a lack of a \u201csignificant connection\u201d or \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-66(a)(1); <em>Griffith, supra, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 142-45, 925 A.2d 702. Because the move to Canada occurred only a few months after the PSA was executed, and because Stephen remains a New Jersey resident and is still entitled to meaningful parenting time with the children in New Jersey, there is no doubt New Jersey has not lost jurisdiction over parenting-time controversies. Indeed, as our Supreme Court has recognized, New Jersey \u201c \u2018will continue to have modification jurisdiction until it loses all or almost all connection with the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neger v. Neger, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>15, 30, 459 A.2d 628 (1983) (quoting <em>Kumar v. Superior Court, </em>32 <em>Cal.3d </em>689, 186 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>772, 652 P.2d 1003, 1009-10 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Here, the trial judge did not find a loss of jurisdiction. Instead, in relying on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71, the judge determined that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>these circumstances New Jersey should decline jurisdiction in favor of Canada. That determination requires a consideration of whether \u201c \u2018the court of another State[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] is in a better position to make the custody determination, taking into consideration the relative circumstances of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Griffith, supra, </em>394 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 148, 925 A.2d 702 (quoting UCCJEA \u00a7 207).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b) provides eight factors a court must consider in making such a determination. Before turning to the application of those factors here, however, we must recognize that what is being considered is whether the home state \u201cis an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and [whether] a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-71(a). In short, to decline jurisdiction, the trial judge was required not only to accurately determine that New Jersey constitutes \u201can inconvenient forum\u201d but also that Canada represents \u201ca more appropriate forum\u201d; the statute joins those two concepts with the word \u201cand,\u201d and so both elements must be found before the home state may decline jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We turn first to the latter question \u2014 whether Canada is a more appropriate forum \u2014 because that question is dispositive. The record does not permit a finding that Canada is \u201can appropriate forum,\u201d let alone \u201ca more appropriate forum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Stephen presented a certification that explained how he traveled to a border crossing in upstate New York and was denied entry because of his criminal record. The trial judge assumed this event actually occurred, but found that circumstance irrelevant because of the judge\u2019s belief that \u2014 even though Canadian law may, as a general matter, bar Stephen\u2019s entry due to his criminal record \u2014 Canadian immigration officials may make exceptions and grant a temporary visa of limited duration and scope. In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the judge rejected Stephen\u2019s contention that Canadian law \u201cabsolute[ly]\u201d bars his entry, and he found that Canadian law provides the discretion to permit entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Neither party has briefed Canadian law on this subject. The judge referred to one statutory provision and a related regulation in support of his belief that Stephen might be able to secure entry into Canada to appear in its courts for a limited purpose. Although a judge may take judicial notice of foreign law, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>201(a), we are not satisfied from the limited state of the record in this regard that obtaining of admission into Canada is as readily available as the judge suggests. Moreover, the judge\u2019s interpretation of the provisions he cited recognizes that, at the very least, Stephen would be relegated to an application process, and perhaps additional litigation, just to obtain the right to enter Canada. And, of course, because entry into Canada, if at all permitted, would undoubtedly rest in the discretion of Canadian officials, Stephen may very well' \u2014 at the conclusion of any such proceedings \u2014 ultimately be denied access. In short, as the trial judge recognized, until Stephen takes those steps \u201cit is premature at best to assume [he] would be denied entry\u201d for purposes of litigating his parenting-time dispute with Glenda. By the same token, it is premature to assume he will be permitted entry. The judge, however, also had an answer for this: \u201cEven if [Stephen] is ultimately denied entry to Canada he can still participate by video conferencing that will allow him to have full access to the courtroom.\u201d The judge cited no Canadian statute, rule or case law to support the conclusion that Stephen would be permitted to participate in a Canadian proceeding in this matter, let alone whether such a process would constitute an adequate substitute for his physical presence in the forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Moreover, Stephen\u2019s probation officer testified that someone in Stephen\u2019s position would normally be barred from leaving the United States, although he recognized a court could allow him to leave for a specific purpose such as appearing in a foreign court. The judge made no determination nor expressed any opinion on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the likelihood of Stephen obtaining such an order. In short, as matters presently stand, there is no guarantee that Stephen will either be permitted to leave New Jersey or enter Canada for the proceedings to which the trial judge relegated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As a result, we conclude that the record does not support a finding that Canada constitutes \u201can appropriate forum,\u201d let alone \u201ca more appropriate forum\u201d than New Jersey. Multiple obstacles stand in the way of Canada constituting an adequate forum for the resolution of the parties\u2019 disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The language of the applicable statute is couched in terms similar to those used to describe the doctrine of forum non conveniens, requiring that the current forum be \u201cinconvenient\u201d and the other forum \u201cappropriate.\u201d <em>Compare D\u2019Agostino v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Inc., 225 N.J.Super. </em>250, 259, 542 A.2d 44 (App.Div.1988), <em>affd, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>491, 559 A.2d 420 (1989) (describing \u201cthe essence of the doctrine\u201d of forum non conveniens as allowing a court to \u201cdecline jurisdiction whenever the ends of justice\u201d demonstrate the chosen forum \u201cwould be inappropriate\u201d) <em>with N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b) (requiring that \u201c[bjefore determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this State shall consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction\u201d). The adoption of language used by courts in describing the doctrine of forum non conveniens strongly suggests the Legislature sought our similar approach when applying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">The doctrine of forum non conveniens, to which we look for additional guidance, is \u201cequitable in nature,\u201d <em>Kurzke v. Nissan Motor Corp., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>159, 165, 752 A.2d 708 (2000), \u201ca manifestation of a \u2018civilized judicial system,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio R.R. Co. v. Kepner, </em>314 <em>U.S. </em>44, 55, 62 <em>S.Ct. </em>6, 11, 86 <em>L.Ed. </em>28, 34 (1941)). We find the trial judge\u2019s declination of jurisdiction to be highly inequitable because it relegates Stephen to an attempt to litigate his parenting-time issues in a forum that may not be accessible, instead of in a jurisdiction the parties expressly and unequivocally stipulated as the forum for such disputes \u2014 a forum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>that unquestionably possesses jurisdiction over the disputes. Because Canada has not been shown to be an \u201cappropriate\u201d forum, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Although not necessary to our disposition of this appeal, we also reject the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u2014 even if Canada was an appropriate forum \u2014 the eight factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b) support the declination of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The first factor requires consideration of \u201cwhether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best protect the parties and the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(l). The judge recognized that our courts granted Glenda an FRO and Stephen is serving a probationary term here that arises from his conviction for the same incident. The judge also found both New Jersey and Canada law provide a comprehensive array of services for domestic violence victims. The judge, however, seems to place this factor in favor of a Canadian forum simply because Glenda and the children now reside there. And the judge gave no weight to the fact that Glenda stipulated to a New Jersey forum <em>after </em>the FRO was entered, <em>after </em>defendant pleaded guilty to a criminal offense, and <em>after </em>Glenda formulated plans to move to Canada, or the fact that there has been no domestic violence since the FRO was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">The second factor requires consideration of \u201cthe length of time the child[ren] ha[ve] resided outside this State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-71(b)(2). New Jersey was home to Glenda and the children throughout the marriage; their four children, who were, at the time of the entry of the order in question, eleven, eight, seven, and four years old, were born and raised here until Glenda\u2019s move to Canada in August 2012, only one month prior to the filing of Stephen\u2019s motion. Although the judge seems to have concluded this factor favors a Canadian forum, he did so by mistakenly transforming this second factor into the sixth factor, which re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>quires consideration of \u201cthe nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including the testimony of the child[ren],\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(6), by stating: \u201cthe issues regarding parenting that have been raised by this motion and cross-motion relate to the current condition of the children and most of that evidence and the witnesses needed to present it are in Ontario.\u201d The judge\u2019s interpretation of the second factor was erroneous. The second factor relates only to the amount of time the children have lived outside New Jersey. The simple answer is approximately one month.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This factor highly favors New Jersey\u2019s retention of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The third factor requires consideration of \u201cthe distance between the court in this State and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(3). The judge found that the distance between Glenda\u2019s current home and Middlesex County is approximately 450 miles. In finding this factor weighed in favor of a Canadian forum, the judge focused on a New Jersey court\u2019s apparent inability to compel production of records or witnesses. Again, the judge erroneously transmogrified this factor into the sixth factor. Instead, the third factor requires recognition that a Canadian forum is more convenient for Glenda and a New Jersey forum is more convenient for Stephen.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The fourth factor requires consideration of \u201cthe relative financial circumstances of the parties.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(4). The judge found that the parties\u2019 most recent case information statements revealed that Stephen had an annual income slightly in excess of $100,000, and Glenda\u2019s annual income was less than $10,000. Even with the payment by Stephen to Glenda of $25,800 per year in alimony, there remained a significant gulf between the parties\u2019 incomes that does, as the judge held, favor a forum closer to Glenda\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The fifth factor requires consideration of \u201cany agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(5). There is no question the parties unambiguously agreed that New Jersey would remain the exclusive jurisdiction for the resolution of their disputes. Indeed, the PSA expresses that Stephen surrendered his statutory right to object to the removal of the children from the jurisdiction, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-2, in exchange for Glenda\u2019s agreement that New Jersey would remain the forum for all their parenting-time disputes until emancipation of the youngest child. The judge\u2019s statement that the parties\u2019 agreement is not binding suggests he gave it little weight.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge was greatly mistaken in this regard. The parties stipulated to the continuation of New Jersey as the forum for any disputes. Glenda received valuable consideration in obtaining Stephen\u2019s consent to her removal of the children from New Jersey; she gained certainty and the elimination of the possibility of Stephen\u2019s opposition to removal and the subsequent litigation\u2014 in New Jersey \u2014 that would have likely followed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The judge erred in giving this factor little or no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">As mentioned earlier, the sixth factor involves consideration of \u201cthe nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including the testimony of the child[ren].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(6). The judge spent a good deal of his opinion expressing a concern about Canadian evidence being inaccessible to a New Jersey court. What has been overlooked, however, is that the current dispute mainly concerns the pursuit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>an alternative to the PSA\u2019s declaration of Stephen\u2019s right to visitation at times in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Although Stephen is entitled to considerable visitation in New Jersey in the summer and at other times, subparagraphs (h) and (i) of the PSA\u2019s sixteenth paragraph provide Stephen with additional time with the children on Father\u2019s Day weekend, the weekend of Stephen\u2019s birthday, and the children\u2019s birthdays in Canada. And subparagraph (j) afforded Stephen the right to overnight parenting time with the children <em>in Canada </em>one weekend \u201cin each of the months during which he would otherwise would not see them.\u201d It appears that the simple question to be decided is how can the parenting time precluded by Stephen\u2019s ostensible inability to enter Canada be equitably replaced. Stephen has suggested that this parenting time occur in Cortland, New York, a town approximately halfway between the parties\u2019 residences. Logic suggests that the parties\u2019 intent, when they designated these specific parenting times would take place in Canada, would be better redressed by choosing a location in the United States far closer to Canada. In any event, it is not clear to us what Canadian \u201cevidence\u201d would be required to iron out this dispute; indeed, this type of dispute may not even require an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">And if we are mistaken, and there is evidence that requires consideration at a plenary hearing, consideration of this factor also requires an examination of the New Jersey evidence a Canadian court would require and the difficulties a Canadian court might encounter when the parties seek production of that evidence. In addition, the judge who ultimately considers the merits of the parties\u2019 dispute might be interested in hearing whatever Stephen\u2019s probation officer might have to contribute. As a result, consideration of the sixth factor requires an understanding of the difficulties a Canadian court might encounter in obtaining a New Jersey probation officer\u2019s testimony as opposed to its ready availability in New Jersey. Rather than constitute what seems to have been the overriding factor in the judge\u2019s decision to decline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>jurisdiction, this availability-of-evidence factor is at best neutral\u2014 both fora would likely encounter similar difficulties in obtaining evidence located in the other \u2014 but is likely more favorable to the retention of jurisdiction in New Jersey because the children spent their entire lives here until they moved to Canada approximately one month before the parenting-time issue arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The seventh factor requires consideration of \u201cthe ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(7). The trial judge observed the Canadian courts, like our own, recognize that custody and parenting-time issues are to be decided expeditiously. As a result, such a limited examination of this factor suggests it does not weigh in favor of either position. When viewed more deeply, however, there are \u2014 as we have observed \u2014 further obstacles to a Canadian adjudication of the parenting-time dispute. Stephen\u2019s attempts to enter Canada will likely be the subject of an application process and perhaps additional litigation if he is denied relief; there is no information in the record to suggest whether he possesses a likelihood of success or how long such a determination may take. On the other hand, we assume the matter could be resolved in our courts expeditiously because there is no impediment to Glenda and the children entering this country for purposes of such a hearing \u2014 assuming an evidentiary hearing is even necessary. Although the record is rather barren on the point, experience suggests that, subject to Glenda\u2019s convenience, the matter could be disposed of quickly in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The eighth and final factor requires consideration of \u201cthe familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues of the pending litigation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-71(b)(8). The record reveals that no Canadian court is familiar with this case. On the other hand, the trial judge presided over and made findings of fact in the domestic violence matter, and he later presided over the uncontested divorce proceedings; accordingly, our courts are quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>familiar with the parties and their past troubles, whereas the Canadian courts know nothing of these parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">As can be seen, the second, fifth and eighth factors all favor retention of jurisdiction here in New Jersey. Others, such as the first, third, sixth and seventh are arguably in equipoise, and only the fourth favors a Canadian forum. Accordingly, even if we were to ignore the fact that a Canadian forum is not an appropriate forum because it has not been shown that Stephen can enter Canada, a quantitative consideration of the statutory factors strongly tilt in favor of New Jersey\u2019s retention of jurisdiction. Even so, we recognize that simple arithmetic is not what the legislation expects of our courts. A more sophisticated approach requires a consideration \u2014 based on the parties\u2019 particular circumstances \u2014 as to the weight to be given to those in favor of and against a declination of jurisdiction. Clearly those factors that suggest the retention of jurisdiction \u2014 particularly the fifth factor (the existence of an agreement on the matter) \u2014 should be given greater weight than many of the others in this case. The parties, both then represented by counsel, executed a PSA \u2014 a mere four months before problems arose \u2014 that specifically stipulated to New Jersey\u2019s retention of jurisdiction. Those statutory factors that may suggest New Jersey\u2019s declination of jurisdiction or are in equipoise represent only the foreseeable consequences of the parties\u2019 free and voluntary agreement and should not have more weight than the agreement itself. When viewed in that context, there are very little, if any, arguable reasons for New Jersey\u2019s declination of jurisdiction at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the November 28, 2012 order insofar as it memorializes the judge\u2019s decision to decline jurisdiction. The parenting-time issues should be resolved in the trial court as expeditiously as possible. Because of the time that has elapsed since the order was entered, we exercise original jurisdiction to order that any future visitation pursuant to subparagraphs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(h) through (j) of paragraph 16 of the PSA occur in Niagara Falls, New York, or such other location on which the parties may mutually agree. Stephen may not transport the children more than thirty miles from that locale on those occasions without Glenda\u2019s approval or court order. These conditions shall remain in place until such time as the trial court has an opportunity to hear from the parties on the parenting time issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The first seven points of Stephen\u2019s appellate brief relate to the trial judge\u2019s jurisdictional ruling, which we have reversed. Stephen also argues that the judge\u2019s disposition of other issues was erroneous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">VIII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUEST TO SUSPEND ALIMONY AS SPECIFICALLY AGREED TO IN PARTIES!\u2019] [PSA] WITHOUT STAYING SAID ISSUE FOR FORTY-FIVE (45) DAYS AS WELL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">IX. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE DEFENDANT\u2019S REQUEST AS TO CLAIMING THE PARTIES\u2019 CHILDREN WITHOUT PROVIDING A REASONING FOR SAME OR STAYING SAID ISSUE FOR FORTY-FIVE (45) DAYS AS WELL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">X. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PARAGRAPH 29 [OF THE NOVEMBER 28, 2012 ORDER] BY ALTERING PARTIES\u2019 [PSA] AND ACCELERATING PLAINTIFF\u2019S PAYMENT DUE AND OWING FOR A JUDGMENT FROM 12 MONTHS TO 30 DAYS AND ISSUING A BENCH WARRANT WHILE FAILING TO PROVIDE ANY REASONS ON THE RECORD AS TO SAME.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">XI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PARAGRAPH 25 [OF THE NOVEMBER 28, 2012 ORDER] IN DENYING LEGAL FEES, NOT STAYING THE ISSUE, AND NOT PROVIDING A REASONING OR APPLICATION OF THE RULE 5:3-5(e) AS THE PLAINTIFF FILED IN GOOD FAITH TO ENFORCE PARENTING TIME, WHEREAS THE DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION SEEKS TO AMEND PARTIES\u2019 AGREEMENT AND SUSPEND ALL PARENTING TIME IN BAD FAITH.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">We find insufficient merit in Points VIII and IX to warrant discussion in a written opinion, <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E), adding only the following. With regard to Point VIII, the suspension of alimony authorized by paragraph 5 of the PSA expressly applies only when there is a \u201cwillful failure\u201d by Glenda \u201cto comply with the child custody and parenting time provisions.\u201d The confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>regarding parenting time around Labor Day of 2012 was a product of the problem Stephen has in entering Canada and other circumstances that do not remotely suggest Glenda\u2019s \u201cwillful failure\u201d to abide by the PSA\u2019s parenting-time provisions. Stephen\u2019s Point IX has no merit because the PSA precisely spells out how the parties will divide the tax exemptions in the future, and Stephen has alluded to nothing to suggest that the PSA ought to be modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">For the same reason that the parties\u2019 PSA should be applied and enforced absent some substantial change in circumstances, we agree with the argument in Stephen\u2019s Point X that the trial judge\u2019s acceleration of Stephen\u2019s reimbursement of counsel fees incurred by Glenda in the domestic violence matter was mistaken because that ruling was inconsistent with the terms of the PSA. Glenda failed to demonstrate any colorable reason for modifying that to which the parties had agreed a short time earlier \u2014 that Stephen had one year from the entry of the divorce judgment to pay her $3825 in counsel fees. We, thus, reverse paragraph 29 of the November 28, 2012 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">And, lastly, we vacate paragraph 25 of the November 28, 2012 order by which the trial judge denied either party an award of counsel fees in connection with the motions that led to the November 28, 2012 order. Whether or to what extent fees may be awarded to either party should abide the trial judge\u2019s disposition of the parenting-time dispute engendered by Stephen\u2019s inability to enter Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and vacated in part. The matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-13\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-53 to -95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\"> The names we have assigned to the parties are fictitious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-8\"> The PSA delineated Stephen\u2019s parenting time with the children in great detail.
