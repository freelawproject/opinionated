Plaintiff Katherine Feliciano cross-appeals, arguing that the trial judge should have calculated the fees at a higher hourly rate and enhanced the lodestar amount after it was established. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">We discern the following facts and procedural history from the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>On March 7, 2007, while driving in rainy weather, the motor vehicle owned by defendant Jenny Gonzalez and driven by Faldet-ta struck the vehicle driven by Feliciano. As a result of the accident, Feliciano alleged that she suffered permanent injuries to her neck and lower back, with permanent residuals including muscle damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Feliciano filed a personal injury action against Faldetta and Gonzalez in February 2009. Gonzalez was subsequently granted summary judgment, dismissing the claim against her on the basis that Faldetta was not her agent at the time of the accident. Faldetta moved for summary judgment in April 2010, arguing that Feliciano\u2019s alleged injuries failed to satisfy the verbal threshold established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a). The motion was denied in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In June, Feliciano served and filed an offer to take judgment in the amount of $15,000, as permitted by <em>Rule </em>4:58-1. Faldetta rejected the offer. Following a three-day trial in May 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Feliciano, determining that she had suffered permanent injuries and awarding her $50,000 in damages for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">On July 3, Feliciano filed a motion seeking attorney\u2019s fees, litigation expenses, and interest pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. In support of the motion, Feliciano filed certifications by the two attorneys who had worked on the case. They sought a total of $62,780 in legal fees. Faldetta filed a brief in opposition, arguing that the fees were unwarranted, excessive, and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">On September 18, the trial judge issued a written decision explaining his reasons for awarding $42,230 in counsel fees, $6,831.09 in litigation expenses, and $6,998.67 in interest. On the same day, the trial judge entered judgment against Faldetta for $109,185.27. This appeal and cross-appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">On appeal, Faldetta argues that (1) <em>Rule </em>4:58 is unconstitutional because it treats plaintiffs more favorably than defendants, (2) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>trial judge failed to consider that the award created undue hardship for Faldetta because the insurance policy covering the Gonzalez vehicle had a policy limit of $50,000, (3) the award was duplicative because Feliciano\u2019s attorneys were entitled to a contingent fee, and (4) the trial judge erred in determining the hourly rate and the hours spent on which the award was based. Feliciano argues in the cross-appeal that the judge should have (1) chosen higher hourly rates and (2) awarded an enhanced fee under the principles set forth in <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 340-42, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Because the issue of the constitutionality of <em>Rule </em>4:58 was not raised in the trial court, we decline to consider it on appeal. <em>Nieder v. Royal Indem Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973) (quoting <em>Reynolds Offset Co. v. Summer, </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542, 548, 156 A.2d 737 (App.Div.1959), <em>certif. denied, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>554, 158 A.2d 453 (1960)); <em>see also State v. Robinson, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>1, 20-22, 974 A.2d 1057 (2009). In addition, Faldetta failed to give notice to the Attorney General, as required by <em>Rule </em>2:5-l(h) if the constitutionality of a state \u201cenactment\u201d is challenged. <em>See R.M. v. Supreme Court, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>208, 213, 883 A.2d 369 (2005) (noting that the Supreme Court was represented by Attorney General in constitutional challenge to <em>Rule </em>1:20-9).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We take the same position with respect to the argument that the trial judge erred by failing to consider and apply the provision in <em>Rule </em>4:58-2(b) that \u201c[n]o allowances shall be granted pursuant to paragraph (a) if they would impose undue hardship.\u201d Although the issue of who would pay the fee award was mentioned during oral argument, there was nothing in the opposition to the motion, particularly certifications, concerning Faldetta\u2019s financial position. In addition, it is not clear whether Faldetta has a viable <em>Rova Farms</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>claim against the carrier who defended the action and declined the offer of judgment. If he does, the carrier would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>be required to pay the judgment, including the fees and expenses awarded under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. If it is determined that Faldetta has no such claim, he has the option of seeking relief from that portion of the judgment under <em>Rule </em>4:50, at which time he would be required to provide the financial information he failed to provide in opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We reject Faldetta\u2019s argument that the counsel fee award is duplicative because plaintiffs attorneys are also entitled to a contingent fee of one-third of the amount of the judgment. His argument assumes that plaintiffs counsel is entitled to both the contingent fee and the fees awarded under <em>Rule </em>4:58-2. That assumption is, in our opinion, inconsistent with the wording of the rule, which provides that \u201cthe claimant shall be allowed\u201d costs of suit, legal fees, and interest. To hold that the contingent fee must be deducted from the fee award under the rule would provide a windfall to Faldetta at the expense of Feliciano. Her attorneys are entitled to the fee awarded pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:58-2 for the work done after the offer of judgment was rejected and fair compensation from their client for the period prior to that.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Finally, we turn to the issue of the quantum of fees awarded. Faldetta takes issue with the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of the hours submitted by Feliciano\u2019s attorneys and the hourly rate applied to those hours. Feliciano argues that the judge set the hourly rates too low and erred in declining to award a fee enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\"><em>Rule </em>4:58-2 \u201caccords [the] judge no discretion regarding whether or not to award attorney\u2019s fees and costs of suit in an offer of judgment case.\u201d <em>Wiese v. Dedhia, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>587, 592, 911 A.2d 479 (2006). The amount of the assessment, however, is discretionary. <em>Packard-Bamberger &amp; Co. v. Collier, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>427, 444, 771 A.2d 1194 (2001). \u2018We will disturb a trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>determination on counsel fees only on the \u2018rarest occasion,\u2019 and then only because of clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Strahan v. Strahan, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 317, 953 A.2d 1219 (App.Div.2008) (quoting <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 661 A.2d 1202).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In calculating the amount of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, courts determine the \u201clodestar,\u201d defined as the \u201cnumber of hours reasonably expended\u201d by the attorney, \u201cmultiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.\u201d <em>Furst v. Einstein Moomjy, Inc., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>1, 21, 860 A.2d 435 (2004); <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 334-35, 661 A.2d 1202. \u201cThe court must not include excessive and unnecessary hours spent on the case in calculating the lodestar.\u201d <em>Furst, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 22, 860 A.2d 435. The court is required to make findings on each element of the lodestar fee. <em>Ibid.; R.M. v. Supreme Court, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 918 A.2d 7 (2007) (citing <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 <em>U.S. </em>424, 434, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1933, 1940, 76 L.Ed.2d 40, 51 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The trial judge carefully reviewed both the hours requested and the hourly rates sought. He found that the time spent by the attorneys was reasonable, that the hours were not duplicative, and that they had not been increased to inflate the fees. He declined to accept the requested hourly rates for the two attorneys, $500 for trial counsel and $400 for the other attorney. Although he did not apply the hourly rates urged by Faldetta, he described them as more in line with the relevant legal community. He chose hourly rates of $350 and $250, respectively. We see no \u201cclear abuse of discretion\u201d in the judge\u2019s determination of the hourly rate or the number of hours eligible for reimbursement, which find adequate support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Finally, the judge determined that a fee enhancement was not appropriate in this case. Here, the judge did not explain his reasons with the same degree of detail as required by <em>Rendine </em>and subsequent case law. We, nevertheless, agree with his conclusion that a fee enhancement was not required in this case. We note that the purpose of the fee-shifting provisions of <em>Rule </em>4:58 is to encourage settlement rather than to provide an incentive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>representation of plaintiffs in certain types of cases. <em>Rendine, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 341-42, 661 A.2d 1202. That is one reason why the fee award is limited to the period after the refusal to accept an offer of judgment. Even if the judge had the discretion to enhance the fees, he was not required to do so and our review of the record convinces us that he did not abuse any such discretion in declining to do so. The fee awarded was fair and reasonable under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v.
