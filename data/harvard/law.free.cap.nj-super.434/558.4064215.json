Prioleau damages for injuries suffered from a fall on defendants\u2019 restaurant premises. Defendants maintain the trial judge erred in denying their motion for a directed verdict. Alternatively, defendants argue erroneous jury instructions and incorrect evidential determinations require the verdict be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Following our review, we affirm the denial of defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict. However, we agree that use of the mode-of-operation liability jury charge was erroneous, warranting reversal. Accordingly, we vacate the verdict and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">The facts are taken from the record of the three-day jury trial. Early in the evening of December 26, 2009, between 5 and 6 p.m., plaintiff, who was traveling with her adult children Richard and Adriana, stopped in the Cherry Hill KFC restaurant owned and operated by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">Plaintiff and her children confirmed the weather was \u201cvery bad,\u201d it was \u201cpouring\u201d rain, and there was \u201ca torrential storm.\u201d Plaintiff entered the restaurant without aid of an umbrella. Further, plaintiff recalled she and her children \u201cwere wet[,]\u201d her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>jacket, clothing and sneakers were soaked, and the family \u201ctracked water in[to]\u201d the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">When the family entered the premises, only one other customer was in the dining area. Initially, plaintiff did not notice water or \u201cwetness\u201d on the restaurant\u2019s floor. Her son and daughter strode to the counter to place their order and plaintiff headed toward the restroom. Approximately five feet from the restroom, plaintiff started \u201cto slip and slide like [she] was on ice.\u201d She fell, extending her arms and hands to brace her fall and avoid banging her knees, and landed on her buttocks. Richard attempted to assist plaintiff, but he \u201cstarted to slip[,] also.\u201d Adriana \u201cran over also and tried to guide [plaintiff] up[, but] she started to slip.\u201d Then, the male patron seated nearby helped plaintiff rise from the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">During trial, plaintiff described the floor\u2019s surface, stating: \u201cIt was just like a sheet of ice. It was slippery. It was wet. And when I fell, that\u2019s what I came up was on my clothes [sic].\u201d Plaintiff said the floor felt like \u201cgrease ... and water.\u201d On cross-examination, plaintiff expounded, exclaiming: \u201cI felt it was wet first. It was slippery. And ... when we first started sliding is when [sic] I realized that it was grease mixed with water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">She and her children were approached by Debbie Lovato, the restaurant\u2019s assistant manager. Richard informed Lovato plaintiff had slipped. She declined medical attention stating \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t that serious.\u201d Plaintiff and her family ate their food and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">Plaintiff did not feel any immediate pain resulting from her fall; she \u201cfigured [she] would be okay.\u201d However, Adriana drove home to Newark, Delaware because plaintiff \u201cwas in too much pain.\u201d Upon arriving in Newark, plaintiff sought treatment at Christiana Hospital\u2019s emergency room and was discharged the same day. Two weeks later, on January 11, 2010, she consulted her family doctor. As a result of the accident, plaintiff injured her neck, back, and hands; experienced numbness in her left leg; and tingling in both arms and her left foot. She underwent a CT scan of her lumbar spine, which revealed disc bulges and arthritis at Ll-2, L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5, as well as a herniation in L5-S1. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>declined spinal injections and surgical intervention, and attended physical therapy a few days a week for approximately two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Plaintiff suffered no lost wages, acknowledging she returned to work without missing any time, despite the physical demands of her occupation. Plaintiff last received medical treatment in August 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On cross-examination, defendants attempted to inquire into plaintiffs prior medical treatments for her back and neck. Plaintiff had testified she only had prior difficulties with her knee. Defendants, intending to impeach plaintiffs testimony, questioned her regarding medical care undertaken to treat her lumbar spine in 2002. The judge sustained plaintiffs objection, precluding the use of plaintiffs prior medical records during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Additional evidence introduced by plaintiff included excerpts from deposition testimony of defendants\u2019 employees. Mark Loveless, the loss prevention manager, described various company policies. He stated a warning sign is used' if floors are wet and there is a general requirement to monitor the customer floor area for water or spills. Michelle Abdou, the restaurant\u2019s general manager, admitted no policy required the floor to be mopped periodically throughout the day, rather it was mopped in the evening and in the event of a spill, or if water was tracked in by customers. Further, when a floor is wet, warning signs are placed at the affected site. Cheryl Lynn Gross, an area coach and Abdou\u2019s supervisor, described how the restaurant cooks chicken in open split vat fryers and pressure cookers. She noted oil is used in the cooking process. During kitchen operations in the Cherry Hill restaurant, the kitchen floor is mopped two to three times per day and also if there is a spill. When asked whether someone on the cook line could get oil on their footwear, Gross responded \u201cpossibly.\u201d Acknowledging employees access the same restrooms as customers, Gross was asked whether kitchen workers with soiled footwear could track oil to the restroom. Again she responded, \u201cpossibly.\u201d At her deposition, Lovato testified that dining area tables were wiped every half-hour and the restrooms were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>checked when the tables were wiped. Lovato admitted she was unaware of any entries recording an inspection of the restaurant floor in the four hours preceding plaintiffs fall. She had not personally performed inspections, nor could she remember who was working that day that may have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Plaintiff presented expert testimony from Allan D. Tiedrich, MD, an expert in physical medicine and rehabilitation and orthopedics. He discussed his review of plaintiffs medical records and the examination he performed on September 13, 2010. During cross-examination, defendants established Dr. Tiedrich had not been provided with plaintiff\u2019s pre-accident treatment records and attempted to use the records to question him, including a 2007 lumbar x-ray. The trial judge allowed limited questions regarding Dr. Tiedrich\u2019s knowledge of the prior treatment, but precluded the use of the documents or his examination of the earlier x-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Abdou and Lovato testified for defendants. Abdou was not working the day of plaintiffs fall. She described the restaurant\u2019s layout, including the six-table dining area, the order counter, restrooms and the location of the two entrances. Abdou testified both customer entrances have \u201cbig[,] heavy\u201d floor mats \u201cbuilt into the tile of the floor\u201d and a rubber floor mat over those mats. Another large rubber mat was located in front of the soda machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Lovato explained she arrived at the restaurant at 2 p.m. and did not notice anything on the dining area floor. During her shift, she did not see any substances on the floor and no one complained the floor was wet or greasy. The restaurant does not have a specific policy requiring periodic inspection or mopping of the dining area floor during the day. However, when the floors are mopped, the mops are \u201ccolor coded\u201d and specific to the kitchen and the dining area. On the day of the incident, defendants\u2019 records contained no entry recording a floor inspection prior to plaintiffs accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">After learning of plaintiffs accident, Lovato attempted to speak to plaintiff, and learned she was in the restroom. In accordance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>with company policy, Lovato apologized to plaintiff and offered to compensate the family for their meal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Lovato visually examined the location where plaintiff fell and saw no water, grease or other substance on the floor. However, she acknowledged she did not physically touch the floor. She maintained the floor in front of the ladies room was not greasy or it would have been cleaned. She further stated she could survey the dining area floor from the order counter. Lovato insisted there were no spills on the floor, stating if water or grease was on the tile floor it is visible because \u201cit shines.\u201d She also explained team members wipe the dining area tables every half-hour and cheek the dining room and no problems were reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">After the incident, \u201cas a precautionary measure,\u201d Lovato erected a caution cone outside the restroom, which remained there until the restaurant closed. Immediately after speaking with plaintiff, Lovato called the company hotline to report the incident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">At the close of evidence, defendants moved for a directed verdict, arguing plaintiff failed to identify the substance on which she slipped and had not established \u201cany notice to the defendant[s].\u201d The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">During the charge conference, defendants objected to the inclusion of a mode-of-operation liability charge. The judge overruled the objection and included the doctrine in the jury\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff, awarding $250,000 and finding defendants 51% negligent. Final judgment for plaintiff was entered in the amount of $138,643.09, which included $11,143.09 in prejudgment interest. This appeal ensued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 request to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal and file a supersedeas bond, <em>Rule </em>2:9-5(a) and (b), was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">On appeal, defendants challenge the denial of the motion for directed verdict, the inclusion of the mode-of-operation liability charge, and the preclusion of plaintiffs past medical records during cross-examination. We examine these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Defendants contend a directed verdict should have been granted at the close of evidence because plaintiff produced no proof of defendants\u2019 actual or constructive notice of the dangerous substance on the premises, or even exactly what substance was on the floor. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In reviewing an order granting or denying a motion for directed verdict, \u201cwe apply the same standard that governs the trial courts.\u201d <em>Frugis v. Bracigliano, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>250, 269, 827 A.2d 1040 (2003). Motions for directed verdict at the close of trial, <em>R. </em>4:40-1, are governed by the same standard as motions for involuntary dismissal, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b). As applied here, we must accept as true all evidence presented by plaintiff and the legitimate inferences drawn therefrom, to determine whether the proofs are sufficient to sustain a judgment in her favor. <em>Monaco v. Hartz Mountain Corp., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>401, 413, 840 A.2d 822 (2004). \u201c[T]he judicial function here is quite a mechanical one. The trial court is not concerned with the worth, nature or extent (beyond a scintilla) of the evidence, but only with its existence, viewed most favorably to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5-6, 258 A.2d 706 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">Under <em>Rule </em>4:37-2(b), a motion for a directed verdict is granted only if, accepting the plaintiffs facts and considering the applicable law, \u201cno rational jury could draw from the evidence presented\u201d that the plaintiff is entitled to relief. <em>Pitts v. Newark Bd. of Educ., </em>337 <em>N. J.Super. </em>331, 340, 766 A.2d 1206 (App.Div. 2001). <em>See also R. </em>4:37-2(b) (\u201c[A] motion shall be denied if the evidence, together with the legitimate inferences therefrom, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>sustain a judgment in plaintiffs favor.\u201d). \u201c[I]f reasonable minds could differ, as to whether any negligence has been shown, the motion should be denied.\u201d <em>Bozza v. Vornado, Inc., </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>355, 357-58, 200 A.2d 777 (1964) (citing <em>Bell v. E. Beef Co., </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>126, 199 A.2d 646 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">\u201cIn general, \u2018[bjusiness owners owe to invitees a duty of reasonable or due care to provide a safe environment for doing that which is in the scope of the invitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stelluti v. Casapenn Enters., LLC, </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 446, 975 A.2d 494 (App.Div. 2009) (quoting <em>Nisivoccia v. Glass Gardens, Inc., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>559, 563, 818 A.2d 314 (2003)), <em>aff'd </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>286, 1 A.3d 678 (2010). \u201cThe duty of due care requires a business owner to discover and eliminate dangerous conditions, to maintain the premises in safe condition, and to avoid creating conditions that would render the premises unsafe.\u201d <em>Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 818 A.2d 314 (citing <em>O\u2019Shea v. K. Mart Corp., </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 492-93, 701 A.2d 475 (App.Div.1997)). <em>See also Arroyo v. Durling Realty, LLC, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 243, 78 A.3d 584 (App.Div.2013). Such a duty is imposed because \u201cbusiness owners \u2018are in the best position to control the risk of harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>323, 335, 901 A.2d 381 (2006) (quoting <em>Kuzmicz v. Ivy Hill Park Apartments, Inc., </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>510, 517, 688 A.2d 1018 (1997) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">To recover for injuries suffered, in addition to establishing a defendant\u2019s duty of care, a plaintiff must also establish the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition that caused the accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 818 A.2d 314 (citing <em>Brown v. Racquet Club of Bricktown, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>280, 291, 471 A.2d 25 (1984)). \u201cAn inference [of negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>gence] can be drawn only from proved facts and cannot be based upon a foundation of pure conjecture, speculation, surmise or guess.\u201d <em>Long v. Landy, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>44, 54, 171 A.2d 1 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">\u201cProof of a fall alone would not be adequate to create an inference of negligence.... \u201d <em>Simpson v. Duffy, </em>19 <em>N. J.Super. </em>339, 343, 88 A.2d 520 (App.Div.) (citations omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>10 <em>N.J. </em>315, 91 A.2d 230 (1952). This is because the mere existence of a dangerous condition does not, in and of itself, establish actual or constructive notice. <em>Arroyo, supra, </em>433 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 243, 78 A.3d 584 (citing <em>Sims v. City of Newark, </em>244 <em>N. J.Super. </em>32, 42, 581 A.2d 524 (Law Div.1990)). Liability for injuries caused by premises defects is imposed when a plaintiff establishes a defendant knew or had the reasonable opportunity to discover and correct the defect. <em>Brown, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 291, 471 A.2d 25. \u201cWhether a reasonable opportunity to discover a defect existed will depend on both the character and duration of the defect.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, a business owner will be liable for injuries sustained by an invitee caused by a dangerous condition on the premises \u201cif ... the dangerous condition ... existed for such a length of time that he should have known of its presence.\u201d <em>Bozza, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 359, 200 A.2d 777 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Defendants argue no testimony established actual or constructive notice of the alleged greasy and/or wet floor, defeating plaintiffs assertion of negligence. Plaintiff responds, maintaining the facts proved defendants had constructive notice of the floor\u2019s hazardous condition or, alternatively, that notice is inferred because of the nature and operation of the business itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Following our review, we reject defendants\u2019 contention as we conclude the proofs, when viewed in a light most favorable to plaintiff, sufficiently evince defendants\u2019 constructive notice of a wet or possibly greasy floor. We save for later our discussion of the applicability of mode-of-operation liability to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Plaintiffs evidence showed she felt the floor where she fell and found it wet, greasy and slippery. Further, she noticed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>substance was transferred to her clothing. Her daughter and son also experienced the slippery floor as they went to plaintiffs aid. Testimony demonstrated it was raining heavily throughout the day, which circumstantially proves rain-soaked customers entered the restaurant. Although mats were placed at public entrances, no mats were on the floor in front of the restrooms and plaintiff testified no mats were at the entrance on the day of the accident. Employees, including kitchen employees using grease for frying, used the same restroom facilities as did the customers, through a common entrance. Defendants admitted they had no established policy requiring floors to be inspected periodically, and Lovato confirmed no inspection or mopping occurred during the four hours before plaintiffs accident. Finally, despite plaintiffs fall, Lovato performed only a visual inspection of the site; she did not physically touch the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Having considered the proofs as a whole, we determine they are sufficient to allow a rational jury to evaluate whether the condition of the floor existed for a period of time such that had defendants exercised reasonable attention to inspect the floor\u2019s condition, defendants\u2019 employees would have learned of the danger and undertaken remedial action. Therefore, defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Defendants next challenge the jury charge. Specifically, defendants argue the judge failed to properly inform the jury of plaintiffs obligation to prove notice of the alleged hazardous condition. Moreover, defendants maintain the judge erred in directing notice was unnecessary if defendants\u2019 mode of operation created the hazardous condition. We conclude the court misapplied mode-of-operation liability. Because the charge had the capacity to mislead the jury, we vacate the judgment, reverse the verdict, and remand for a new trial. <em>Ruiz v. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Inc., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>607, 613, 636 A.2d 117 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>In reviewing challenges to jury charges, we do not criticize small parts of the charge, but examine the charge \u201cas a whole\u201d to determine whether it \u201c \u2018adequately conveys the law and is unlikely to confuse or mislead the jury[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Mogull v.

When applicable, an injured plaintiff is relieved of proving actual or constructive notice where, \u201cas a matter of probability, a dangerous condition is likely to occur as the result of the nature of the business, the property\u2019s condition, or a demonstrable pattern of conduct or incidents.\u201d <em>Nisivoccia,, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 818 A.2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">The mode-of-operation doctrine is an extension of the general principle that when a proprietor creates a dangerous condition, \u201cnotice, actual or constructive, of [that] dangerous condition is not required____\u201d <em>Craggan v.

More specifically, the mode-of-operation doctrine provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">[W]hen a substantial risk of injury is inherent in a business operator\u2019s method of doing business, the plaintiff is relieved of showing actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. The plaintiff is entitled to an inference of negligence, shifting the burden of production to the defendant, who may avoid liability if it shows that it did all that a reasonably prudent man would do in the light of the risk of injury the operation entailed. Thus, absent an explanation by defendants, a jury could find from the condition of the premises and the nature of the business that defendants did not exercise due care in operating the establishment, and that said negligent operation was the proximate cause of the injuries. The ultimate burden of persuasion remains, of course, with the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\"><em>[Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 564-65, 818 A.2d 314 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>See also Model Jury Charge (Civil), </em>5.20F(11), \u201cNotice Not Required When Mode of Operation Creates Danger\u201d (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Our review of the authority applying mode-of-operation liability does not support a conclusion that the doctrine applies merely because a defendant operates a type of business.

J.Super. </em>243, 300 A.2d 164 (App.Div.1973), this court rejected application of mode-of-operation liability where the plaintiff was injured by a youth who failed to control a metal shopping cart provided to customers by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 247-248, 300 A.2d 164. We examined the duty imposed on the defendant by furnishing the carts, but also observed they did not create a hazardous method of business operations, stating: \u201cWe are unable to say that a substantial risk of injury is implicit, or inherent, in the furnishing of shopping carts to patrons by a store proprietor. Shopping carts are not dangerous instrumentalities, and they are uniquely suitable for the purpose for which furnished.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">Understanding the parameters of mode-of-operation liability, we emphasize the need to examine the facts of each individual case. Turning to the facts presented here, we first consider the basis articulated by the trial judge to include a mode-of-operation liability charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">During the charge conference, plaintiff argued mode-of-operation liability applied. <em>See Model Jury Charges (Civil), </em>5.20F(11), \u201cNotice Not Required When Mode of Operation Creates Danger,\u201d (1970). Plaintiff mentioned the floor was greasy, grease was used in the restaurant\u2019s food preparation, and Gross acknowledged grease \u201cpossibly\u201d could have been tracked onto the customer floor area by a kitchen employee on the way to the restroom. Plaintiff next suggested defendants\u2019 business operation lacked a definitive policy requiring the floor to be inspected at set intervals. The judge considered these assertions, adding defendants\u2019 business was a \u201cfast food store ... and a lot of people tracking in and out.\u201d He further found defendants\u2019 safety policy required the use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>warning cone when it rained. The judge concluded: \u201cPutting that all together I think there\u2019s [sic] enough facts to make the inferences and the arguments to the jury.\u201d Accordingly, the judge applied mode-of-operation liability and overruled defendants\u2019 contrary objection.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The conclusion that these facts invoked mode-of-operation liability was unfounded and erroneous. Mode-of-operation liability does not apply merely because defendants operated a fast food restaurant. Rather, plaintiff must establish a causal nexus between the fast food or other business operation and the harm causing her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion, defendants\u2019 business as a \u201cfast-food operation\u201d has no relationship to plaintiffs fall. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>is no link between the manner in which the business was conducted and the alleged hazard plaintiff slipped on or its source. No testimony showed the alleged wet/greasy floor was the result of a patron\u2019s spilled drink or dropped food. Further, there was no evidence the restaurant\u2019s floor was ill-kept, strewn with debris or laden with overflowing trash.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Our dissenting colleague suggests we have narrowed mode-of-operation liability to apply solely \u201cto businesses where customers use self-service facilities.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 592, <em>85 </em>A.3d at 1035. Every reported opinion applying mode-of-operation liability in fact examines the self-service aspect of the defendant\u2019s business operations, which was found to have created the hazardous condition, causing the plaintiffs injury. From this we conclude the self-service mode-of-operation has resulted in the doctrine\u2019s development. Again, mode-of-operation liability results when a plaintiff suffers injury because the mode or manner of the business operation creates the dangerous condition on the premises. This concept does not lead to broad application. Although mode-of-operation can cause a dangerous condition, resulting in the owner\u2019s liability, not all dangerous conditions arising in the operation of a business satisfy the mode-of-operation theory of liability. It is on this point that we part company with the views expressed in the dissent. Therefore, mode-of-operation liability is distinguishable from liability imposed when an owner creates or fails to remove a known dangerous condition on premises, such as found in <em>Smith, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">When determining whether mode-of-operation liability exists, it is a mis-characterization to label a type of business, such as the trial judge did here, as invoking the doctrine. Just because a business is a fast-food restaurant or has self-service facilities does not prompt mode-of-operation liability. To trigger mode-of-operation liability, a plaintiff must identify facts showing a nexus between the method or manner in which the business is operated when extending products or services to the public, and the harm alleged to have caused the plaintiffs injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The additional facts identified by the dissent fail to establish a business operation that created an inherently dangerous risk warranting inclusion within the narrow scope of mode-of-operation liability. Although defendants\u2019 restaurant used oil to prepare fried food and spills occurred at times in the kitchen area, these facts do not implicate customer conduct in the operation of the business, which is the rationale underlying application of the mode-of-operation doctrine. Even after adding Gross\u2019s testimony, as cited by the dissent, <em>post </em>at 588-89, 85 A.3d at 1033-34, the facts at best raise a mere possibility that the greasy floor resulted from a kitchen employee. The comments do not \u201ccreate the <em>reasonable </em>probability that the dangerous condition would occur[,]\u201d <em>Bozza, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 360, 200 A.2d 777 (emphasis added). <em>See also Craggan, supra, </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 58, 752 A.2d 819 (\u201c[The defendant\u2019s mode of operation to facilitate self-service removal of purchased items created a <em>reasonable probability </em>that the string would not be properly coiled in its container after each use, would accumulate in the loading area, and create a tripping hazard for anyone using the area.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In reaching his conclusion, our dissenting colleague relies solely on this court\u2019s holding in <em>Smith, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874. We cannot abide such a rationale because the facts in <em>Smith </em>are distinguishable from those here presented, and, in concluding defendant created a dangerous condition on its property, the <em>Smith </em>court did not apply mode-of-operation liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff slipped on sawdust located on a stairwell used to access the restroom. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 228 A.2d 874. \u201cThere was evidence that prior to the accident sawdust was commonly observed upon the stairway[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Sawdust was used on the floor of the meat department and in the produce department. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 228 A.2d 874. The stairs were five feet from the store\u2019s meat department. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 228 A.2d 874. \u201c[E]mployees used the stairway about seven or eight times a day, or a total of 180 times a day for all employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 228 A.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>We determined, \u201cthe evidence was such that a jury could legitimately conclude that the greasy, slippery state of the stairway in reasonable probability resulted from the tracking of the sawdust upon the stairway \u2014 not by customers \u2014 but by defendant\u2019s own employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874. Thus, the plaintiff was not required to prove the defendant had notice of the condition because its employees created the dangerous condition. <em>Ibid. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>the issue before the trial court was whether the defendant had constructive notice of the hazardous condition of the stairway. <em>Smith, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874. The trial judge applied the holding in <em>Bozza, </em>stating plaintiffs proofs created \u201cthe reasonable probability that the dangerous condition did occur\u201d from the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>Ibid. </em>In our review of this determination, we expressed \u201cdoubt of [the] complete applicability [of the doctrine] to the facts of this case.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">In <em>Bozza, </em>the culpable conditions arose from the conduct of customers of defendant\u2019s restaurant and cafeteria. The court in effect held that there inhered in the nature of defendant\u2019s operation a foreseeable hazard that the floor would become littered and therefore that notice, actual or constructive, was not required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">Here, as we have indicated, the evidence was such that a jury could legitimately conclude that the greasy, slippery state of the stairway in reasonable probability resulted from the tracking of the sawdust upon the stairway \u2014 not by customers\u2014 but by defendant\u2019s own employees. Notice, either actual or constructive, is not required where a defendant through its agents and employees creates a dangerous condition. <em>Compare Torda v. Grand Union Co., </em>59 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41 [157 A.2d 133] (App.Div.1959), <em>Plaga, v. Foltis, </em>88 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 212 [211 A.2d 391] (App.Div. 1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">\n<em>\\Ibid.\\</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">It is important to note we did not find the conduct of the defendant\u2019s employees in tracking sawdust on the stairway fit within the narrow exception of mode-of-operation liability, even though <em>Wollerman, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 426, 221 A.2d 513, which defined the doctrine, had been decided by the Court a year earlier. Rather, in <em>Smith, </em>like this case, the facts presented issues of negligence unrelated to defendants\u2019 mode of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>This record is devoid of proof plaintiff fell on grease caused by defendants\u2019 fry cook who used the restroom. Plaintiff could not identify with any certainty the substance she thought caused her fall, alternating her description of the foreign substance between grease and water. The evidence marshalled by plaintiff may tend to show defendants had constructive notice that the restaurant floor was greasy. Moreover, even if the record revealed the fry cook used the restroom prior to plaintiffs fall and, in doing so, tracked grease onto the floor area leading to the restroom, the mode-of-operation doctrine would not apply. The doctrine\u2019s focus is not upon the conduct of the establishment\u2019s employees. Rather, the focus is upon the business model that encourages self-service on the part of the customer, which can reasonably and foreseeably create a risk of harm to the customer. <em>Nisivoccia, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 818 A.2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The specific facts identified by plaintiff and the judge during the charge conference, as listed in the dissent, address defendants\u2019 duty to guard against wet/greasy floors and invoke defendants\u2019 duty to periodically inspect the customer dining area floor for foreign substances. So too, defendants\u2019 alleged inaction or ineffective conduct despite the heavy downpour may tend to prove constructive notice of an unattended wet floor (although we note, contrary to the judge\u2019s statement, there was no testimony of a high volume of traffic in the restaurant and plaintiff herself testified there was only one patron present).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Unlike the precedents we have discussed, plaintiff cannot identify defendants\u2019 business practice that created an implicit or inherent danger likely to cause the resultant injury she sustained. <em>See e.g., Znoski, supra, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247, 300 A.2d 164 (holding the defendant\u2019s provision of shopping carts to customers does not trigger mode-of-operation liability in the plaintiffs action for injury caused when a youth struck him with a cart).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">This same analysis holds true if the foreign substance is water. The bulk of plaintiffs evidence suggested water from the rain and possibly from her own wet shoes and clothing caused her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>falL She produced no evidence showing, as a matter of probability, the presence of rain water on defendants\u2019 restaurant floor was \u201clikely to occur as a result of the nature of the [defendants\u2019] business, the property\u2019s condition or a demonstrable pattern of conduct or incidents.\u201d <em>Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 818 A.2d 314. That defendants failed to erect a warning sign or inspect the floor supports her claim of negligence, but not mode-of-operation liability, making use of that jury instruction error.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We, therefore, decline to paint with the same broad brush used by our dissenting colleague, who suggests defendants\u2019 actions or omissions in the course of operating a business must be attributed to its mode-of-operation. <em>Post </em>at 590-91, 592-94, 85 A.3d at 1034-35, 1036-37. Rather, mode-of-operation liability is applied only in limited circumstances that are not demonstrated here. These facts at hand may prove defendants breached their duty to plaintiff or that defendants had constructive notice of an inherently dangerous condition, but they do not reflect a danger posed by defendants\u2019 business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">We also note the judge specifically rejected inclusion of subpart 8 of the Model Charge addressing notice of a danger located on a business property, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">If you find that the land (or premises) was not in a reasonably safe condition, then, in order to recover, plaintiff must show either that the owner/occupier knew of the unsafe condition for a period of time prior to plaintiffs injury sufficient to permit him/her in the exercise of reasonable care to have corrected it, or that the condition had existed for a sufficient length of time prior to plaintiffs injury that in the exercise of reasonable care the owner/occupier should have discovered its existence and corrected it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\"><em>[Model Jury Charges (Civil), </em>S.20F8, \u201cNotice of Particular Danger as Condition of Liability\u201d (1970)1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">We conclude this charge properly addresses the liability question posed by the facts of this case. The jury should have been asked to consider whether plaintiff proved defendants breached their duty to provide a safe premises for invitees by failing to act when it knew or should have known of the danger posed by the rain on tile floors. The omission of the applicable legal standard from the jury instruction along with the inclusion of mode-of-operation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>liability charge was error. Because the jury charge used here was clearly capable of misleading or confusing the jury, we vacate the verdict and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Defendants\u2019 final challenge attacks the evidentiary determinations by the court excluding the use of plaintiffs prior medical records on cross-examination. Defendants argue the trial court erred in limiting cross-examination of plaintiff and her expert regarding plaintiffs prior complaints and symptoms of back and neck pain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As noted below, this record is insufficient to allow our definitive review of these issues.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, because we have ordered a new trial, we include these comments for guidance if the matter arises on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">At trial, plaintiff described her injuries. On cross-examination, she was asked whether she had made complaints of pain or sought medical treatment for these same areas of her body, prior to her fall. She responded she did not remember. Plaintiff was confronted with her deposition testimony, which unequivocally stated she had never sought treatment or complained of pain in her legs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>neck, or back or for tingling or numbness in her arms. Defendants then proceeded to ask plaintiff if she sought medical treatment in 2002, after complaining of back pain, which was met by a hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">At sidebar, the judge rejected defendants\u2019 claim the documents were admissible as business records and sustained the objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">So you\u2019re asking that the [c]ourt let in medical records withouF-just because it\u2019s for impeachment purposes because you found some medieal record that perhaps may contradict her credibility____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-7\">But just interpreting that the findings of the doctor and the history that he took is the same as the injuries she claims about today that\u2019s what you want the jury to make a credibility determination to find that she\u2019s not credible because some other doctor made note that she had perhaps similar complaints to similar body parts. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough. That\u2019s just too much hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">I\u2019m going to preclude you from using these notes to pick out another person\u2019s opinion without presenting the opinion of the doctor as to what the complaint resulted in after physical examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Hearsay statements are inadmissible unless they fall within a designated exception. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>802.

Amtrak, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. 139, </em>155-59, 690 <em>A.2d 682 </em>(App.Div.1997) (history of drag abuse and other personal issues was relevant to credibility of damage claim arising from personal injury); <em>Allendorf v. Kaiserman Enters., </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>662, 674, 630 A.2d 402 (App.Div.1993) (allowing introduction of \u201cevidence that plaintiff had episodes of passing out prior to the accident[, which] was admissible for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of her testimony that she was \u2018in perfect health\u2019 and had never had \u2018any problem with blacking out\u2019 prior to the accident\u201d). \u201cIt has long been the rale in New Jersey that the declarations of a patient as to his [or her] condition, symptoms and feelings made to his [or her] physician for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment are admissible in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rale.\u201d <em>Cestero v.

First, no proffer was made identifying the specific records to be used. Defendants\u2019 obligation is to identify the specific record, or portion thereof, claimed to be exempt and demonstrate its admissibility. We do not fault the judge for rendering a general ruling when confronted for the first time at trial with voluminous records claimed to be business records. Second, the judge correctly identified the prospect of inadmissible hearsay imbedded within possibly admissible documents. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>805. If the issue arises on remand, the subject may be best analyzed by motion presenting a specific proffer and allowing a detailed review.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The judge also limited the use of plaintiffs past medical records during cross-examination of Dr. Tiedrich. Noting plaintiff had not provided her expert with any pre-accident treatment records, defendants presented Dr. Tiedrich with a September 6, 2007 x-ray report of plaintiffs lumbar spine. Plaintiff objected, maintaining the records were hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">\u201cExtensive cross-examination of experts is generally permitted, subject to reasonable limitations imposed by the trial court in its discretion.\u201d <em>Nowacki v.

Further, Lovato confirmed no inspection or mopping occurred during the four-hour period before plaintiffs accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Indeed, a business owner has a duty to provide a safe environment for its invitees. <em>Nisivoccia v. Glass Gardens, Inc., </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>559, 563, 818 A.2d 314 (2003). This duty of care \u201crequires a business owner to discover and eliminate dangerous conditions, to maintain the premises in safe condition, and to avoid creating conditions that would render the premises unsafe.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because business operators are in the best position to prevent the risk of harm to their customers, it is fair to hold them responsible for injuries caused by their negligence. <em>See Hojnowski v. Vans Skate Park, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>323, 335, 901 A.2d 381 (2006). Unlike the customer, \u201c[t]he operator of a commercial recreational enterprise can inspect the premises for unsafe conditions, train his or her employees with regard to the facility\u2019s proper operation, and regulate the types of activities permitted to occur.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Nevertheless, business owners are generally not liable for injuries caused by dangerous conditions of which they were not aware. <em>Brown v. Racquet Club of Bricktown, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>280, 291, 471 A.2d 25 (1984). Ordinarily, the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove \u201cthat the defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition that caused the accident.\u201d <em>Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 563, 818 A.2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">When the very \u201cnature of the business ... creates the hazard,\u201d however, the \u201cmode-of-operation rule\u201d creates an inference of negligence and \u201cshifts the burden to the defendant to \u2018negate the inference by submitting evidence of due care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 564, 818 A 2d 314 (quoting <em>Bozza v. Vornado, Inc., </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>355, 360, 200 A.2d 777 (1964)). This inference relieves the plaintiff of proving the defendant had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition and instead requires the defendant to show it did \u201call that a reasonably prudent [person] would do in light of the risk of injury [the mode-of-operation] entailed.\u201d <em>Wollerman v. Grand Union Stores, Inc., </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>426, 429, 221 A.2d 513 (1966). If the defendant provides no explanation, the facts presented by the plaintiff should allow a jury to find \u201cfrom the condition of the premises and the nature of the business that [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>defendant] did not exercise due care in operating the [business], and that said negligent operation was the proximate cause of [the plaintiffs] injuries.\u201d <em>Bozza, supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 359, 200 A.2d 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">I agree with the majority that mode-of-operation liability does not apply merely because a defendant operates a fast food restaurant. <em>Ante </em>at 574, 85 A.3d at 1024. I further agree the unifying factor in these eases is the defendants\u2019 method of business operation, but I disagree with the assertion that mode-of-operation liability is limited to businesses where customers use self-service facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 85 A. 3d at 1024-25. Instead, mode-of-operation liability applies where there is a \u201crisk of injury inherent in the nature of the defendant\u2019s operation.\u201d <em>Wollerman, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 429-30, 221 A.2d 513.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Plaintiff relies on <em>Smith v. First National Stores, Inc., </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>462, 228 A.2d 874 (App.Div.1967), to support her position that she did not need to present evidence defendant had notice of the substance on the floor on the day she fell because there was sufficient evidence for a jury to draw a legitimate inference that the greasy floor was caused by defendants\u2019 employees. In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff was a supermarket patron who slipped on an interior stairwell leading to a restroom. <em>Id. </em>at 464, 228 A.2d 874. Evidence was introduced at trial indicating that the meat department \u201cwas about five feet away from the foot of the stairway.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c[P]rior to the accident sawdust was commonly observed upon the stairway,\u201d which could have come from the meat or produce departments because employees frequently used those stairs to access the restroom. <em>Id. </em>at 464-65, 228 A.2d 874. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Neither actual nor constructive notice was deemed necessary because evidence existed the defendant had created a dangerous condition \u201cthrough its agents and <em>employees____\u201d Id. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874. Essentially, the court found the plaintiff did not have to prove that the defendant had notice of the dangerous condition because evidence indicated the defendant itself created the hazard. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Here, the record indicates plaintiffs fall occurred about five feet outside of the restroom entrance. Plaintiff testified that her hands hit the floor and it felt like the floor had grease mixed with water on it. Plaintiffs son Richard testified, \u201cI went over to her and I tried to pick her up but I started to slip also. So Adriana, my sister[,] ran over also and tried to guide her up [but][s]he started to slip[.]\u201d Richard and Adriana required the assistance of another patron in the restaurant to finally get their mother up. Adriana testified the floor \u201cwas wet and it felt like it was greasy. I\u2019ve actually worked in a restaurant as well and it just felt like it was just greasy and it wasn\u2019t mopped properly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">The record clearly shows that KFC was aware the kitchen floor required special attention as evidenced by the practice of having separate mops for use in the kitchen and dining areas.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because workers in the kitchen used the same restrooms as patrons of the restaurant, the area between the kitchen and the restrooms could reasonably be expected to encounter grease from the workers\u2019 shoes when they used the restroom facilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Just as KFC had actual notice of the condition of the kitchen floor and had taken steps to address it, we can infer that KFC had constructive notice of the condition of the floor between the kitchen and the restrooms as well. It was \u201ccircumstantially inferable\u201d that the presence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>greasy substance described by plaintiff and her children was \u201csubstantially attributable\u201d to the use of the restrooms by the workers in the kitchen. <em>Smith, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 465, 228 A.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">I do not find the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Smith </em>persuasive. <em>Ante </em>at 580-82, 85 A.3d at 1028-29. In <em>Smith, </em>the store manager \u201ctestified that the purpose of the sawdust around the meat department was to \u2018keep the meat floor from a sliding condition,\u2019\u201d and we concluded it was thus \u201cinferable that such sawdust would pick up meat or fat droppings.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 465, 228 A.2d 874. Here, the testimony of defendants\u2019 district manager acknowledged that oil on the floor could be tracked outside the kitchen. Although she tried to minimize the impact of her responses by indicating \u201cpossibly,\u201d neither the jury nor the judge was obligated to accept this self-serving qualification when it flies in the face of logic and human experience. Simply put, when persons get cooking oil or grease on the soles of their shoes, one can reasonably expect they will track that substance as they walk about, leaving residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I see no significant distinction between the sawdust used by the meat department in <em>Smith </em>and the multi-colored mops used by KFC. Each represented a well-intentioned, but far-from-perfect, effort to address problems posed by the tracking of substances that reach the floor in the preparation of food. The sawdust used almost fifty years ago to address the problem posed by a greasy, slippery floor may seem rudimentary today; however, aside from the plaintiffs accident, there is no indication of any other accidents in <em>Smith, </em>even though the stairway where the accident occurred was used 180 times a day for all employees, as well as an unstated number of patrons, like the plaintiff. <em>Ibid. </em>While the sawdust may have been effective most of the time, the evidence was, nevertheless, \u201csuch that a jury could legitimately conclude that the greasy, slippery state of the stairway in reasonable probability resulted from the tracking of the sawdust upon the stairway \u2014 not by customers \u2014 but by defendant\u2019s own employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Similarly here, while the multi-colored mops may have been effective most of the time, the evidence was such that a jury could conclude with reasonable probability that the greasy, slippery floor outside the ladies restroom where plaintiff fell, resulted from the tracking of oil or grease from KFC\u2019s kitchen by defendants\u2019 own employees. Plaintiff described the floor where she fell as \u201cgrease and water\u201d and her daughter used the term \u201cgreasy\u201d; their testimony, if found credible by the jury, was certainly competent to establish the dangerous condition of the floor related to defendants\u2019 mode of operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">I believe the majority places undue emphasis upon the court in <em>Smith </em>expressing <em>\u201csome </em>doubt\u201d as to the <em>\u201ccomplete </em>applicability\u201d of mode-of-operation liability to the facts presented there. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 228 A.2d 874 (emphasis added). Unfortunately, the court in <em>Smith </em>did not provide any explanation for its reservation. <em>Ibid. </em>Nevertheless, such language hardly constituted a complete rejection of the applicability of the doctrine. Instead, the court in <em>Smith </em>chose to reverse on the narrow basis that the evidence at trial could support the conclusion that the slippery stairway resulted from the tracking of sawdust by defendant\u2019s own employees. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The majority interprets <em>Nisivoccia </em>as indicating a limitation of the mode-of-operation doctrine to proprietors whose business model \u201cencourages self-service on the part of the customer.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 582-83, 85 A.3d at 1029-30. While <em>Nisivoccia </em>did involve a slip and fall in a supermarket on grapes loosely packaged for sale, <em>Nisivoccia, supra, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>at 562, 818 A.2d 314, the Supreme Court made no express statement limiting the mode-of-operation rule to self-service businesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">The Model [Jury] Charge correctly states the rule that when a substantial risk of injury is inherent in a business operator\u2019s method of doing business, the plaintiff is relieved of showing actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition. The plaintiff is entitled to an inference of negligence, shifting the burden of production to the defendant, who may avoid liability if it shows that it did \u201call that a reasonably prudent man would do in the light of the risk of injury [the] operation entailed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>[Id. </em>at 564-65, 818 A.2d 314 (quoting <em>Wollerman, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 429, 221 A.2d 513).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Given the well-recognized risks to the health and safety of both patrons and workers posed by a greasy, slippery floor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I see no sound reason to impose the majority\u2019s limitation on the mode-of-operation doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Further, the equitable considerations that underlie the mode-of-operation cases apply to the present case and justify shifting the burden to KFC. After plaintiff fell, the assistant store manager chose not to kneel down to inspect the floor where plaintiff fell; neither she, nor any other employee, wiped the floor with a cloth or rag to see what may have caused plaintiffs fall. Additionally, KFC failed to preserve the restaurant log book in which the assistant manager documented the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\u201cThe customer is hardly in a position to know precisely [what] was the neglect.\u201d <em>Wollerman, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 429, 221 A.2d 513. \u201cIt is just, therefore, to place \u2018the onus of producing evidence upon the party who is possessed of superior knowledge or opportunity for explanation of the causative circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Kahalili v. Rosecliff Realty, Inc., </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>595, 606, 141 A.2d 301 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Because KFC\u2019s mode of operation allowed its workers in the kitchen, including those workers who fry the chicken in cooking oil in deep vat flyers and pressure cookers, to use the same restrooms as restaurant patrons,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the burden was appropriately shifted to KFC to prove it took \u201creasonable measures to guard against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>injuries to customers.\u201d <em>Craggan v. IKEA USA </em>332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>53, 62, 752 A.2d 819 (App.Div.2000)(quoting <em>O\u2019Shea, supra, </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 493, 701 A.2d 475).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">I conclude the facts before the jury raised legitimate inferences that plaintiffs fall was caused by grease on the floor related to defendants\u2019 mode of operation, where workers, exposed to the oil and grease in the kitchen, were not provided with a separate bathroom but were required to use the restrooms provided for patrons. By its verdict, the jury concluded defendants breached its duty to plaintiff to keep the premises reasonably safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Because I conclude the record supports the decision of the trial judge to give the mode-of-operation charge, and the jury charge on the whole accurately stated the law applicable to the contested evidence in this case, I would affirm the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Mogull v. CB Commercial Real Estate Group, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>449, 464, 744 A.2d 1186 (2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-16\"> Although the record does not contain specific testimony regarding restroom usage by KFC workers on the date of plaintiff's accident, the restaurant had been open approximately seven hours by the time of her fall, a sufficient period of time to make it reasonably probable one or more workers would have used the restroom during that period. Moreover, the record indicates the restrooms were checked every half hour when the customer tables were wiped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-6\"> Although I do not share the majority\u2019s view that limits mode-of-operation liability to businesses that allow self-service, <em>ante </em>at 574-75, 85 A.3d at 1024-25, I note the record does reflect that defendants' restaurant has a self-service soda fountain. While I believe the presence of this fountain reasonably charged defendants with notice that drink spills are likely to occur, I concede the record does not implicate the fountain in plaintiff's fall as she described the substance as \"grease\" and her daughter used the term \"greasy.\" Thus, the record does not indicate a nexus between defendants' self-service soda fountain and the substance that caused plaintiff's fall.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-10\"> While color-coded mops demonstrated some effort by KFC to address the problem posed by grease in the kitchen, it also highlighted the difficulty in effectively cleaning grease so as to prevent workers from tracking grease into the dining and restroom areas.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> The properties and hazards posed by kitchen grease are common knowledge and well within the ken of the average juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\"> <em>See, e.g., </em>a recent study of fast food restaurants, which highlighted the magnitude of the risk presented by walking on a contaminated floor, finding it increased the rate of slipping by 14.6 times.
