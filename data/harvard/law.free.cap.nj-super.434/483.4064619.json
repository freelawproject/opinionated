Newman, Jr. appeals from the October 30, 2009 determination of the Department of Labor\u2019s Board of Review, that affirmed a decision by the Appeal Tribunal for the Department\u2019s Division of Unemployment and Disability Insurance that, in turn, reversed a determination of the Deputy Director of the Division that Newman was entitled to benefits without disqualification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A portion of the appeal hearing was held when Newman was unable to attend because he was serving in the United States Air Force, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>violating his rights under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 <em>U.S.C.A. app. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 501 to 597. Additionally, the employer\u2019s appeal was improperly deemed timely based on the date that the employer received the determination <em>from </em>its representative, rather than when the representative received it. We therefore reverse and remand for another hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Newman was a sales specialist in the flooring department of Lowe\u2019s Home Centers, Inc. in Brick from February 2006 until July 18, 2008. On July 18, 2008, Lowe\u2019s management met with Newman regarding a dispute with a co-worker a few weeks earlier. The incident involved a verbal disagreement on the sales floor between Newman and the co-worker that escalated into a physical altercation. Prior to the meeting, management conducted an investigation and determined that Newman and the coworker should be discharged for misconduct. After the co-worker was terminated, a supervisor allowed Newman to resign instead of being formally discharged. Newman was given this option because his supervisor was aware that he was hoping to join the armed forces and an involuntary termination might negatively impact his opportunity to enlist.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Newman filed a claim for unemployment benefits on August 17, 2008. On October 2 a notice of eligibility was mailed by the Division. Lowe\u2019s appealed this decision thirteen days later on October 15. A telephonic hearing was held before an appeals examiner on January 12, 2009. An individual from UC Express<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> represented Lowe\u2019s at the hearing pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:21 \u2014 l(f)(H)The Appeals Examiner explained that UC Express \u201cis a company that represents employers in matters such as these unemployment hearings and he is here today, this morning at the discretion of Lowe\u2019s.\u201d At the conclusion of the telephonic hearing, Newman stated that he was going into the Air Force soon. The examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>reassured him that \u201c[everybody is going to get a decision shortly.\u201d No other hearing was scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Prior to a decision and after Newman entered the Air Force, the examiner conducted another hearing in April 2009 to determine only the timeliness of Lowe\u2019s initial appeal, which the examiner had neglected to cover in the earlier hearing. Newman was not present for this second telephonic hearing. Only Maryellen Miraglia, Lowe\u2019s human resource manager, appeared. She stated that, on October 13, 2008, she had received the initial determination from UC Express via fax. She testified that UC Express filed the appeal on Lowe\u2019s behalf on October 15. No evidence was presented as to when UC Express received the initial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">On April 14, 2009, the Appeal Tribunal rendered a decision finding: (1) the appeal was timely filed in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21 \u2014 6(b)(1); (2) Newman was disqualified from benefits under <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-5(b) from July 13, 2008<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> through August 23, 2008, as \u201cthe discharge was for misconduct connected with work;\u201d (3) Newman\u2019s liability for a refund of benefits received was remanded to the Director and; (4) Lowe\u2019s was not liable for any charges to its rating account.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Newman appealed to the Board, and the case was remanded to the Appeal Tribunal for a \u201cdecision on all issues,\u201d although the remand directed additional testimony from Newman and the store manager only \u201cregarding whether [Newman] voluntarily left his employment or was discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">On July 23, 2009, with Newman now present, the appeals examiner took telephonic testimony only as to whether Newman was \u201cdischarged for misconduct connected to the work.\u201d Lowe\u2019s was again represented by UC Express. After the hearing, the Appeal Tribunal issued a second opinion, again finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>appeal was timely filed and that Newman was disqualified from benefits for six weeks pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-5(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Board then issued an opinion agreeing with the Appeal Tribunal, stating that because Newman resigned in lieu of a discharge for misconduct, he was disqualified for benefits for six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Our review in an appeal from a final decision of an administrative agency is limited. <em>Circus Liquors, Inc. v. Middletown Twp., </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>1, 9, 970 A.2d 347 (2009). The issues presented here, however, are strictly legal in nature: the interpretation of the federal and state Civil Relief Acts for members of the military and the import of UC Express\u2019 representation when considering whether the initial appeal by Lowe\u2019s was timely filed. Such legal interpretations are primarily the function of the judiciary and do not call for deference to the agency. <em>Krayniak v. Bd. of Trs., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 237, 989 A.2d 306 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Newman argues that he was unlawfully deprived of the opportunity to participate in the April 13, 2009 hearing regarding the timeliness of Lowe\u2019s appeal. The Attorney General does not address this issue, instead focusing on the argument that Newman was properly disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits for six weeks. Newman stated at the end of the January 12, 2009 hearing, \u201cI\u2019m actually going into the United States Air Force January 20th ... [s]o I just need to make sure this is handled and taken care of before I do actually go away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\"><em>Rule </em>1:5-7 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]n affidavit of non-military service of each defendant, male or female, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>required by law, shall be filed before entry of judgment by default against such defendant.\u201d We noted in <em>PNC Bank, N.A v. Kemenash </em>that this <em>Rule </em>is grounded in both federal and state law. 335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 127, 761 A.2d 118 (App.Div.2000). The New Jersey Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">In any civil action or proceeding commenced in any court, if there shall be a default of an appearance by the defendant, [ ] plaintiff, within 20 days before the entry of judgment or final order, shall file in the court an affidavit setting forth facts showing that the defendant is not in military service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>38:230-4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The statute is to be liberally construed for the stated purpose \u201cto maintain, secure and protect the civil and property rights of persons in the military.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:23C-1. A judgment entered in the absence of an appropriate affidavit \u201cis not void but voidable and then only by a person within the protection of the statute and affidavit requirement.\u201d <em>Kemenash, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 129, 761 A.2d 118. New Jersey law defines \u201ccourt\u201d only as any \u201cState court of competent jurisdiction ...\u201d and does not include state administrative agencies. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>38:23C-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The federal statute, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, 50 <em>U.S.C.A. app. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 501 to 597, similarly requires a plaintiff to file an affidavit of nonmilitary status before a default judgment is entered in a civil proceeding. 50 <em>U.S.C.A. app. </em>\u00a7 521(b)(1)(A). The federal law, which was amended in 2003, now defines \u201ccourt\u201d as any court or \u201cadministrative agency of the United States or <em>of any State </em>(including any political subdivision of a state)____\u201d 50 <em>U.S.C.A. app. </em>\u00a7 511(5) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">The federal Act further provides for a stay of proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">(1) Authority for stay. At any stage before final judgment in a civil action or proceeding in which a servicemember ... is a party, the court may on its own motion and shall, upon application by the servicemember, stay the action for a period of not less than 90 days, if the conditions in paragraph (2) are met.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">(2) Conditions for stay. An application for a stay under paragraph (1) shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">(A) A letter or other communication setting forth facts stating the manner in which current military duty requirements materially affect the servicemember\u2019s ability to appear and stating a date when the servicemember will be available to appear. [50 <em>U.S.C.A. app. </em>\u00a7 522(b)(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The stated purpose of the federal Act is to \u201cprovide temporary suspension of judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect the civil rights of servieemembers during their military service.\u201d 50 <em>U.S.C.A. app. </em>\u00a7 502(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">This federal Act applies to our state administrative agencies by application of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, <em>U.S. Const. </em>Art. VI, cl. 2. During World War II, the United States Supreme Court stated that the Act, then known as the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act, is \u201calways to be liberally construed to protect those who have been obliged to drop their own affairs to take up the burdens of the nation.\u201d <em>Boone v. Lightner, </em>319 <em>U.S. </em>561, 575, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>1223, 1233, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>1587, 1596 (1943). We follow the Court\u2019s mandate to liberally apply the Act, which is necessary now as it was then.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">It was a clear violation of the Act for a hearing to proceed while Newman was known to be serving in the military and did not expressly consent to the proceeding occurring in his absence. We must therefore remand for another hearing as to the timely filing of Lowe\u2019s appeal, giving Newman an opportunity to participate. Newman may well have a legal defense regarding the untimeliness of the employer\u2019s appeal, which he was not able to present at the April 13 hearing due to his service in the Air Force.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Newman argues that Lowe\u2019s initial appeal of the Deputy\u2019s decision rendering him eligible for unemployment benefits was untimely filed. The Attorney General maintains that since Lowe\u2019s appealed within two days of receiving the initial determination from UC Express, it filed the appeal timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-(6)(b)(l) sets forth the procedure for appeals of an agency determination of unemployment benefits. It states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqj-dedup-0\">Unless the claimant or any interested party, <em>within seven calendar days after delivery of notification of an initial detei'm.ination </em>or within 10 calendar days after such notification was mailed to his or them last-known address and addresses, files <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>an appeal from such decision, such decision shall be final and benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance therewith....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>43:21 \u2014 (6)(b)(l) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Lowe\u2019s clearly did not file an appeal within \u201c10 calendar days after such notification was mailed.\u201d The issue is whether the appeal was filed within seven calendar days of receipt of notification of the initial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">New Jersey courts have consistently held that the limitation period proscribed by this statute is of jurisdictional import and \u201chence not generally subject to equitable tolling or enlargement under the so-called discovery rule.\u201d <em>Hopkins v. Bd. of Review, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 88-89, 591 A.2d 1371 (App.Div.1991). <em>See also, Lowden v. Bd. of Review, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 470, 189 A.2d 224 (App.Div.1963) (explaining that the Unemployment Compensation Law is social legislation \u201cwhich should be construed by the courts to give effect to its beneficent purposes! ]\u201d but does not authorize courts to extend time limitations intended by the Legislature to be fixed as an absolute deadline in the statute). In <em>Rivera v. Bd. of Review, </em>the Court held that claimants in unemployment compensation cases have a due process right to notice which must be considered when applying statutory appeal requirements. 127 <em>N.J. </em>578, 586, 606 A.2d 1087 (1992). As applied to a claimant, the statutory period may be enlarged so that the individual has constitutionally-sufficient notice of the loss of benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 586-87, 606 A 2d 1087. Lowe\u2019s, the employer, does not enjoy a similar due process right to enlarge the rigid statutory period to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Both the Appeal Tribunal and the Board of Keview determined that Lowe\u2019s appealed within seven days of receipt of the Deputy\u2019s initial determination. Lowe\u2019s human resources manager stated at the April 13 hearing that she received the initial determination from UC Express, the company\u2019s unemployment compensation representative, on October 13. There is no evidence in the record as to when UC Express received the determination and thus no way to determine if Lowe\u2019s October 15 appeal was within seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>days of delivery of the notification of the initial determination to UC Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><em>Rule </em>4:4-6 explains that an attorney acknowledgement of service of process <em>on </em>behalf <em>of </em>a client \u201cshall have the same effect as if the defendant had been properly served.\u201d While UC Express does not provide legal representation, UC Express is Lowe\u2019s representative with specific authority to receive determinations from an administrative body on behalf of Lowe\u2019s. <em>See Air-Way Branches, Inc. v. Bd. of Review, 10 N.J. 609, </em>613-15, 92 A.2d 771 (1952) (holding that a determination sent to a warehouse manager with no authority to accept or acknowledge service of legal process is insufficient to begin the seven-day appeals timeline for an employer to appeal employee eligibility of benefits). Thus, the issue is whether Lowe\u2019s filed the appeal within seven calendar days of UC Express\u2019 receipt of the initial determination. Because the record does not reveal when UC Express received the determination, a rehearing as to timeliness of Lowe\u2019s appeal would be necessary even absent the clear violation of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-15\"> Only one week of benefits is actually in dispute: the week of August 17, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> The transcript refers to this entity variously as \u201cUC Express,\u201d \u201cUC EXPRESS\u201d and <em>\"TALX </em>UC EXPRESS.\u201d We use UC Express consistently throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-10\"> It is unclear where the July 13 date comes from as the fight occurred earlier, Newman worked through July 18, 2008 and he was \"removed from the [Lowe's] system\u201d on July 20, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b514-11\"> The statute has since been amended to an eight-week period of disqualification. <em>L. </em>2010, c. 37, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
