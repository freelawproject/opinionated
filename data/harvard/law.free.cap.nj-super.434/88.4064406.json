O\u2019Brien, Jr., the Director of the Medicinal Marijuana Program (MMP).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs seek \u201cinjunctive and/or declaratory relief\u2019 to effectuate the New Jersey Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-1 to -16. The Act legalizes the production, sale, and consumption of medicinal marijuana prescribed for specific patients diagnosed with defined debilitating medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">After reviewing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, the trial judge concluded the Law Division lacked jurisdiction to consider the substantive claims and transferred the matter to this court, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(2), which provides \u201cappeals may be taken to the Appellate Division as of right ... to review final decisions or actions of any state administrative agency.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(2) contemplates a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">proceeding to review the action or inaction of a stale administrative agency [shall] be by appeal to the Appellate Division____Therefore, the Appellate Division has exclusive jurisdiction to consider a claim of state administrative agency inaction.

However, we deny all other requests for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">The Act was adopted on January 18, 2010 and originally scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2010, <em>L. </em>2009, c. 307, \u00a7 19. At DOH\u2019s request, the Legislature amended the Act to delay the effective date to October 1, 2010. <em>See L. </em>2010, c. 36, \u00a7 1. Stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>legislative findings note that although marijuana is included as a controlled dangerous substance, as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-2, \u201c[cjompassion dictates that a distinction be made between medical and non-medical uses of marijuana.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>24:6I-2(e). The Act broadly seeks \u201cto protect from arrest, prosecution, property forfeiture, ... criminal and other penalties, those patients who use marijuana to alleviate suffering from debilitating medical conditions, as well as their physicians, primary caregivers, and those who are authorized to produce marijuana for medical purposes.\u201d Listing the specific debilitating medical conditions to which the use of medicinal marijuana is permitted, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-3, the Act directs DOH to establish a registry of qualifying patients and their caregivers and issue registry identification cards. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-4(a). Further, the Act proposes to license alternative treatment centers (ATC) to cultivate and distribute medicinal marijuana. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The Act includes few details for its effectuation, but rather, authorizes DOH to promulgate a body of regulations in consultation with the Department of Law and Public Safety, regarding the operation, monitoring, inspection, licensure, and security of permitted providers; pickup, delivery, and distribution of marijuana by third parties; the nature of the products sold and the quantity permitted for distribution; provisions allowing registered primary caregivers to handle a qualifying patient\u2019s medical marijuana; and qualifications and the registration of patients to receive medicinal marijuana. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-4, 7(a), 7(b), 7(i), 16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">DOH discharged its rulemaking responsibility by proposing rules for the MMP on November 15, 2010. 42 <em>N.J.R. </em>2668(a) (Nov. 15, 2010).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature found the proposed rules, in part, were inconsistent with the Act\u2019s intention, and passed a concurrent resolution identifying provisions needing modification. <em>S. Res. </em>130, 214th Leg. (N.J.2010) and <em>Assemb. Res. </em>151, 214th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Leg (N.J.2010). <em>See also </em>43 <em>N.J.R. </em>340(a) (Feb. 22, 2011). The concurrent resolution directed DOH to amend or withdraw portions of regulations it identified as non-conforming, within thirty-days. More specifically, the concurrent resolutions identified as non-conforming the imposed limitation on debilitating conditions treatable by medicinal marijuana, the separation of ATC activities for cultivation and distribution of marijuana, and the limit imposed on the level of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained in marijuana products sold. DOH issued modified rules in February 2011. 43 <em>N.J.R. </em>340(a). A second concurrent resolution, <em>S. Res. </em>151, 214th Leg (N.J.2011) was introduced on April 11, 2011, which reaffirmed those proposed rules found to deviate from the Act\u2019s intent. The Legislature never adopted that resolution. The MMP regulations were finalized and adopted on November 23, 2011, effective December 19, 2011. 43 <em>N.J.R. </em>3335(a) (Dec. 19, 2011), appear at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:64-1 to -13.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Pending finalization of the rules, DOH published a request for applications for the first non-profit ATC operators. Six applicants were selected to operate proposed ATCs that were geographically spaced throughout the state, with two ATCs in the northern, central and southern regions of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The Act includes a provision instructing: DOH \u201cshall report to the Governor, and the Legislature ... no later than one year after the effective date of this act, on the actions taken to implement the provisions of this act[,]\u201d and annually thereafter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-12(a)(1), (2). The Commissioner was also mandated to report findings regarding the sufficiency of the number of ATCs and other issues within two years of the Act\u2019s effective date and every two years thereafter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-12(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">To date, three ATCs have opened: Greenleaf Compassion Center in Montclair, Essex County, on October 16, 2012; Compassionate Care Foundation in Egg Harbor Township, Atlantic County, on October 28, 2013; and Garden State Dispensary, formerly Compassionate Care Centers of America, Inc. in Woodbridge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Middlesex County, on November 22, 2013.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The respective websites of the other three chosen ATC applicants suggest various stages of progress toward opening. Compassionate Sciences, Inc., located in Bellmawr, Camden County, appears to be closest to commencement of operations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Breakwater Alternative Treatment Center lists its location as Central New Jersey<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Harmony Foundation lists an address in Cliffside Park, but does not yet suggest it is accepting patients.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 five-count amended complaint conflates requests for equitable and legal relief and demands a jury trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Plaintiffs Richard Caporusso and Caroline dock are qualified patients under the Act, who claim they have been denied access to medical marijuana because of DOH\u2019s failure to implement the program as mandated. Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollack, M.D., alleges he sought to provide written certifications for his patients he believed suffered qualified debilitating medical conditions and found the requirements to do so were burdensome and time-consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>In count one, Caporusso and Glock generally assert they suffered a denial of due process under the New Jersey Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In count two, plaintiff Jill Caporusso, Richard\u2019s wife, asserts derivative claims for loss of services. Count three asserts DOH\u2019s willful, intentional, wanton, malicious, reckless, or grossly negligent actions, have denied Caporusso and Glock access to medical marijuana which amounts to an intentional tort. Count four alleges DOH negligently failed to effectuate its duty to implement the Act and count five identifies the injunctive relief sought \u201cto see to it that the will of the [Legislature is carried out.\u201d In a single prayer for claims of relief, plaintiffs seek an order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">1. Requiring [the Commissioner] to see to it that the statute is properly implemented and the scheme contained in the [Act] ... is obeyed!;]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">2. Compelling ... [the] Director of the [MMP] to promptly comply with the [Act] and the [legislative directives in [the Act] by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">A. Immediately establishing a workable program eliminating the unnecessary and/or overly burdensome hurdles to physicians willing to prescribe marijuana in accordance with the [Act];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">B. Completing background investigations on all six (6) [ATCs\u2019] entire board members, staff and interested parties within [thirty] days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">C. Approving or denying each of the six (6) selected ATC applicants within [thirty] days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">D. Rejecting any disqualified applicant and appointing another ATC operator in the event that an ATC applicant is disqualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">E. Submitting the complete report as mandated by the [Act], on their actions taken to implement the program to the Governor and Legislature within [thirty] days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\">3. Declaring that the [MMP] regulations as promulgated by the [DOH] are ultra vires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-14\">4. Declaring that the MMP regulations as promulgated by the DOH are unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-15\">5. Appointing the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey ... as [m]onitor, to oversee and report to the Le]ourt on actions taken by DOH to implement the MMP;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-16\">6. Compelling DOH to revise the MMP regulations under consultation and in conformity with the recommendations drafted by [the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey] within [sixty] days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>7. Providing [the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey] shall be compensated at a reasonable rate out of the MMP budget;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">8. Granting qualified and registered patients a defense from criminal prosecution that they otherwise would have been afforded had they possessed an ID card;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">9. Permitting patients to immediately petition the DOH to add qualifying conditions pursuant to the [Act].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Finally, plaintiffs\u2019 <em>ad damnum </em>clause seeks \u201csuch other relief as the [c]ourt deems equitable and just[,]\u201d along with demands for compensable and punitive damages, counsel fees, costs and pre- and post-judgment interest. It is noted, certifications and plaintiffs\u2019 merits brief also discuss prior document requests, alluding to violations of the Open Public Records Act (OPRA), <em>N.J.S.A </em>47:1A-1 to -13.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">In lieu of filing an answer, DOH moved to dismiss the complaint. The Law Division judge considered the matter on January 24, 2013. The judge declined to review the merits of the various claims, determining jurisdiction rested with this court, and transferred the case for our review pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The complaint is muddled and lacks specificity regarding several alleged causes of action. However, we discern four types of issues presented: (1) DOH\u2019s inaction in implementing identified provisions of the Act requires an order compelling it to act; (2) due process violations warrant compensatory relief; (3) DOH\u2019s inaction amounts to intentional torts and/or negligence requiring an award of damages; and (4) DOH\u2019s noncomplianee with several OPRA requests must be remedied.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">We easily dispose of the latter two categories of claims. We conclude plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings are insufficient to allow consideration under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act (TCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-1 to:12-3 and OPRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">Although not referenced in the complaint, claims against the State must meet the requirement of the TCA, which states: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by this act, a public entity is not liable for an injury, whether such injury arises out of an act or omission of the public entity or a public employee or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:2-l(a). Accordingly, immunity generally applies and \u201cliability is the exception.\u201d <em>Fluehr v. City of Cape May, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>532, 539, 732 A.2d 1035 (1999). <em>See also Dickson v. Twp. of Hamilton, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 195, 946 A.2d 617 (App. Div.) (\u201c \u2018[T]he public policy of this State is that public entities shall be liable for their negligence only as set forth in the [TCA].\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Pico v. State, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>55, 59, 560 A.2d 1193 (1989))), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>461, 957 A.2d 1170 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u201cConsistent with its goals of restricting governmental liability in tort, the TCA requires that a claim be presented to a public agency within ninety days after accrual of the cause of action.\u201d <em>Greenway Dev. Co. v. Borough of Paramus, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>546, 552, 750 A.2d 764 (2000) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8). \u201cTwo of the primary purposes advanced by the notice requirement are: (1) \u2018to expedite investigation with the hope of reaching non-judicial settlement\u2019; and (2) \u2018to protect the public entity\u2019s access to current information about the incident giving rise to the claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Reale v. Twp. of Wayne, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 109, 332 A.2d 236 (Law Div.1975)). The record presents no compliance with the TCA\u2019s notice requirement, a lapse that is fatal to recovery. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>59:8-8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">As to the claimed OPRA violations, we observe plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to allege a basis for relief under OPRA. Further, we find any challenge based on said requests is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The record reveals OPRA requests were filed by counsel before and after plaintiffs filed their April 4, 2012 complaint. Assuming the OPRA requests were made on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf, which is not clear from the record,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the document demands submitted prior to initiating legal action were dated November 23 and 30, 2011, December 20, 2011, and February 10, 2012. The assertions of OPRA non-compliance arising from these requests should have been filed within forty-five days of DOH\u2019s alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>lapse. <em>See Mason v. City of Hoboken, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>51, 57, 951 A.2d 1017 (2008) (\u201cOPRA actions have a 45-day statute of limitations, consistent with actions in lieu of prerogative writs.\u201d). <em>See also R. </em>4:69-6. The claims will not be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Accordingly, the issues for our consideration are narrowed. We consider whether DOH has failed to comply with the Legislature\u2019s directives set forth in the Act and, if so, whether relief is available through this court. Also, we consider whether an actionable constitutional challenge has been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Included among the common law prerogative writs is mandamus, which is a writ directing government officials to carry out required ministerial duties. <em>In re Application of LiVolsi, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>576, 594 n. 18, 428 A.2d 1268 (1981) (citing <em>McKenna v. N.J. Highway Auth., </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>270, 275-76, 116 A.2d 29 (1955)). A court-issued writ of mandamus to a government official \u201c \u2018commands the performance of a specific ministerial act or duty, or compels the exercise of a discretionary function, but does not seek to interfere with or control the mode and manner of its exercise or to influence or direct a particular result.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Resolution of State Comm\u2019n of Investigation, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>35, 45 n. 7, 527 A.2d 851 (1987) (quoting <em>Switz v. Middletown Twp., </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>580, 587, 130 A.2d 15 (1957)). \u201cFormer prerogative writs have been superseded\u201d by Article VI, Section V, paragraph 4 of the 1947 New Jersey Constitution, such that actions in lieu of prerogative writs are now governed by <em>Rule </em>4:69-1. <em>McKenna, supra, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>at 274, 116 A.2d 29.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>Guhl, supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 333, 751 A.2d 1077 (\u201cWhen our 1947 Constitution was prepared, pains were taken to insure not only that the court\u2019s prerogative writ jurisdiction would remain intact, but also that the manner of its exercise would be greatly simplified <em>([N.J. Const.] </em>art. VI, see. 5, [paragraph] 4).\u201d). In this regard, it is well-settled this court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction extends not only to State agency action, but also agency inaction.\u201d Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3.1 on <em>R. </em>2:2 \u2014 3(a)(2) (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Understanding the matter is properly before this court, we emphasize our authority to compel agency action is exercised sparingly, as courts are ill-equipped to micromanage an agency\u2019s activities. <em>Sod Farm Assocs. v. Twp. of Springfield, </em>366 <em>N.J.Super. </em>116, 130 n. 10, 840 A.2d 885 (App.Div.2004). Rather, we accord wide discretion to administrative agencies which are to decide \u201chow best to approach legislatively assigned administrative tasks.\u201d <em>In re Failure by the Dep\u2019t of Bank. &amp; Ins., </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>253, 262, 764 A.2d 494 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>292, 773 A.2d 1155 (2001). We also remain mindful separation of powers generally grants control of policy-making to the Governor and Legislature. <em>United States Trust Co. v. State, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>253, 259, 353 A.2d 514 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">An individual\u2019s challenge to the inaction of a State agency can seek to compel only clearly \u201cmandated ministerial obligations,\u201d which do not require an evaluative judgment in the exercise of discretion. <em>Equitable Life Mart. &amp; Realty Inv. v. Div. of Taxation, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 238, 376 A.2d 966 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>535, 384 A.2d 514 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>A ministerial duty is one that \u201cis absolutely certain and imperative, involving merely the execution of a set task, and when the law which imposes it prescribes and defines the time, mode and occasion of its performance with such certainty that nothing remains for judgment or discretion.\u201d <em>Ivy Hill Park Apartments v. N.J. Prop. Liab. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>131, 140, 534 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>188, 540 A.2d 183 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In other words, \u201cmandamus is an appropriate remedy \u2018(1) to compel specific action when the duty is ministerial and wholly free from doubt, and (2) to compel the exercise of discretion, but not in a specific manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vas v. Roberts, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 522, 14 A3d 766 (App.Div.2011) (quoting <em>Loigman v. Twp. Comm, of Middletown, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>287, 299, 687 A.2d 1091 (App.Div. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Here, plaintiffs seek an order compelling DOH to: eliminate \u201cthe unnecessary and/or overly burdensome hurdles to physicians willing to prescribe marijuana in accordance with the [Act]\u201d; complete background investigations on board members, staff and interested parties of approved ATCs within thirty days; approve or reject the licensure of the remaining three selected ATCs within thirty days and select different ATC applicants to replace those rejected; and submit a report to the Legislature and the Governor as mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-12(a)(l) within thirty days. We must separately examine each of these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Regarding the regulatory scheme adopted for physician certification of eligible MMP patients, plaintiffs allege the regulations are \u201cunnecessary and/or overly burdensome.\u201d To support their claim, plaintiffs rely on certifications by Jeffrey S. Pollack, M.D. and Vanessa Waltz. Dr. Pollack states he registered two patients and found the process \u201cburdensome\u201d because he was required to provide patient-specific information not readily accessible in his patient\u2019s file, such as the patient\u2019s full middle name, and asserts such information is not mandated when he writes a prescription for pharmaceuticals. In registering his second pa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>tient, Dr. Pollack reduced his time expenditure by one-third, to twenty minutes, which he still found excessive. He suggests the process is a \u201cnuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Waltz, a member of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana New Jersey and not a physician, conducted \u201ca non-scientific survey of physicians registered with the [DOH] to recommend medical marijuana to patients.\u201d From this effort she concludes physicians are reluctant to participate in the MMP because she believes the DOH\u2019s website is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">When an agency violates the express policy of its enabling act, the agency action may be deemed arbitrary and capricious. <em>Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl.

Act Rules, N.J.A.C. 7:7A-1.1 et seq., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 527, 570 A.2d 435 (App.Div.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Following our review, we conclude to issue an order as requested by plaintiffs has the potential of interfering with the orderly workings of DOH in implementing the MMP, making mandamus inappropriate. <em>In re Failure, supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 262-63, 764 A.2d 494. Dr. Pollack\u2019s certification is anecdotal and his two experiences fail to establish plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of unnecessary and burdensome regulatory requirements. Further, if Dr. Pollack is aggrieved by agency action, recourse requires initial administrative review and exhaustion of administrative remedies, a course he has not pursued. Waltz offers no factual information based on personal knowledge. She merely imparts her opinion gathered from unidentified hearsay statements. This is not evidential, and is insufficient to support plaintiffs\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We find significant the Legislature, which has actively monitored the MMP regulations, raised no concerns regarding the provisions addressed to a physician\u2019s patient registration for the MMP. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>8:64-2.1 to 2.6. Indeed, the Legislature has adopted no further resolutions challenging any of the MMP rules or procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 claims of the need to conduct discovery to develop this issue. The type of discovery requests suggested is neither specific nor descriptive of what information is held by DOH that is necessary to support plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. For all of these reasons, we conclude mandamus relief on this issue is inappropriate and is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Plaintiffs next challenge the lack of current operational ATCs, asserting DOH has caused \u201cunjustifiable delay\u201d in meeting its statutory mandate to render approval or rejection within sixty days following receipt of a completed ATC application, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-7(e). Plaintiffs contend the statute mandates agency action, up or down, within sixty days. When their complaint was filed, no ATC was operational, and now, more than three years following the effective date of the Act, only one-half of the minimum ATCs authorized by the Act have been fully permitted. Pointing to the time elapsed, plaintiffs assert delay in the commencement of ATC operations results from DOH\u2019s purposeful inaction. They seek an order directing DOH to complete background investigations and issue licensure approving or rejecting the remaining three ATCs within thirty days and if one of the original ATCs cannot meet the standards, its application shall be rejected and the next available applicant should be approved to commence operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">DOH opposes the requested relief, arguing it has engaged in \u201cextraordinary work\u201d to make the MMP a reality. DOH identifies the myriad components necessary for licensure and maintains court ordered action is inappropriate because permitting ATCs is highly discretionary and not a mere ministerial act. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">In evaluating whether the requested agency action is ministerial or discretionary, we consider the language of the statute as evincing the Legislature\u2019s intent. We reject plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that ATC licensure is ministerial.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The Act grants DOH discretion to determine the kind and amount of information necessary to process ATC permit applications and evaluate the need for and regulation of ATCs. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-7(a), (b) and (i). The Act further directs DOH \u201cshall issue a permit to a person to operate as an [ATC] if [DOH] finds that issuing such a permit would be consistent with the purposes of this [A]ct and the requirements of this section are met[,]\u201d and \u201cshall approve or deny an application within [sixty] days after receipt of a completed application.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-7(e). \u201c[T]he Act tasks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the Commissioner of [DOH]\u201d with the responsibility to \u201cpromulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purpose of this [A]ct, in consultation with the Department of Law and Public Safety.\u201d <em>Natural Med., supra, </em>428 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 263, 52 A.3d 207 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-16(a)). \u201cIn advance thereof, the Commissioner and the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs are authorized to \u2018take such anticipatory administrative action ... as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this [A]ct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>L. </em>2009, c. 307, \u00a7 19).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">Although use of the term \u201cshall\u201d is generally indicative of the strength of the Legislature\u2019s intent, it has been construed on occasion as directory, suggestive or instructive, rather than imperative, where it relates to the form and manner in which the law is to be carried out and more clearly implements legislative intent. Thus, the ordinary common meaning of \u201cshall\u201d may be overcome by something in the character of the legislation in the context which will justify a different meaning. <em>[Id. </em>at 268, 52 A3d 207 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Only thirteen states allowed the sale of medicinal marijuana prior to adoption of the Act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-2(c). As noted, the details to effectuate New Jersey\u2019s program were required to be formulated by the DOH. The record, although limited, reflects DOH attacked its charge by timely conducted rulemaking to adopt regulations governing the newly created MMP. DOH expeditiously requested and approved six ATC applications. When \u201cconsidered in full,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>24:61-7 \u201cdoes not allow for automatic licensure\u201d of an ATC whose application was approved. <em>Natural Med., supra, 428 N.J.Super. </em>at 268, 52 A.3d 207. Rather, it presents a process, coordinated and overseen by DOH in conjunction with other State agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Not only must the technical requirements of the Act be met and the information contained in the application verified, but an ATC must get ready for business operations, a process ignored or significantly oversimplified by plaintiffs. The non-profit corporations selected as New Jersey\u2019s first ATCs were required to obtain a location, local land-use permits or variances, necessary equipment, inventory, and financing. The ATCs hired professional and non-professional staff, and implemented administrative, production, security, quality control, and distribution procedures. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>needed to fit-out operational space, train personnel, commence growing product, and meet state health, safety, and security inspection standards. Approval of ATC operations requires review and input from other State agencies including the Departments of Law and Public Safety, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-16(a), the State Police, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-4, -7, -13, and the Division of Consumer Affairs, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61 \u2014 4(f)(1); <em>L. </em>2009, c. 307 \u00a7 19, and necessitates municipal inspection and permitting. Some ATCs met opposition by communities wary of such an enterprise being located within its boundaries.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even now it appears two ATCs await requisite site permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The record shows the scope of necessary review represents the fair exercise of judgment and discretion, which is the province of the functioning agency. We cannot conclude from the evidence presented DOH unjustifiably delayed issuing licensure to allow ATC operations to commence. Plaintiffs offer no proof an ATC\u2019s application was fully submitted but ignored by DOH, or that selected ATCs have abandoned moving forward with proposed operation because of barriers erected by the DOH.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Further, plaintiffs\u2019 proposition as framed would require DOH to automatically reject a previously accepted ATC, because it could not open within thirty days. A decision approving an ATC\u2019s operations involves a policy judgment by the agency. <em>See In re Petition of Howell Twp., Monmouth Cnty., </em>371 <em>N. J.Super. </em>167, 188, 852 A.2d 258 (App.Div.2004) (stating the court shall not \u201ccompel a specific form of agency action\u201d but may order \u201ca remedy for arbitrary inaction\u201d). This court may not compel DOH to exercise its discretion in a specific manner with respect to the discretionary agency review granted by the Act. <em>See Loigman, supra, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 299-300, 687 A.2d 1091 (denying manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>mus to compel the Township to exercise its discretion in a specific manner with respect to a disputed provision of a labor agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Although plaintiffs are not satisfied with the pace of ATC openings, we cannot conclude the delay results from DOH\u2019s failure to perform its regulatory responsibilities. Accordingly, we reject as unfounded plaintiffs\u2019 assertion DOH has engaged in arbitrary conduct amounting to an abuse of discretion in authorizing ATC operations. The essence of the relief sought does not encompass performance of \u201ca specific, ministerial action, a set task in terms of mode and manner that leaves no discretion to the official.\u201d <em>Vas, supra, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 523, 14 A.3d 766. Mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Nevertheless, we determine plaintiffs validly question whether DOH has ignored the time elapsed from approval of the initial applications and whether it must examine what period is reasonable for an approved ATC to meet requisites for commencement of operations. Breakwater Alternative Treatment Center does not have a designated location and Harmony Foundation, whose application received the second highest score of the thirty-five filed with the review committee, appears stalled in its progress, making its opening uncertain. We agree with plaintiffs DOH has a responsibility to examine the viability of a prospective ATC\u2019s fulfillment of the requirements to open for business.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">This responsibility is tied to plaintiffs\u2019 request to compel DOH to submit reports to the Legislature and the Governor, as mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61 \u2014 12(a)(1), (2) and (c). DOH admits no formal report has ever been compiled and offers no justification for the delay in completing this task. Instead, the agency seeks to rely on its general public communications and annual report submittal during the legislative budget process. We conclude these communications are insufficient to satisfy the statutory directive. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 request for mandamus on this issue is appropriate and must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Where an agency violates the express policy of its enabling act by violating the clear deadline for agency action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>omission is arbitrary and capricious. <em>Pub. Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 501 A.2d 125 (stating the determination of whether agency action is arbitrary and capricious, allows a court to consider \u201cwhether the agency action violates the enabling act\u2019s express or implied legislative policies\u201d). Further, when an agency\u2019s inaction is unsupported by substantial credible evidence in the record or accompanied by no reasonable explanation \u2014 as is the case here \u2014 we, likewise, may conclude an agency\u2019s inaction is arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. <em>Gilliland v. Bd. of Review, Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>298 <em>N. J.Super. </em>349, 354-55, 689 A.2d 781 (App.Div.1997) (deeming agency action arbitrary and capricious where no explanation is provided to support it).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The Legislature\u2019s desire to assure progress of the MMP is expressed under the Act, which directs DOH \u201cshall report to the Governor and the Legislature ... no later than one year after the effective date of this act, on the actions taken to implement the provisions of this act[,]\u201d and annually thereafter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:61-12(a)(1), (2). The Commissioner also must report findings regarding the sufficiency of the number of ATCs and other issues within two years of the effective date and every two years thereafter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-12(c). We conceive of no reason justifying DOH\u2019s noncompliance with these directives to take finite action within a fixed time period. The conduct required is not discretionary, but involves a ministerial function.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">DOH\u2019s reporting requirement is designed to inform the identified branches of government as well as the public, and to fully explain where the MMP stands on its expected delivery of specified services to patients who need them. Discussion of the current progress and future expectations allows evaluative judgments to be made in keeping with the Act\u2019s identified purposes. The absence of this information has likely led to unfounded assertions, similar to those set forth in plaintiffs\u2019 pleadings, which suggest DOH is unconcerned with and has thwarted the MMP\u2019s development.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Based on the record before us, we find no apparent basis for continued delay in DOH\u2019s compliance with the clear reporting provisions in the Act. Consequently, our intervention is justified. <em>See Howell Twp., supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 187, 852 A.2d 258 (stating the court shall not \u201ccompel a specific form of agency action\u201d but may order \u201ca remedy for arbitrary inaction\u201d). We compel DOH to file the required reports mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-12(a)(l), (2) and (c), addressing the status of the MMP, the viability of the ATC applicants which have yet to open, and whether the number of existing licensed and operating ATCs fully serve the needs of registered medicinal marijuana patients, within forty-five days of the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also challenges DOH\u2019s action, by attacking its rulemaking as ultra vires. They argue DOH \u201cexceeded [its] legislative authority in promulgating regulations so overly restrictive they serve to stifle the [MMP,]\u201d and suggest the regulations are inconsistent with legislative intent. Specifically, plaintiffs rely on the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the concurrent resolution, reported on November 15, 2010 and published on February 22, 2011, as support for the proposition the regulations are inconsistent with the statutory mandate. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">It is well settled, \u201cadministrative agencies derive their authority from legislation,\u201d and an agency may not act \u201cto alter ... [or] to frustrate the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>In re Agrie., Aquacultural &amp; Horticultural Water Usage Certification Rules, </em>410 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 223, 981 A.2d 99 (App.Div.2009) (citations omitted). Article V, section IV, paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution allows the Legislature to review any rule or regulation of an administrative agency to determine whether it is consistent with the intent expressed by the Legislature in the statute. If the Legislature finds the rule or regulation violates the granted authority, it may invalidate or prohibit the adoption of the proposed rule. <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. V, \u00a7 IV, H 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Courts, on the other hand, have \u201ca limited role to play in reviewing the actions of other branches of government\u201d and \u201ccan act only in those rare circumstances when it is clear that the agency action is inconsistent with its legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Williams v. Dep\u2019t. of Human Servs., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>102, 107, 561 A.2d 244 (1989). Appellate \u201creview of agency regulations begins with a presumption that the regulations are both \u2018valid and reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Ass\u2019n of School Adm\u2019rs v.

Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>366, 385, 955 A.2d 886 (2008)). \u201cSuch judicial deference to the administrative interpretation of a statute is even more appropriate \u2018when the case involves the construction of a new statute by its implementing agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freshwater Wetlands Prot.

Accordingly, in our review of challenges to an agency\u2019s exercise of authority, we \u201cmay not substitute [our] judgment for the expertise of an agency \u2018so long as that action is statutorily authorized and not otherwise delective[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 561 A.2d 244 (quoting <em>Dougherty v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 449 A.2d 1235 (1982)). This principle equally applies to policymaking. <em>Dougherty, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 9-11, 449 A.2d 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Finally, our Supreme Court has advised the judiciary that \u201c \u2018an ultra vires finding is disfavored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freshwater Wetlands Prot. Act Rules, supra, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525, 570 A.2d 435 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>(quoting <em>N.J. Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 561, 384 A.2d 795). And, any party challenging a regulation must prove its invalidity. <em>N.J. State League of Municipalities v. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>211, 222, 729 A.2d 21 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">In this matter, in support of their contention, plaintiffs point to the Legislature\u2019s adoption of the concurrent resolution that mandated modification of three rule provisions. Plaintiffs\u2019 brief emphasizes the ten percent THC limit imposed by <em>N.J.AC. </em>8:64 \u2014 10\u2014 6(c)(5) and the physician\u2019s certification required for patient enrollment found at <em>N.J.A.C. </em>8:64-2.5 are illustrative of their contention. Otherwise, they offer no support for the assertion these regulations are ultra vires and \u201cstifling\u201d the MMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">It cannot be ignored that following DOH\u2019s submission of modified rules, the Legislature did not adopt a subsequent proposed concurrent resolution, purporting to invoke the constitutional authority to void rules. The absence of a legislative veto of the remaining regulations suggests deference should be afforded the regulations. <em>Cnty. of Hudson v. State, Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 321, 324, 746 A.2d 5 (App.Div.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">It is also clear that a challenge to an existing regulation as applied must be made to the agency in the first instance. Dr. Pollack has not exhausted available administrative remedies to support his contention the patient certification provisions are onerous and unnecessary. <em>Ortiz v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>406 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 65, 69, 966 A.2d 495 (App.Div.2009) (holding that an appeal may not be maintained where a party fails to exhaust administrative remedies by not exercising a statutory right to an administrative appeal). The challenge to the limitation is accompanied by no support. Based on our review, the request must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Plaintiffs also claim the regulations are unconstitutional. We need not address this assertion because no legal arguments are offered to support the contention, aside from identifying the concurrent resolutions. As noted, the concurrent resolutions targeted three regulations for modification. In this light, we deem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the entirety of the regulatory scheme is unsupported. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 final request seeks appointment of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana of New Jersey as a \u201cneutral third party\u201d to monitor DOH\u2019s compliance with the Act and the implementation of the MMP. We also reject this application. As discussed in our opinion, other than its omission of required progress reports, we do not agree DOH has ignored its responsibilities or refused to comply with the legislative mandate to implement the MMP. The need for a third-party monitor is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In summary, DOH shall render its status report to the Legislature and Governor as mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:6I-12(a)(l), (2) and (c) within forty-five days of the date of this opinion.
