Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 323, 878 A.2d 16 (App.Div. 2005). Petitioner R.S. appeals from a final agency decision of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (Division) finding that the community spouse monthly income allowance (CSMIA) for his wife, D.S., should be calculated in accordance with 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B) and <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-5.7(e), rather than pursuant to a separate maintenance order entered by the Family Part. Following our review, we conclude the Division, when determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s obligation for his nursing home care, is not bound to abide by the terms of a Family Part non-dissolution separate maintenance order, entered in a non-contested proceeding, without notice to the Division, because the Order was designed to circumvent the regulations governing the CSMIA. We affirm, concluding the Order \u201ctransgressed the permissible limits of Medicaid planning[.]\u201d <em>H.K, supra </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 323, 878 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">R.S. and D.S. were married on September 9, 1978. As a result of physical and mental ailments, R.S. began residing at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Kessler Rehabilitation Center on November 1, 2010. Thereafter, R.S. moved to the Cornell Hall Nursing and Rehabilitation Center for further rehabilitation and long-term custodial care, which he will require for the rest of his life. Since November 1, 2010, R.S. and D.S. have been living separately, with D.S. continuing to reside in the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On November 4, 2010, D.S. filed a complaint for separate maintenance wherein she requested a judgment compelling R.S. to pay her support equaling the amount of R.S.\u2019s Social Security income, asserting R.S.\u2019s income is necessary for D.S. \u201cto meet her basic expenses to remain in the marital home ... [and] maintain a reasonable approximation of the marital standard of living enjoyed prior to the separation of the parties.\u201d In the complaint, D.S. claimed R.S. had \u201cseparated himself from [D.S.] and ha[d] refused and neglected to support [D.S.] within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-24.\u201d D.S. attached to her complaint a Family Part case information statement (CIS) detailing her income, expenses, assets and liabilities, in which she disclosed she was employed and earning an annual salary of $22,679.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">On November 24, 2010, R.S.\u2019s attorney accepted service of the complaint. Neither the Union County Board of Social Services (Board) nor the Division received notice of the Family Part proceedings, even though D.S.\u2019s complaint stated she was \u201cabout to file a[n] application for ... Medicaid benefits pursuant <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D <em>et seq. </em>and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71 <em>et seq.\u201d </em>on R.S.\u2019s behalf, and further alleged that R.S. \u201cmeets the financial and medical criteria for eligibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">R.S. did not oppose his wife\u2019s action nor is there evidence a hearing was held. An order issued by the court on December 10, 2010 required R.S. to pay D.S. \u201can amount equal to [R.S.\u2019s] net Social Security benefit; that is, after the deduction of the Medicare premium, supplemental insurance premium and the Medicaid \u2018Personal Needs Allowance,\u2019 for her support.\u201d The order was retroactive to November 2010. Because D.S. inadvertently omitted income R.S. received from a worker\u2019s compensation award, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>March 30, 2011, the judge issued an amended order (the Order) including this additional income as part of R.S.\u2019s support obligation. Therefore, the Order required R.S. to pay D.S. $3460.20 per month in spousal support, consisting of his monthly social security and worker\u2019s compensation income benefits, less the designated offsets for R.S.\u2019s personal allowance and health insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">On May 12, 2011, the Board received a Medicaid application for R.S.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 20, 2011, the Board determined R.S. eligible for Medicaid as a \u201cmedically needy\u201d recipient, effective April 1, 2011. The Board did not recognize the Order in its \u201cStatement of Available Income for Medicaid Payment.\u201d Rather, the Board decided, D.S. was entitled to a CSMIA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of $1514.93 per month, allowing her to meet her minimum monthly maintenance needs amount (MMMNA), as calculated pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">R.S. appealed the Board\u2019s determination at a hearing before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL), claiming that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(f) required the allocation of R.S.\u2019s income consistent with the Order rather than in accordance with the CSMIA calculated by the Board. R.S. further sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, alleging the Board\u2019s findings, as adopted by the Division, denied his rights under federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Administrative Law Judge Caridad Rigo (ALJ) rejected R.S.\u2019s contentions in an initial decision issued on April 5, 2012. The ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>noted the Board was not provided notice of the Family Part proceedings nor did it have an opportunity to be heard; further, \u201cthe issue in Superior Court was not the community spousal support in relation to Medicaid[,] but rather spousal support in relation to the Family Law statutes and regulations.\u201d Relying on <em>H.K., </em>Judge Rigo found the appeal represented an attempt to use a support order \u201cto circumvent the Medicaid regulations concerning ... spousal allowance[,]\u201d and concluded \u201cthis case does not exhibit the requisite medical and financial duress or any exceptional circumstances where an increase of spousal maintenance allowance is required [or] justified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On July 2, 2012, the Division adopted the ALJ\u2019s decision agreeing D.S.\u2019s \u201cordinary and regular expenses\u201d did not meet the \u201cexceptional circumstances threshold\u201d required for an increase in the CSMIA, pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B). In declining to give effect to the amended support order, the Division noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">A review of the record indicates that the wife\u2019s action in family court was not adversarial and was chosen to avoid following the Medicaid spousal impoverishment rules so as to \u201cprotect\u201d income for her monthly expenses such as: $150 for hair care or $1,800 yearly; ... $50 for unspecified contributions or $600 a year; $100 for life insurance or $1,200 a year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">After reviewing the legislative history of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(5), the Division emphasized that R.S.\u2019s wife \u201chas not claimed any \u2018special circumstances\u2019 in this matter or before the family court\u201d that would warrant enforcement of the amended support order. Appellant appeals from this final agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, the Medicaid program is a joint federal-state program in which the federal government provides \u201cfinancial assistance to states that choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons.\u201d <em>Harris v. McRae, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>297, 301, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2671, 2680, 65 L.Ed.2d 784, 794 (1980); <em>see also </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396. Simply put, Medicaid \u201cprovidefs] medical assistance to the poor at the expense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of the public.\u201d <em>Mistrick v. Div. of Med.

Although participation is optional, states that do participate must adhere to the requirements of Title XIX. <em>Harris, supra, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>at 301, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2680, 65 L.Ed.2d at 794. Participating states must develop a plan including \u201c \u2018reasonable standards ... for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance ... [that is] consistent with the objectives\u2019 of the Medicaid program.\u201d <em>L.M. v. Div. of Med.

The Division is the \u201c\u2018single [s]tate agency\u2019 responsible for administering New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid program.\u201d <em>In re AN., </em>430 <em>N.

In administering New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid program, the Division has promulgated comprehensive regulations delineating the program\u2019s scope and procedures. <em>See, e.g., N.J AC. </em>10:71-2.1 to -2.16 (establishing application process); <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-3.1 to -3.16 (establishing eligibility factors). County welfare agencies, such as the Board, \u201cassist [the Division] in processing applications for Medicaid and determining whether applicants have met the income and resource eligibility standards.\u201d <em>Cleary v. Waldman, </em>959 <em>F.Supp. </em>222, 229 (D.N.J.1997), <em>affd, </em>167 A.3d 801 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>870, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>170, 145 L.Ed.2d 144 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Among the objectives of Medicaid is to \u201cprovide[] medical assistance to needy persons who are institutionalized in nursing homes as a result of illness or other incapacity.\u201d <em>M.E.F. v. A.B.F., </em>393 <em>N. J.Super. </em>543, 545, 925 A.2d 12 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>479, 932 A.2d 29 (2007). Before 1988, couples would \u201cspend down\u201d their assets so an institutionalized spouse could qualify for Medicaid assistance to defray the cost of his or her care. <em>Ibid. </em>This practice often rendered the spouses who remained in the community impoverished. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In response to this trend, Congress incorporated \u201cspousal impoverishment provisions\u201d in the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (MCCA). 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(a) to (h). Generally, Medicaid-eligible individuals pay part of the cost of their care and \u201cthe remainder is paid by the State and Federal governments through Medicaid.\u201d <em>H.K., supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324 n. 2, 878 A.2d 16 (quoting <em>H.R. Rep. </em>No. 100-105(11), at 66 (1987), <em>reprinted in </em>1988 <em>U.S.C.C.A.N. </em>857, 899 (1987)). Furthermore, these provisions provide that certain allowances must be made from the institutional spouse\u2019s income before determining how much of the monthly income is applied to the cost of care in the institution. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d). One such allowance is made for the CSMIA. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(l)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The CSMIA is \u201cthe amount by which the community spouse\u2019s needs in the form of a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance (MMMNA), established by each state in compliance with federal standards, exceeds the community\u2019s spouse\u2019s income.\u201d <em>M.E.F., supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 546, 925 A.2d 12 (citing 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(2)-(3)). \u201cThe provision for this allowance ensures that income transferred from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse to meet the latter\u2019s basic needs is not also considered available for the former\u2019s care.\u201d <em>Wis. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Family Servs. v. Blumer, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>473, 482, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>962, 968, 151 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 935, 945 (2002). Consequently, Medicaid pays a greater share of the institutionalized spouse\u2019s costs of care than it would without the CSMIA provisions. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The MCCA also revises the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance by providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">If either such spouse establishes that the community spouse needs income, above the level otherwise provided by the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, due to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial duress, there shall be substituted, for the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance in subsection (d)(2)(A) of this section, an amount adequate to provide such additional income as is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">[42 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Pursuant to its grant of authority in the Act, the Division issued parallel regulations. The State\u2019s CSMIA regulation reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">There shall be deducted from the institutionalized individual\u2019s income an amount for the maintenance of the community spouse. Except as specifically provided below, the deduction for the maintenance of the community spouse shall not exceed $1,821.25 per month____In arriving at the amount that may be deducted for the maintenance of the community spouse, the deductions authorized by this section shall be reduced by the gross income of the community spouse. The community spouse deduction is authorized only to the extent that the income deducted is actually made available to (or for the benefit of) the community spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">Similar to the federal statute, the New Jersey regulations provide for a fair hearing to contest a determination of the deduction. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-5.7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Both the MCCA and the New Jersey regulations allow for recognition of court orders for spousal support in determining the CSMIA. Further, the MCCA provides \u201c[i]f a court has entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for monthly income for the support of the community spouse, the community spouse monthly income allowance for the spouse shall be not less than the amount of the monthly income so ordered.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(5). The analogous New Jersey regulation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-13\">If a court has entered an order against an institutionalized spouse for monthly income for the support of a community spouse and the amount of the order is greater than the amount of the community spouse deduction, the amount so ordered shall be used in place of the community spouse deduction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-14\"><em>[N.J.AC. </em>10:71-5.7\u00ae.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-15\">Guided by the applicable legislation, we note our review of administrative agency decisions is limited. <em>Karins v.

We reject this argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ment. Not only does R.S.\u2019s rigid construction ignore the context of the Medicaid Program provisions he seeks to apply, but also abrogates the well-defined policies of the program and would lead to an absurd result. We conclude the Division\u2019s determination declining to follow the Order was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The first issue is one of statutory construction. R.S. argues for a strict application of the canons of statutory interpretation, contending the Board and the Division disregarded the mandatory language of 42 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1396r-5(d)(5) and <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-5.7(f). R.S. contends the regulations\u2019 plain language directs the Order to control the Board\u2019s review. Such a crabbed construction cannot stand as it abrogates the clear intent and purpose of the statute and obviates the Division\u2019s role in safeguarding limited Medicaid resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Our Court has emphasized repeatedly \u201cwhen interpreting an enabling statute or any other law, a court\u2019s obligation is to determine and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>N.J.

The New Jersey Supreme Court reviewed the legislative history of the \u201cspousal impoverishment\u201d provisions of the MCCA and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">Those provisions were intended to end the pauperization of the community spouse by allowing that spouse to protect a sufficient, but not excessive, amount of income and resources to meet his or her own needs while the institutionalized spouse was in a nursing home at Medicaid expense. Congress also recognized that because the allocation of resources depended wholly on whether a resource was in the name of one spouse or the other, couples could shelter their resources in the name of the community spouse while the institutionalized spouse would receive Medicaid coverage. MCCA closed this loophole by considering a couple\u2019s resources in their entirety, regardless of the name in which the resources were held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\"><em>[Mist/rick, </em>supra&gt; 154 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 712 A.2d 188 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Congress enacted the MCCA to \u201cassure that the community spouse ... has income and resources sufficient to live with independence and dignity.\u201d <em>M.E.F., supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 552-53, 925 A.2d 12 (quoting <em>H.R.

Finally, this concern for community spouses is reflected in 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B), which allows for an adjustment of the MMMNA \u201cdue to exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial distress[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We conclude the Division\u2019s decision comports with the legislative policies. The decision is consistent with the broad federal and state goals of preventing the impoverishment of community spouses, while ensuring limited Medicaid resources are allocated prudently among those most in need.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">In <em>H.K., supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 323-26, 878 A.2d 16, we affirmed a Division decision refusing to give effect to a support order obtained in a divorce from a \u201cbed and board\u201d proceeding, entered after the institutionalized spouse applied for Medicaid. This court concluded the agency\u2019s decision was \u201cconsistent with the language and purpose of the Medicaid statute,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 327, 878 A.2d 16, and noted holding otherwise would invite collusive agreements to divert an institutionalized spouse\u2019s income to the community spouse in a manner contrary to the intent underlying Medicaid. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Estate of G.E. v.

As the Federal District Court for the District of New Jersey observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">The Medicaid Act contains complex, interrelated provisions, and it would be foolhardy to impute a plain meaning to any of its provisions in isolation. A statute must be read as a whole; words depend upon context; they have only a communal existence; and not only does the meaning of such interpenetrate the other, but all in their aggregate take their purport from the setting in which they are used. <em>[Cleary, supra, </em>959 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 228-29 (internal quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">R.S. next contends the agency\u2019s decision was unsupported and must be set aside. In considering whether a reviewing \u201ccourt owes substantial deference to the agency\u2019s expertise and superior knowledge of a particular field[,]\u201d a key inquiry is \u201cwhether the record contains substantial evidence to support the findings on which the agency based its action.\u201d <em>Herrmann, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 926 A.2d 350 (citation omitted). As demonstrated by our review of the statutory context and legislative history, the claimed \u201cplain language\u201d reading suggested by R.S. is unfounded. <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 404, 22 A.3d 1 (App.Div.2011) (quoting <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. 477, </em>493, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)) (\u201cA reviewing court \u2018may also resort to extrinsic evidence if a plain reading of the statute leads to an absurd result or if the overall statutory scheme is at odds with the plain language.\u2019 \u201d). As noted in <em>H.K., </em>an interpretation of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7\u00a9 \u201cpermitfting] a community spouse to obtain an unlimited increase in the spousal allowance by obtaining a court order for support ... would nullify the statutory and regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>limitations on the community spouse allowance.\u201d <em>H.K., supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 328, 878 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The Division\u2019s findings are supported by calculations of R.S. and D.S.\u2019s income and expenses, and its decision is further supported by R.S.\u2019s failure to allege any special circumstances necessitating enforcement of the Order. Moreover, strict enforcement of the amended support order would produce the absurd result of providing D.S. with a monthly spousal allowance $1945.27 greater than her MMMNA, while depleting the limited resources available to provide for other individuals in need. We conclude the record supports the Division\u2019s adoption of the Board\u2019s sound methodology, which is consistent with the policies of New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid program, specifically, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(c) (providing for calculation of CSMIA) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(e) (providing for an increase in CSMIA upon demonstration of exceptional circumstances resulting in financial distress). Using D.S.\u2019s actual shelter costs, including a mortgage of $2320 per month, and other preset standards, the Board determined D.S.\u2019s MMMNA (labeled \u201ctotal community deduction standard\u201d on the community spouse deduction worksheet) to be $3972.19. The Board then subtracted $2457.26, D.S.\u2019s monthly total gross income, to calculate her CSMIA as $1514.93.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(c) and <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(3), the Board determined that this \u201ctotal community deduction\u201d (the CSMIA) would be deducted from R.S.\u2019s total monthly income of $3597.27. After accounting for minor deductions including the personal needs allowance ($35.00) and health insurance premiums ($102.07), R.S.\u2019s remaining monthly income, totaling $1945.27, would be paid toward the costs of his care. If the March 2011 award were given effect, that $1945.27 would have been paid to D.S., making her net monthly income $5917.46 (comprised of all of her earned income and almost all of R.S.\u2019s unearned income). To give effect to the amended support order would cause the CSMIA for D.S. to more than double, despite the absence of exceptional circumstances resulting in financial duress. Such a result demon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>states the arbitrariness of isolating the language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(f), as R.S. contends. Indeed, the obvious intent of the Order was to maintain D.S.\u2019s lifestyle prior to R.S.\u2019s institutionalization at the expense of the Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">R.S. asserts that we should defer to the Order citing the Appellate Division\u2019s deference to the special expertise of the Family Part in dealing with family matters. However, this argument is inappropriately broad. Rather, in our review of a trial court\u2019s order, we grant substantial deference to the trial court\u2019s findings of facts following a hearing in which the court is able to assess the evidence. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-413, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). This deference is specifically appropriate when the trial court \u201chears the case, sees and observes the witnesses, [and] hears them testify,\u201d because \u201cit has a better perspective than a reviewing court in evaluating the veracity of witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Pascale v. Pascale, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>20, 33, 549 A.2d 782 (1988)). Further, the Court has held that \u201can appellate court should not disturb the \u2018factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial judge unless [it is] convinced that they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In this case, the Family Part Judge did not hold a fact-finding hearing to which we owe deference. The Order was not supported by \u201cadequate, substantial, credible evidence[;]\u201d rather, the evidence presented does not support the Order and thus, we need not defer to the Order. Moreover, the incongruity between the regulatory CSMIA calculations and those factors considered by the Family Part in awarding support orders further demonstrates the potential for an absurd result in applying the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>language of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(f). While the MCCA provisions on the whole focus on preventing the pauperization of community spouses, the family courts have latitude to contemplate factors that are irrelevant in calculation of CSMIA, such as \u201c[t]he standard of living established in the marriage or civil union and the likelihood that each party can maintain a reasonably comparable standard of living.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Here, the record clearly indicates the Order was entered to allow for the payment of all of D.S.\u2019s living expenses, including monthly expenses of $150 for hair care, $100 for life insurance, and $50 for unspecified contributions. Diverting income toward payment of these expenses reflects a paradigm of maintaining a spouse\u2019s lifestyle, rather than the more modest goal of ensuring personal needs. As noted by the Division, the difference would be at the taxpayer\u2019s expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The record also contains substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s treatment of R.S.\u2019s income. R.S. attempts to limit relevant evidence to the proceedings in the Family Part, including D.S.\u2019s complaint and CIS, and the two support orders. Because agency discretion must accord with express and implied legislative policies, the Division was not required to divert all income to a community spouse without considering whether there are \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranting the payment. Additionally, R.S.\u2019s own application for medical assistance, the Board\u2019s eligibility decision, and the community spouse deduction worksheet are all relevant in determining the post-eligibility treatment of his income; without these forms, R.S. would not be deemed eligible for Medicaid in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We also address R.S.\u2019s argument the ALJ and the Division improperly undertook an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d analysis. However, R.S. sought relief in a letter dated September 21, 2011, specifically requesting a \u201cFair Hearing\u201d pursuant to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(e), which allows for a fair hearing to determine whether an increase is warranted due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Therefore, the appropriate standard was applied according to R.S.\u2019s requested relief. However, we will still address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Our review asks \u201cwhether, in applying the legislative policies to the facts, the agency clearly erred by reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably have been made upon a showing of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>H.K., supra, </em>379 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 327, 878 A.2d 16 (quoting <em>Pub. Serv. Elec., supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 501 A.2d 125). The Division relied on the factual findings of the ALJ which appropriately considered R.S.\u2019s financial information submitted to calculate the CSMIA in accordance with <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-5.7(c) and <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The record clearly supports the Board\u2019s calculation of D.S.\u2019s CSMIA and accordingly, the primary question at the fair hearing, and in the Division\u2019s subsequent review of the hearing, was whether or not D.S. was entitled to a revision of her CSMIA based upon \u201cexceptional circumstances resulting in financial duress[.]\u201d <em>N.J AC. </em>10:71-5.7(e). Relying on the contents of the record, the ALJ found that R.S. had averred no such circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">D.S. does not qualify for an increase in the community spouse monthly maintenance allowance based on exceptional circumstances. D.S. does not claim any modical/physieal impairments of her own. She is gainfully employed. There is no showing that the community spouse needs specialized medical care or attention. The instant case does not involve the type of long-term health and financial problems as contemplated in the term \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d In sum, D.S. has not demonstrated the requisite level of significant financial duress to justify an increase above the $1,514.93 she has already received from the respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">After reviewing all documents in the record, including those submitted to the Family Part, the Division similarly found that D.S.\u2019s CSMIA should not be increased to cover her \u201cordinary and regular expenses.\u201d The Director further found \u201cinteresting[] [that] even without her husband in the household, her monthly expenses remain nearly the same ($5,827 vs. $5,651).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This meager $176 decrease in monthly expenses upon institutionalization of R.S. reasonably led to the skepticism of the Division in considering D.S.\u2019s calculations concerning her expenses. In re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>viewing the record for any possible \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d the Division recognized the credit card debt of R.S. may warrant an increase in income for D.S. \u201cdepending on the circumstances such as when and how the charges were incurred and if the expenses were charged for the couple\u2019s sole use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Considering the foregoing in light of the implied and express legislative policies and legislative history discussed above, the Director\u2019s decision was well-reasoned and made in reliance on relevant guiding principles and a sufficient factual record. To conclude, the Division\u2019s decision was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, having passed muster under the three-pronged test.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">R.S. makes additional arguments, also rejected by the Division, which we find lack sufficient merit to warrant extensive discussion. R.S. asserts that the Division engaged in improper rule-making by imposing an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d criterion for post-eligibility treatment of a recipient\u2019s income and by imposing a requirement that R.S. give \u201cnotice\u201d to Medicaid on the support action. This argument lacks merit. In <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 330-31, 478 A.2d 742 (1984), the Supreme Court held, for due process reasons, that an administrative agency must conduct formal rulemaking before imposing new standards upon those it regulates. Six factors guide our analysis of when such formal rulemaking is necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">(1) [the decision] is intended to have wide coverage encompassing a large segment of the regulated or general public, rather than an individual or a narrow select group; (2) is intended to be applied generally and uniformly to all similarly situated persons; (3) is designed to operate only in future cases, that is, prospectively; (4) prescribes a legal standard or directive that is not otherwise expressly provided by or clearly and obviously inferable from the enabling statutory authorization; (5) reflects an administrative policy that (i) was not previously expressed in any official and explicit agency determination, adjudication or rule, or (ii) constitutes a material and significant change from a clear, past agency position on the identical subject matter; and (6) reflects a decision on administrative regulatory policy in the nature of the interpretation of law or general policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 381, 478 A.2d 742.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>These factors, \u201ceither singly or in combination,\u201d determine whether agency action amounts to the promulgation of an administrative rule. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 478 A.2d 742. Having considered each of the six enumerated <em>Metromedia </em>factors, we are satisfied that the decision to apply an \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d criterion for post-eligibility treatment of a recipient\u2019s income was an unassailable exercise of the agency\u2019s pre-existing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">R.S.\u2019s argument is based on a misreading of the administrative decisions of the ALJ adopted by the Division. In her decision, Judge Rigo referred to the language of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B), which expressly allows for revision of the MMMNA \u201cin exceptional circumstances resulting in significant financial distress,\u201d and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5(e), which allows for revision if the community spouse or recipient establishes at a fair hearing that \u201cexceptional circumstances resulting in financial duress\u201d exist. Relying on the record and the express language of the Medicaid law and regulations, Judge Rigo concluded an increase in the MMMNA was not warranted. This was not rule-making, but the application of the criterion already established in 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(B) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Next, regarding the alleged creation of a \u201cnotice\u201d requirement, when Judge Rigo considered the Order, she noted that the Board had not been provided notice or an opportunity to be heard. Judge Rigo did not, however, adopt a rule; rather, she analogized the facts of this case to those of <em>H.K., </em>ultimately concluding, based on the record, that R.S.\u2019s \u201cobtaining the court order was an attempt to circumvent the Medicaid regulations concerning the levels of spousal allowance.\u201d Similarly, in its final agency decision, the Division adopts this finding, noting \u201c[njeither [R.S.] nor his wife appears to have informed the court of the true ramifications of the support order on Medicaid[.]\u201d Although this was a circumstance relevant to the Division in deciding not to give effect to the amended support order, it did not amount to formulating a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Furthermore, R.S. further contends that the outcome of this appeal is controlled by our decision in <em>M.E.F., supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 548, 925 A.2d 12. In <em>M.E.F., </em>the community spouse who \u201creceived $576 per month from Social Security as her sole source of independent income,\u201d was allocated a community spouse allowance of approximately $445 upon a determination of her institutionalized spouse\u2019s Medicaid eligibility. <em>Id. </em>at 548, 925 A 2d 12. Dissatisfied with this amount, the community spouse sought relief from the Family Part in the form of separate maintenance, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-24. <em>Id. </em>at 548-49, 925 A.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">At issue was whether the administrative hearing and the Family Part constitute alternative avenues to seek relief from the determination of an allegedly inadequate CSMIA, as well as what standard applied in such a review. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 549-51, 925 A.2d 12. We reached our decision on procedural grounds, reasoning that \u201cM.E.F.\u2019s effort to obtain [a support] order, perfected only after her MMMNA had been reconsidered and increased, albeit not to her satisfaction, constituted parallel litigation and a form of forum shopping of a sort that we are unwilling to recognize as valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557, 925 A.2d 12. We added that the \u201cpresent appeal does not require [a] decisive construction of the effect of the court ordered support provision[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">An award of support entered against an institutionalized spouse prior to Medicaid eligibility would clearly be governed by the standards articulated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23. We see no principled reason why those standards would change simply because the spouse was found to be eligible for Medicaid and subject to the spousal income protection provisions of the Act. We do note, however, that the standards for calculating support, set forth in N.J.S.A 2A:34-23, permit consideration of spousal \u201cactual need,\u201d ability to pay, and \u201c[a]ny other factors which the court may deem relevant.\u201d N.J.S.A 2A:34r-23b(l) and (13). The dual purposes of the MCCA \u2014 to ensure that the community spouse has sufficient, but not excessive, income and to ensure that individuals not be permitted to avoid payment of then-own fail- share for long-term care \u2014 are certainly relevant considerations in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\"><em>Ud. </em>at 557-58, 925 A.2d 12.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Thus, we were concerned with preserving the standards of the family proceedings and ensuring that such proceedings consider the goals of the Medicaid program when relief is sought by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>community spouse. <em>Ibid. </em>While this quote regards the standard to be applied in Family Court proceedings, it envisions a flexibility that should be extended to the Division to allow for deviations from the statutorily calculated MMMNA where the circumstances warrant special consideration. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">R.S. next asserts the \u201cforum shopping\u201d found in <em>M.E.F., supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 557, 925 A.2d 12, is absent here, since D.S. obtained her support order prior to R.S.\u2019s Medicaid application; however, <em>M.E.F. </em>is otherwise distinguishable. There, the community spouse\u2019s sole source of independent income was monthly payments of $545 from Social Security. <em>Id. </em>at 548, 925 A.2d 12. In contrast, D.S. earns $2457.26 in monthly income. Importantly, there was a hearing held by the Family Part in <em>M.E.F., </em>as opposed to the record here, which indicates an uncontested application decided on the papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We find <em>H.K., supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 878 A.2d 16, more on point. There, an institutionalized spouse qualified for Medicaid \u201ceven though he had Social Security and pension income of approximately $4,500 per month and his wife worked full-time and earned over $2,000 per month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 878 <em>A.</em>2d 16. Because the community spouse\u2019s monthly income was too high to entitle her to an allowance, the couple \u201cattempted to invoke the \u2018court order\u2019 exception of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71 \u2014 5.7(f), by obtaining a divorce from \u2018bed and board\u2019 with a property settlement agreement providing for support to be paid to [the community spouse] from the [institutionalized spouse\u2019s] pension.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325-26, 878 A.2d 16. The Division adopted the decision of the ALJ not to give effect to the court-ordered spousal support obligation, reasoning that \u201cgiving effect to the divorce judgment would be contrary to the purpose and intent of the [MCCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 878 A.2d 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">We agreed, reasoning that, \u201cgiven the facts of [the] case, the agency\u2019s decision is consistent with the language and purpose of the Medicaid statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 878 A.2d 16. Additionally, accepting the petitioner\u2019s position in that case \u201cwould nullify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>statutory and regulatory limitations on the community spouse allowance[,]\u201d thereby yielding an \u201cabsurd result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 878 A.2d 16. We further stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEP\">[t]his is not a situation where a court has held an evidentiary proceeding and determined independently that the community spouse is in need of support or that she has \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d Nor was the court that entered the order even notified that [the institutionalized spouse] was receiving Medicaid benefits. This is also not a case where there was an existing support obligation that pre-dated the Medicaid application and was entered at a time when such application was not anticipated. Rather, the property settlement agreement in this case was an undisguised attempt to circumvent the Medicaid regulations concerning the appropriate level of spousal allowance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 329, 878 A.2d 16.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Supporting this conclusion was our observation that the proceeding in the Family Part in <em>H.K. </em>was not \u201cgenuinely adversarial\u201d because the State Medicaid program had not been provided notice; further, \u201cno factual record was made to support the alimony award, and the court that entered the order did not determine whether the award was justified in light of the countervailing interests of the State[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329-30, 878 A.2d 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The record here similarly lacks any evidence that R.S. contested D.S.\u2019s allegations or computations of financial needs asserted in her complaint. Because R.S. did not file any opposition to D.S.\u2019s application, the entire record in the Family Part proceeding consisted of D.S.\u2019s verified complaint and CIS, the acknowledgment of service, and two orders. In sum, as the Division noted, \u201c[a] review of the record indicates that the wife\u2019s action in family court was not adversarial and was chosen to avoid following the Medicaid spousal impoverishment rulesf.]\u201d \u201cGenerally, an appellate court does not substitute its judgment of the facts for that of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Campbell v. N.J. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>579, 587, 781 A.2d 1035 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">These circumstances raise the concern noted in <em>H.K. </em>and echoed in the final agency decision that spouses may collude and use support orders \u201cto circumvent the Medicaid regulations concerning the appropriate level of the spousal allowance.\u201d <em>H.K, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329, 878 A.2d 16. As the Division noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The instant matter shows how one couple could obtain legal counsel to seek judicial fiat to circumvent the spousal impoverishment rules .... [y]et another couple, without income or wherewithal to hire counsel, would have to abide by the statutory calculation and the statutory remedy to have additional income set aside for the community spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">In light of the substantial deference afforded agency decisions, the express and implied legislative policies underlying Medicaid, and the circumstances of this case, we affirm the Division\u2019s approval of D.S.\u2019s CSMIA determined in accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-5.7(c) and 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">R.S. finally claims entitlement to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1988, alleging the Division\u2019s refusal to enforce the amended support order amounted to an arbitrary and capricious violation of established law and his civil rights. Because R.S. failed to prevail on any issue in the litigation, his claim for attorney\u2019s fees clearly lacks merit. <em>See Singer v.
