Subject to certain exceptions that do not apply here, the statute bars employers seeking to fill job vacancies in this State from purposefully or knowingly publishing advertisements stating that job applicants must be currently employed in order for their applications to be accepted, considered, or reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Appellants are a New Jersey company and its chief executive officer. Seeking to fill a job vacancy, they admittedly posted a newspaper ad containing such prohibited language shortly after the law became effective. Appellants were consequently fined by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) pursuant to the statute and its implementing regulations. In contesting that fine, appellants contend that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 improperly infringes upon their rights of free speech, in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Paragraph 6 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reject appellants\u2019 claims of unconstitutionality. Applying the well-established test for evaluating content-based restrictions on commercial speech set forth in <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>557, 561, 100 <em>S.Ct </em>2343, 2349, 65 L.Ed.2d 341, 348 (1980), we conclude that the statute is narrowly tailored to advance a limited, but nevertheless substantial, governmental objective in maximizing the opportunities for unemployed workers to have their qualifications presented to prospective employers. The modest restrictions that the State has placed upon job advertising under the statute are constitutionally valid, even though employers might not consider or ultimately hire most of the unemployed applicants who respond to such job postings.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">We therefore affirm the Department\u2019s enforcement of the statute and its finding of a violation. However, we remand the matter to the agency for reconsideration of appellants\u2019 fine, in light of the distinctive circumstances presented by this precedential litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The parties have stipulated to the relevant facts. Appellants are Crest Ultrasonics (\u201cCrest\u201d), a New Jersey corporation that manufactures and distributes ultrasonic precision cleaning equipment, and its chief executive officer, J. Michael Goodson. The company needed to replace its Service Manager<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at its facility in Ewing, an employee who had served in that position for over twenty years. Appellants regarded the vacant position as one that \u201crequires technical knowledge that is both current and up to date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">After several unsuccessful attempts to fill the position, appellants placed an employment advertisement in the classified section of the <em>Burlington County Times. </em>The short text of the ad, which appeared in the newspaper on August 31, 2011, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVH\">SERVICE MANAGER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXj\">65K-75K. <em>Must be currently employed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">Technically competent. Customer Friendly</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">CREST ULTRASONICS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGj\">EWING TWP, NJ</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9q\">HR@erest-ultrasomes.com</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">That same day, an individual<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> placed a phone call to the Department to report concerns about the ad. The individual followed up with a letter, asking the Department \u201cif it is legal to place an ad in the unemployment section of the newspaper that as a condition of applying for a position you must be currently employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>In response to the citizen\u2019s complaint, the Department assigned an investigator to review the circumstances. The investigator twice visited appellants\u2019 offices, reviewing various payroll and other company records.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">After the investigation was completed, the Department sent Crest and Goodson a letter notifying them of its determination that their ad violated <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1, and that they were consequently being fined $1,000 pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8B-2. The letter advised appellants that they could contest the assessed fine by detaching and returning a form enclosed with the notice letter within sixteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The Department subsequently issued an administrative order reiterating the $1,000 penalty against appellants, noting that they had failed to respond to the earlier notice. Appellants then filed an administrative appeal -with the Department, asserting that the fine was improper because \u201cthe law <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1] is unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The parties\u2019 counsel thereafter jointly developed and agreed upon a stipulation of facts. The stipulation consisted of nineteen paragraphs, including a final paragraph which stated that the parties had agreed that the facts recited therein, along with various specified exhibits, would \u201cserve as the \u2018written record\u2019 pursuant to <em>N.J AC. </em>12:67-1.5<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so the matter may proceed to the Commissioner [of the Department] for a Final Administrative decision.\u201d The parties chose this route in order to \u201celiminate[ ] the cost and delay associated with transmitting the case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Office of Administrative Law when there existed no necessity for fact-finding, and the only issue was the constitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The Commissioner subsequently issued a final administrative decision on August 17, 2012, upholding the $1,000 penalty assessed against appellants. The Commissioner expressly declined to address appellants\u2019 contention that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 is unconstitutional. On that subject, the Commissioner noted that \u201cthe final responsibility to pass upon the constitutionality of a given piece of legislation rests in the courts,\u201d adding that \u201cit is the duty of the various [Sjtate agencies and administrative bodies to accept a legislative act as constitutional until such time as it has been declared to be unconstitutional by a qualified judicial body.\u201d Hence, the Commissioner stated that he had based his decision to uphold the $1,000 fine \u201csolely upon the stipulated facts and attached exhibits, which together comprise the record in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">This appeal ensued. Fundamentally, appellants maintain that the statute\u2019s prohibitions are improper content-based infringements upon their rights of free speech under the federal and state constitutions. They also allege violations of due process and other constitutional principles. The Department counters that the statute promotes legitimate and significant governmental interests, and that it has been crafted in a measured fashion that does not unduly infringe upon the expressive freedoms of employers or other constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1, and the companion penalty provision in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-2, were enacted into law in March 2011. They became effective on June 1, 2011. The statute has its genesis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>A-3359, a bill which was introduced in October 2010.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>N.J. State Law Library, <em>Legislative History Checklist to N.J.S.A. 34,:8B-1</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The bill was approved by the Assembly Labor Committee on October 14, 2010, and initially passed the full Assembly later that same month. The provision was also approved by the Senate Labor Committee and a subsequent vote of the full Senate in November 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The bill was conditionally vetoed by Governor Chris Christie on January 11, 2011. <em>See Governor\u2019s Conditional Veto to Assembly Bill No. 3359 </em>(Jan. 11, 2011). In his veto message, Governor Christie stated that he \u201cshare[d] the sponsors\u2019 interest in removing barriers to employment for people who are actively seeking work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1. However, he noted that \u201cthe bill, as currently drafted, is vague and confusing.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Governor Christie accordingly recommended twelve proposed changes to the bill.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3-5. All twelve of Governor Christie\u2019s proposed amendments were thereafter adopted by the Legislature without alteration. Subsequently, the final version of the bill was enacted into law as <em>L. </em>2011, c. 40, on March 29, 2011. <em>See </em>Legislative History Checklist, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The statute\u2019s core substantive provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1, entitled \u201cRestrictions upon use of employment as qualification for position vacancies,\u201d states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">Unless otherwise permitted by the provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes [<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] or any other law, rule, or regulation, no employer or employer\u2019s agent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>representative, or designee shall knowingly or purposefully publish, in print or on the Internet, an advertisement for any job vacancy in this State that contains one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">a. <em>Any provision stating that the qualifications for a job include current employment;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">b. <em>Any provision stating that the employer or employer\u2019s agent, representative, or designee will not consider or review an application for employment submitted by any job applicant currently unemployed; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">c. <em>Any provision, stating that the employer or employer\u2019s agent, representative, or designee will only consider or review applications for employment submitted by job applicants who are currently employed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">Nothing set forth in this section shall be construed as prohibiting an employer or employer\u2019s agent, representative, or designee from publishing, in print or on the Internet, an advertisement for any job vacancy in this State that contains any provision setting forth <em>any other qualifications for a job, as permitted by law, including, but not limited to, the holding of a current and valid professional or occupational license, certificate, registration, permit or other credential, or a minimum level of education, training or professional, occupational or field experience.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-9\">In addition, nothing set forth in this section shall be construed as prohibiting an employer or employer\u2019s agent, representative, or designee from publishing, in print or on the Internet, an advertisement for any job vacancy that contains any provision <em>stating that only applicants who are currently employed, by such employers </em>will be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-10\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">The companion penalty provision in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-2 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-12\">a. Any employer who violates this act <em>[N.J.S.A </em>34:8B-1] shall be <em>subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $1,000 for the first violation, </em>$5,000 for the second violation and $10,000 for each subsequent violation, <em>collectible by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development </em>in a summary proceeding pursuant to the \u201cPenalty Enforcement Law of 1999,\u201d <em>P.L. </em>1999, <em>c. </em>274 <em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:58-10 to -12],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-13\">b. Nothing set forth in this act shall be construed as creating, establishing or authorizing a private cause of action by an aggrieved person against an employer who has violated, or is alleged to have violated, the provisions of this act. [ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">This legislation was enacted during the midst of a national recession that indisputably caused a significant adverse impact upon the economy and the workforce in the State of New Jersey. We can readily take judicial notice that the bill became law in a context where unemployment levels in this State had been rising, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>businesses were widely downsizing, and new job opportunities were waning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These conditions had produced a harsh reality in which many workers remained on the unemployment rolls for prolonged periods of time and were finding it difficult to be considered for and obtain new positions. At the same time, certain employers that did have vacant positions apparently were disinclined to hire persons who were currently jobless, preferring instead to focus their hiring on the pool of applicants who currently held other positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">During the Assembly session of October 25, 2010 cited in the Department\u2019s brief, one of the bill\u2019s sponsors, Assemblyman Peter J. Barnes III, underscored the importance of promoting the ability of currently unemployed persons to be considered for vacant jobs. When such jobless persons become discouraged from applying for work, Barnes asserted, both they and potential employers are harmed, through the elimination of a whole segment of the population that might otherwise be qualified to do the tasks required.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Assemblyman Barnes noted that it had been his original intention to seek to amend the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 to -42, to prohibit employers from discriminating against unemployed job applicants. Rather than pursuing a more ambitious measure directed to the merits of an employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>hiring decisions, he compromised by introducing this narrower bill instead.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">The official statement accompanying the bill reads as follows: This bill prohibits an employer or employer\u2019s agent, representative, or designee to publish, in print or on the Internet, an advertisement for any job vacancy that prohibits, announces or suggests that unemployed individuals need not apply for a job vacancy. The bill provides for the imposition of civil penalties, for a violation of the bill, in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for the first violation, or $10,000 for each subsequent violation, collectible by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\"><em>[Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. A3359 </em>(Oct. 7, 2010).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Apart from these particular aspects of the advertising statute\u2019s legislative history, the Department contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 \u201cshares a common purpose\u201d with the Unemployment Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-2 to -24.30. The latter statute requires unemployed residents to seek jobs actively in order to qualify for unemployment benefits. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-4(c)(l) (\u201cAn unemployed individual shall be eligible to receive benefits with respect to any week eligible only if ... [t]he individual is able to work, and is available for work, and has <em>demonstrated to be actively seeking work.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). According to the Department, \u201c[tjhese statutes are mutually supportive and should be read <em>[in pari materia </em>] as part of an overall legislative scheme.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Other jurisdictions have recently enacted similar or more expansive laws designed to aid unemployed workers in their job searches. <em>See generally </em>Jennifer Jolly Ryan, <em>Repairing Damaged Goods: Federal and State Legislation Prohibiting Employers from Making Current Employment a Job Requirement, </em>14 <em>Rutgers Race &amp; L.Rev. </em>54 (2013) (canvassing the enacted and pending provisions in other jurisdictions). In 2012, Oregon passed a statute worded very similarly to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1, which prohibits employers from pubhshing job ads that make current employment a hiring qualification. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That same year, the District of Columbia adopted a provision that not only bans such \u201cneed not apply\u201d advertising content, but goes further and also makes it illegal to refuse to hire or consider hiring a potential employee based upon his or her unemployed status.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The City of New York has likewise adopted a comparable ban.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We were advised at oral argument that Rhode Island is considering similar legislation, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>is awaiting the outcome of the present appeal and the resolution of this constitutional challenge to the New Jersey provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">As Professor Ryan\u2019s journal article has noted, these various laws have been enacted in recognition that \u201c[t]he undisputed proof is that the longer one is unemployed, the less likely one will find a job.\u201d Ryan, <em>supra, </em>14 <em>Rutgers Race &amp; L.Rev. </em>at 59 &amp; n. 32. \u201cWhen employers require job-seekers to be currently employed before even considering them for available job openings, unemployed workers continue to face disproportionate circumstances as their period of unemployment grows longer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 60 n. 37. Some employers, however, perceive that currently jobless persons are less likely to be suitable applicants because they may lack current skills, or because they may have lost their previous jobs due to poor performance. <em>See id. </em>at 60-62. In addition, because of the surplus of supply in the labor market, hiring employers may already be flooded with more than sufficient applications from currently employed candidates. <em>Id. </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">We now turn to the merits of appellants\u2019 constitutional challenge. In doing so, we bear in mind that \u201c[t]he power of [a] [c]ourt to declare a statute unconstitutional must be delicately exercised.\u201d <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr. v. Verniero, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>254, 285, 716 A.2d 1137 (1998) (citing <em>Harvey v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>381, 388, 153 A.2d 10 (1959)), <em>cert. denied, </em>527 <em>U.S. </em>1021, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>2365, 144 L.Ed.2d 770 (1999). \u201cThe strong presumption of constitutionality that attaches to a statute can be rebutted only upon a showing that the statute\u2019s \u2018repugnancy to the Constitution is clear beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Harvey, supra, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>at 388, 153 A.2d 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">Appellants\u2019 claims of invalid infringement of their free speech rights trigger the application of several long-standing principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>First Amendment law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> At the outset, it is undisputed that appellants\u2019 classified advertising is a species of commercial speech rather than political speech. In <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>376, 385, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2553, 2558, 37 L.Ed.2d 669, 677 (1973), the United States Supreme Court observed that help-wanted ads conveying \u201cno more than a proposal of possible employment\u201d were \u201cclassic examples of commercial speech.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is equally clear that the prohibitions in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 are content-based, not content-neutral. Appellants do not claim, however, that the statute is a form of \u201cviewpoint\u201d discrimination, a circumstance which can trigger, in some contexts, an even higher level of judicial scrutiny than that which applies to content-based restrictions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>In traditional First Amendment jurisprudence, \u201c[wjhen a statute favors one speaker over another, it is a form of content-based regulation. The government must abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.\u201d <em>Chez Sez VIII, Inc. v. Poritz, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. </em>331, 342, 688 A.2d 119 (App.Div. 1997) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Content-based restrictions on political speech are considered \u201cpresumptively invalid\u201d unless they are able to withstand a strict scrutiny analysis. <em>R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>377, 382, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2538, 2542, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>305, 317 (1992). However, courts have customarily declined to apply an equally stringent review standard to content-based regulations of commercial speech, instead utilizing the four-part intermediate scrutiny framework of <em>Central Hudson, </em>discussed <em>infra.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In its 1980 seminal opinion in <em>Central Hudson, </em>the United States Supreme Court described commercial speech as \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\u201d <em>Central Hudson, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 561, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>2349, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 348 (citing <em>Va. Pharm. Bd. v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, </em>435 <em>U.S. </em>748, 762, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 1825-26, 48 L.Ed.2d 346, 359 (1976)). \u201c[B]oth the United States Supreme Court and [the New Jersey Supreme Court] have held that the United States Constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally-guaranteed expression.\u201d <em>Barry v. Arrow Pontiac, Inc., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>57, 72, 494 A.2d 804 (1985) (citing <em>Central Hudson, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 563, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2350, 65 L.Ed.2d at 349). \u201cThat protection applies only insofar as the speech conveys facts that facilitate honest commercial transactions.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In <em>Central Hudson, </em>the Court maintained this critical distinction between speech concerning solely commercial transactions and other forms of speech that are entitled to more stringent protections, by delineating a four-part analytical framework for assessing the validity of restrictions placed on commercial speech. The four elements of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeN\">At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. [1] For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. [2] Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine [3] whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and [4] whether it is more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\"><em>[Central Hudson, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 566, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2351, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 351.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">We are therefore guided by <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>four-part intermediate scrutiny test in resolving the present appeal. In applying that test, we are mindful that the United States Supreme Court issued an opinion in <em>Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., </em>564 <em>U.S. </em>-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011), indicating that a majority of the justices believed that a more rigorous test of \u201cheightened judicial scrutiny\u201d should be applied to certain forms of restrictions on commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">The Court ruled in <em>Sorrell </em>that a Vermont statute restricting the sale, use, and disclosure of pharmacy records that revealed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>prescription practices of individual doctors throughout that state to pharmaceutical manufacturers \u201cmust be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2659,180 L.Ed.2d at 551. In so ruling, the Supreme Court rejected Vermont\u2019s argument that the statute was merely a commercial regulation and thus subject to only intermediate scrutiny. The Court noted that \u201c[t]he First Amendment requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys____Commercial speech is no exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2664, 180 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 556 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). However, despite this pronouncement, the Court still applied the traditional <em>Central Hudson </em>analysis for restrictions on commercial speech (i.e., intermediate, not heightened, scrutiny), to the facts in <em>Sorrell, </em>and did not articulate how the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d test should be applied going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\"><em>Sorrell </em>is distinguishable from the present case in several respects. First, the Vermont statute banned the sale of prescri-ber-identifying information \u201cbased in large part on the content of a purchaser\u2019s speech.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2663, 180 L.Ed.2d at 554. For example, the information could be purchased by those who wished to participate in educational communications, but could not be purchased for purposes of marketing or advertising. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court noted that the statute specifically \u201cdisfavorfed] marketing, that is, speech of a particular content.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, in concluding that heightened scrutiny was required, the Court criticized the fact that the statute \u201cdisfavor[ed] specific speakers, namely pharmaceutical manufacturers.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">Here, by contrast, <em>N.J.S.A, </em>34:8B-1 does not favor one type of speaker over another, as all employers that choose to advertise for open job positions through print or Internet postings are equally subject to the terms of the statute. In addition, the statute regulates a type of speech \u2014 advertising\u2014that the United States Supreme Court traditionally has held to be \u201ccommercial speech\u201d less worthy of constitutional protection than political speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In electing to apply the <em>Central Hudson </em>test to this appeal, we also find it significant that the United States Supreme Court has yet to issue an opinion applying the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d test intimated by <em>Sorrell </em>to a restriction on commercial speech. Moreover, the Court has not clearly elucidated what that \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d might entail. In the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s post<em>Sorrell </em>silence and inaction, many federal and state courts are continuing to apply the standard set forth in <em>Central Hudson.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Applying, as a whole, each of the four <em>Central Hudson </em>factors to the present statute, we conclude that appellants have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the law violates the First Amendment. We analyze the four factors as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The first prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test \u2022 requires little discussion. The Department acknowledges that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u201cregulates a job advertisement posted by Crest that is about a lawful activity and is not inherently misleading.\u201d We accept that sensible concession, although it does not end the four-part analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The second prong of the test considers whether the governmental interest underlying the statute is \u201csubstantial.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">To be sure, \u201c[t]he burden is on the State to establish the existence of the substantial governmental interest it sought to advance\u201d through the enactment of this statute. <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, 716 A.2d 1137. However, \u201c[b]oth the United States Supreme Court and this Court have held that the government does not have a heavy burden to satisfy the substantial governmental interest prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>standard. That burden may be satisfied in a variety of different ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270-71, 716 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">For example, in <em>Burson v. Freeman, </em>504 <em>U.S. </em>191, 211,112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1846, 1858, 119 L.Ed.2d 5, 22 (1992), the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Court upheld a Tennessee statute prohibiting the solicitation of votes and the display and distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of a polling place, finding that the government had a substantial interest in keeping the election process \u201cfree from the taint of intimidation and fraud.\u201d The Court reached this conclusion based not on empirical evidence, but on \u201c[a] long history, a substantial consensus, and simple common sense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Appellants are correct that the texts of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 and -2 and the sponsor\u2019s official statement do not explicitly articulate the \u201csubstantial government interest\u201d that the Legislature sought to address, and the State has not provided empirical support of the efficacy of the statute. Nonetheless, we are persuaded that the legislative objective associated with the statute is a \u201csubstantial\u201d one. We reach that conclusion based upon a fair conception of the deliberately circumscribed nature of the law\u2019s scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">It is evident that the statutes before us have a modest aim: to maximize the ability of jobless persons to simply present their qualifications to potential employers. The statutes do not pretend to do more than that. They do not, for instance, require employers to read such applications, or to bring in any jobless persons for interviews, or to hire any of those persons in lieu of applicants who already have other jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Moreover, if the statutes had gone to such extra lengths, they would probably be evaluated under the fairly lenient constitutional standards for economic regulation under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It would be ironic indeed if the less ambitious statute adopted by the Legislature would be more constitutionally vulnerable than a more aggressive measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 and -2 have a less ambitious scope than a sweeping general anti-discrimination law protecting the jobless. But that limited scope does not make the governmental interests insubstantial. Indeed, the substantiality prong of <em>Central Hudson </em>has frequently been construed and applied to accord considerable deference to the policy choices of elected officials.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We are not a \u201csuper-Legislature\u201d empowered to strike down laws based upon our own policy preferences or our collective personal senses of what we deem important and substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The inescapably clear premise of these challenged laws is that, although employers may discard or ignore many resumes and applications that they receive from jobless applicants, undoubtedly some currently unemployed applicants will stand out. At least some of them, from time to time, will possess such impressive or well-suited credentials that they will receive a job offer despite an employer\u2019s initial reluctance to consider unemployed applicants. Indeed, the recent severe recession and the all-too-frequent closure, downsizing or migration of businesses from our State have unfortunately caused innumerable very talented workers with vast amounts of skill to find themselves out of work. A portion of those now unemployed persons might well be of interest to companies with vacancies, if they were not discouraged from sending in their applications by the prohibitive words of job advertisements.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The Legislature and the Governor reasonably determined that job-seekers should not be repelled by ads proclaiming that the unemployed \u201cneed not apply.\u201d It is not our province to trivialize that objective by declaring that the law does not go far enough to be worthwhile.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The second prong of substantiality is therefore met.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">For related reasons, we are also satisfied that the third prong of <em>Central Hudson </em>is fulfilled, as the statute \u201cdirectly advances the governmental interest asserted.\u201d <em>Central Hudson, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 566, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2351, 65 L.Ed.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">We agree with the Department\u2019s assertion in its brief that \u201c[t]he statute, in ensuring that a help wanted ad cannot exclude unemployed job seekers, directly serves the purpose of increasing the opportunities for unemployed workers to <em>apply </em>for work.\u201d (Emphasis added). Although the Department has not presented an empirical study to confirm this assertion, for the reasons that we have already mentioned, there is a logical nexus between the terms of the statute and its desired goals. Again, if the \u201cgovernmental interest\u201d at stake were more ambitiously defined as, for example, a material increase in the hiring of unemployed persons, the Department\u2019s ability to satisfy the third prong on the facts presented would be questionable. But, as we have noted, if the scope of the statute is conceived more modestly as a measure to simply get more resumes into the hands of prospective employers, then the law is surely crafted to advance that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The fourth and final prong of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test requires a determination as to whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 \u201cis narrowly tailored to serve the State\u2019s asserted interests.\u201d <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 276, 716 A.2d 1137; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Central Hudson, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 566, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2351, 65 L.Ed.2d at 351. \u201c[T]he regulation need not be the least restrictive means of serving the State\u2019s ... substantial interest.\u201d <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 277, 716 A.2d 1137 (citations omitted). Rather, the narrow tailoring requirement is satisfied \u201c \u2018so long as the ... regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>781, 797, 799, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2746, 2757, 2758, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, 679, 680-81 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We conclude that this final element of the test also weighs in favor of the Department. We agree with the Department\u2019s argument that the means employed by this statute \u201care quite narrowly tailored\u201d because employers are simply obligated to \u201crefrain from excluding unemployed workers in job advertising,\u201d but may still \u201cadvertise job openings in the manner they desire, and ultimately they can select who they want for the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">As we have indicated, the manifest purpose of the statute is to ensure that unemployed residents of the State are not categorically deterred from applying for job opportunities merely because they are currently out of work. The statute reaches no further than what is required to achieve its stated purpose and, in fact, explicitly allows employers to restrict potential candidates based on other criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">For example, in keeping with the Governor\u2019s conditional veto amendments, an employer is permitted under the statute to state in an advertisement for a job vacancy that the minimum qualifications for that particular position include a certain professional license or certificate, a certain degree or educational background, or a certain number of years of training or experience in the field. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1. In addition, employers are not prohibited from stating in an advertisement, if they so choose, that they will only accept applications from persons currently employed by them in another position than that being advertised. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Because the statute only prohibits an employer from stating in its ads that current employment is a prerequisite to the acceptance of an applicant\u2019s materials, we concur with the Department\u2019s contention that <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8B-1 is no more extensive than necessary to serve the government\u2019s asserted interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">We need not say much about appellants\u2019 passing contentions of unconstitutionality that are not grounded upon free speech principles. In particular, we reject appellants\u2019 claim that <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8B-1 and -2 violate Article I, Paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ll persons ... have certain natural and unalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\u201d <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, II1.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Appellants contend in this regard that a business owner\u2019s fundamental rights are being \u201cabridged\u201d by this law because the \u201cimplicit objective] of this statute\u201d is to \u201cforce an employer to hire the unemployed.\u201d We disagree with that characterization. As the Department explains in its brief, the statute is \u201cintended to enable unemployed workers to <em>apply </em>for jobs, and is not aimed at requiring employers to actually hire unemployed applicants. The law thus takes a very measured approach to the objective it seeks to achieve.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u201cInsofar as most rights are concerned, a state statute does not violate [principles of] substantive due process if the statute reasonably relates to a legitimate legislative purpose and is not arbitrary or discriminatory.\u201d <em>Greenberg v. Kimmelman, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>552, 563, 494 A.2d 294 (1985) (citing <em>Nebbia v. New York, </em>291 <em>U.S. </em>502, 537, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>505, 516, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>940, 957 (1934)). \u201cBriefly stated, if a statute is supported by a conceivable rational basis, it will withstand a substantive due process attack.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Williamson, supra, </em>348 <em>U.S. </em>at 488, 75 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 464, 99 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 572).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>There is clearly such a rational basis underlying the legislation before us. Appellants\u2019 claims to the contrary lack merit, as do the rest of their various subsidiary claims of invalidity. We need not comment on them further. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Having concluded in this case of first impression that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:8B-1 and -2 are indeed constitutional, we therefore sustain the Department\u2019s finding that appellants\u2019 job advertisement violated the statutes. Even so, we are not prepared at present to sustain the $1,000 penalty imposed upon them by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:8B-2 does not require imposition of the authorized full penalty in all instances of a proven violation. Instead, the statute authorizes a penalty that is <em>\u201cnot to exceed </em>$1,000 for the first violation.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>34:8B-2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Moreover, the implementing penalty regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:67-1.4, states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">When the Director finds that an employer or employer\u2019s agent, representative, or designee has violated the Act, the Director is authorized to assess an administrative penalty against the employer in the amounts that follow:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">1. First violation \u2014 not more than $1,000[J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>12:67-1.4(a)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">In addition, the regulation states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">In determining what constitutes an appropriate administrative penalty for a particular violation, the following factors shall be considered, where applicable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">1. The seriousness of the violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">2. The past history of previous violations by the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-16\">3. The good faith of the employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-17\">4. The size of the employer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-18\">o.

Nor did the Commissioner have the chance to consider the equities of the penalty in light of the nature of the substantial constitutional issues litigated in this appellate forum. Although appellants\u2019 constitutional arguments ultimately were not successful, we do observe that they were non-frivolous in nature, and that, by all indications in this record, they were presented in a good faith effort to test the validity of this relatively new statute. These distinctive factors are potentially relevant in determining whether the fine should be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In light of the unique posture of this precedential case, we therefore choose to remand the penalty aspect of this matter for further consideration by the Commissioner, and for the express application of the discretionary factors set forth in the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Affirmed in part and remanded in part.

However, we accept the Department's argument that there is some degree of implicit connection between the statutes. The statutes do relate to the same general subject matter, i.e., unemployment. Moreover, the new statute\u2019s effort to lessen obstacles for jobless persons to regain employment does tie in with the policies set forth in the Title 43 provisions. <em>See Burt v. W.
