She caught herself on a display counter and so avoided a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">In an action to recover damages for the injury she alleged it was the result of negligence and the maintenance of a nuisance on the part of Montgomery Ward, in that the floor at the point of her accident was very slippery, with a sticky \u201cwaxy like\u201d powder on the surface. This substance she contends caused her to slip and its presence was due to the failure of the store to use care to keep the floor in a reasonably safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The District Judge, trying the action without a jury, found \u201c[t]here was no direct evidence of any foreign substance on the floor\u201d. He further held the evidence insufficient to establish an \u201cinherent slippery condition in the surface of the floor\u201d. He concluded that the plaintiff had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence any neglect on the part of the store to provide the plaintiff, as one of its patrons, with a reasonably safe place to walk while shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">The evidence in respect to the condition of the floor surface at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury was conflicting. The District Court was clearly justified in its findings. We cannot overturn them unless they are \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d, and this is certainly not so here. Rule 52(a) F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
