The Board found that the employer coerced its employees in violation of Section 8(a) (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.) by interrogating them concerning their union activities and sympathies, by threatening to close the plant and by granting -wage increases which were intended to discourage union activity. The Board further found that the discharge of the employees Edward Cackowski and Adam Kreuzwieser was on account of their union membership and activities and violated the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-24\">The Trial Examiner, whose intermediate report appears on forty-eight pages of the printed record, gave careful consideration to the conflicting evidence in the case. The Board\u2019s order was in conformity with his findings. On the basis of the evidence which he credited, we think substantially existed. We are, therefore, required to enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-25\">Enforcement granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
