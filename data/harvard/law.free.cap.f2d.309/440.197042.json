SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A0f\">During 1960, five separate grand juries, impanelled in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, returned twenty indictments which charged twenty-nine manufacturers of heavy electrical equipment, and forty-seven corporate officials, with violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1. Of the series of indictments, United States v. General Electric Company et al.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Cr. No. 20401), charged a conspiracy \u201c [t] o fix and maintain prices, terms and conditions for the sale of turbine-generator units\u201d and \u201c [t]o submit noncompetitive, collusive and rigged bids and price quotations * * * \u201d to utility companies and other purchasers. United States v. Foster Wheeler Corporation et al.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Cr. No. 20402), charged a similar conspiracy in connection with the sale of steam condensers. The defendants were convicted on the respective indictments on pleas of guilty or nolo contendere.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The three corporations convicted in Criminal No. 20401 have been subject to the provisions of a Cease and Desist Order<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> issued by the Federal Trade Commission. This order directs the corporations to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from \u201c[fjixing and maintaining uniform delivered prices\u201d and from \u201c [submitting uniform or identical delivered prices in competitive bidding * * * \u201d in connection with the sale of turbine generators. The six corporations convicted in Criminal No. 20402, except Carrier Corporation, have been subject to the provisions of a Cease and Desist Order <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which prohibits similar unfair methods of competition in connection with the sale of steam condensers. These orders were issued by the Commission on April 2, 1937, pursuant to the authority vested in it by Section 5(b) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45 (b), and became final on May 21, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-15\">The convictions of the corporate defendants in the criminal actions prompted an investigation by the Commission of possible violations of the cease and desist orders and the liability of the respective corporations for the penalties prescribed by Section 5(1) of the Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45 (l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The penalty provisions are enforceable in an appropriate proceeding brought by the United States whenever the \u201cCommission has reason to believe that any * * * corporation is liable\u201d under subdivision (1) and upon certification of the \u201cfacts\u201d to the Attorney General.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>This matter came before the court below on a verified petition, and an amendment thereto, requesting that the Commission or its designated attorneys be granted leave to inspect and copy the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\">\u201c(1) Documents * * * submitted by-corporations named as defendants or co-conspirators, and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201c(2) Transcripts of grand jury testimony * * * of witnesses employed or formerly employed by corporations named as defendants or co-conspirators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">The request was limited to documents and testimony relating to turbine generators and steam condensers. The Commission sought access to this evidence in connection with its investigation. The petition was resisted by the corporations on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective employees. The petition was denied and the present appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The proceedings before a grand jury are protected against disclosure by the common law policy of secrecy. This policy is continued in rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A., which is the measure of the Commission\u2019s privilege of access to the documents and transcripts requested. The first sentence of this rule permits disclosure, without leave of the district court, \u201cof matters occurring before the grand jury * * * to the attorneys for the government for use in the performance of their duties.\u201d The term \u201cattorneys for the government\u201d is limited in its application to \u201cthe Attorney General, an authorized assistant of the Attorney General, a United States Attorney, an authorized assistant of the United States Attorney * * Fed.Rules Cr.Proc. rule 54(c), 18 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">It is here contended that \u201c * * * the Commission is entitled to the use of the grand jury material * * * because of its special relation to\u201d the Attorney General, under whose direction the grand jury proceeding was conducted. The basis of this contention is the dual responsibility of the Attorney General and the Commission for the enforcement of the Clayton Act, a responsibility which the Attorney General shares with other administrative agencies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a721 and 25; United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953); Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 68 S.Ct. 793, 92 L.Ed. 1010 (1948). The attorneys for the Commission argue that since the Attorney General may have free access to the grand jury evidence in the performance of his duties the same privilege should be accorded to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">We have heretofore noted that the right of access enjoyed by the Attorney General is derived from the express language of the first sentence of rule 6(e), supra. The term \u201cattorneys for the government\u201d is restrictive in its application and does not include the attorneys for the administrative agencies. See rule 54(c), supra. If it had been intended that the attorneys for the administrative agencies were to have free access to matters occurring before a grand jury, the rule would have so provided. The rule is not ambiguous and we see no reason to extend its application by judicial interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">The Commission urges in further support of its petition the pertinent provision of the second sentence of the rule, supra, which authorizes the disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury when \u201cdirected by the court preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.\u201d It is argued that the requirements of the rule are satisfied in the instant case. We cannot agree. The Commission does not seek the grand jury evidence for use in any judicial proceeding ; it seeks a private disclosure in aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>of an administrative investigation into possible violations of the cease and desist orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">There is no judicial proceeding now pending and it is possible that none may result from the investigation. The function of the Commission is to ascertain whether there is reason to believe that one or more of the corporations is liable to a penalty and, if it is so ascertained, to certify the facts to the Attorney General. The exclusive authority to enforce the statutory provision is vested in the Attorney General. 15 U.S.C.A., supra, at footnote 6. The investigation undertaken by the Commission is preliminary to and in connection with the ex parte administrative proceeding contemplated by the statute; it is not preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding within the intendment of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Commission argues that its \u201cpetition * * * comes within the <em>settled rule </em>authorizing disclosure of grand jury evidence for the use of <em>government law-enforcement agencies </em>other than those involved in the grand jury proceeding.\u201d (Emphasis by the Court.) It is further argued that under this rule the petition should have been granted upon a showing that \u201cthe grand jury evidence [would] be material and useful to a lawful function of the * * * agency.\u201d The cases cited <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in support of the argument establish no such \u201csettled rule.\u201d The decision of the court in each of those cases, consistent with established principles, rested on a determination that under the facts presented the interests of justice outweighed the countervailing policy of secrecy. The disclosure of evidence \u201cmaterial and useful to a lawful function\u201d may facilitate investigation and serve the convenience of the agency, but in our opinion more is required to outweigh the traditional policy of secrecy.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\"> The courts have uniformly held that a petition or motion for leave to inspect grand jury evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, to be dealt with by him in light of the facts and circumstances of the particular ease. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States, 360 U.S. 395, 399, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1959), and the cases therein cited; Franano v. United States, 277 F.2d 511, 513 (8th Cir. 1960); Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561, 566 (9th Cir. 1955). This discretion should be exercised favorably to disclosure only when it is persuasively shown that the ends of justice require it. The action of the trial judge on such a petition or motion may not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-15\">The Commission has plenary authority to investigate possible violations-of its cease and desist orders and, under Section 9 of the Act, the \u201cpower to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all * * * documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 49. See United States v. Morton Salt Company, 338 U.S. 632, 643, 70 S.Ct. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401 (1960). The witnesses who appeared before the grand jury, and the documents there produced, are readily available to the Commission and subject to administrative subpoena. It seems reasonably clear that under these circumstances it was not an abuse of discretion-to hold the secrecy of the grand jury inviolate.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-17\">The decision of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\">.
