On this petition counsel for the United States calls our attention to the fact that the appellant filed no bond in the Tax Court and that \u00a7 108 of the Act, as amended, 70 Stat. 791, 50 U.S.C.Appendix \u00a7 1218, provides that the filing of a petition in the Tax Court shall operate to stay the execution of an order of the Renegotiation Board \u201conly\u201d if an adequate bond is filed with the Tax Court within ten days after the petition is filed, that although it appealed to this court the appellant filed no supersedeas bond as required by Rule 73(d), Fed.R. Civ.P. and that \u00a7 108, supra, provides that any amount collected by the United States in excess of the amount found due by the Tax Court shall be refunded to the contractor with interest at four per centum from the date of collection to the date of refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-20\">We think the Government\u2019s petition is well grounded. In view of the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>provisions referred to above there is no need to give the appellant protection it did not request and which was readily available to it by simply filing a bond. Even if we had the statutory power, which is open to question, we are now convinced that our gratuitous favor to the appellant was ill-advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">An order will be entered vacating the judgment of August 30, 1962, and a new judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
