The contempt charged is a civil one.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-33\">Fox had been required to appear as a witness for the taking of his pre-trial deposition in the action between American Cyanamid Company, the plaintiff, and Nathan Sharif, the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-34\">Fox moved to set aside the notice of examination, and to stay the examination itself. These motions were denied. Cy-anamid then moved to compel Fox to answer the questions propounded in the examination before trial. The motion was granted and Fox was directed to reply to the questions set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fox declined to answer these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>questions, basing his refusal on the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"ARs\">After an examination, in which the court below investigated the incrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>tory tendencies of the questions, Fox was ordered to answer. He refused to obey this direction, and the court ordered him committed until he answered. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">That the privilege against self-incrimination extends to all judicial or official proceedings where persons are compelled to give testimony permits small argument. United States v. Goodner, 35 F.Supp. 286 (D.Colo.1940). This court in United States v. Coffey, 3 Cir., 198 F.2d 438, 440 (1952), stated that it is enough to justify the exercise of the privilege: \u201c(1) that the trial court be shown by argument how conceivably a prosecutor * * * might proceed step by step to link the witness with some crimes against the United States, and (2) that this suggested course and scheme of linkage not seem incredible in . the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d Once it has been determined that a conceivable possibility exists of the commission of a crime against the United States the trial court must then decide whether the questions asked have a tendency to incriminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">In describing the kinds of questions which give rise to a valid exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination, Judge Learned Hand said: \u201cAll crimes are composed of definite elements, and nobody supposes that the privilege is confined to answers which directly admit one of these; it covers also such as logically, though mediately, lead to any of them; such as are rungs of the rational ladder by which they may be reached. A witness would, for example, be privileged from answering whether he left his home with a burglar\u2019s jimmy in his pocket, though that is no part of the crime of burglary.\u201d United States v. Weisman, 111 F.2d 260, 262 (2 Cir.1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">The function of determining whether a direct answer to a question will furnish evidence against the witness falls on the court. United States v. Burr (In re Willie), 25 Fed.Cas. 38 (1807). If the questions appear innocent upon their face the witness must then \u201cshow that answers to them might criminate him\u201d. United States v. Weisman, 111 F.2d 260, 261 (2 Cir.1940). To require a showing on the part of the witness of more than the likelihood of danger to him arising from answering the question would defeat the privilege granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">In reviewing an order of contempt arising from a plea of self-incrimination the decision of the trial judge must be given weight. Mason v. United States, 244 U.S. 362, 366, 37 S.Ct. 621, 61 L.Ed. 1198 (1917). But in order to deny the application of the privilege, it must be <em>\u201c \u2018perfectly clear, </em>from a careful consideration of all the circumstances in the case, that the witness is mistaken, and that the answers <em>cannot possibly </em>have such a tendency\u2019 \u201d to incriminate. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 488, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951), citing Temple v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 892, 898 (1881); cited with approval in Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 579-580, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">Using the standards set out above, the first inquiry must be whether there appears to be a conceivable possibility that the witness could be linked to a crime against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">From reading (a) the complaint of the plaintiff Cyanamid filed in the action against the defendant Sharff,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>the complaint filed by Cyanamid in an action against Fox in the Supreme Court of New York<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (c) the affidavit, executed by the plaintiff\u2019s, Cyanamid\u2019s, counsel, which was served upon Fox at the time he received notice to appear for the taking of his deposition in this proceeding <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we find that Fox has been charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>with being a co-conspirator in the receiving, selling, and transporting of trade secrets, strains of microorganisms, and sample drugs belonging to Cyanamid in interstate and foreign commerce, knowing them to have been stolen. The facts supporting this allegation, if proved, could give rise to an indictment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314, 2315<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> if the term \u201cgoods, wares, and merchandise\u201d employed in the statutes includes one of the articles, trade secrets, strains of microorganisms, or sample drugs alleged to have been transported, concealed, sold or disposed of by Fox, and if the article or articles had a value of $5,000 or more.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">We point out that the law does not require that the recalcitrant witness be found to have clearly committed a crime against the United States before he is entitled to exercise the privilege. All that is necessary is that it be shown that conceivably he has committed such a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Applying these rules, we now turn to the question of whether or not there is a conceivable possibility that the articles allegedly stolen are covered by the phrase \u201cgoods, wares, and merchandise\u201d. This court has previously stated that \u201cthe terms \u2018goods, wares, and merchandise\u2019 is a general and comprehensive designation of such personal property or chattels as are ordinarily a subject of commerce.\u201d United States v. Seagraves, 3 Cir., 265 F.2d 876, 880 (1959). Since the articles allegedly stolen are personal property, all that must be alleged and proven at trial is the fact that one or all of such articles are ordinarily a subject of commerce and therefore covered by the statute. We, however, can find nothing in the language of the trial judge (and he wrote no opinion) that would indicate with clarity that he applied the principle of law to which we have just referred. Moreover, the trial judge made no finding of fact respecting the conceivable possibility that the allegedly stolen items were of the value of $5,000 or more. The court below simply ordered Fox to answer and committed him to jail when he refused to testify. No question of double jeopardy is, of course, presented, since the alleged contempt is civil rather than criminal. As we have indicated the charges made against Fox may or may not constitute a crime against the United States. We cannot say as a matter of law, on the present record, that the items allegedly stolen by Fox are not ordinarily the sub ject of commerce. Nor can we say that these items are or are not worth $5,000 or more. The court below was not required to find that a crime clearly had been committed. It was required to find that there was or was not a conceivable possibility that a crime had been committed. The court, however, made no finding in respect to this vital issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>We now turn to the issue of whether the facts sought to be elicited from Fox by the questions form a link in the chain of evidence necessary to convict Fox of the crimes proscribed by the statutes set out in note 5, supra. The questions the appellant refused to answer can be segregated into four groups: (1) those concerning Fox\u2019s professional and employment relations; (2) those relating to his personal contacts; (3) those concerning his contacts with companies, and (4) those dealing with his travel. In determining whether answers to these questions could form a necessary link in the chain of evidence leading to conviction of the crimes alleged, all pertinent circumstances must be looked to. In the complaints, referred to above, Fox was charged with being a co-conspirator who, with others, not all of whom were named, stole, transported and sold, in interstate and foreign commerce, property belonging to the plaintiff, to certain Italian firms, none of whom were named.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">Fox was examined by the trial judge in order to determine whence his apprehension of incrimination arose. He stated that he had refused to answer the questions concerning his professional and employment contacts because \u201cthere is the possibility that by spelling out the length of employment it would * * * show that I had access to certain information * * * alleged by the complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In refusing to answer the group of questions concerning his personal connections Fox said, \u201cI may be incriminating myself by association.\u201d This answer was given when the questions involved persons named or not named in the complaint. Even though a name was not set out in one of the complaints Fox said \u201c[I]t could be one of the others * * * I have been alleged to have conspired with\u201d. In response to a question as to his basis for refusing to answer the questions concerning his relations with companies he gave a two-fold answer. Some of the questions concerned companies which he said \u201cmay be considered one of the others in the suit\u201d. Other questions involved various firms which, he stated, \u201cmay be * * * the Italian companies mentioned in the complaint\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Fox declined to answer the questions concerning his alleged travel activities upon the ground that \u201can answer to [these] questions may * * * show that I was present or not present [in Italy and other countries] at certain occasions\u201d, and \u201cmay establish a location for a conspiracy, * * * or a possible association with the conspiracy\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">The thread that weaves its way through Fox\u2019s given reasons for his apprehension of incrimination is his alleged belief that, by responding to the questions asked, he would show circumstantially an opportunity for him to have participated in the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Are questions. which circumstantially show the opportunity to conspire the type of questions which form a link in the chain of evidence leading to a conviction for conspiracy?</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">\u201cA conspiracy is sufficiently described as a combination of two or more persons, by concerted action, to accomplish a criminal or unlawful purpose, or some purpose not in itself criminal or unlawful, by criminal or unlawful means.\u201d; Pettibone v. United States, 148 U.S. 197, 203, 13 S.Ct. 542, 37 L.Ed. 419 (1893). \u201cIt is well settled that a formal agreement of the parties concerned is not essential to the formation of a conspiracy. It is sufficient if there be concert of action, all the parties working together understanding^, with a single design for the accomplishment of a common purpose.\u201d Fowler v. United States, 273 F. 15, 19 (9 Cir. 1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">Inasmuch as a major element to be proven is the fact that the parties to the conspiracy worked together understanding^, a showing that an opportunity existed for the planning or carrying out of the design alleged would be a logical and \u201cmediate\u201d step in such proof. Therefore, if the court below could have found from the information before it that answers to the questions posed would tend to show an opportunity to have participated in the alleged conspiracy, its con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>tempt order should not have been entered. But again we have no definite findings of fact or conclusions of law by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">We have no way of being reasonably certain that the persons, places and items in the questions propounded were or were not within the purview of the vague wording of the complaints. Perhaps Fox could not have shown with greater specificity that the subject of each question was within the purview of the complaints without giving information which would endanger his privilege against self-incrimination but of this we cannot be certain on the present record. We point out that a witness is not barred in a situation like that at bar from introducing evidence through other witnesses that would show the incriminatory nature of the questions as to him. The burden of making such a showing rests however in the first instance, on the witness claiming the privilege. See Hooley v. United States, 209 F.2d 234, 236 (1 Cir. 1954). Although a witness can introduce evidence to show the incriminatory nature of the questions asked, we think that, under the circumstances at bar, the court on its own initiative might well have required Cyanamid to have given evidence relating to the inclusion or exclusion of the subject of each question in the vague terminology of the complaint, if Fox could not have done so without waiving his privilege. See Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 95 L.Ed. 1118 (1951). See also Redlich, The Rights of Witnesses Before Congressional Committees, 36 N.Y.U. Law Rev. 1126 (1961). Under the circumstances of this case the view we have expressed does not seem unreasonable. The trial court should not deem itself to be \u201ca mere keeper of the ring\u201d in the tradition of the English civil law.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">In our opinion the case at bar is one which preeminently requires findings of fact and conclusions of law in respect to the issues indicated above despite the fact that Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C., is not expressly applicable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cf. Jewel Tea Co. v. Kraus, 204 F.2d 549, 550 (7 Cir., 1953). As we have stated, the trial judge wrote no opinion. Not having had adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law before us we cannot adjudicate the issues presented by this appeal. The case therefore must be remanded to the trial court to the end that the necessary findings of fact and conclusions of law may be made and the record be augmented by further evidence, if that be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The judgment will be vacated and the case will be remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">.

A supplemental record now before this court contains certain depositions, taken in the action against Fox now pending in New York.

These depositions, from tlie proceedings in New York, were not before the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">In what we believe is a proper exercise of our discretion we have not included the material in these depositions in our consideration of this case. Bowing to the time honored rule that findings of fact are within the exclusive province of the trial court, this supplemental record will be returned to the court below for inclusion in the record on reconsideration of the issues presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
