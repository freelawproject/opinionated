Miller and Fahy, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b713-6\">BAZELON, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Appellant was charged with one count of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-2204 (1961), and one count of interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 (1958). At trial the Government introduced no \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of the essential elements of the offenses. It did, however, introduce direct evidence of \u201cexclusive possession [by the defendant] of recently stolen property.\u201d The only instruction given to the jury on the issue of inferring guilt from possession was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5d\">\u201cNow, it is the law, members of the jury, that the exclusive possession of recently stolen property, unexplained, is sufficient to support a verdict of guilty of larceny.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Defense counsel, who was not his counsel on appeal, did not request this instruction ; but neither did he offer one of his own; nor did he object to the instruction as given. And when asked by the trial judge if he had \u201canything\u201d to say about the instruction, he replied in the negative. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. This appeal followed, in which the primary question relates to the quoted instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">In Bray v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 136, 306 F.2d 743 (1962), this court' carefully defined the limits to which the doctrine of \u201cinference\u201d may be pressed in criminal cases. After stating that an \u201cinference\u201d but not a \u201cpresumption\u201d of guilt could be drawn from recent exclusive possession of stolen property, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">\u201cThe distinction between a presumption and an inference is subtle, but not unreal. A presumption, sometimes called a presumption of law, is an inference which the lav/ directs the jury to draw if it finds a given set of facts; an inference is a conclusion which the jury is <em>permitted, </em>but not compelled, to draw from the facts.\u201d [113 U.S.App.D.C. at 140, 306 F.2d at 747.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">In Bray \u201cthe trial court did not instruct the jury that there was a <em>presumption </em>that one in possession of recently stolen goods was the thief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, it said \u2018you may if you see fit to do so <em>infer </em>* * * that this defendant is guilty unless you find that he has explained * * * his possession of the [stolen vehicle].\u2019 \u201d We therefore held that \u201cthis did not mislead the jury into believing that it was <em>required </em>to infer guilt from possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">The instruction in the instant case that exclusive possession of recently stolen property \u201cis <em>sufficient to support </em>a verdict of guilty,\u201d is inadequate. It was no more than a bare conclusion, in legal parlance, which unnecessarily informed the jury that the judge was not required to direct a verdict of acquittal. It did not make clear that, if the jury found exclusive possession by the defendant of recently stolen goods, it <em>could, </em>but was <em>not required </em>to, find that defendant had stolen the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Had this error been objected to below, reversal of the conviction would be required. In the context of this case, however, the error is not one which warrants reversal under Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">A careful consideration of appellant\u2019s other contentions reveals no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">WILBUR K. MILLER, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">. In the Bray case the judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aad-dedup-0\">\u201cthere is another principle of law which you have for your consideration in this case and that is the principle known as possession of recently stolen goods. If you find that this defendant was in possession of this automobile, Lincoln Continental, and that that vehicle had been recently stolen, and it had been stolen in North Carolina, and you further find it to be in the District of Columbia, and you further find that it was in fact being driven by this defendant, then you may, if you see fit to do so, infer therefrom that this defendant is guilty of the offense with which he is charged, unless you find that ho has explained to your satisfaction his possession of the vehicle in question on the date in question and under the circumstances stated. The Court states to you that you are not required to so infer from the facts, but you may infer unless he has explained, or the defense has explained to your satisfaction his possession in the District of Columbia on the date in question.\u201d [113 U.S.App.D.C. at 139, 306 F.2d at 746.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
