The [container] material has a plurality of minute openings or perforations of a number and size large enough to permit the passage of water and water-soluble starch* therethrough and small enough to restrict the release of pressure generated by conversion to steam of water which enters through the perforations upon placing of the container in boiling water when cooking the rice. The pressure generated within the container resists the entry of additional water and emits water containing soluble starch- through the perforations to separate the starch from the rice. Also, the perforations permit the draining of water from the container prior to the removal of the cooked rice therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Referring more specifically to the container material, appellant\u2019s specification as filed stated: \u201cThe sheet 11 [of the container] may be paper, or vegetable parchment, metal foil, plastic, treated cloth or other thin, frangible, disposable material resistant to water and heat.\u201d Appellant amended this sentence to read as follows: \u201cThe sheet 11 may be paper, or vegetable parchment, metal foil, plastic, or other thin, frangible, disposable material which is substantially nonporous and resistant to water and heat.\u201d The effect of this amendment, as well as the original meaning of the above-quoted sentence, constitutes one of the issues presented by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The claims on appeal read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\">\u201c16. In combination, uncooked rice, and a disposable container for cooking the rice, the container including an enclosure holding a predetermined quantity of uncooked rice and formed of flexible and manually tearable and substantially non-porous material resistant to heat and water, the enclosure having a plurality of perforations of a size and quantity large enough to permit the passage of water and water-soluble starch therethrough and small enough to prevent the passage of rice therethrough and restrict the release of the pressure generated by the conversion to steam of water which enters through the perforations upon placing of said enclosure in boiling water when cooking the rice whereby the generated pressure resists the entry of additional water and emits water containing soluble starch through said perforations to separate the starch from the rice, said perforations permitting the draining of water from said enclosure prior to removal of the cooked rice therefrom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\">\u201c17. The combination as set forth in claim 16 wherein said material is vegetable parchment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">The above claims stand rejected on two grounds, neither of which involves, directly at least, prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-11\">The examiner stated the basis for the first, or \u201cnew matter,\u201d rejection as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-12\">\u201cThe original disclosure (page 4, lines 8 to 10) states that many materials can be used without any statement as to whether the materials are porous, non-porous or substantially non-porous other than the statement that the materials are \u2018resistant to water and heat.\u2019 This does not serve as proper basis for claiming \u2018substantially non-porous.\u2019 it is pointed out that \u2018paper\u2019 and \u2018treated cloth\u2019 may be porous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-13\">Discussing first appellant\u2019s use of the word \u201cpaper,\u201d we find ourselves unable to agree with the board that appellant intended to include thereby reference to \u201cordinary \u2018paper\u2019.\u201d Elementary rules of grammar compel us to find that as originally disclosed in his specifications, quoted supra, appellant intended \u201cpaper\u201d as well as \u201cvegetable parchment, metal foil, [and] plastic\u201d to be \u201cresistant to water and heat.\u201d To come to grips with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>the position of the examiner, however, it is necessary for us to decide another point, namely, whether the designation \u201cresistant to water and heat,\u201d necessarily connotes substantial non-porosity, as required by the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">It may be true that under circumstances <em>remote </em>from the instant invention, materials designated \u201cresistant to water\u201d might be other than non-porous. In the instant case, however, the specification makes it clear that appellant is concerned solely with non-porosity, i. e., with his container\u2019s ability to keep out or resist the entry of water. Designating materials \u201cresistant to water\u201d <em>under such circumstances </em>could only mean that such materials are non-porous. We find it difficult to believe that any person <em>skilled in the art, </em>desiring to utilize the instant invention, would think otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">We find the Patent Office position on this \u201cnew matter\u201d point untenable for a second reason. The Patent Office has admitted that \u201cvegetable parchment, metal foil, [and] plastic\u201d may be considered non-porous. Alluding once again, therefore, to considerations of basic grammar, a holding that appellant could not properly be said to have intended the word \u201cpaper,\u201d as used in his specification, to mean non-porous paper, would effectively ascribe two different meanings to the words \u201cresistant to heat and water\u201d in the same sentence. We find such interpretation of language, at the very least, rather strained.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Much of what we have just said applies equally to appellant\u2019s reference to \u201ctreated cloth.\u201d As to this material, however, there is yet another reason for our conclusion. Patent specifications, as the patent act expressly indicates, are directed not to the public in general but to those skilled in the relevant art. Appellant, in an attempt to show how one having such skill would define the words \u201ctreated cloth * * * resistant to water and heat,\u201d has cited the following definition of \u201cwater resistance (fabric)\u201d from the Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-13\">\u201cIn the Technical Manual and Yearbook of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (1) are the definitions: <em>water resistance </em>(fabric) \u2014 a general term denoting the ability of a fabric to resist wetting and penetration of water; * * *. In A. S. T. M. standard D583-54(2) * * * the term <em>water resistance </em>is used in a less restricted sense to denote the \u2018ability of a fabric to resist wetting or penetration or both.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">The solicitor states with regard to this definition that it \u201cdoes not require that a water resistant fabric be <em>completely </em>imr pervious to water [emphasis in original].\u201d The answer to this objection again lies in appellant\u2019s use of the words \u201cresistant to water and heat.\u201d We might ask in what sense is plastic resistant to heat? Completely? Obviously not. In what sense is vegetable parchment resistant to water or heat? Completely? Obviously not. It is clear, therefore, that appellant did not intend, originally, that the words \u201cresistant to water and heat\u201d be absolute terms. In view of the above considerations, we find ourselves unable to attribute any particular significance, insofar as the instant \u201cnew matter\u201d rejection is concerned, to appellant\u2019s cancellation of the words \u201ctreated cloth\u201d from his specification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-16\">Since'we are of the opinion that as originally filed, appellant\u2019s specification would have indicated to one skilled in the art that <em>all </em>suggested container materials were to be substantially nonporous, we hold that the insertion of this limitation expressly into the specification and claims did not involve \u201cnew matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>The exact basis for the second ground of rejection is not entirely clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The examiner stated the essence of his rejection as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-5\">\u201cThe specification is held to be incomplete, inadequate and not in accordance with Rule 71(b) in that it fails to describe completely a specific embodiment of the package on which appellant predicates patentability; namely it fails to even mention, let alone give specific data as to the size and number of openings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">The board, stating the above rejection substantially as did the examiner, referred to the fact that appellant\u2019s briei on appeal before that body stated: \u201cthat the number of the perforations may vary from 44 to 1,241 and that the size of the perforations may range from .0013 to .003 square inches for a particular type of rice.\u201d The board then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">\u201cThis type of data, we believe, should have been included in the original specification <em>in order to constitute compliance with Rul\u00e9 71 (b) </em>and to give proper guidance to one skilled in the art <em>so that such persons could produce the article with a minimum amount of experimentation.\u201d </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">On reconsideration the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-9\">\u201cIt is not possible to derive any instruction .from the specification which would be equivalent to the \u2018best mode\u2019 or the \u2018specific embodiment\u2019 of 35 U.S.C. 112 and Rule 71 (b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">The solicitor\u2019s argument appears to be based on the thought that appellant should have \u201cdescribed in the specification a bag having a specified number and size of perforations,\u201d that this would be necessary to produce the appellant\u2019s invention with a minimum amount of \u201cexperimentation,\u201d and that if such information had been supplied, \u201cthe specification would have been held to comply with Rule 71(b) <em>and therefore </em>with the \u2018best mode\u2019 requirement of Section 112. [Emphasis ours.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">We have set forth the Patent Office position in some detail as we feel that it confuses, and in fact is in part contrary to, two of the several requirements of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 This paragraph reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-12\">\u201c[A] The specification shall contain a written description of the invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains, or with which it it most nearly connected, to make and use the same, and shall</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-13\">\u201c[B] set forth the best mode <em>contemplated by the inventor </em>of carrying out his invention.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">The essence of portion [A] is that a specification shall disclose an invention in such a manner as will enable one skilled in the art to make and utilize it. <em>Separate and distinct </em>from portion [A] is portion [B], the essence of which requires an inventor to disclose the best mode <em>contemplated by him, </em>as of the time he executes the application, of carrying out his invention. Manifestly, the sole purpose of this latter requirement is to restrain inventors from applying for patents while at the same time concealing from the public preferred embodiments of their inventions which they have in fact, conceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">As we view portion [B], we think that an inventor is in compliance therewith if he does not conceal what he feels-is a preferred embodiment of his invention. The question of whether an inventor has or has not disclosed what he-feels is his best mode is, however, a question separate and distinct from the question of the <em>sufficiency </em>of his disclosure to satisfy the requirements of portion [A] of section 112, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-16\">What we find confusing about the instant rejection is not what it says, but what it does not say. It does no't object to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>the specification because of failure to comply with Rule 71(a) which is an almost verbatim reproduction of portion [A] of section 112.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both the solicitor and the board, if not the examiner, appear to equate Rule 71(b) in its entirety with portion [B] of section 112.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In doing so, however, we find that they appear to read into portion [B] requirements very similar to those stated in portion [A], and <em>in addition </em>require that the mode disclosed be in fact the <em>optimum </em>mode of carrying out the invention. We find no statutory basis for this position.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">On this point, we note that the board in its original opinion observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ao1-dedup-0\">\u201cIt * * * appears from the oral hearing and amendment, Paper No. 12, pages 3 to 5, that a packet is <em>being marketed </em>which is suitable for one kind of rice in common use. This had 192 holes each .0021 sq. in. in size.\u201d [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">As this observation applies to appellant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose what he felt to be his \u201cbest mode\u201d of carrying out the invention, we merely note that the patent law allows patent applications to be filed when in fact the invention has never been reduced to commercial form. Commonly, they are filed long before commercial embodiments reach the market. Such, from the evidence before us, could have been true in the instant case. We find completely inapposite the board\u2019s statements concerning the configuration and number of the container\u2019s perforations as it is \u201cbeing marketed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">We find it difficult to follow the interpretation placed on the statements of the examiner by the board and the solicitor. Clearly there is nothing to discuss other than what can be the only statutory basis for the instant rejection\u2014 failure to comply with portion [A], supra, of section 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">If we analyze exactly what appellant\u2019s invention is in the instant case, we see that it is in essence a perforated container. Appellant\u2019s invention requires that the container be made of special materials having special characteristics. As previously indicated, we find that the specification adequately discloses what several of these materials may be and their essential characteristics. Appellant\u2019s specification, referring to the desired size of the perforations in the container, also states that \u201cany diameter large enough to accommodate the passage of water or steam particles and small enough to prevent- the entry of foreign matter therethrough is sufficient. Of course, the openings 17 are much smaller than the grains of rice.\u201d Referring to the number and positioning of the perforations, the specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-14\">\u201c * * * the openings need not cover the entire area of the enclosure and may extend through the fold or unseamed margin 12 of the sheet material. The spacing of the openings may vary with the nature of the sheet material to prevent weakening and accidental tearing thereof. Preferably, the openings are arranged in intersecting rows 18 extending diagonally or in non-parallel relation to the margins of the enclosure to prevent undue weakening thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>In view of the above disclosures, it is manifest that appellant does not consider either perforation size, positioning, or number to be particularly crucial aspects of his invention, and that this fact would be appreciated by one skilled in the art who read the instant specification. From the disclosure of appellant\u2019s invention as it appears in the specification alone, we feel that one skilled in the art would be enabled to make and use appellant\u2019s invention without undue experimentation. Such a skilled person, we find, would clearly know that a multiplicity of perforations in the container would be necessary. While appellant\u2019s specification does not disclose the exact number or positioning of such perforations, or their exact size, we think that one skilled in the art \u201ccould produce the article with a minimum amount of experimentation,\u201d if any experimentation at all be necessary. Whatever doubt may exist on this point must, however, be resolved in appellant\u2019s favor in view of the drawings which, in view of the nature of the invention before us, are a very important part of the complete enabling disclosure. We think that they have not been given enough weight in deciding whether the disclosure satisfies this statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">For these reasons we find the instant disclosure in full compliance with the requirements of section 112 designated, supra, as portion [A].</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">One final point remains to be discussed \u2014 the Patent Office requirement based on Rule 71(b) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that a \u201cspecific embodiment\u201d of appellant\u2019s invention be described <em>in the specification. </em>No direct statutory basis exists for this requirement other than portion [A] of section 112, which it appears to implement. The term \u201cspecification\u201d must be taken to include the drawings which are a part of it. In our view the specification in this case contains not only one but two \u201cspecific embodiments\u201d of appellant\u2019s invention. The word \u201cspecific\u201d is a somewhat indefinite term in that it involves a matter of degree \u2014 the question, How specific?, is not answered. Obviously, it is not necessary that an applicant be more specific than is required by section 112, portion [A]. Not every last detail is to be described, else patent specifications would turn into production specifications, which they were never intended to be. United States specifications have often been criticized as too cluttered with details to give an easy understanding of what the invention really is.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">In conclusion, therefore, we hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">(1) that appellant\u2019s noted amendment to the specification does not involve new matters;</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">(2) that no reason exists for holding that appellant failed to disclose what he felt to be the best mode of carrying out his invention at the time of filing;</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">(3) that the disclosure in the specification is such that undue experimentation would not be necessary for one skilled in the art and that this disclosure would be sufficient to enable him to make and use the instant invention; and</p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">(4) that in the instant case appellant\u2019s disclosure in his specification, taken with his disclosure in the drawing, amounts to a disclosure of a specific embodiment of his invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">For these reasons, the decision of the board is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-8\">.
