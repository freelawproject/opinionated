The ap\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>pellant here argues, as he did in the court below in support of a motion for acquittal, that the evidence was insufficient to support the allegation that the obligations were counterfeit. We have reviewed the record and find that the argument is clearly without merit; the spuriousness of the obligations was amply established by competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The judgment of the court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
