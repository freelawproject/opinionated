We have repeatedly stated that such factual determinations are the function of the Board and will not be disturbed unless not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. National Labor Relations Board v. Buitoni Foods Corp., 298 F.2d 169 (C.A.3, 1962); National Labor Relations Board v. Lewisburg Chair &amp; Furniture Co., 230 F.2d 155 (C.A.3, 1956). Of course, this is in accord with the Supreme Court\u2019s direction in Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">A consideration of the entire record in this case convinces us that the findings of the Board are amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">The petition for enforcement will, therefore, be granted, and a form of decree may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
