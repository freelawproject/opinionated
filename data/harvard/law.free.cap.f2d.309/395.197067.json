The defendant, a nonresident of Georgia, removed the case to the United States District Court. Thereafter she moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction because of inadequate process or service thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-20\">The District Court, after extensive hearings and on a record which details every possible relation between such policies and the divorce proceeding, denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to remand. Thereafter the Court dismissed the cause for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">The District Court was right on both scores. Neither ownership nor right to possession of such policies was an issue in, or determined by, the divorce proceedings. The relief sought, by whatever name now described, was not ancillary. It was an independent, separate, new proceeding which the defendant was entitled to remove. Since it was not ancillary, the purported service by mere notice to defendant\u2019s divorce action counsel was inadequate. Dismissal for want of jurisdiction over the defendant was therefore .appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
