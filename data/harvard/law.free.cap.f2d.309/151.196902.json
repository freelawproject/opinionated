Judge Sugarman held that the referee\u2019s order was \u201can interlocutory order lacking the necessary finality that is a condition to any review of such an order.\u201d The attorney for the bankrupt and the attorney for the trustee in bankruptcy, who had been recently appointed, were in the process of attempting to develop before the referee additional evidence which was relevant to whether or not Beol, Inc. should be stayed from the collection of a state court judgment. The attorney for Beol, Inc. knew of the hearing set for January 16, 1962, and that he would be required as a witness at that hearing. Instead of appearing before the referee, the attorney for Beol, Inc. petitioned the district court to review the action of the referee. When Judge Sugarman quite properly denied the petition to review, Beol appealed to this court instead of going forward before the referee. The order of the district court was clearly right as the appellant had by its own actions and the actions of its attorney, precluded a sufficient consideration of the matters then pending before the referee. In such a case there was nothing which required a review of the referee\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
