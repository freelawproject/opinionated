This ruling is assigned as error on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">In support of the district court Graham here contends that he was not a \u201cperson,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 6671(b), since he was simply a member of the corporation\u2019s board of directors, was not employed by the corporation and did not serve as an executive officer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">This is too narrow a reading of the section. The term \u201cperson\u201d does include officer and employee, but certainly does not exclude all others. Its scope is illustrated rather than qualified by the specified examples. In our judgment the section must be construed to include all those so connected with a corporation as to be responsible for the performance of the act in respect of which the violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Graham next contends that he was not a person under \u00a7 6672 \u201crequired to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over\u201d the taxes in question, since he was not a disbursing officer of the corporation and had no authority to draw or sign checks on the corporation\u2019s bank account.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">This again, we feel, is too narrow a construction. The statute\u2019s purpose is to permit the taxing authority to reach those responsible for the corporation\u2019s failure to pay the taxes which are owing. It would make little sense to confine liability to those performing the mere mechanical functions of collection and payment when such functions are performed simply in accordance with the executive judgment of others whose duty it is to decide for the corporation in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">The question is simply whether the board of directors \u201chad the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid, and when.\u201d Wilson v. United States, 9 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 312, 316. Appellee contends that it did not and that the district court has so found.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">In the light of the issues (hereinbefore discussed) upon which this case was tried to the district court \u00e1nd the findings made upon those issues, we regard the court\u2019s determination in this area as inconclusive. Never did the evidence come to grips with the. essential question: whether the board controlled the payment of the corporation\u2019s tax debt or whether this power had by the board been delegated to some officer of the corporation. Nor does it appear that the district court was called upon to find upon this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">Graham contends that irrespective of the outcome upon this issue, he himself did not willfully fail to pay over the taxes due and that the district court has so found.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Here, too, we find the evidence and the determinations of the district court inconclusive in the light of the manner in which the case was tried and the issues apparently tendered to the court for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The court did not find upon the question whether, the board acted to pay other obligations of the corporation in preference to the tax obligation. If such was the action of the board and if the board was, as the United States contends, the corporate authority which approved or disapproved the payment of corporate obligations, it does not appear what the state of Graham\u2019s knowledge was with reference to the unpaid taxes or what he did or did not do in regard to their payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In the light of our views as here expressed, further trial and determination upon decisive issues are required.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-15\">. Section 6671(b) : \u201cPerson defined. The term \u2018person\u2019, as used in this subchapter, includes an officer or employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to .perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-16\">Section 6672: \u201cAny person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for, and paid over. No penalty shall be imposed under section 6653 for any offense to which this section is applicable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">. That the district court felt there was some merit to this contention appears from its findings 7 and 8, which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\u201c7. During the period in question plaintiff was not employed in any capacity by the corporation nor did he receive any salary or wages from the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">\u201c8.
