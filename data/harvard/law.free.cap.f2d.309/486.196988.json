The court below denied the motion on the ground that all issues raised on this motion either were or could have been presented in the appeal of Morris\u2019 conviction, wherein he was ably represented by counsel of the Legal Aid Society. United States v. Morris, 269 F.2d 100 (2 Cir.1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 885, 80 S.Ct. 159, 4 L.Ed.2d 122 (1959), or are stated in conclusory terms with no substantiating facts, or are irrelevant to proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Although notice of appeal was filed on May 31, 1962, the appellant\u2019s request for assignment of counsel did not reach us until the day this case was submitted on the briefs, without argument, of which date the appellant had been given due notice. We find the claims of the appellant so lacking in merit that there is no need to assign counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
