After defendant filed a retraction of the alleged libels, which concerned plaintiff\u2019s activities as trustee of a college, Judge McGohey, on defendant\u2019s consent, entered a judgment in December, 1956, forever enjoining and restraining defendant from uttering or publishing \u201cany of the libels or defamation in said complaint as amended, or any of the statements disclaimed by defendant in said retraction.\u201d Four years later plaintiff moved to punish defendant for contempt of the injunction through further publication of the alleged libels. After proceedings which it is unnecessary to detail, Judge Herlands found defendant in contempt, and, as an alternative to commitment on August 11, 1961, accepted defendant\u2019s deposit of $5,000 as a bond \u201cfor compliance with judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-18\">Any tranquility thus secured was of short duration. The instant motion alleges that in February, 1962, defendant sent certain communications, claimed by plaintiff to repeat libels within the scope of the injunction, to the president of a company of which the corporation plaintiff had served as executive vice president is now a subsidiary. The president of the parent passed them on to the president of the subsidiary, who was already familiar with the matter and returned them to plaintiff. The motion sought a declaration of defendant\u2019s contempt, forfeiture of the $5,000, payment of the expenses of the litigation, and such further sanctions as would \u201cmost effectively and appropriately coerce the defendant into future compliance.\u201d Not being convinced that the Communications were within the injunction, Judge Dawson denied the motion, saying that if there should be any future violations, the plaintiff might move again. The appeal is from this order of denial. Since the motion was made after the conclusion of the principal action rather than in its course, denial of the motion was a \u201cfinal decision\u201d and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. International Silver Co. v. Oneida Community, Ltd., 93 F.2d 437, 441 (2 Cir. 1937); see Parker v. United States, 153 F.2d 66, 69, 163 A.L.R. 379 (1 Cir. 1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">Appellant\u2019s principal argument is that Judge Dawson applied too strict a standard in saying he had to be convinced of the violation of the injunction \u201cbeyond peradventure of doubt.\u201d Appellant says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>this is the test for criminal rather than civil contempt; as to the latter, he argues, it is enough that a plaintiff establish \u201ca violation of the spirit of the injunction, even though its strict letter may not have been disregarded.\u201d John B. Stetson Co. v. Stephen L. Stetson Co., 128 F.2d 981, 983 (2 Cir. 1942). Appellant urges that application of what he claims to be the correct standard would bring the communications within the injunction, even if they were not there under a stricter one as he also claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The gap between the quantum of proof required for criminal and for civil contempt is not so wide as appellant urges \u2014 naturally not, since an order of civil contempt may also lead to imprisonment. The standards for both types of contempt proceeding were well stated by Judge Hutcheson in Coca-Cola Co. v. Feulner, 7 F.Supp. 364, 365 (S.D.Texas, 1934): In criminal contempt, \u201cno contempt order will issue unless the defendant is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; in civil contempt, although the reasonable doubt requirement does not prevail, \u201ca bare preponderance of the evidence will not suffice * * *. Proof of violation must be clear and convincing.\u201d Accord, Telling v. Bellows-Claude Neon Co., 77 F.2d 584 (6 Cir.), cert. denied, 296 U.S. 594, 56 S.Ct. 108, 80 L.Ed. 420 (1935), and see the cases collected in Moskovitz, Contempt of Injunctions, Civil and Criminal, 43 Colum.L.Rev. 780, 818-819 (1943). Cf. Oriel v. Russell, 278 U.S. 358, 362-363, 49 S.Ct. 173, 73 L.Ed. 419 (1929). Applying Judge Hutcheson\u2019s formulation, we still reach Judge Dawson\u2019s result. We thus have no occasion to consider whether, if we took a contrary view as to violation of the injunction, affirmance would not still be required because of the questionable propriety of a Federal court\u2019s assuming policing functions with respect to utterances of the character here at issue, even with the consent of the parties. See Kuhn v. Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., 29 F.Supp. 800 (S.D.N.Y.1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
