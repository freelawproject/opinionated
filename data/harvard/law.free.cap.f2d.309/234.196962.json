During this time Morgan made numerous appearances in the courts of the District of Columbia representing defendants in criminal cases. He was tried and convicted on thirteen counts of an indictment:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-21\">Three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by concealing his name, identity, and non-admission to the bar before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia;</p>\n<p id=\"b287-22\">Four counts of violating 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1303 by falsely impersonating Lawrence Archie Harris, a duly authorized attorney, before the United States District and Municipal Courts for the District of Columbia;</p>\n<p id=\"b287-23\">Three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 . 494 by forging the name L. A. Harris on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>praecipes by which he entered his appearance in cases;</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">One count of violating 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2501 by perjuring himself in taking an oath of admission;</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">One count of violating 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1401 by forging a registration card; and</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Two counts of violating 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1301 by taking money from clients by falsely pretending that he was a licensed attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Concurrent sentences of imprisonment for a total of three to ten years were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">On the appeal, it is contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that imprisonment for three to ten years for a crime, the \u201cgist\u201d of which is \u201cpracticing law without a license,\u201d constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. Governing case law, however, provides no support for this contention. Alternatively, appellant argues that, even if the three to ten year sentence does not violate the Constitution, it is \u201cdisproportionately harsh in relation to the essential nature of the offense\u201d and consequently \u201cthe court should be more inclined to regard as harmful an error otherwise probably harmless\u201d and should construe the penal statutes more narrowly than usual. Assuming arguendo the validity of this proposition,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we still find no error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Nor can we accept appellant\u2019s argument that the applicable statutes must be read to exclude the acts with which he was charged. Appellant contends that neither 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 494 nor 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 1401 applies to his alleged offenses, and that consequently four of the five counts which carried a three to ten year sentence must be dismissed. In support of this contention, it is urged that Congress, in enacting these statutes, intended merely to codify the common law crime of forgery; that forgery at common law required that the forged writing \u201cmust be of apparent legal efficacy to impose * * * or to change a liability\u201d; and that the appearance praecipes and registration card which were filed with the Clerk of the Court and which were allegedly forged in this case are not such writings.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Although Congress may have intended to adopt the common law requirements in regard to some of the elements of forgery, see Gilbert v. United States, 370 U.S. 650, 82 S.Ct. 1399, 8 L.Ed.2d 750 (1962), it seems clear that they did not intend to adopt the common law limitation on the types of writing which could be forged. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 494 explicitly proscribes the forgery of \u201cany bond, bid, proposal, contract, guarantee, security, official bond, public record, affidavit, or other writing * * and 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 1401 covers \u201cany writing of a public or private nature, which might operate to the prejudice of another * * Had Congress intended the statutes to apply only to the types of documents which could be forged at common law, enumeration of the types of writings sought to be included would have been unnecessary. While we intimate no opinion concerning the general applicability of the statutes, we are satisfied that they were intended to include the types of instruments allegedly forged in the instant case. Cf. Prussian v. United States, 282 U.S. 675, 51 S.Ct. 223, 75 L.Ed. 610 (1931); Johnson v. Warden, 134 F.2d 166 (9th Cir. 1943); Head v. Hunter, 141 F.2d 449 (10th Cir. 1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">Appellant further contends that the count charging violations of 22 D.C. Code \u00a7 2501 (which also carries a three to ten year sentence) must be dismissed because that statute is inapplicable to his alleged offenses. The statute applies to an oath or affirmation taken \u201cbefore a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which the law authorized such oath or affirmation to be administered * * And it is argued that there \u201cis no law prescribing\u201d the oath involved in this case. The oath was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>pursuant to Rule 75(a) of <em>the </em>Municipal Court Civil Rules;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and this rule was adopted pursuant to 11 D.C.Code \u00a7 748a which grants the Municipal Court power \u201cto make such rules and regulations as may be deemed necessary and proper for conducting business in said court.\u201d Appellant does not question the validity of the rule'; but he argues that a perjury conviction cannot be predicated on an oath taken pursuant to it, since the oath is \u201cderived from the general house-keeping powers of the clerk\u2019s office, rather than from a statute * * But 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2501 covers oaths \u201cwhich the law authorized,\u201d and an oath taken pursuant to a court rule validly enacted under the clear authority of a statute may be the subject of a perjury conviction under such a provision. See, e. g., United States v. Morehead, 243 U.S. 607, 37 S.Ct. 458, 61 L.Ed. 926 (1917); Johnson v. United States, 26 App.D.C. 128 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Appellant also contends that the three counts predicated on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 must be dismissed, because the alleged concealment did not involve a \u201cmatter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States,\u201d but rather involved a matter solely within the jurisdiction of a District of Columbia court. In support of his argument against a construction of the words \u201cdepartment or agency\u201d which would include courts, appellant points out that such a construction would raise a host of problems not considered by Congress when it enacted the statute. For example, the following rhetorical questions are posed: \u201cDoes a defendant \u2018cover up * * * a material fact\u2019 when he pleads not guilty?\u201d \u201cDoes an attorney \u2018cover up\u2019 when he moves to exclude hearsay testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf of a client he knows to be guilty?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">Were we examining the statute without the benefit of prior Supreme Court construction, perhaps we would agree with appellant that Congress did not intend it to apply to courts (especially in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 6 which states that the term \u201cdepartment\u201d means \u201cone of the executive departments * * * unless the context shows that such term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government\u201d). But the Supreme Court has explicitly stated, in Bramblett v. United States, 348 U.S. 503, 509, 75 S.Ct. 504, 99 L.Ed. 594 (1955), that the \u201ccontext\u201d of \u00a7 1001 \u201ccalls for an unrestricted interpretation\u201d and that the word \u201c \u2018department,\u2019 as used in this context, was meant to describe the executive, legislative <em>and judicial branches of Government.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms \u201cconceals or covers up.\u201d We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the \u201cadministrative\u201d or \u201chousekeeping\u201d functions, not the \u201cjudicial\u201d machinery of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">We have also examined the other statutes under which appellant was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and find no ground for holding them inapplicable to the conduct charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Finally, appellant contends that, although he was competent to stand trial, he was incompetent to act as his own chief counsel. It is correctly urged that different criteria of competency are required for standing trial, and for acting as one\u2019s own chief counsel. But the record before us does not warrant reversal on this ground.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-15\">. See United States v. Hoffman, 137 F.2d 416, 442 (2d Cir. 1943); United States v. Trypuc, 136 F.2d 900 (2d Cir. 1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">. Rule 75(a), Municipal Court Civil Rules, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">\u201cThe bar of this court shall consist of any person who is a member of the bar of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in good standing, unless disbarred or suspended by action of this court, provided such person shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">\u201c(1) Take and subscribe to the following oath or affirmation, viz.:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">\u201c \u2018I,-, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a member in good standing of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, having been duly admitted on the-day of-, 19 \u2014 ; that I have not been suspended or disbarred by any Court; that I 'will demean myself as an attorney and counsellor of this Court uprightly and according to law; and that I will support the Rules of this Court, the laws of the District of Columbia, and the Constitution of the United States.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-18\">. Appellant refers to matters dehors the record in support of this point. Such matters, including a psychiatric report, have been presented in support of a collateral attack under \u00a7 2255 now pending in the District Court. Our affirmance is without prejudice to the consideration of those matters in the \u00a7 2255 proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
