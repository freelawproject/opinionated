The alleged violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the Act stem exclusively from the activities of New England Web, Inc. The other above-named corporations are included in the present proceedings because of the Board\u2019s determination that all of the respondents constitute a single employer within the meaning of the Act, and consequently, all are jointly responsible for New England Web\u2019s alleged unfair labor practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Board found that New England Web violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by interrogating its employees about their union activity and by threatening them with reprisals for engaging therein. The Board also found that New England Web violated Section 8(a) (3) (5) and (1) of the Act by shutting down its plant, and subsequently proceeding to liquidate its operations, to avoid bargaining with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In making these determinations the Board overruled the findings of the Trial Examiner who, in issuing his Intermediate Beport, found that New England Web had not engaged in the above cited unfair labor practices and recommended that the complaint be dismissed in its entirety. The Trial Examiner also found that the five respondents should not be regarded as a single employer within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The facts giving rise to the alleged violations were substantially as follows. New England Web is a small corporation located in Pawtucket, Bhode Island. It engaged in the manufacture of webbing, employing some thirty-five people, of whom approximately fifteen were weavers. The record indicates that in September 1959 New England Web began to receive an unusually large number of returns of defective merchandise from its customers. Because of this fact the company lost several customers. In the judgment of Clarence W. Jarvis, an officer and director of New England Web, the high rate of defective material which was being turned out could be traced to the fact that the weavers were paid on a \u201cpiece-work\u201d basis rather than on an hourly basis and that, consequently, these workers were more interested in speed than in quality of production. When the situation continued Jarvis decided to place the weavers on a basic hourly rate rather than on piece-work rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">On March 8, 1960 Jarvis summoned the weavers who worked on the first shift (the weavers worked on three shifts) into his office and told them that in an attempt to remedy the quality situation he was going to take all of the weavers off piece-work and pay them by the hour. At this meeting Jarvis explained to the weavers that the work had reached a point where some customers now refused to take any goods that were manufactured by New England Web. Moreover, in order to establish the <em>bona fides </em>of the change in method of compensation, Jar-Vis\u2019 uncontradicted testimony was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-11\">\u201c * * * I showed them the books of the company; I showed them our performance for the month of February, that was atrocious; I showed them letters; I showed them returns of merchandise for credit. I even went so far as to show them some tax returns, to show them that this was not a sham deal and I was telling them nothing but the truth, and not anything I wanted to tell them; we just keep one set of books; I don\u2019t want any inference that this is a put-up job. I showed them all the records from the very beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Beid) Now, Mr. Jarvis, did you have the record books of the corporation before you, did you have them with you? A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-16\">\u201cQ. Were they available to the employees \u2014 A. Yes, they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-17\">\u201cQ. \u2014at the time? A. They were.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-18\">On the following morning, none of the weavers appeared for work because of their apparent dissatisfaction with the suggested new method of compensation. However, a group of them met with Jarvis at the plant and asked him to increase the proposed hourly rate. When Jarvis declined, all of the weavers left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>plant. Shortly thereafter they reconvened at a nearby cafe called \u201cThe Idle Hour\u201d and decided to call in the Union<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to represent them.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">That day, March 9, one Sylvia \u2014 a representative of the Union \u2014 called Jarvis to request recognition of the Union and stated that he had dispatched a letter to Jarvis to that effect. Jarvis replied that the matter was in the hands of his attorney. On the same date Sylvia sent the letter to New England Web, stating that the Union represented a majority of its employees and requesting a conference to negotiate a contract. Sylvia also wrote to the Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board petitioning for a representation election. Later on that same day the weavers set up a picket line outside the company plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">There followed several informal conversations and conferences between representatives of the company and the Union. The company questioned the majority status of the Union, declined a card check and raised an eligibility issue by disputing the appropriate bargaining unit. The State Board then directed an election among the employees, including the strikers. On April 1 the State Board held an election which the Union won and the Union was subsequently certified on April 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The first negotiation meeting between New England Web and the Union was held on April 5. Jarvis advised the Union that New England Web had lost its biggest customer, as well as several others ; that it would not be able to get these customers back; and that, therefore, New England Web was going to liquidate. Jarvis informed the Union that the company wanted six weavers of its own selection (two for each shift) for the purpose of \u201crunning out\u201d the beams that were already in the machines. The company estimated that this work would take from four to six weeks and that the plant would then be closed down.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The next negotiation meeting was held on April 7. Jarvis offered a rate of pay for employees to run out the work and the parties agreed that the six workers who would be needed would be called according to seniority. On the following day, at the employees\u2019 request, the Union advised Jarvis that the employees \u201cwere willing to go back to work,\u201d and that the employees \u201cwanted some assurance that the company would make an attempt to continue in operation.\u201d Jarvis again reiterated his decision to close and indicated that there was no sense in making any statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">On April 14 a Union representative, on behalf of the Union, and each individual employee on strike, sent separate letters to New England Web informing it that th\u00e9 strike was terminated and requesting reinstatement. On the same day a group of strikers went to the company and personally requested reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The company\u2019s decision remained unchanged and finally the company and the Union agreed to the terms for running out the remaining work. A number of workers, selected according to seniority, undertook to run out the work with the Union\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">On May 11, a Union representative called the company\u2019s attorney concerning the negotiation of a contract and at the same time advised him that the Union was filing unfair labor practice charges against the company. In view of the Union\u2019s action in filing the charges, the attorney questioned the utility of meeting for a contract. Nonetheless, a meeting was held on May 11 and despite the company\u2019s reavowal of its intention to close, it requested that the Union submit a written contract for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">A subsequent meeting was held on May 17. Here the discussion centered on the alleged unfair labor practices. However, at the Union\u2019s request, the parties did discuss the Union\u2019s proposed contract. While no definite agreements were reached, New England Web indicated that if it was going to sign a contract it would only be for the duration of the time that New England Web remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>in business \u2014 a time then estimated to be about two weeks. No further meetings were held after this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">From March 9 \u2014 the day that the weavers went out on strike \u2014 -until the Monday following the Union\u2019s election, April 1, New England Web remained in operation; doing business on a restricted basis with workers from other divisions filling in on the weavers\u2019 machines. The plant was closed one week from April 4 to April 11 and thereafter resumed to conclude the \u201crunning out\u201d operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">As we have noted, the Trial Examiner recommended dismissal of the entire complaint. The Trial Examiner, after resolving credibility in favor of the company\u2019s witnesses, found no illicit threats \u2022or interrogation in violation of Section 8(a) (1). He dismissed the Section 8 (a) (3) allegation on finding that New England Web\u2019s shutdown was dictated by economic motives and was free of anti-union motivation. The Section 8(a) (5) allegation was dismissed because the Trial Examiner found no refusal to bargain before the election, no discriminatory animus in the liquidation, and bargaining in good faith as to the running out of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">The Board\u2019s reversal of the Trial Examiner raises two basic issues: (1) Is there substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole that New England Web interrogated its employees and threatened reprisals because of their union activity and (2) was the shutdown of the New England Web plant actuated by legitimate business considerations or was it an artifice to avoid obligations under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">As to the first issue, the Board adopts a view of the Trial Examiner\u2019s treatment of the testimony concerning the alleged threats and reprisals with which we do not agree. The Trial Examiner wrote an extremely comprehensive report covering some forty-three pages of the printed record. In his report, <em>inter alia,, </em>he set forth with particularity all the evidence which was relied on to establish the Section 8(a) (1) violations. He analyzed the body of this evidence and resolved credibility in favor of the respondents\u2019 witnesses. In making these credibility determinations he treated certain witnesses and allegations with greater specificity than others in enumerating the basis and rationalization for his ultimate credibility determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">The Board, however, takes the view that because the Trial Examiner did not set forth an in-depth rationalization as to each of the witnesses that he did not \u201cconsider\u201d their testimony. As to this portion of the evidence the Board reasoned that \u201cthe Trial Examiner merely set out but failed to consider [the testimony] .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">We find no basis in this record that the Trial Examiner failed to consider any piece of evidence. Eather, in resolving the question in favor of the company\u2019s witnesses he stated that he believed that in many respects their memory was far better \u201cthan that of <em>certain witnesses including </em>Lisi, Welch and Cirillo [Union witnesses].\u201d (Emphasis supplied). He went on to point out that \u201cthese witnesses <em>particularly </em>did not impress\u201d him for reasons which he proceeded to enumerate.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">It is plainly obvious that the Trial Examiner\u2019s allusion to the testimony of the enumerated witnesses, Lisi, Welch and Cirillo, was not meant to be exhaustive but illustrative. The tone of his language calls for no invocation of the canon of construction that <em>Inclusio TJnius Est Exclusio Alterius, </em>as the Board seems to have believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-13\">Some of the testimony which the Board relied on to overturn the Trial Examiner was of the precise ilk on which the latter had made specific credibility findings in favor of the company. Another portion which the Board found to substantiate the charge had, on cross examination, actually received \u201cits own death wound.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Pittsburgh, S.S. Co., 337 U.S. 656, 660, 69 S.Ct. 1283, 1285, 93 L.Ed. 1602 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>In short; the Trial Examiner\u2019s report \u2014 his analysis of the evidence and his citation of the relevant cases\u2014 showed an acute awareness of the principles which govern the conduct proscribed by Section 8(a) (1) of the Act. On this record we are unwilling to upset his determinations of credibility either directly or by the more circuitous method of speculating that portions of the evidence detailed with particularity were \u201cmerely set out\u201d but not \u201cconsider [ed].\u201d As the Supreme Court has so recently reminded us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\">\u201cBut the Examiner' \u2014 * * * sees the witnesses and hears them testify, while the Board and the reviewing court look only at cold records. As we said in the Universal Camera case [340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201c <em>&lt; </em>* * * ipjjg fin(jingS \u2022 0f the examiner are to be considered along with the consistency and inherent pi'obability of testimony. The significance of his report, of course, depends largely on the importance of credibility in the particular case.' 340 U.S., at 496 [71 S.Ct. at 489].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARcu\">\u201cFor the demeanor of a witness</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHK\">\u201c <em>\u2018 </em>* * * may satisfy the tribunal, not only that the witness\u2019 testimony is not true, but that the truth is the opposite of his story; for the denial of one, who has a motive to deny, may be uttered with such hesitation, discomfort, arrogance, or defiance, as to give assurance that he is fabricating, and that, if he is, there is no alternative but to assume the truth of what he denies.\u2019 Dyer v. MacDougall [2 Cir.], 201 F.2d 265, 269.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">National Labor Relations Board v. Walton Mfg. Co., 369 U.S. 404, 408, 82 S.Ct. 853, 855, 7 L.Ed.2d 829 (1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">We turn then to the second aspect of the case \u2014 the question of whether substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that a purpose of the New England Web shutdown and liquidation was to avoid the duty to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Here again the Board disagreed with the findings of the Trial Examiner. After an exhaustive review of the evidence bearing on this issue, the Trial Examiner concluded that \u201cthe General Counsel has failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the Respondent, New \u25a0 England Web, or any one of the other Respondent Corporations, failed to bargain collectively in good faith with the Union.\u201d The Trial Examiner found that New England Web\u2019s contention that the shutdown was actuated by economic motives was bona fide. In rejecting the General Counsel\u2019s argument that the circumstances showed union animus and hostility, the Trial Examiner concluded that \u201cToo much surmise and inference as to employer motivation is necessary in order to warrant a finding of bad faith.\u201d Again, we believe that the Trial Examiner\u2019s findings are both factually and legally correct and that the Board\u2019s conclusions to the contrary are not supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-12\">We start with the proposition that a businessman still retains the untrammeled prerogative to close his enterprise when in the exercise of a legitimate and justified business judgment he concludes that such a step is either economically desirable or economically necessary. This prerogative exists quite apart from whether or not there is a union on the scene. \u201cA company may suspend its operations * * * so long as its change in operations is not motivated by the illegal intention to avoid its obligations under the National Labor Relations Act. A change in operations motivated by financial or economic reasons is not an unfair labor practice under the Act.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Lassing, 284 F.2d 781, 783 (6th Cir., 1960), cert. den., 366 U.S. 909, 81 S.Ct. 1085, 6 L.Ed.2d 235 (1961). An ordinary act of business management cannot be set aside by the Board. National Labor Relations Bd. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Houston Chronicle Pub. Co., 211 F.2d 848, 855 (5th Cir., 1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In determining whether the shutdown was justified, we first note that there is nothing in the record indicating a prior history of Union opposition or hostility on the part of New England Web. The presence or absence of this factor is always relevant in questions of this nature. See N. L. R. B. v. Lassing, supra; cf. N. L. R. B. v. Corning Glass Works, 293 F.2d 784 (1st Cir., 1961); and N. L. R. B. v. R. C. Mahon Company, 269 F.2d 44, 47 (6th Cir., 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Assuredly among those factors which would induce a \u201clegitimate\u201d business judgment to close operations, few can exceed financial distress. Here the record indicates that due to the production of defective merchandise, New England Web had experienced serious customer dissatisfaction \u2014 resulting in the loss of customers and a consequent and predictable loss in revenues. At the March 8, 1960 meeting with the weavers \u2014 even before the advent of the Union \u2014 Jarvis showed the workers the books of the company and the tax returns to indicate the seriousness of this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Moreover, at the hearing before the Trial Examiner Jarvis testified at length on cross examination by the General Counsel as to the financial condition of New England Web. He testified that the company had lost $8,000 in February 1960, and was approaching the point where it could scarcely meet its current obligations as they fell due. He further testified that New England Web had obtained a chattel mortgage which required a payment of from $1400 to $1500 per month. Because of the precariousness of its cash position, New England Web was forced to sell two of its \u201ccovering machines\u201d in order to realize sufficient funds to keep abreast of its monthly payments. Accounts receivable were approximately $3,000 to $3,500 while accounts payable were between $8,000 and $9,000. In reply to a question from General Counsel as to whether New England Web was solvent \u2014 Jarvis replied that the answer to this question would turn upon the amount of money that could be realized upon the sale of the looms in liquidation. Jarvis expressed the hope that the looms could be sold for a price which would enable New England Web to satisfy its current liabilities and also the balance on the chattel mortgage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-12\">In short, we have no hestitation in agreeing with the Trial Examiner that \u201cthe facts plainly disclose the financial distress of New England Web.\u201d While it is true that there is no evidence in the record that the company had formally considered closing down operations prior to the advent of the Union, it is equally true that the officers felt that some decisive measures were necessary to avert the rapidly deteriorating economic position of the company. The decision to change the mode of compensation was significant evidence of this. When this decision \u2014 far from immediately ameliorating the company\u2019s economic position-caused a walkout and a strike by the weavers and their subsequent unionization, then this was assuredly a new factor to be considered by the New England Web management in determining a future course of action. Viewed in the context of the shaky financial status with which New England Web was confronted, a decision \u2014 at that point \u2014 to go on no more cannot be said to be inherently implausible. As was stated by the court in N. L. R. B. v. Lassing, supra: \u201cThe advent of the Union was a new economic factor which necessarily had to be evaluated by the respondent as a part of the overall picture pertaining to costs of operation.\u201d 284 F.2d 781 at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">Certainly the company could reasonably expect the advent of the Union to affect its already precarious cost picture. The record indicates that the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>act of the Union representative following the Union election on April 1 was to broach the subject of wages to Jarvis. Moreover, at the first bargaining session following the unionization \u2014 April 5\u2014 a union representative indicated to Jarvis that the workers would not return to New England Web for the wages which it had been previously offering. Again, in the language of the Court in Lassing, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-4\">\u201cIt is completely unrealistic in the field of business to say that management is acting arbitrarily or unreasonably in changing its method of operations based on reasonably anticipated increased costs, instead of waiting until such increased costs actually materialize.\u201d Id., at 783.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">While, subsequently, the Union and the weavers indicated some flexibility on wages, by then the decision to close down had been announced by New England Web.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Moreover, as noted, this decision to terminate activities was announced to the Union at a negotiation meeting and thereafter the company and the Union mutually discussed the number of employees that would be needed to \u201crun out\u201d the woi'k, the rate of pay and the seniority of these workers. When the Union interjected a complaint about the status of a particular worker, the company took the action which the Union requested. In sum, the company notified the Union of its decision and proceeded to negotiate the details of the run out of work. There was no unilateral action by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The Board takes the position that the alleged shutdown was actually a subterfuge uxxder which work done at New England Web was shifted to another company in which Jarvis had an interest. We have reviewed this evidence in detail and again agree with the Trial Examiner who concluded: \u201cthat the manner of interchange of work between New England Web and National Webbing was no different in practice after April 13 than it was prior to the strike. The only difference, not material to the issues here, seems to be that such interchange was effected during a time when it had been decided to run out all orders of New England prior to liquidation of its business. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we believe that New England Web committed none of the unfair labor practices found by the Board. Having made this determination, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the four other corporations included in the complaint are to be regarded as a \u201csingle employer\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Neither is it necessary for us to consider the scope of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">A decree will be entered setting aside the order of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-13\">. Rhode Island State Joint Board, Textile Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\">. The record indicates that the books of New England Web were available to General Counsel at the hearing if there was any question as to the correctness of Jarvis\u2019 figures. General Counsel apparently raised no such question. Since the figures are uneontradieted, we accept them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
