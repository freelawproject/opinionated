The travel resulting in the expenses with which we are presently concerned occurred during such a sabbatical period.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The record supports the findings of the Tax Court that the taxpayer\u2019s activities on his trip abroad were not different from those reasonably expected of any other tourist of his age on a sightseeing trip abroad, that no report thereof was required by or submitted to the university, that many of his fellow faculty members did not travel during their sabbatical summer (and in no known instance has one ever been discharged for that reason), and that the taxpayer was not required to travel in Europe or elsewhere during the year in question to retain his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Assuming, as did the Tax Court, that foreign travel would be culturally broadening and therefore of benefit not only to the taxpayer individually but also to the university because of the potential increase in his teaching accomplishment, and that the taxpayer might thereby qualify for promotion, no justification for the claimed deduction as ordinary and necessary business expense appears. (See Robert M. Kamins, 25 T.C. 1238 (1956); Knut F. Larson, 15 T.C. 956 (1950); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933).)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the Tax Court\u2019s judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
