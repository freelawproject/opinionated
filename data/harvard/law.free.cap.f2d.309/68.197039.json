In its complaint, filed in the Massachusetts state court and removed, the plaintiff alleged that it was a real estate broker; that the defendant engaged it \u201cto find a customer\u201d at a specified price for a certain property owned by him in Massachusetts ; that plaintiff did find a \u201ccustomer [who] informed the plaintiff in behalf of his corporation that it was ready, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>able and willing to purchase said property,\u201d but that defendant did not so convey the property or pay plaintiff its commission. The pleader\u2019s looseness as to the identity of the \u201ccustomer\u201d permeates this appeal. The evidence most favorable to the plaintiff shows, at best, that plaintiff persuaded the president of a corporation to say that the corporation would purchase the property; that the president was authorized to look for property, and to recommend, but not to contract; that authority to purchase was in a board of fifteen trustees; that no more than four trustees even knew of this property, and that a majority of the board, either formally or informally, never authorized or ratified the president\u2019s alleged agreement. It is thus clear that plaintiff\u2019s \u201ccustomer\u201d was the corporation, and that the only undertaking approaching an agreement was by an officer who was not authorized to bind it.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s otherwise detailed brief omits mention of the fact that defendant\u2019s obligation was based upon \u201cany offer that is accepted.\u201d Assuming that an oral, and therefore not binding, acceptance may be enough, cf. Walker v. Russell, 1922, 240 Mass. 386, 391, 134 N.E. 388; Leland v. Barber, 1917, 228 Mass. 144, 117 N.E. 33; but cf. MacDonald v. Mihalopoulos, 1958, 337 Mass. 260, 149 N.E.2d 138, it must in any event be unconditional and unqualified. Chapin v. Ruby, 1947, 321 Mass. 512, 74 N.E.2d 12; Doten v. Chase, 1921, 237 Mass. 218, 129 N.E. 363. The expression of willingness by an unauthorized agent, never confirmed by the principal, falls far short of an unqualified acceptance. Cf. Bresnahan v. Brighton Avenue Baptist Church, 1932, 279 Mass. 300, 181 N.E. 202. If, as plaintiff\u2019s argument vaguely suggests, defendant revoked his offer before the corporation acted upon it, revocation of his authority is a risk a broker takes, unless the seller acts in bad faith. Bartlett v. Keith, 1950, 325 Mass. 265, 90 N.E. 308; Doten v. Chase, supra. There is no evidence of bad faith on this record. See Brooks v. Gregory, 1934, 285 Mass. 197, 205, 187 N.E. 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">There is nothing in plaintiff\u2019s point that defendant waived the president\u2019s lack of authority to bind the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\"> The court did not err by excluding hearsay evidence. Since plaintiff was not entitled to go to the jury, any error in the charge \u2014 we do not intimate there was any \u2014 was of no consequence. Nor was there error in the court\u2019s sending the case to the jury, even though it informed counsel it intended later to grant defendant\u2019s motion and to set aside any verdict returned for the plaintiff. On the contrary, this procedure is often a wise and time-saving precaution.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
