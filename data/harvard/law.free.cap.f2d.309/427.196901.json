Lessor built a filling station on the property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and taxpayers sublet the filling station. In 1948, taxpayers exercised their option to purchase the land. The property was condemned by the Chicago Park District in 1954 and the proceeds of the award invested in a one-fourth interest in Florida vacant real estate. Later this vacant property was leased for construction of apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-19\">The question is whether the Florida property was \u201csimilar or related in service or use\u201d to the converted Chicago property so as to qualify for the benefits of \u00a7 1033(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-20\">The Tax Court applied the \u201cfunctional test\u201d by comparing the end use to which the properties were devoted. It decided that the apartment building \u201cservice or use\u201d was not \u201csimilar or related\u201d to the filling station \u201cservice or use.\u201d Taxpayers contend this was not the right test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>and that since they used both properties for investment purposes, the \u201cservice or use\u201d to them was \u201csimilar or related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The question is new in this Circuit. It has, however, been considered in four Circuits:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Steuart Brothers, Inc. v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 261 F.2d 580 (1958); McCaffrey v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 275 F.2d 27 (1960); Liant Records, Inc. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 303 F.2d 326 (1962); Loco Realty Co. v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 306 F.2d 207 (1962) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Loco, the Eighth Circuit presents an exhaustive survey of all the pertinent cases in the Tax Court and the District Courts, as well as the Courts of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In Steuart (Fourth Circuit) the converted property was vacant but was committed to leases for warehouses, a retail grocery store, offices and parking space. The replacement property consisted of an automobile sales room, a parking and used car lot, garages, and a service station. The court there, in reversing the Tax Court\u2019s decision against the taxpayer, set up a double standard to test the availability of the benefit of the section to a taxpayer: if the taxpayer actually used the converted property, that use must be compared to the use of the replacement property and the comparisons must show a similarity; if the taxpayer did not himself use the property before and after conversion, a comparison of investments before and after should show a similarity. The court concluded that taxpayer\u2019s real estate before and after \u25a0condemnation was held by it for investment purposes and the proceeds of the \u25a0condemnation invested in real estate of the same general class.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">In McCaffrey (Third Circuit), the converted property was used solely as a public parking lot and the replacement property for warehouse space, with incidental private parking. The court did not dispute taxpayer\u2019s contention that he held the properties for investment only. In affirming the Tax Court\u2019s decision for the Commissioner, the Third Circuit decided that the properties were not similar \u201cphysically or otherwise,\u201d and were not similar in class since both were not industrial. Therefore, the court concluded, the properties were not \u201csimilar or related in service or use.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">In Liant (Second Circuit), the converted property was an office building and it was replaced by three apartment buildings. Taxpayers held the properties for rental income, and did not occupy them. The court pointed out the intention of Congress to postpone the tax on the gain of an involuntary conversion. But the court said that conversion should not give the taxpayer an opportunity to \u201calter the nature of his investment tax free.\u201d The question under \u00a7 1033(a), it said, was whether the replacement and converted property were \u201csimilar or related in service or use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The court concluded that since Congress intended a taxpayer-owner to maintain \u201ccontinuity of interest\u201d and not to alter the nature of his investment tax free \u201cit is the service or use which the properties have to the taxpayer-owner that is relevant.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It set forth a \u201csingle test to be applied to both users and investors, i. e., a comparison of the services or uses of the original and replacement properties <em>to the taxpayer-owner.\u201d </em><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>applying the test the court said there must be a comparison of, among other things,-the extent and type of the lessor\u2019s management activity, amount and kind of services he rendered to tenants and the nature of his business risks connected with the properties. The court buttressed its conclusion by a comparison of the language of \u00a7 1033(a), involuntary conversion, and \u00a7 1031, voluntary exchange of \u201cproperty held * * * for investment\u201d for property of a \u201clike kind.\u201d Both sections have tax postponement benefits. The \u201clike kind\u201d qualification, said the court, has received a much broader interpretation than \u201csimilar or related in service or use.\u201d The court added that in 1958, Congress amended \u00a7 1033(a) and made the \u201clike kind\u201d qualification applicable to condemnation of real estate \u201cheld * * * for investment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It reversed the Tax Court\u2019s decision against the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In Loco (Eighth Circuit), the converted property was light manufacturing building and the replacement property office and warehouse, both held for investment. The Tax Court\u2019s decision against the taxpayer-owner was reversed. The court avoided the McCaffrey \u201cend use\u201d by tenants test, as well as an extreme statement of the Steuart and Li-</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">ant doctrine that both properties need only qualify as investments. The test used by the court was made up of the tests in the Steuart and Liant cases: it is sufficient if in addition to the \u201cleasehold characteristics\u201d there is a reasonable similarity to the properties themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">We think the Liant decision of the Second Circuit is most persuasive. Its view is apparently the one Congress adopted in 1958 in its amendment of \u00a7 1033(a). It is the \u201ccontinuity of interest\u201d which is the key factor. Presumably the taxpayers here would have continued their lessor interest in the converted property had it not been interrupted by the condemnation. In view of the involuntary conversion. Congress intended to aid such taxpayers by permitting them to place themselves in a \u201csimilar or related\u201d position to that held when the property was converted and to continue thereby the interest they held when the condemnation took place. At that time the \u201cservice or use\u201d to taxpayers was production of rental income. The \u201cservice or use\u201d of the replacement property to them is \u201csimilar or related.\u201d The replacement did not \u201calter the nature\u201d of their investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">For the reasons given, the decision of the Tax Court is Reversed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">. Section 1033(a) provides, in general, that gains resulting from the involuntary ' conversion of property are not immediately \u201crecognized\u201d for tax purposes if the requirements of the section are met. The provision immediately affecting the \u25a0case at bar is subsection (3) (A), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">\u201c(A) <em>Nonrecognition of gain. </em>\u2014 If the taxpayer during the period specified \u25a0* * * for the purpose of replacing the property so converted, purchases other property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted * * * the gain shall be recognized only to the extent that the amount realized upon such conversion * * * exceeds the cost of such other property * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-24\">. Although the government\u2019s brief indicates that the taxpayers built the filling station, the record shows that the lessor built it under the terms of the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-10\">. The question is pending in the Sixth Circuit, Clifton Investment Co. v. Commissioner, 36 T.C. 569 (1961); and in the Ninth Circuit, Filippini v. United States, 200 F.Supp. 286 (N.D.Cal. 1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-11\">. There is a basic difference of opinion between the Third Circuit and the Second, Fourth and Eighth Circuits, and among the latter three there are shades of difference in the tests applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b481-15\">. And the court said \u201cit is manifest\u201d that this conclusion served the purpose of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b481-16\">. The court applied the functional test as relating only to \u201cthe \u2018purpose\u2019 or nature of the properties themselves,\u201d and rejected the test argued for by the taxpayer, that \u201cthe nonrecognition of gain provisions * * * are available to him * * * because both properties were used by him for the same \u2018use\u2019 \u2014 the production of rental income.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b481-20\">. 303 F.2d 326, at 328.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b481-21\">. Id., at 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b482-5\">. Section 1033 was amended in 1958 by the addition of subsection (g). The amendment, which was prospective only, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cFor purposes of subsection (a), if real property * * * held for productive use in trade.or business or for investment is (as the result of its seizure, requisition, or condemnation, or threat or imminence thereof) compulsorily or involuntarily converted, property of a like kind to be held either for productive use in trade or business or for investment shall be treated as property similar or related in service or use to the property so converted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The Senate Finance Committee made the following comments on the amended section:</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">As a result your committee has added a new subsection to the involuntary conversion (sec. 1033) provision of present law. In this new subsection it has added the \u201clike kind\u201d test of the voluntary exchange of business property rule of present law as an alternative in the case of involuntary conversions for the rule requiring the substitution of property \u201csimilar or related in service or use.\u201d The \u201clike kind\u201d rule in this case applies, however,' only in the case of real property, does not include inventory or property held primarily for sale, and is limited to seizures, requisitions, condemnations, or the threat or imminence thereof. 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News pp. 4861-4862 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b482-15\">. The Tax Court found that taxpayers had nothing to do with operation of either improvement and did not see the Chicago property for many years when they owned it. This obviates any necessity of remanding for testimony of the comparative purposes set out in Liant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
