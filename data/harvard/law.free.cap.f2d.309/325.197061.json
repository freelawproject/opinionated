This premise was satisfied at a later stage in the case when the plaintiff\u2019s wife testified on his behalf that the plaintiff had been in a prior accident but had suffered no substantial injuries. Consequently, it cannot be said that the question was proved improper \u2014 as suggesting the plaintiff was \u201caccident prone or claim conscious\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u2014when the defendant failed to adduce evidence of a previous injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">At all events, we cannot say that the propounding of the question, even if objectionable, was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
