The court based its denial of bail upon the ground that the appeals were \u201cfrivolous or taken for delay\u201d within the meaning of Rule 46(a) (2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court expressly declined to certify that there was substantial risk that either defendant would flee if released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-23\">Among the grounds of appeal asserted by both defendants are certain alleged errors which are also presented in the earlier appeal of a co-defendant, Philip Weinstein, now pending in this court. Another panel of this court has recently granted defendant Weinstein\u2019s motion for release on bail, and has thus necessarily determined that the common grounds of appeal are sufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 46(a) (2). Accordingly, the motions of defendants Lassiter and Barnard for bail pending appeal must also be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>An examination of a partial transcript of the proceedings before the District Court on the motions for bail pending appeal suggests that the court may have tested the sufficiency of the grounds for bail pending appeal by standards applied prior to the 1956 amendment of Rule 46 (a) (2). The Rule then authorized release on bail pending appeal only if a substantial question was presented for review; it now provides that bail may be allowed unless it appears that the appeal is frivolous or taken for delay. The purpose of the amendment was to liberalize the granting of bail pending appeal by establishing \u201ca much lighter standard than the-old one of \u2018substantial question.\u2019 \u201d Fiano v. United States, 259 F.2d 135, 136 (9th Cir. 1958), cert. denied 361 U.S. 964, 80 S.Ct. 593, 4 L.Ed.2d 545. See also Ward v. United States, 76 S.Ct. 1063, 1064-1065, 1 L.Ed.2d 25 (1956); United States v. Allied Stevedoring Corp., 76 S.Ct. 1068, 1069, 1 L.Ed.2d 23 (1956). An appeal is not \u201cfrivolous\u201d within the meaning of Rule 46(a) (2) if it is \u201ctaken in good faith\u201d within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, authorizing proceedings in forma pauperis. Wagner v. United States, 250 F.2d 804, 805 (9th Cir. 1957), cert. denied 360 U.S. 936, 79 S.Ct. 1459, 3 L.Ed.2d 1548. The Supreme Court has held that the \u201cgood-faith\u201d test of Section 1915 \u201cmust not be converted into'a requirement of a preliminary showing of any particular degree of merit. Unless the issues raised are so frivolous that the appeal would be dismissed in the case of a nonindigent litigant, Fed.Rules Crim. Proc. 39(a), the request of an indigent for leave to appeal in forma pauperis must be allowed.\u201d Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674-675, 78 S.Ct. 974-975, 2 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1958). It follows under our decision in Wagner that the same standard is to be applied in determining whether an appeal is frivolous for the purposes of an application for bail pending appeal under Rule 46(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Each of the appellants may be admitted to bail pending disposition of their appeals upon filing an appearance bond in the registry of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in the amount of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,-000.00) by the appellant Barnard, and in the amount of Seven Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($7,500.00) by the appellant Lassiter, approved as to form and execution by any of the Judges of that court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
