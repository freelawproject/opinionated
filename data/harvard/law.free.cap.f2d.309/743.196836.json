This omission was important because the note provided for payment in quarterly installments \u201cbeginning three months from the date hereof\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">The relevant Connecticut statute (Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 49-93 (1958)) requires that, as a condition of its validity, a chattel mortgage contain \u201cthe terms of repayment\u201d. Under Connecticut law this statute must be strictly construed against the mortgagee. Bickart v. Sanditz, 105 Conn. 766, 136 A. 580 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">While there appears to be no direct Connecticut authority on the point here in controversy, the case of Rhode Island Hosp. Nat\u2019l Bank, etc. v. Larson, 137 Conn. 541, 79 A.2d 182 (1951) seems to us to be sufficiently close to be controlling. In that case it was held that a conditional sales agreement in which the day of the month on which payments were to be made was left blank was invalid under a statute requiring that such an agreement, to be valid as against creditors of the vendee, must describe \u201call the conditions of such sale\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-14\">Happily future Connecticut cases will not turn upon such minor technicalities, since Connecticut has now adopted the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
