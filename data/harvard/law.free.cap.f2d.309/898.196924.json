The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its order. We modify the order as hereafter stated and grant enforcement of it so modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">Bon-R, a printer of advertising and sales promotion material, employs about twelve men in its shop. Prior to the events in question, the shop was not unionized. In August 1960, Scrima, an employee, started an organization drive and solicited applications for membership in Sign-Pictorial and Display Union Local 230, Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators &amp; Paperhangers of America, AFL-CIO. On Monday, August 22, Morandi, the union\u2019s business manager sent a telegram to Bon-R claiming that the union represented a majority of the employees and requesting recognition as bargaining representative. After Spiel-man, the president of Bon-R, had been advised of the telegram he came to the shop and called to his office each of the employees in turn and questioned them about their attitude toward the union. The results of the poll contradicted the union\u2019s claim to a majority, and later that afternoon Spielman telephoned Morandi to tell him this. Morandi, according to his testimony, offered to conduct a secret ballot, which offer Spielman refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-19\">The next day, soon after the employees were paid, Spielman called them together and reported the previous day\u2019s events. He made some remarks, the nature of which is in dispute, and asked who was behind the union activity. Scrima admitted that he had brought in the union. Spielman discharged Scrima and walked out. A few moments later he returned and told the employees that Scrima had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>been fired because he was incompetent and not because of his union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Following the filing of charges by Local 230, the Board issued its complaint, which alleged violations by Bon-R of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 140 (1947), as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a) (1), (3). Section 8(a) (1) provides that it shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer to \u201cinterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in\u201d \u00a7 7 of the Act. Section 7, in relevant part, confers on employees \u201cthe right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.\u201d 61 Stat. 140 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157. Section 8(a) (3) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">After a hearing, the trial examiner found that in all the circumstances of the case, the interrogation of employees violated \u00a7 8(a) (1), and recommended an appropriate order. He found that the discharge of Scrima did not violate \u00a7 8 (a) (3) and recommended that that portion of the complaint be dismissed. The Board accepted the examiner\u2019s finding of a violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) but it rejected his finding that the discharge was not a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (3) and 8(a) (1). It issued an order that Bon-R shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-6\">\u201c1. Cease and desist from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-7\">\u201c(a) Discouraging membership in Sign-Pictorial &amp; Display Union, Local 230, Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators &amp; Paperhangers of America, AFL-CIO, or any other labor organization, by discharging any of its employees, or otherwise discriminating in regard to their hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-8\">\u201c(b) Coercively interrogating its employees concerning their union membership or sympathies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-9\">\u201c(c) Threatening its employees that they could not have any union unless it wanted one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-10\">\u201c(d) In any other manner interfering with, restraining or coercing its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization, to form labor organizations, to join or assist Sign-Pictorial &amp; Display Union, Local 230, Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators &amp; Paperhangers of America, AFL-CIO, or any other labor organization. * * * \u201d 134 NLRB No. 38.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">In addition, Bon-R was required to offer to reinstate Scrima with back pay and to post appropriate notices in its plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">We grant enforcement of the order with respect to the provisions prohibiting threats that the employees could not have a union unless management wanted one and requiring the posting of an appropriate notice. In all other respects the order is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">1. The Interrogation of Individual Employees on August 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">The interviews followed a standard pattern. Each lasted for just a few minutes, and the entire process was completed in about an hour. Miss Book, the bookkeeper and a stockholder of Bon-R, and Janz, the foreman, were present at the interviews, the nature of which is well shown by the testimony of Reid, one of the employees.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-16\">\u201c * * * Mr. Spielman told me that he had received a letter from the Union stating that there was a majority of the people that wanted the Union in Bon-R Reproductions and he wanted to know how the fellows felt about it. He had a yellow pad * * * jn front 0f him, with the fellow\u2019s [sic] names on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-17\">\u201cThere was one fellow that went in before me. I was asked to go in after him. And he asked me if I had known anything about the telegram. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>And I told him I hadn\u2019t. And he asked me how I felt about the Union. I told him I didn\u2019t know. I knew nothing about it. I didn\u2019t know anything that was in it for me so, therefore, I told him I wasn\u2019t sure if I did or if I did not want the Union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"awg-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. Did he do any marking on the pad? A. Yes, he had the fellows\u2019 names. He checked the \u2018no\u2019 on my name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-8\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you that he got a letter from the Union or a telegram? Was a telegram envelope on the desk? A. A telegram.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-11\">\u201cQ. About how long did the interview last? A. Two to three minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-12\">\u201cQ. Now, at that interview did Mr. Spielman threaten you with discharge or any other discipline if you were in favor of the Union? A. No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-13\">\u201cQ. Did he promise you any benefits or advantages such as a better job or higher wages if you were against the Union? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-14\">\u201cQ. As a matter of fact, didn\u2019t he state to you that he didn\u2019t care one way or the other whether you were in favor of the Union or against it? A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-15\">\u201cQ. Did he make clear to you that the reason why he was asking your opinion with respect to the Union was so that he would know how to answer the telegram that he had received from the Union? A. More or less I\u2019d say.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">Substantially the same account is given by all the employees, and by Spielman, Miss Book and Janz. There is a variation only in the case of Ford, who testified that after Spielman asked him whether he would be interested in the union, \u201cHe [Spielman] said not that it matters because if he wants the Union in the shop, he will have it. If he doesn\u2019t want it, he won\u2019t have it.\u201d The record is clear that Spielman said nothing else which could be construed as a threat and made no promises of benefit. Three of the employees testified that Spielman stated positively that he was entirely indifferent to the union. Even Scrima, fired in unpleasant circumstances the next day, testified that no threats were made. Ford testified that there were no threats; despite Spielman\u2019s remark to him, Ford said that he would be interested in the union, the only employee to do so. The record thus confirms the trial examiner\u2019s conclusion that the interviews were prompted by the union\u2019s claim to a majority, that they were brief, and that, with the exception of the remark to Ford, they were conducted without any suggestion that Spielman had any antipathy toward the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-18\">2. The Telephone Conversation with Morandi.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-19\">Spielman had reason to telephone Morandi following his poll of the employees, since the result of the poll contradicted the union claim. Most of the conversation concerned this conflict. Morandi testified, and the trial examiner believed him, that when he offered to conduct a secret ballot, Spielman replied that no union would come into his shop unless he wanted it to.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-20\">3. The Meeting of August 23 and Scrima\u2019s Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b953-21\">In the middle of the afternoon, Spiel-man called the men together in the shipping room, where they were having a coffee break. He told them that despite the negative result of his poll, the union still claimed a majority. What happened next is in dispute except as to its outlines. The trial examiner accepted Spielman\u2019s account, with one modification. Spielman testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-22\">\u201cPhil Scrima at one point said that he was behind the whole thing and that he was very familiar with the thing, with the union. And I had asked him at that point, I said, \u2018Well, I asked you yesterday what you knew about it and at that time I was interested in information. Why hadn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>you told me ? You were emphatically no against this.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-4\">\u201cHe said this \u2014 these were his words, \u2018They had told me not to say anything.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-5\">\u201cI said, \u2018Who is they? I thought you were working for me. I don\u2019t know any they.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you go to work for they?\u2019 That was it. I said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you leave ?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\">\u201cBut at that point I was absolutely completely upset for anyone to tell me that someone else told him not to tell me the truth. I must have been very emotional. I just walked away from the meeting at that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">There is little variation in the accounts of the employees, except that they testified, and the trial examiner found, that Spielman did say just before or just after he fired Scrima that no union would come in unless he wanted it to, or words to that effect. The testimony of the employees also indicates that Scrima\u2019s admission of responsibility for the union\u2019s presence was probably prompted by Spiel-man\u2019s asking who had initiated the drive and was not, as Spielman\u2019s account suggests, volunteered.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">A few minutes after Spielman walked out of the room, he returned and told the employees that Scrima was fired because he was an incompetent worker who was damaging his machine and not because he was a union organizer. After he had left again, the men stood around for a few minutes and Janz, the foreman, said something to the effect that if the shop were unionized their salaries might be lower because they would be paid according to the union scale. With that the meeting ended and the men returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">4. The Background of Scrima\u2019s Discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">The record is replete with evidence that Scrima was incompetent and uncooperative. The trial examiner said that Scrima was \u201cslated for discharge * * * because of inept work virtually dating back to the time of his original employment.\u201d Scrima had been hired about five months earlier to operate a precision printing machine. The examiner\u2019s report states: \u201cScrima never mastered the automatic operation because he was unable or unwilling to adjust the machine and he relied on inefficient manual operation. Such operation resulted in damage to the machine and loss of production.\u201d On numerous occasions the manufacturer of the machine or a maintenance man had to be called in to adjust or repair the machine. \u201cHowever, after 'Scrima\u2019s discharge, the machine has operated satisfactorily and has not been subject to constantly breaking down and repeatedly having to be repaired. There were no longer missing, loose, or broken parts, no wires crossed nor gummed up machinery.\u201d In addition, there is ample evidence, and the trial examiner found, that Scrima did not get along with the other employees. The examiner\u2019s summary, amply supported by the evidence, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-13\">\u201cSuffice it to say Scrima had been constantly having trouble with the machine, as well as with his coworkers, ever since he had been on the job. It is clear from the record that he ineptly and carelessly if not wil-fully mishandled the machine necessitating repeated overhauls and adjustments due to his failure to operate the machine automatically \u2014 for which type operation it was designed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">The record shows that Spielman decided to fire Scrima on the Friday before the events in question, before he knew anything of Scrima\u2019s connection with the union. On that day, Janz told Spielman over the telephone that an important job had been held up because a part was missing from Scrima\u2019s machine, and that Scrima had \u201cfound\u201d the part that morning. Both Janz and Spielman suspected sabotage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Janz recommended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Serima be fired and Spielman said that he would take care of it on Monday when he returned to the shop. On Monday morning, before the union\u2019s telegram was received, Spielman spoke to Miss Book on the telephone. She also recommended that Serima be fired and Spielman said that he would do so when he arrived. The trial examiner concluded that the decision to fire Serima \u201cwas made on Friday, and would have been effectuated on Monday had not press of business on Spielman, and an unexpected turn of events, namely \u2014the advent of the Union \u2014 temporarily diverted him from such action.\u201d There is nothing in the record which casts doubt on this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The Board\u2019s decision should be affirmed if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 463, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). On the other hand, it is our duty to set aside its decision if we \u201ccannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board\u2019s view.\u201d Id. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 465. While this standard is imprecise, it provides as much clarity as the area affords. To elaborate on it by replacing one set of \u201cundefined defining terms,\u201d id. at 489, 71 S.Ct. 456, with another would serve no purpose. All that we can do in fulfilling our function is to indicate as clearly as possible the grounds on which we accept or reject the Board\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\"> Dealing first with that portion of the Board\u2019s order as to which we grant enforcement, we find adequate basis in the entire record to sustain the conclusion that Spielman committed an unfair labor practice in violation of \u00a7 8(a) (1) by telling his employees that they would have no union unless he wanted one. The Board adopted the trial examiner\u2019s finding that Spielman so stated on three occasions within the first two days after he learned of union activity: to Ford during the interview on August 22, to Morandi on the telephone later that day, and at the meeting on August 23 before or after Serima was fired. The examiner noted in his report that Spielman was an \u201cexcitable executive\u201d prone to an \u201cinvoluntary emotional reaction\u201d; and, as discussed more fully hereafter, there is no evidence of an antiunion bias apart from these outbursts. His statements would probably not be characterized as \u201cthreats\u201d in any context except that of a labor dispute. Ford did not so construe them. But both the examiner and the Board chose that characterization and we cannot say that it is entirely without foundation. In any event, the prohibitions of \u00a7 8(a) (1) are not limited to threats, and Spielman\u2019s words, uttered by an employer in the middle of a drive for unionization, do constitute \u201cinterference\u201d with the right to organize.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">There is a further question whether a cease and desist order is warranted by a violation consisting of scattered, ambiguous remarks. See May Department Stores Co. v. N. L. R. B., 326 U.S. 376, 66 S.Ct. 203, 90 L.Ed. 145 (1945). In Canton Carp\u2019s, Inc., 130 NLRB 1451 (1961), the Board found that the employer had threatened economic reprisals against an employee if he did not attempt to secure a favorable result in a Board-conducted election. Despite this clear showing of a violation, it dismissed the complaint, saying that \u201cbecause of the isolated nature of this remark, it would not serve any useful purpose to issue a cease-and-desist order based thereon.\u201d Id. at 1452 (Footnote omitted). See also Atlas Storage Division, P &amp; V Atlas Industrial Center, Inc., 112 NLRB 1175, 1180 (1955), aff\u2019d 233 F.2d 233 (7 Cir., 1956). In other cases, the Board has ruled that \u201cisolated and vagrant\u201d statements or conduct does not even constitute a violation. Playwood Plastics Co., Inc., 110 NLRB 306, 313 (1954); West Texas Utilities Co., Inc., 85 NLRB 1396, 1400 (1949), enforced 87 U.S.App.D.C. 179, 184 F.2d 233 (1950), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 939, 71 S.Ct. 999, 95 L.Ed. 1366 (1951). A substantial inroad will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>be made on the right to express one\u2019s views, National Labor Relations Act \u00a7 8 (c), 61 Stat. 142 (1947), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158 (c), if under pain of Board proceedings and contempt of orders issuing therefrom, an employer (or employee) must control his every word or refrain from speaking altogether. But in view of the short time span in which the remarks were repeated three times, we think subdivision 1(c) of the Board\u2019s order should be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Subdivision 1(b) of the order enjoins Bon-R from \u201ccoercively interrogating its employees concerning their union membership or sympathies.\u201d The asserted factual basis for this order is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACnC\">\u201cNot only does the record show employer threats during the course of the interrogations, but it also appears that Spielman, Respondent\u2019s president, interrogated some employees about the possible union activities of the others and that he persisted in demanding that the employees indicate how they felt about the Union and whether they would like a union in the plant, and this after each had stated he knew nothing about the Union\u2019s telegraphic request for recognition. Moreover, the timing of the interrogations and the fact that the coffee-break meeting sought the same information previously obtained, convinces us that the Respondent conducted these polls for the purpose of interfering with its employee\u2019s union and concerted activities, rather than for the purpose of ascertaining whether the Union represented a majority in order to determine whether to accord it exclusive recognition.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">We do not agree with this statement of the Board which, we think, ignores in letter and spirit the factual conclusions of the trial examiner, who found that the pattern of the interviews was entirely innocent. The only evidence anywhere in the record of \u201cemployer threats\u201d is the single ambiguous statement made to Ford, who did not understand it to be a threat. The Board disregards entirely the unanimous recollection of the employees, all of whom testified that no threats were made. Nor can we find anything coercive in the general questions which Spielman put to his employees; in interviews lasting only a few minutes, it is incredible that there could have been the delving below the surface or persistence which the Board found. As to the timing of the interviews, they followed immediately on Spielman\u2019s being advised of the union\u2019s claim to a majority. There was similar reason for Spielman to seek out his employees a second time, since his noncoercive questions had elicited responses which the union\u2019s business manager contradicted. The circumstances are exactly those in which the Board has held that noncoercive interrogations are permissible. Blue Flash Express, Inc., 109 NLRB 591, 592 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">We find, therefore, as did the trial examiner, that the interviews of August 22, taken by themselves, come within the protection of the so-called Blue Flash doctrine, which permits questioning of employees \u201cunder proper safeguards.\u201d Id. at 593. Every one of the criteria announced in that case has been met: the employer had reason to conduct the interviews, he advised his employees of his reason, he made no threats or promises of benefit. The interviews were short and openly conducted, in a background free of hostility toward unions. See id. at 592-595. See also, e. g., N. L. R. B. v. Firedoor Corp., 291 F.2d 328, 331-32 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 921, 82 S.Ct. 242, 7 L.Ed.2d 136 (1961), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-9\">Although the trial examiner concluded that Blue Flash was inapplicable in the circumstances of this case, his conclusion was apparently based on a transparent misreading of Ford\u2019s testimony about the interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Looking beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the interviews to their context, there is nothing in the events which followed to justify an order directed specifically at coercive interrogations. Whether we regard the coffee meeting as a part of continuing interrogations or as a separate event, it provides no basis for the belief that Spielman did use, or will attempt to use, interrogations as a means of interfering with his employees\u2019 rights. To the extent that Spielman made remarks which constituted violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1), his conduct has been enjoined by the portion of the order which we have sustained. Since the examiner\u2019s conclusion was based on a clear error of fact and the Board\u2019s conclusion derived from a misreading of the facts as they appear in the record, and since we can find no other basis in the record for sustaining this portion of the order, subdivision 1(b) is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">There remains with respect to the \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations the Board\u2019s order in subdivision 1(d) that Bon-R cease and desist from interfering with the rights of its employees \u201cin any other manner\u201d and with respect to Local 230 \u201cor any other labor organization.\u201d We find no warrant for the issuance of such a broad order. In N. L. R. B. v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 433, 61 S.Ct. 693, 698, 85 L.Ed. 930 (1941), the Supreme Court said: \u201c[T]he authority conferred on the Board to restrain the practice which it has found the employer to have committed is not an authority to restrain generally all other unlawful practices which it has neither found to have been pursued nor persuasively to be related to the proven unlawful conduct.\u201d And in May Department Stores Co. v. N. L. R. B., 326 U.S. 376, 390, 66 S.Ct. 203, 211, 90 L.Ed. 145 (1945), the Court amplified this by saying: \u201cThe test of the proper scope of a cease and desist order is whether the Board might have reasonably concluded from the evidence that such an order was necessary to prevent the employer before it \u2018from engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce.\u2019 \u201d See also Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO v. N. L. R. B., 362 U.S. 479, 80 S.Ct. 838, 4 L.Ed. 2d 896 (1960) (per curiam). ,</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\"> Since we find that Bon-R did not commit an unfair labor practice when it discharged Scrima, the record is bare of anything suggesting its management\u2019s unwillingness to comply with the requirements of the NLRA except three ambiguous remarks made by Spielman. Except to suggest that the interrogation and \u201cthreatening\u201d of employees revealed Spielman\u2019s \u201cantiunion animus,\u201d the Board made no findings that indicate any likelihood of future violations. The trial examiner concluded, and we agree, that apart from Spielman\u2019s ambiguous remarks the record is \u201cdevoid of animus.\u201d No hostile action of any kind was threatened or taken against Ford, the only employee (apart from Scrima) who told Spielman that he would favor unionization. Ford was laid off on August 26, but was called back to work on a temporary basis thereafter. Holmes, who had told Spielman that he had no interest in a union, was fired on August 26 and not recalled. We do not think that Spiel-man\u2019s isolated remarks, the subject of an order directed particularly at them, can carry the additional weight of a blanket order prohibiting every kind of conduct which \u00a7 8(a) (1) covers. Accordingly, we set aside this portion of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The discharge of Scrima was not an unfair labor practice because it was not motivated by a purpose to \u201cencourage or discourage [union] membership by means of discrimination.\u201d Radio Officers\u2019 Union of Commercial Telegraphers Union, AFL v. N. L. R. B., 347 U.S. 17, 42, 74 S.Ct. 323, 337, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954). We recognize the power of the Board to infer Spielman\u2019s motive from his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>duct, see id. at 48-52, 74 S.Ct. 323, but such an inference must be such \u201cas reasonably may be based upon the facts proven.\u201d Id. at 49, 74 S.Ct. at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">We reject as wholly inconsistent with the proven facts the Board\u2019s conclusion that Scrima\u2019s work was not unsatisfactory. The trial examiner\u2019s summary on this point, quoted above, cannot be doubted. We cannot agree with the Board\u2019s statement that apart from some hearsay evidence, \u201cthere is no other substantial credible evidence in the record that Scrima\u2019s work was inferior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">It is equally plain that Scrima knew his work was not satisfactory to the management. Although he never found the source of his troubles within himself, he testified that the machine which he operated was running badly and that he had had bad relations with other men in the shop. He said that within the two weeks immediately preceding his discharge Janz spoke to him about both problems. About a week before the discharge, Janz asked Scrima to come to his office and Scrima told another employee that he expected to be laid off. The trial examiner found that Scrima expected to be discharged and, indeed, added that he believed Scrima to have started union organizing to shield himself from a deserved discharge. In view of all this, we disagree with the Board\u2019s unexplained statement that \u201cthe record is devoid of any indication that Scrima was ever reprimanded or admonished because of the quality of his work, or, in fact that he was even aware that his work performance was considered unsatisfactory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"auv-dedup-0\">Finally, despite the testimony of Spiel-man, Miss Book, and Janz that the decision to fire Scrima was made on the Friday before and the examiner\u2019s express conclusion to this effect, the Board concluded that this decision was made for the first time at the coffee meeting. Its sole explanation is that if the decision to fire Scrima had been made over the telephone on Friday, Spielman would have told Janz to fire him then or would have done so himself at the latest on Monday when he came to the shop. We may not \u201cdisplace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views.\u201d Universal Camera Corp. supra, 340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. at 465. But in our judgment, the record, supported by the examiner\u2019s finding as to credibility, leaves no room for conflict here.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">It is, of course, true, that \u00a7 8(a) (3) is violated even if there is a legitimate motive for discharging an employee if one of the motives is antagonism to unions. N. L. R. B. v. Jamestown Sterling Corp., 211 F.2d 725 (2 Cir., 1954). See Sunshine Biscuits, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 274 F.2d 738 (7 Cir., 1960); N. L. R. B. v. Lewis, 246 F.2d 886 (9 Cir., 1957). Ordinarily, we would not disturb a conclusion of the Board that the discharge of an employee which followed immediately upon his revealing union activities is a violation. But here, as elsewhere, our decision must proceed from an examination of the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Even standing alone, and taken in their worst light, Spielman\u2019s remarks when he fired Scrima are ambiguous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On their face, they say no more than that an employee whose loyalties elsewhere prevent him from speaking truthfully to his employer about a matter of great importance to the shop should go where his loyalties lead him. Scrima\u2019s loyalties were to a union, and so the remarks can be understood as expressing an antagonism to the union. The surrounding eir-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>cumstances, however, overwhelmingly refute this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Within a matter of minutes Spielman expressly stated to his employees that Scrima\u2019s discharge was unconnected with his union activities. In the past, the Board has accepted such a recantation made in much less impressive circumstances than the present. In Marr Knitting, Inc., 90 NLRB 479 (1950), the violation consisted of a threat that the plant might be shut down if it were unionized, and the recantation came \u201cabout a week later.\u201d Yet the Board accepted it, saying: \u201cWe believe * * * that this [recantation] * * * was sufficient to counteract the effect of * * * [the] coercive statements and to assure the employees that they were free to engage in union activities without fear of reprisal.\u201d Id. at 480. Surely here, there is even greater reason to regard the recantation as honest and as effective to dispel the employees\u2019 fears. The \u201cthreat\u201d was made in anger, and was withdrawn as soon as the anger died down. There was more than adequate ground to discharge Scrima, and Spielman had already decided to do so. The prior and subsequent history of the shop indicates nothing except the employer\u2019s indifference to unions.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">The trial examiner, who had the only opportunity to observe Spielman, thought he had no hostility to unions. Judge Friendly dismisses the examiner\u2019s finding because \u201clack of \u2018union animus\u2019 can hardly be discerned from the bearing of a witness months after the event.\u201d But as Judge Friendly points out, intentions cannot be directly observed, and a man\u2019s honest statement of his intentions is often the best guide we have. Spielman\u2019s bearing as a witness may not itself show his intent but it is certainly highly significant in deciding whether to believe his statements about what his intent was. A determination of intent by demeanor evidence is a common occurrence in our trial courts. This being precisely the kind of issue as to which demeanor evidence is relevant, the examiner\u2019s finding should accordingly be given \u201cspecial weight.\u201d See 2 Davis, Administrative Law 26 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">As to the effectiveness of the recantation, there is not a single statement in the testimony of any of the employees that Spielman at any time, before, during, or since the firing of Scrima has said or done anything which they regarded as a threat. They all knew, as their testimony indicates, that the machine which Scrima was operating was working badly. They thus had every reason to credit, and no reason to doubt, Spielman\u2019s sincerity when he explained his motives for firing Scrima.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Although Judge Friendly agrees with us that the Board based its conclusion on erroneous premises, he would remand to the Board because he thinks the same conclusion could reasonably have been based solely on Spielman\u2019s angry remark when he fired Scrima. In our judgment, to hang so much on the slim peg of a few ambiguous sentences is to allow an excerpt of the record to swallow up the whole, something which Universal Camera, supra, forbids. Without giving controlling effect to any one element, we think that the facts surrounding Scrima\u2019s discharge, coupled with the examiner\u2019s finding on credibility, make up a record which permits only one conclusion. In the light of this record, any other conclusion would amount to a decision, supported neither by reason nor the statute, that even the least improper remarks made in the course of discharging an employee render the discharge an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Subdivision 1(c) of the Board\u2019s order is enforced. Subdivision 2(c), which requires the posting of notices by the employer, is enforced, the notice to be modified to accord with this opinion. In all other respects the order is set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-11\">. The trial examiner said that the conclusion was \u201cinescapable that Scrima had purposely rendered the machine partially inoperable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\">. The trial examiner said in his intermediate report that Ford\u2019s expression of interest in a union \u201cevoked Spielman\u2019s declaration\u201d that there would be no union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>unless he wanted one. Ford\u2019s testimony is clear that Spielman\u2019s remark to this effect <em>preceded </em>Ford\u2019s statement that he would be interested in a union. The trial examiner\u2019s erroneous reading of Ford\u2019s tcs-timony is the only \u201ccircumstance\u201d apart from Spielman\u2019s similar remark to Mo-randi which he mentions as taking the case outside the rule of Blue Flash.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b958-6\">. Judge Friendly, preferring the \u201cmore colorful\u201d accounts of the employees to Spielman\u2019s account, quoted above and used by the trial examiner in his report, sees no ambiguity in the language which the em^-oyees attributed to Spielman. But there is very little difference between their accounts and Spielman\u2019s, except that an express reference to the union replaces tbe pronoun \u201cthey\u201d which Spielman claims to have used. So long as the employees\u2019 stories are understood as different versions of a single incident and not given cumulative effect, they no more than Spielman\u2019s account point unequivocally to a discriminatory motive behind Scrima\u2019s firing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b959-12\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ajc-dedup-0\">(concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">I concur in the Court\u2019s disposition save for its setting aside so much of the order as finds Scrima\u2019s discharge to have been an unfair labor practice. In view of my agreement with my brothers\u2019 conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>as to Serima\u2019s conduct, I should be happier if I could conscientiously join in this portion of the decision, too. However, I am forced to conclude that in this respect the majority has gone beyond the power conferred on us by Congress, and that the proper course is to remand this issue to the Board for further consideration in the light of our conclusion that some of the bases on which it rested its decision are untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">The issue here was not whether Bon-R had legitimate grounds for discharging Scrima or even whether his discharge reflected such grounds. Discharge of an employee has been held to be an unfair labor practice if it is motivated only in part by the employee\u2019s union activities. N. L. R. B. v. Jamestown Sterling Corp., 211 F.2d 725, 726 (2 Cir., 1954); Sunshine Biscuits, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 274 F.2d 738 (7 Cir., 1960). Whether such motivation existed here was a \u201cquestion of fact\u201d as to which 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) and (f) direct that \u201cThe findings of the Board with respect to questions of fact If supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Nevada Consolidated Copper Corp., 316 U.S. 105, 62 S.Ct. 960, 86 L.Ed. 1305 (1942). Evidence to support a finding of fact by an administrative agency is substantial if the evidence is \u201cenough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 505, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939). A verdict may be directed only \u201cWhen the evidence is such that without weighing the credibility of the witnesses there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.\u201d Brady v. Southern Ry. Co., 320 U.S. 476, 479, 64 S.Ct. 232, 234, 88 L.Ed. 239 (1943); 5 Moore, Federal Practice (2d ed. 1951), 2314; 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed.), 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">To me it is plain that Spielman\u2019s doings on August 23 afforded ample basis for a reasonable conclusion that Spielman discharged Scrima at least in part because of union activity. My brothers quote Spielman\u2019s statement of the August 23 incident; the employees\u2019 versions were rather more colorful. Scrima testified that, just after his admission of union activity, Spielman said \u201cRight here, as of now, you\u2019re fired. Get your clothes and get out.\u201d Holmes stated that Spielman told Scrima to take his men down to the union organizer\u2019s shop, that nobody could tell Spielman how to run his shop, \u201cand furthermore, you\u2019re fired. He said, \u2018You can pack your gear and get out of here right now\u2019.\u201d Ford\u2019s testimony was that, as soon as Scrima confessed to union activity, Spielman said, \u201cYou\u2019re fired here and now. You can get your things and leave.\u201d Tyson\u2019s version of Spielman\u2019s remark was, \u201cWell, if you are working in a union shop, it won\u2019t be in this shop, it will have to be in some other shop. If I want a Union here, I will get it. If I don\u2019t, it won\u2019t come in. As of right now, you\u2019re fired.\u201d Reid\u2019s account was \u201cif you want the Union in here, you can work in a Union shop. You can leave now.\u201d It was stipulated that the testimony of three other witnesses \u201cwould follow the pattern already established.\u201d In the light of all this, I am at a loss to understand what my brothers find ambiguous in Spielman\u2019s remarks to Scrima; indeed, if the curtain had dropped at this point and stayed down, the evidence that Scrima\u2019s discharge was motivated at least in part by his union activity would have been not only substantial but overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">True, the curtain rose again, and the Board could properly have disregarded the first act and taken Spielman\u2019s statement in the second as reflecting his true intent. But it was not obliged to do so. There is no principle of law or logic that a statement made in anger or emotion inevitably affords a less valid indication of intent than one made after reflection has set in. Indeed, the contrary is true. The exception to the hearsay rule for \u201cspontaneous exclamations\u201d is based upon the very consideration \u201cthat in the stress of nervous excitement the reflective faculties may be stilled and the utterance may become the unreflecting and sincere ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>pression of one\u2019s actual impressions and belief.\u201d 6 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), 139. It is for this reason that a hearsay declaration which is \u201cspontaneous, excited, or impulsive\u201d, such as Spiel-man\u2019s initial utterance, is admitted under this exception, whereas one which is \u201cthe product of reflection and deliberation\u201d, such as that made on his return, is not. McCormick, Evidence (1954), 580. Nothing in the testimony of the other employees shows that they regarded Spiel-man\u2019s first utterance as an aberration and his second as the true revelation of his mind. The absence of threats to them is inconclusive, both because Scrima had been the instigator and because, as the Board could permissibly infer, further threats may not have been deemed required.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">Bon-R argues that, however all this might be if the Board had heard the evidence or had sustained an examiner who did, here the Examiner\u2019s contrary finding tips the scale. This finding was that, despite the words used in firing Scrima, Spielman was then exercising \u201chis predetermined decision to discharge Scrima\u201d for cause and \u201cused language which did not convey his real purpose and motive.\u201d The Examiner so found because \u201cnot only from the testimony in the record, but from his appearance on the stand, it is and was evident that Spielman, a high strung, temperamental person, misspoke himself when he discharged Scrima.\u201d The Examiner thought also that when Spielman \u201crushed from the room, he was not in control of his emotions or his thinking processes\u201d and that what Spiel-man said on his return reflected his true intent, since the Examiner was \u201cconvinced that Spielman had no union animus.\u201d As against this the Board, accepting the Examiner\u2019s finding that Spielman was a \u201chigh strung, temperamental person\u201d, was \u201cconvinced, contrary to the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion, that Spiel-man\u2019s language at the time of the discharge did convey his real motive and purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">Part III of Mr. Justice Frankfurter\u2019s opinion in Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 492-497, 71 S.Ct. 456, 465, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), rejects both polar positions on the effect of an examiner\u2019s finding contrary to that of the Board. An examiner\u2019s report, being a part of \u201cthe record\u201d, cannot be excluded from the data a reviewing court must consider in determining whether a finding with respect to a question of fact is \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d But the statute \u201cis wholly inconsistent with the notion that it [the Board] has power to reverse an examiner\u2019s findings only when they are \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019,\u201d id. at 492, 71 S.Ct. at 467, a point reemphasized in F. C. C. v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp., 349 U.S. 358, 364-365, 75 S.Ct. 855, 99 L.Ed. 1147 (1955). The proper solution lies in between: \u201cThe findings of the examiner are to be considered\u201d by a reviewing court \u201calong with the consistency and inherent probability of testimony,\u201d with the \u201csignificance of his report\u201d depending \u201clargely on the importance of credibility in the particular case\u201d; \u201cevidence supporting a conclusion may be less substantial when an impartial, experienced examiner who has observed the witnesses and lived with the case has drawn conclusions different from the Board\u2019s than when he has reached the same conclusion.\u201d 340 U.S. at 496, 71 S.Ct. at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Here, insofar as the physical happenings at the August 23 meeting were disputed, we have sustained the version adverse to Bon-R, finding that Spielman repeated his assertion of the previous day that he would not have a union unless he wanted one, and that Scrima\u2019s statement was in answer to a question and not volunteered as Spielman said. What remains in controversy is not what happened, but what conclusion concerning Spielman\u2019s intent is to be drawn from what happened. Although \u201cThe state of a man\u2019s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion,\u201d Edgington v. Fitzmaurice (1885), 29 Ch.D. 459, 483, we have not yet developed mental X-rays permitting this \u201cfact\u201d to be determined by direct observation rather than by in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>ference. With the objective facts here not in dispute, the Examiner had only one datum for inference-drawing that the cold record would not contain, namely, his observation of Spielman, which led him to find that the latter was \u201ca high strung, temperamental person.\u201d Lack of \u201cunion animus\u201d can hardly be discerned from the bearing of a witness months after the event, although in some instances the contrary might be. Without questioning this finding as to Spielman\u2019s emotional make-up, the Board chose to conclude that what Spielman said in anger indicated his intent better than what he said on reflection. Even under the more limiting standards of the \u201cnot clearly erroneous\u201d principle, F.R.Civ.Proc. 52 (a), we have reversed a trial judge\u2019s finding where, after giving \u201cevery possible probative force\u201d to oral testimony of intent, we were convinced that what the man indisputably said made \u201cplain what he really believed.\u201d E. F. Drew <em>&amp; </em>Co. v. Reinhard, 170 F.2d 679, 683-684 (2 Cir., 1948). Still more directly applicable is F. C. C. v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp., supra, where the Supreme Court reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversing an agency\u2019s reversal of an examiner\u2019s finding that witnesses had been \u201cevasive\u201d \u2014 a matter as to which the examiner has peculiar opportunities for observation; the Court there disapproved, 349 U.S. at 364, 75 S.Ct. 855 the statement of Judge Learned Hand on remand in N. L. R. B. v. Universal Camera Corp., 190 F.2d 429; 430 (2 Cir., 1951), on which the Court of Appeals had relied, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 222 F.2d 781, 786 (1954), that \u201cwe are not to be reluctant to insist that an examiner\u2019s findings on veracity must not be overruled without a very substantial preponderance in the testimony as recorded.\u201d See N. L. R. B. v. Ra-Rich Mfg. Corp., 276 F.2d 451, 454 (2 Cir., 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">We thus may not properly set aside the portion of the Board\u2019s order relating to Scrima\u2019s discharge. But we are equally not obliged to enforce it. The Board\u2019s finding rested not merely on Spielman\u2019s statements on August 23 but on the Board\u2019s views, erroneous as we all hold, that there was no credible evidence that Scrima\u2019s work was inferior or that Spiel-man believed him to be dischargeable for cause, and also that Spielman had done something seriously wrong in his interrogation of the employees on the previous day. Since we cannot tell whether the Board would make the same finding as to Spielman\u2019s intent in discharging Scrima with these supports removed, we should remand this phase of the case for appropriate reconsideration. N. L. R. B. v. Lundy Mfg. Corp., 286 F.2d 424 (2 Cir., 1960).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
