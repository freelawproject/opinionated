He engaged in the currency exchange business in that country from 1934 to 1949; but in the latter year, fearing persecution at the hands of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Communists, he fled to the Dominican Republic, entering that country on a merchant\u2019s visa. He stayed in the Dominican Republic for eleven months, until July 1950. That month he entered the United States as a non-immigrant visitor on a three month permit for the purpose of winding up the affairs of his deceased brother. When he entered this country he possessed a permit from the Dominican Republic giving him the right to re-enter that country if application for re-entry were made within the time limits stated in the permit, and he possessed an airlines return ticket. He remained in the United States beyond the three months\u2019 period, his Dominican Republic re-entry permit expired, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service commenced deportation proceedings against him in 1951. At the deportation hearing a Special Inquiry Officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service concluded that appellant was deportable, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that decision, but to date he has remained here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In 1953, to aid persons fleeing from countries taken over by the Communists, Congress passed the Refugee Relief Act of 1953. Two years later appellant applied for adjustment of his status in this country to that of a permanent resident under section 6 of that act. See note 1 <em>supra. </em>The Special Inquiry Officer who considered this application denied it for he found on the evidence that the applicant\u2019s last foreign residence was in the Dominican Republic and that the applicant had made no showing that he was unable to return to that country on account of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, or political belief. The Acting Regional Commissioner approved the recommendation of the Special Inquiry Officer, and the Immigration Service prepared to deport appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Appellant had elected no country to which he wished to be sent in the event of deportation, and so the Immigration Service, under section 243(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, see note 2 <em>supra, </em>asked the Republic of China (Formosa), the Dominican Republic, and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong whether any of them would accept appellant. The Service did not ask the government on the Chinese mainland. The first two governments contacted refused to accept him, but Hong Kong consented, and he was ordered deported there.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Appellant then brought the present action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York so as to obtain judicial review of the order of the Immigration and Naturalization Service denying his application for adjustment of status under the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 and of the subsequent order of the Service directing that he be deported to Hong Kong. The defendant moved for summary judgment, which was granted by the court. The court held, first, that the administrative finding that appellant\u2019s last residence was in the Dominican Republic was supported by substantial evidence; second, that as appellant failed to demonstrate that the reason for his inability to return to the Dominican Republic was persecution or fear of persecution, he could not obtain the benefit of the Refugee Relief Act of 1953; and, third, that the Immigration Service was not obligated to ask Communist China to accept appellant before the Service was entitled to deport him to Hong Kong. On appeal from that decision appellant seeks to have us review the action the court below took on each of these three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">We shall turn first to a resolution of the second issue, whether appellant\u2019s inability to return to the Dominican Republic for reasons other than fear of persecution precludes him from obtaining the benefit of the Refugee Relief Act of 1953, \u00a7 6. Inasmuch as our answer to that issue is determinative of the appeal, we would not be warranted in reversing the finding of the Immigration Service that appellant\u2019s \u201clast residence\u201d was in the Dominican Republic. The Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>asks us to interpret the language of Section 6 \u201cunable to return to the country of his birth, or nationality, or last residence, because of fear of persecution\u201d to mean that appellant, in order to obtain the benefits of the Act, must show that he is unable to go to the three countries referred to in the statute and that his inability to go to each one of them is caused by persecution or fear of persecution. Appellant, on the \u25a0 other hand, seeks to have us adopt the interpretation which the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reached and applied in Cheng Lee King v. Carnahan, 253 F.2d 893 (9 Cir.1958). In that case a merchant seaman, a Chinese national, born in China but with a \u201clast residence\u201d in Singapore, sought permanent residence under the Refugee Relief Act of 1953, \u00a7 6, alleging a fear of persecution in China and an inability to return to Singapore for a different reason. The Ninth Circuit held that the statutory language permits relief to be given to an alien applicant who demonstrates that he is unable to return to any one of the three countries because of persecution or fear of persecution, and also demonstrates an inability, for whatever reasons, to return to the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The Refugee Relief Act of 1953 was enacted mainly to provide admission into this country for about 240,000 persons who had fled from Communist governments and were living abroad in desperate conditions. Section 3 of the act, 67 Stat. 401 (1953), 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1971a (1958), authorized the issuance of 205,000 special nonquota immigrant visas for those aliens and an additional number of such visas for their spouses and dependents. Section 4, 67 Stat. 401 (1953), 50 U.S.C.A.Apppendix, \u00a7 1971b (1958), allotted these visas among refugees having various ethnic origins. Section 2(a), 67 Stat. 400, 50 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Appendix, \u00a7 1971(a), defined \u201crefugee\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201c(a) \u2018Refugee\u2019 means any person in a country or area which is neither Communist nor Communist-dominated, who because of persecution, fear of persecution, natural calamity or military operations is out of his usual place of abode and unable to return thereto, who has not been firmly resettled, and who is in urgent need of assistance for the essentials of life or for transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Section 6, with which the present cas\u00e9-is primarily concerned, was intended to-grant relief to a rather small group of not more than 5000 persons who had-entered this country as bona fide non-immigrants and were stranded here because of persecution at home.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was the purpose of this relatively insignificant provision of the act to extend refugee relief to those aliens stranded in the United States who would have come-within the other provisions of the act if they had been refugees abroad. The-House Report to the 1953 act stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\n<em>Section 6</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cThe proposed adjustment of status of aliens who would fall within the refugee categories specified in section 4 except for the fact that they are now in the United States,, having entered lawfully in a temporary nonimmigrant status, represents the committee\u2019s belief that relief should be granted to bona fidetemporary residents, if aliens in situations identical to theirs are to-be permitted to avail themselves of' newly offered immigration opportunities.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.974, 83d Gong., 1st Sess. 18 (1953), U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 1953, p. 2103.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>An alien lawfully present in the United States in the temporary status of a non-immigrant visitor is a person entitled to seek the relief afforded by section 6, if \u201che is unable to return to the country of his birth, or nationality, or last residence, because of persecution or fear of persecution * * Thus, without according to any one of the three countries a priority over the other two, the statute refers to the country of the applicant\u2019s birth, the country of his nationality, and the country of his last residence. If the present case involved an applicant\u2019s inability, because of a non-perseeutory reason, to return to the first-mentioned country, that of his birth, instead of inability, for a non-persecutory reason, to return to the third-mentioned country, that of his last residence, it seems clear that the applicant would be eligible for section 6 relief if he could not return to his last residence because of fear of persecution there. Regardless of his place of birth or of nationality, a person who is fleeing from persecution in the country of his last residence and who is present on a temporary basis in a displaced persons\u2019 center, or anywhere else in the world in a country not that of his last residence, would obviously be a refugee within the spirit and the letter of the Refugee Relief Act. In the words of Section 2(a), such a person would be out of \u201chis usual place of abode,\u201d \u201cunable to return thereto,\u201d and \u201cnot firmly Resettled\u201d \u2014 all as a result of persecution or fear of persecution. As pointed out \u00bfbove, section 6 of the act was intended to benefit persons already within the United States as bona fide non-immigrant aliens who would have been refugees under other provisions of the act if they were beyond our borders. It would be contrary to the humane policy of the act, and an oppressive interpretation of section 6 thereof, to preclude a longtime resident and national of a country taken over by the Communists from obtaining the relief provided by section 6 for the sole reason that he was born outside of that country (assuming that he is unable to return to the place of his birth for a non-per-secutory reason).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Here, instead of the supposititious case just discussed, we have a case involving flight from a Communist government in the country of one\u2019s birth and nationality, coupled with an inability, for a non-persecutory reason, to return to one\u2019s last residence. Inasmuch as the statute envisions no priorities among the three countries set forth therein, we should decide the case before us, unless there be a clear reason for a contrary ruling, in the same way that the case mentioned in the preceding paragraph would be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Appellant is one who fled persecution at the hands of the Communists. His entire odyssey away from his homeland, now in its thirteenth year, commenced as a result of the Communist conquest of China. Furthermore, it cannot be said that he was \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in the Dominican Republic even if under our immigration laws he was technically a \u201cresident\u201d of that land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Leong Leun Do entered the Dominican Republic and remained there eleven months on a businessman\u2019s visa. Neither party to this litigation has given us the text of the Dominican Republic\u2019s immigration laws which define the status of one in that country on such a visa. However, if the law of the Dominican Republic is at all similar to the United States statute applicable to business visitors, it is clear that appellant could only remain in the Dominican Republic temporarily.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>pellant certainly fits into the current image of a political refugee. It should be noted that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has announced that applicants for adjustment of status under section 6 need not comply with all of the specific requirements imposed on those who would seek entrance into the United States as \u201crefugees\u201d under the other provisions of the Refugee Relief Act of 1953. Chien Fan Chu v. Brownell, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 204, 247 F.2d 790, 793, 795 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">It might be asserted that the purpose of the Refugee Relief Act did not include relief to fleeing persons who had already found havens abroad. The conference report to the 1953 act, however, in defining the term \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d tends to refute this proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cWhile no definition is contained in the act, the conferees wish to state that the term \u2018firm resettlement\u2019 as applied to prospective beneficiaries of this legislation is not designed automatically to exclude aliens from the refugee category solely on the ground that they have been collectively, by law or edict, granted full or limited citizenship rights and privileges in any area of their present residence.\u201d Cong. R. 1069, 83d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News, p. 2123 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Also, we point out that section 6 of the Refugee Relief Act only applies to non-immigrant aliens who lawfully entered this country before the enactment of that statute. Therefore, even if we hold in appellant\u2019s favor, we shall not be fostering schemes by which persons born in Communist-controlled countries, but longstanding residents of other countries not Communist-controlled, enter the United States as bona fide non-immigrants, and then purposefully foreclose their rights to re-enter the land of their last residence, thereby claiming a right to permanent residence here under section 6. In other words, our decision here only affects aliens present here prior to midsummer 1953, and does not involve persons who will intentionally but unjustifiably seek to qualify for the privilege bestowed by section 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">True, interpreting the language of section 6 in the way appellant asks us to interpret it could conceivably lead to an extension of the coverage of the section to include a person bom in a country now Communist-controlled and who, having for many years resided in a non-Communist country, happened to be lawfully in the United States on August 7, 1953, and who, by plan or accident, precluded a return to his last residence abroad. Even if it were not one of the purposes of the Refugee Relief Act to facilitate such a person\u2019s permanent residence in the United States we would hazard a guess that there are very few persons, if any, in this position. More-ever, within section 6 itself Congress inserted a safeguard that would prevent such persons from taking advantage of the section\u2019s benefits, for it is provided that Congress must approve by concurrent resolution the granting of permanent resident status to any alien seeking the benefit of section 6 before an alien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>may attain that status.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence we should resolve whatever ambiguities there may be in the statutory language so as to preserve to Congress this final power to decide an alien\u2019s status under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Another argument against appellant\u2019s interpretation of the clause \u201cunable to return to the country of his birth, or nationality, or last residence, because of persecution or fear of persecution\u201d is that the words \u201cbecause of persecution or fear of persecution\u201d should in every instance modify the phrase \u201cunable to return.\u201d As we have shown, a blind literalism leads to absurd results that would negate, in worthy cases, the very purposes which the Act was adopted to accomplish. This being so, the statute should be interpreted so as to include all worthy eases (even if an occasional unworthy one is also included) rather than to exclude worthy cases because of the possibility that an interpretation consistent with the Congressional purposes may give an occasional opportunity to an unworthy one.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">If Congress had clearly manifested an intention contrary to appellant\u2019s position we would interpret the statutory language in accordance with the grammar of the sentence. But Congress has nowhere indicated an awareness of the problem presented to us by this appeal. The most that we can infer from the legislative history of the 1953 act and its 1954 amendments is that Congress intended that one should read the countries listed in the statute in the conjunctive instead of in the disjunctive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Apparently Congress did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>think it inequitable to require a person to return to one of the three countries, if he could so return, even if he could not return to one or both of the other two countries. See Cheng Lee King v. Carnahan, 253 F.2d 893 (9 Cir.1958); Lubini v. Brownell, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 251 F.2d 28 (per curiam), cert. denied, sub nom. Lubini v. Rogers, 356 U.S. 966, 78 S.Ct. 1005, 2 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1958); Fong Sen v. United States Immigration and Naturalization Serv., 137 F.Supp. 236 (E.D.La.), aff\u2019d per curiam, 234 F.2d 656 (5 Cir.1956). In the case before us, however, the applicant cannot return to any of the three countries.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"> As the court below recognized, 197 F.Supp. at 607, there is no indication that any draftsman or congressman intended to deny relief to aliens in appellant\u2019s situation, or that any thought was given to the particular problem before us. Hence it is hopeless to seek a mythical congressional \u201cintent\u201d in order to resolve the issue at hand. Cf. Associated Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. United States (2 Cir.1962), 306 F.2d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Even as the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts, a statute may encompass more than the combination of its properly parsed phrases. We agree with the statement of Judge Her-lands in D\u2019Antonio v. Shaughnessy, 139 F.Supp. 719, 723 (S.D.N.Y.1956), that \u201cthe statute * * * apparently reflects a liberal and remedial purpose on the part of Congress; and it should be construed to effectuate that purpose.\u201d See also Ching Lan Foo v. Brownell, 148 F.Supp. 420 (D.D.C.1957); Shio Han Sun v. Barber, 144 F.Supp. 850 (N.D.Cal.1956). Furthermore, it does not appear that a holding favorable to the alien in this case would be inconsistent with any of the policies behind the statute. If we are wrong in this assumption, Congress may still correct our error, as provided by the very section that we are now interpreting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> With these considerations in mind, we deem it wiser and fairer to interpret the statute in favor of the alien. Therefore, we conclude that under section 6 of the Refugee Relief Act of 1953 an alien who establishes that he is unable to return to one or more of the three countries listed therein because of persecution or fear of persecution and is also unable to return to the remaining countries for nonpersecutory reasons is eligible to seek the relief that Act provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to discuss the other two issues set forth earlier in this opinion that appellant presented to us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\">. Section 6 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">\u201cAny alien who establishes that prior to July 1, 1953, he lawfully entered the United States as a bona fide nonimmi-grant and that he is unable to return to the country of his birth, or nationality, or last residence because of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion * * * may, not later than June 30, 1955, apply to the Attorney General of the United States for an adjustment of his immigration status.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-14\">.

Since the existing language, as construed, correctly expresses the intent of the section no purpose would be served by modifying the language as proposed in the bill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">S.Rep. No. 2045, 83d Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">This statement by the Senate Judiciary Committee makes it clear that the countries listed in the statute should be read in the conjunctive. But it is a <em>non sequitur </em>to conclude that by referring to the situation in which one is <em>able to return </em>to one of the listed countries the committee had also considered the situa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tion created when one is <em>unable to return </em>to one country because of persecution and <em>unable to return </em>to the other country or countries for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The statement just quoted was immediately preceded in the Senate Report by this less illuminating comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u201cThe proposed amendment would * * * permit the adjustment in those cases where because of events which existed at the time the refugee fled to this country he cannot return to his place of birth, or place of his nationality, or place of his last residence, because of fear of persecution in any of those countries if there is more than one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The Senate Report also stated one of the purposes of the 1954 amendments to be: \u201c * * * (3) [to] permit additional refugees within the United States who are unable to return to any country of their birth, nationality, or last residence because of fear of persecution * * Id. at 1; see note 3 supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b526-16\">. In Fong Sen v.

Section 6 of the Refugee Relief Act is not one of the provisions in our immigration laws that grants broad discretionary power to the Immigration Service.

As I read the statute, the appellant was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 6 because it was not likelihood of persecution which made him unable to return to the Dominican Republic, found on sufficient evidence in the court below to be the place of his last residence. However, I concur in reversing the judgment of the district court because the government failed to comply with the procedures prescribed by \u00a7 243(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 212 (1952), 8 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(a), and the order of deportation to Hong Kong is for that reason invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The district court ruled that in order to obtain the benefit of \u00a7 6, an alien must show that \u201che is unable to return to the country of his birth, or nationality, or last residence\u201d and that as to all three, the inability must be \u201cbecause of persecution or fear of persecution on account of race, religion, or political opinion.\u201d I agree with the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority believes with the Ninth Circuit, Cheng Lee King v. Carnahan, 253 F.2d 893 (1958), that so long as an alien is unable to return to one of the three places designated because of persecution or fear of persecution and is unable to return to the other two for any reason whatever, he has met the statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">The mere fact that a person cannot gain entry to the place of his birth, nationality, or last residence will not keep him in this country. See Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 243(a) which designates the countries to which aliens shall be deported.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor will the fact that in one or two of such places he fears persecution, if he can safely go to the third. Cheng Lee King, supra. Thus in this case, had the appellant been denied admission in all of such places for reasons not involving persecution, he would have been deported. Similarly, had the Dominican Republic been willing to receive him, he would have been deported notwithstanding his inability to go to China, the country of his birth, because of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">I am unable to see why the threat of persecution in one place should be deemed to \u201ccover\u201d other places closed to the appellant for reasons not involving persecution. Our immigration laws do not guarantee an alien admission unless three other countries where there is no threat of persecution will consider his application for entry. Had the appellant been born and always resided in the Dominican Republic, he would not be entitled to relief under \u00a7 6, since persecution would not be involved. He is in no worse position than if that were the case; yet under the majority view, the fact of persecution in China, irrelevant to his status in the Dominican Republic, protects him. The appellant\u2019s situation cannot be compared to that of one who fears persecution in the land of his birth or nationality, where he has resided, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>who has not found a residence elsewhere. For such a person, it <em>is </em>persecution which has closed all the likely doors to him and set him adrift.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The majority reasons that \u00a7 6 complements \u00a7\u00a7 2-4 of the Refugee Relief Act, 67 Stat. 400, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7\u00a7 1971-1971b, by extending relief to persons who are temporarily in this country as nonimmigrants but who otherwise qualify for entrance under those sections. It then reasons that \u00a7\u00a7 2-4 would admit one who, whatever his status in the country of his birth, could not return to the place of his last residence by reason of persecution. Therefore; the majority says, since \u00a7 6 is to be read to conform to the other sections, it must allow to remain a nonimmigrant who, unable for any reason to return to the country of his birth, cannot return to the place of his last residence by reason of persecution. The final step in this chain of reasoning is that since \u00a7 6 \u201cenvisions no priorities among the three countries [birth, nationality, and residence],\u201d the same result must be reached for a non-immigrant who for any reason cannot return to his last residence and fears persecution in the country of his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"afr-dedup-0\">But it is crystal clear that .\u00a7\u00a7 2-4 would not admit to this country one who has had a residence abroad solely because the country of his birth might persecute him; those sections impose requirements not limited to the one that the alien be \u201cout of his usual place of abode and unable to return thereto\u201d and \u201cnot * * * firmly resettled.\u201d 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1971(a). The majority thus reaches by a series of steps a result in conflict with its original premise that the various sections must be read as nearly as possible as one. By the majority\u2019s reasoning, one who entered this country as a nonimmigrant and then for some reason cannot return to his last residence is given a statutory preference over one who equally fears persecution in the land of his birth or nationality but who has remained in his last residence abroad.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">It is true that one who has maintained a residence elsewhere is better off than one like the appellant, who, having had such a residence, came temporarily to this country as a nonimmigrant and is now denied permission to return to his residence. But had the appellant been deported from the Dominican Republic for reasons not involving persecution, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4 would not gain him admission here simply because he might be persecuted in China and had no place else to go. And that is the closest parallel to the situation of this case. The sole distinction is the appellant\u2019s nonimmigrant status. Yet it is that very distinction which the majority, pursuant to legislative policy, claims should not be determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The simple fact is that \u00a7 6 does differ significantly from the other sections. Section 2(a) defines a \u201crefugee\u201d as one</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A86\">\u201cwho because of persecution, fear of persecution, natural calamity or military operations is out of his usual place of abode and unable to return thereto, who has not been firmly resettled, and who is in urgent need of assistance for the essentials of life or for transportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The majority notes with approval the ruling in Chien Fan Chu v. Brownell, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 204, 247 F.2d 790 (1957) that applicants under \u00a7 6 need not meet all the requirements of \u00a7 2(a). Plainly then, the two sections differ as to those whom they protect. Section 3 imposes a general maximum on the number of visas to be issued to refugees, and \u00a7 4 allocates the total among various groups. Nonimmigrants under \u00a7 6 are not included in these quotas, but are included in a separate, unclassified quota of 5000. Since \u00a7\u00a7 2-4 so clearly impose requirements on refugees inapplicable to nonimmigrants, it is difficult to understand the majority\u2019s insistence that \u00a7 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>imposes no requirements on nonimmi-grants inapplicable to refugees.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The majority concedes the difficulties of its construction of \u00a7 6, but argues that the result would be more absurd if it ruled the other way. Yet the supposed absurdity arises only because the majority blinks the differences between the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 2-4 and \u00a7 6 at the same time that it recognizes them. The sum of the difference is that the former sections afford entry to those who are uprooted from their homes by persecution, while the latter allows to remain here those who, having anticipated that they would have to depart, find closed because of persecution the countries to which their natural desires might lead them. Since our general immigration laws do not suspend deportation simply because an alien cannot gain entry to the country of his choice, I see no difficulty in reconciling the various provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">It is not for this court to decide how far the \u201chumane policy of the act\u201d should extend, nor should we reach out for a particular interpretation because another may seem \u201coppressive.\u201d These are matters for congressional determination. On the other hand, we cannot avoid the careful construction of a statute on the ground that Congress can correct our errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The second part of this case concerns the propriety of the order directing deportation of the appellant to Hong Kong pursuant to \u00a7 243(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That section directs that if an alien fails to designate the country to which he chooses to be deported or if the country which he designates refuses to receive him or fails to respond within three months to an inquiry whether it will do so, he shall be deported <em>\u201cto </em>any country of which such alien is a subject national, or citizen if such country is willing to accept him into its territory.\u201d Only after this possibility has been explored and has failed may deportation be directed to a country within other specified categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The appellant contends that he is a national and citizen of the mainland of China and that since the Attorney General made no prior inquiry of the mainland government whether it would accept the appellant, the order of deportation to Hong Kong was not made pursuant to the prescribed procedure and is void. Since the appellant was born and resided on the mainland until his flight to the Dominican Republic,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his contention must be upheld, unless the inquiry which was made to the Nationalist Government whether it would receive him on Formosa satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 243 (a). In my opinion it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The government has contended in the past, and this court has held, that the Chinese mainland is a \u201ccountry\u201d to which an alien may be deported under \u00a7 243(a). United States ex rel. Tom Man v. Murff, 264 F.2d 926 (2 Cir.1959); United States ex rel. Leong Choy Moon V. Shaughnessy, 218 F.2d 316 (2 Cir.1954). In Chan Chuen v. Esperdy, 285 F.2d 353 (2 Cir.1960) (per curiam), we refused to accept the technical argument that Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom and therefore not a \u201ccountry,\u201d and said: \u201c[A]ny place possessing a government with authority to accept an alien deported from the United States can qualify as a \u2018country\u2019 under the statute.\u201d Id. at 354. See also Rogers v. Cheng Fu Sheng, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 115, 280 F.2d 663, cert. denied, 364 U.S. 891, 81 S.Ct. 222, 5 L.Ed.2d 187 (1960). It would do violence to the ordinary' use of language if within a single section of a statute, the word \u201ccountry\u201d had one meaning when used alone and another when used in the phrase \u201ccountry of which such alien is a subject national, or citizen.\u201d Such a result could be justified only if national policy clearly demanded deference in this respect to the nonrecognition of the Communist government.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>To rule that for purposes of \u00a7 243(a), the Chinese mainland is a country of which an alien may be a subject national or citizen imposes no greater requirement on this government than that the immigration authorities inquire whether the Communist government will accept this alien on its territory, something which we have already required it to do in other situations arising under \u00a7 243(a). Tom Man, supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Leong Choy Moon, supra, 218 F.2d at 319. The same requirement was imposed in Lu v. Rogers, 164 F.Supp. 320 (D.D.C.), affirmed per curiam, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 374, 262 F.2d 471 (1958). It does not interfere with this government\u2019s policy of nonrecognition in any other respect, nor does its imply anything about the capacity of the Communist government to confer citizen status in any other context. In short, I would simply recognize the realities of the situation here as we have done when it was the government that was asserting its power to deport to the mainland of China.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">It is true, as the government contends, that \u00a7 243(a) was designed to facilitate deportation proceedings by increasing the number of places to which deportation may be ordered, Chan Chuen, supra, but nothing that I have said here runs counter to that policy. And since \u00a7 243 (a) does not authorize deportation to any country at all unless specified countries, including the one of the alien\u2019s choice, have denied admission, it is plain that Congress had in mind also the reasonable desires of the alien. It would be harsh indeed and contrary to the spirit of the statute if an alien could be denied deportation to a country with which he had all his natural ties simply because this government had, perhaps temno-rarily, withheld or withdrawn diplomatic recognition from the government in power for reasons unconnected with the alien\u2019s status as a citizen of that country. Yet that is where the government\u2019s logic leads.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The district court ruled that the failure to comply with \u00a7 243(a) was in effect harmless error, inasmuch as the appellant has been attempting to avoid deportation to the Chinese mainland from fear of persecution. It might be enough to say that in a matter of such consummate importance to an individual as deportation proceedings, the courts should insist that the letter of the law be observed. In this case, there is further ground for not regarding this contention as frivolous. Under \u00a7 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 214 (1952), 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1253(h), the Attorney General has authority to withhold deportation of an alien \u201cto any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to physical persecution and for such period of time as he deems to be necessary for such reason.\u201d Whether the Communist government would respond affirmatively to an inquiry concerning the appellant and whether, if it did, he could secure a stay of deportation under \u00a7 243(h) is beside the point until the Inquiry is made. It is sufficient now to note the possibility that had the government complied with the procedures of \u00a7 243(a), the appellant would not face immediate deportation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is not a case in which the alien had designated as the country of his choice the one deportation to which he later claims will subject him to persecution; in such a case, it might rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>sonably be argued that the designation constituted a waiver of the relief provided by \u00a7 243 (h). Appellant\u2019s situation seems to be precisely that for which that section was designed. An application for relief under \u00a7 6 of the Refugee Relief Act should not have the effect of a waiver of the independent relief available under \u00a7 243(h), particularly when, as I find, \u00a7 6 is inapplicable to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Since, in my view, the order of deportation to Hong Kong was improper, I concur with the majority in reversing the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. In Lubini v. Brownell, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 251 F.2d 28, certiorari denied sub nom. Lubini v. Rogers, 356 U.S. 966, 78 S.Ct. 1005, 2 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1958), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion that an applicant for relief under \u00a7 6 must show that \u201che will be \u00absubject to persecution \u2018on account of race, religion, or political opinion\u2019 in the country of his birth * * * and in the country ofi his nationality * * * and in the country of bis last residence * * The court did not discuss the particular issue presented here, but the quoted language suggests agreement with the district court\u2019s and my construction of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-16\">.

This would be true even if the \u201clast residence\u201d requirement of \u00a7 6 is construed to mean less than the \u00a7 2(a) requirement that the refugee be \u201cnot * * * firmly resettled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\">.

In Tom <em>Man, </em>supra, the court \u201cassumed\u201d that an alien could not be regarded as a \u201csubject national or citizen\u201d of the Communist government \u201cbecause we do not recognize that as more than a <em>de facto </em>government.\u201d 264 F.2d at 928. However, that issue was not necessary to the court\u2019s ruling, which was only that deportation of an alien to the Chinese mainland must be preceded by an inquiry of the <em>Communist government </em>whether <em>it </em>will accept him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b530-10\">.
