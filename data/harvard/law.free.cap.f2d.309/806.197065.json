As a consequence, we are again confronted with the applicability of the \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U. S.C.A., to an undisputed factual situation appearing in a bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">\u201cIn this circuit the clearly erroneous standard is to be applied to the referee\u2019s' findings and not those of the district court\u201d where as here the District Court on petition to review filed under Section 39, sub. c, <em>supra, </em>rejects the Referee\u2019s finding and enters judgment <em>contra </em>thereto without hearing any additional evidence. O\u2019Rielly v. Endicott-Johnson Corp., 297 F.2d 1 (8 Cir.1961); Gross v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland et al., 302 F.2d 338 (8 Cir.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-15\">However, in the case at bar it clearly appears from the opinion of the District Court, reported at 204 F.Supp. 42, that the findings of the Referee were rejected, (1) because \u201cthe Referee erred in concluding as a matter of law that (a) general assignment (made) to the (appellant) under the (a) performance bond application created an equitable lien giving the (appellant\u2019s) total claim secured status prior in right to the claims of the Trustee and the United States\u201d; and, (2) because \u201cunperfected secret assignment cannot prevail against the Trustee\u201d so as to create a \u201cpreferred status\u201d claim under Section 60 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 96).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-18\">From his opinion, <em>supra, </em>it is manifest that District Judge Stephenson considered that the primary facts adduced before the Referee, when categorized in applicable principles, rules and standards, compelled a \u201clegal concept\u201d to be given thereto, that established the Ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>eree\u2019s conclusory findings to be mixed questions of law and fact, \u201csubject to judicial review, and on such review, the court may substitute its judgment for that of the\u201d Referee. Bogardus v. Commissioner, 302 U.S. 34, 39, 58 S.Ct. 61, 82 L.Ed. 32; Weible v. United States, 244 F.2d 158 (9 Cir.1957); Goldberg v. Commissioner, 223 F.2d 709 (5 Cir.1955). If that be the proper vista from which the Referee\u2019s findings in the case at bar should be considered, then it is obvious that, in effect, only a question of law was presented to the District Court in this review proceeding, and also to us by this appeal, which if properly applied demonstrates the Referee\u2019s findings to be \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d because \u201ca mistake has been committed\u201d within the ambit of United States v. United States Gypsum Company, 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541, 92 L.Ed. 746.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-4\">\u201c* * * [Wjhat facts are significant and determinative in this matter depends upon the standard by which a court looks at the question and evaluates the facts and decides which facts are important and which are relatively unimportant. The conclusion that certain facts are or are not helpful in deciding the question is a question of legal standard, or legal concept, and is one for a court to decide as a question of law.\u201d Kelly v. United States Steel Corp., 284 F.2d 850, 852 (3 Cir. 1960).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-5\">\u201cA legal conception is a legally defined category into which a case may be fitted so that, when certain situations of fact come within the category, a series of rules and principles and standards become applicable.\u201d Pound, \u201cJurisprudence\u201d, Yol. 2, p. 127.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Without presently sounding out the process by which a \u201clegal concept\u201d is determinable we merely note, among other things, that primarily it requires a separation of fact from applicable law and that the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard compels utilization of such process. The standards of that process are aptly set forth in the enlightening opinion of Judge Frank, in Orvis v. Higgins, 180 F.2d 537, 538 (2 Cir.1950). Consequently we do not restate that matter here. See also, comment in Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, Vol. 5, Chap. 52.04, 52.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">In the case at bar it is apparent that such \u201cprocess\u201d was applied by the District Court in this review proceeding. That is made manifest from the summary of facts and applicable law as stated in District Judge Stephenson\u2019s opinion, <em>swpra. </em>In the light of the clarity thereof and because we are convinced he has correctly stated applicable law to such facts, no useful purpose would be served for us to restate or rephrase the same in this opinion. The facts are not complicated or in dispute. The principles, rules and standards applicable thereto are readily comprehensible.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">To demonstrate the correctness of Judge Stephenson\u2019s application of law to the facts in the case at bar, we need only to note that the primary facts adduced before the Referee clearly establish that appellant was aware of facts which caused it to specially inquire of bankrupt as to its financial condition on December 3, 1958, a critical date in light of the provisions of Section 60, sub. a of the Act, <em>supra. </em>It <em>is likewise </em>clear that the only investigation made by appellant in respect to that subject matter, was for its vice-president to interview officers of bankrupt and made an examination of its own financial files which only contained financial statements emanating from this bankrupt. The record here is devoid of evidence as to any other inquiry ever having been made by appellant into the financial condition of this bankrupt at the above critical time. The only reasonable inference to be made from the established facts is that if appellant had reasonably made further inquiry as to this bankrupt\u2019s financial condition at such time it would have disclosed to it the fact that bankrupt was insolvent on December 3, 1958, which stands admitted in the record. Appellant\u2019s vice-president testified before the Referee that all information received by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>it as to bankrupt\u2019s then financial condition, from various creditors and other sources, was negative or adverse to the financial stability of the bankrupt. The only reason given by appellant as to why it did not make any other or further inquiry into the then financial condition of the bankrupt before demanding and receiving the preferential assignments in question, is that its vice-president testified he believed and solely relied on the statements of bankrupt\u2019s principal officers when they told him that \u201cthey were merely short of working capital\u201d and under the circumstances he accepted such statement to be an existing fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">When the above primary facts are considered in relation to other facts as set forth in Judge Stephenson\u2019s opinion, <em>supra, </em>and the totality thereof properly categorized and squared with universally accepted rules, principles and standards, we think it is made manifest as a matter of law that the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard was correctly applied to the Referee\u2019s findings in the case at bar. This, notwithstanding Judge Stephenson considered his power to do so as stemming only from General Order 47, <em>supra, </em>and not Rule 52, supra;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that he made findings of fact <em>contra </em>to those of the Referee only from the record evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">A prime legal concept engendered by the evidence in the case at bar is that in a case such as this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-14\">\u201c * * * an inquiry of the debtor only (as to his solvency) is generally insufficient, where his answer, under the circumstances, could readily have been found to be untrue. As a matter of fact, it is the creditor\u2019s cause for belief and not the debtor\u2019s knowledge, or lack of it, that is important. And if the creditor fails to make an inquiry when he had a duty to do so, he will be charged with all the knowledge which he would have acquired had he conducted such an investigation.\u201d Collier on Bankruptcy, Yol. 3, pp. 996-997, and cases cited. (Par. added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aod-dedup-0\">Paraphrasing what Judge San-born of this Court said in Brown Shoe Co. v. Carns, 8 Cir., 65 F.2d 294, 297, cert. den. 290 U.S. 695, 54 S.Ct. 130, 78 L.Ed. 598, where evidence of \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d a debtor was insolvent was the issue: There was, perhaps, no direct evidence that on December 3, 1958, appellant knew that the liabilities of this debtor exceeded it assets. However, it appears appellant by its conduct has established that it had knowledge of facts which caused it to investigate bankrupt\u2019s then solvency. Applicable law negatives any right in appellant to place \u201cany sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>stantial reliance upon\u201d this bankrupt\u2019s statement \u201cthat it was not insolvent.\u201d Particularly is this true when, as here, appellant, after receiving the assignment in question, knew that it had taken assignments to a large portion of the property of this bankrupt as security for a preexisting debt, which property necessarily would be required by it to continue its ordinary business operations. As Judge Sanborn said (65 F.2d loc. cit. 297):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-4\">\u201cIn order to recover (the voidable transfers here), it was not necessary for the trustee to show that the creditor actually knew that a preference was being effected. (Citing cases.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-5\">\u201cIt was only necessary that the circumstances established by the evidence be such as would lead a reasonably prudent man to that belief., (Citing cases.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-6\">\u201cMere suspicion is insufficient. (Citing cases.) And the reasonable cause for belief must be qne that a preference would result, not merely that it might result. (Citing cases.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">\u201cWhile it has been held that the knowledge of the failure of a debtor to discharge his obligations promptly is alone insufficient to. establish reasonable cause to believe that a preference is being effected (citing cases), knowledge of * * * (facts <em>which </em>would lead a reasonable person to make an inquiry is copsid-ered to be) evidence tending to show reasonable cause for such belief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">We said, in Coder v. McPherson, 8 Cir., 152 F. 951, 953:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-10\">\u201cNotice of facts which would incite a man.of ordinary.prqdence to an inquiry under similar .circumstances is notice of all the facts which a reasonably diligent inquiry would disclose.\u201d ... \u2018</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">No fact appears in the; record -.here from which an inference 'can \u2018be made that by a reasonably diligent inquiry appellant, acting as a reasonable person, would have had no cause to believe that this bankrupt was not insolvent on December 3, 1958. The Referee was entitled to make reasonable inferences from the facts before him concerning that issue, but he was not empowered to make unreasonable inferences or conclusions thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">By Finding of Fact No. 4 (204 F.Supp. 1. c. 45) as made by the Referee, it is clear that the total amount of appellant\u2019s \u201cpreferred status\u201d claim was allowed in a legal concept that an \u201cassignment contained in an application\u201d made by this bankrupt for the performance bonds in question was deemed to be a perfected general assignment. Judge Stephenson, demonstrates that such assignment was not perfected \u201cin accordance with Iowa Law * * * \u201d so that it could not \u201cprevail against the Trustee under Section 70, sub. c of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110.\u201d Appellant does not contest that ruling in this appeal. Instead, in its brief here, under heading \u201cQuestion Raised by the Appeal\u201d it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajv-dedup-0\">\u201cThe sole claim of the appellant in this appeal is that the district court erred in setting aside, as voidable preferences, its chattel mortgages on the heavy equipment and motor vehicles and disallowing its claim of secured status and priority as to those proceeds based upon the chattel mortgages. <em>Appellant makes no further claim of priority or secured status with respect to the balance of its $27,032.54 initial claim </em>over and above the proceeds realized from the sale of the mortgaged assets as stated, above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">That the \u201ctwo chattel mortgages\u201d now relied on by appellant to sustain a \u201csecured status\u201d in this bankruptcy proceeding were preferential transfers within th\u00e9 ambit of Section 60, sub. a, subject to\u2019being \u201cavoided\u201d under 60, sub. b of' th\u00e9 Bankruptcy Act, <em>supra, </em>is manifest as a matter of law and just as apparent from Judge Stephenson\u2019s opinion'as is his ruling in respect to the general assignment originally relied on by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>appellant to sustain such a claim in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"AV9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-5\">. Sec Gross v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md. et al., 302 F.2d 338 (8 Cir. 1962). \u201cAn appellate court reviews judgments, not the reason which may be given in their support. It is only common sense that if, on the record before us, we determine that the judgment is correct, it should be affirmed, regardless of the correctness of the reasons which may be given to support it.\u201d Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide and Carbon Corp., 289 F.2d 86, 89 (9 Cir. 1961), rev. on other grounds, 370 U.S. 690, 82 S.Ct. 1404, 8 L.Ed.2d 777.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">. We have in the past indicated that where a district judge is of the opinion that a correct result has not been reached on facts, by a decision of the referee in bankruptcy, he should not undertake to make independent findings of fact merely from record evidence in review proceeding under Section 39, sub. c supra, except where, as here, the processes on which the Referee\u2019s findings rest constitute legal injustice. Otherwise, if new or additional findings are to be made \u201che may soundly exercise a discretion to receive or require additional evidence\u201d adduced before him and \u201cdetermine from the entire record thus before him\u201d what correct result under applicable law should be reached. \u201cWhether oral evidence shall be received or required in the proceedings before him is, of course, a matter for his sound discretion and is not a matter of right to the parties.\u201d Dunsdon v. Federal Land Bank of St. Paul, 137 F.2d 84 (8 Cir. 1943). Manifestly, when a district judge so proceeds it is his findings of fact and conclusion to which the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Rule 52, F.R.Civ.P. should be applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
