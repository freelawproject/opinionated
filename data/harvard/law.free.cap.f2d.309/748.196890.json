The order of dismissal is based on the notion that the debtor, having availed himself of a like plan within six years next preceding the filing of this plan, is barred by Section 14, sub. c(5) of Chapter III, which, as applied by the District Court to a Chapter XIII proceedings, would operate to bar a discharge where the debtor within six years prior to the filing of a petition has been granted \u201ca discharge, or had a composition or an arrangement by way of composition or wage earner\u2019s plan by way of composition confirmed under this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-21\">This construction of the statute follows In re Bingham, D.C., 190 F.Supp. 219, in which the same court, under similar facts, reasoned that the broad purposes of Section 14, sub. c(5) to exclude habitual bankrupts were applicable to those seeking an extension of time to pay their debts in full. We do not believe that Section 14, sub. c(5) was intended or should be so construed. It is decisively significant, we think, that the bar of Section 14, sub. e(5) is made expressly applicable to discharges in straight bankruptcy or compositions or wage earner plan by way of composition, but is noticeably silent with respect to extensions of time in which to pay debts in full. Indeed, \u201ccompositions\u201d and \u201cextensions\u201d are recognized in the statute as separate forms of relief, see \u00a7 623, Chap. XIII; and in the legislative history, see H.R. 1409, p. 29, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., cited in Fishman v. Verlin, 2 Cir., 255 F.2d 682, affirming In re Verlin, D.C., 148 F.Supp. 660, in which the history of the Act is reviewed in detail. See also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>In re Thompson, D.C., 51 F.Supp. 12; In re Mahaley, D.C., 187 F.Supp. 229; and Judge Lindley\u2019s dissent in In re Jensen, 7 Cir., 200 F.2d 58, 61. Under a wage earner extension plan \u201cThe debtor seeks to pay debts \u2014 not to discharge them. In that effort he should be encouraged. Such encouragement is in accord with the declared Congressional intent of Chapter XIII.\u201d See In the Matter of Olen v. Sharp, Debtor (W.D.Mo.), 205 F.Supp. 786. And see also In re Autry, Debtor, D.C., 204 F.Supp. 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">We conclude that the plan asserted here does not come within the letter or the spirit of the bar in Section 14, sub. c(5). The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
