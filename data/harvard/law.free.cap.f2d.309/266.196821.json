The Board entered an order requiring respondent to cease and desist and to take certain affirmative action. The Board has now petitioned this Court for enforcement. Respondent resists solely on the ground that there was no substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">The evidence was far from compelling, but we cannot say that it was unsubstantial. It consisted principally of testimony regarding conversations between respondent\u2019s plant superintendent and several of respondent\u2019s employees. The testimony was conflicting, and conflicting inferences might have been drawn as to the meaning and effect of the conversations in the circumstances in which they occurred. A determination of the credibility of the principal witnesses was critical to the ultimate decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-15\">In reviewing a Board order in such a case, it is not our function \u201cto judge the credibility of witnesses; * * or dispute the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, although this court might justifiably malee a different choice were the matter before it de novo.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Stanislaus Implement &amp; Hardware Co., 226 F.2d 377, 381 (9th Cir. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-16\">Since no legal infirmity in the Board\u2019s order is suggested, and since we conclude that the order was \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160 (f)), the order must be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
