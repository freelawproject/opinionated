When the turn was about halfway completed a car driven by defendant came over a hill crest about 100 yards to the north, at a speed of 65 miles per hour. A collision occurred. Plaintiff was thrown from Mrs. Kaiser\u2019s automobile and received 36 fractures, and various permanent injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-19\">At the time of the trial defendant was serving abroad in the armed services of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">Mrs. Kaiser heard defendant, immediately after the accident, admit to another person that he was exceeding the speed limit. Plaintiff had no recollection of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">Jack Wilson, an adjuster for the Hartford Accident Indemnity Company, which, insured Mrs. Kaiser\u2019s car, testified that defendant gave him a statement four days after the accident, in which defendant said he came over the hill at about 65 miles an hour and was aware of the club entrance, having traveled the road many times. He said there was a warning sign, and as he came over the crest he saw the car, with a blinker light on, making a left turn to go west into the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\">Casimir Bera, a witness for defendant, testified that, as he followed the Kaiser car in his own car for two or three miles, he observed that the occupants were talking quite a bit. He also stated that through the windows of the Kaiser vehicle before it started its turn, he saw the oncoming car of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-23\">It was stipulated that, prior to the institution of the instant suit, plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>claim against Mrs. Kaiser was settled for $9,000 on her covenant not to sue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">1. When Wilson was called as a witness for plaintiff, he was examined by the court out of the presence of the-jury. He stated that \u201cat that time\u201d he was an adjuster and \u201cat this time\u201d he was a field man; that he was employed by Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, which insured Mrs. Kaiser. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201cMr. French (attorney for defendant) : He is not my insurance adjuster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201cMr. Short (attorney for plaintiff) : I am being very careful not to bring out that he was an insurance adjuster.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\u201cThe Court: And I urge you, when you testify again, that you do not inadvertently disclose you were an insurance adjuster. I think you have been warned of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\u201cMr. French: Your Honor, I think I have a right to show this man\u2019s interest. I am certainly going to ask him by whom he was employed at the time of this occurrence, because he was adjusting this claim on behalf of Mrs. Kaiser who was the driver of the automobile. And he is here as an interested witness, and I certainly have a right to show his employment and in what capacity he was doing whatever he was going to testify to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\u201cMr. Short: There is no interest this man could possibly have. <em>Hartford has no interest in this case.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\u201cThe Court: What interest could he have in view of the fact, as I understand it, <em>the other case has been disposed of?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\u201cMr. French: Your Honor, if this man- \u2014 -I don\u2019t know what he is to testify to. But let us assume that he is to testify that he had a conversation with the defendant. At the time he had the conversation with the defendant, this case had not been settled. He was there as an interested party representing a party to this accident. And I certainly have a right to show his interest- \u2014 not that they may not have any interest today, but at the time the statement was made, they certainly had an interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a8d-dedup-0\">\u201cMr. Short: You test the man\u2019s credibility as of today, not as of when it occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-16\">\u201cMr. French: If he is testifying to something that occurred shortly after this occurrence, at the time they had an interest in this matter, I have a right to show that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-18\">\u201cMr. Short: If he wants to bring this insurance question out on this floor, your Honor, this is a peculiar position. Here is the plaintiff objecting to the jury being informed about insurance in any manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-19\">\u201cThe Court: I am going to let you make inquiry to show interest. The witness is going to be permitted to testify. But I do not think that I would relax the bars until he turns - \u2014 develops that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-20\">\u201cMr. Short: I won\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">Wilson then testified <em>before </em>the jury on direct and cross-examination. On cross-examination defense counsel was permitted over objection to show that the witness was employed by the Hartford Accident Indemnity Company, when he took defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-22\">The court permitted this evidence \u201cto show interest\u201d. Upon closing argument before the jury, the record shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-23\">\u201cMr. French: Is he interested in this case ? Yes, he is. He is employed as an adjuster by the Hartford Insurance Company. He told you what an adjuster is. An adjuster investigates and attempts to adjust claims. At the time that he spoke to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Mr. McKinney, he was speaking to him in his capacity as an adjuster for the Hartford Insurance Company who carried a policy of insurance covering the Kaiser vehicle. Is he interested ? Naturally. He does not want to see Hartford have to pay money to Mrs. Cotter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\">\u201cMr. Short: I am going to object to this, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">\u201cThe Court: The objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cMr. French: So he talked to Mr. McKinney. I think that he was as honest as he possibly could be with regar d to his recollection of the conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">* ' * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">That is the only evidence in this ease whatsoever of the speed of the vehicle. There is not any other evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Later the following occurred (Italics supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">\u201cMr. French: * * * She [plaintiff] was seriously injured. There is no question about that. But let her look to the person that caused those injuries. Think of this \u2014 Mrs. Kaiser, Mr. Wilson, the Hartford Insurance Company man\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-12\">\u201cMr. Short: Same objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-14\">\u201cMr. French: <em>They all </em>have an interest. It is not illogical at all for Mrs. Cotter to seek elsewhere for her damages. But she is not entitled to damages from Mr. McKinney. Let her look to the person that caused those injuries \u2014 Mrs. Kaiser.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-15\">In the closing argument, defense counsel mentioned Hartford at least seven times.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-16\">While it was within the province of defense counsel to show, if he could, that Wilson might have had an interest which affected his credibility, it was not claimed that such interest, if shown, prevented Wilson from being \u201cas honest as he possibly could be with regard to his recollection of the conversation\u201d with defendant. In fact, Mr. French made that admission. But obviously the repeated interjections by defense counsel of references to Hartford were aimed, not so much at showing an interest in the witness Wilson as at directing the jury\u2019s attention to Hartford as a possible source of collection of damages. Even then counsel knew that Hartford had already been released by plaintiff by a covenant not to sue Mrs. Kaiser. Nevertheless he suggested to the jury, \u201cBut let her look to the person that caused those injuries. Think of this \u2014 Mrs. Kaiser, Mr. Wilson, the Hartford Insurance Company man * * * <em>They all </em>have an interest.\u201d (Italics supplied.) Laymen jurors were asked to believe from this language \u2014 \u25a0 \u201cThey all\u201d, rather than \u201cboth\u201d \u2014 that <em>three </em>sources for recovery of <em>damages </em>were available to plaintiff, <em>i.e. </em>\u201cMrs. Kaiser\u201d, \u201cMr. Wilson\u201d and the \u201cHartford Insurance Company\u201d. The verdict for defendant supports a strong inference that the jury was influenced by counsel\u2019s argument to find for defendant, which would shift the liability for damages from defendant\u2019s insurer to Hartford.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-20\">In Clark v. Hasselquist, 304 Ill.App. 41 at 47, 25 N.E.2d 900 (1940), the court referred to questions put by plaintiff\u2019s counsel to a witness for defendant-appellant, one Buckley, who answered that he was investigating the case for defendant\u2019s lawyers and Travelers Insurance Company. The court said, at 48, 25 N.E.2d at 903:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-21\">\u201c * # * it is true as counsel for appellee argue that they had a right to show by questions on cross examination any and all interest of Buckley in the case which might affect the weight and credit to be given his testimony and that it is proper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>show the relationship which exists between a witness and the parties to the suit, but here after Buckley had testified that he was investigating this ease for appellant and his attorneys, counsel for appellee assumed he was investigating the case for some other party not a party to this record and his answer disclosed that other party to be an insurance company. In our opinion this examination by counsel, when considered in connection with their argument to the jury, was for no other purpose than to disclose to the jury that the Travelers Insurance Company was the insurance carrier and the trial court erred in permitting counsel to pursue their inquiries after Buckley had stated that he was investigating this case for appellant and his counsel of record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In Davidson v. Loomis, 282 Ill.App. 515 (1935), at 519, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cThe calling of the attention of-the jury to the fact that the plaintiff carried accident insurance and giving the name of the insurance company was prejudicial error. It had no place in the lawsuit. Defendant was not entitled to reduce his damages because of any insurance which the plaintiff might have had and. defendant cannot excuse himself now by saying that the jury was not influenced thereby. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Kavanaugh v. Parret, 379 Ill. 273, 40 N.E.2d 500 (1942) is typical of many expressions by the Illinois courts of review on this subject. At 277, 40 N.E.2d at 502, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-9\">\u201c * * * Whether the defendant has someone to help him pay a judgment, if one is rendered against him, has nothing to do with the case on trial, and to bring it into the lawsuit is to import an influence having nothing to do with the merits of the ease and designed only to aid the plaintiff at the expense of the defendant. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Likewise in Edwards v. Hill-Thomas Lime Co., 378 Ill. 180, at 186, 37 N.E.2d 801 at 804 (1941), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-11\">\u201c * * * It is apparent under the showing made in this case that the real purpose which counsel had in mind was to advise the jury that the insurance company was making the defense and was liable for the payment of any judgment rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">\u201c * * * The jury may have been influenced in returning a verdict against the defendant because it was, in this manner, improperly informed that the insurance company was making the defense and would be liable for any judgment rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-13\">Repeatedly the Illinois courts have applied this principle to various stages of a trial, such as examination of jurors on <em>voir dire, </em>examination of witnesses and arguments to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-14\">- We are not here confronted with a reference to insurance coverage made inadvertently by a witness in answering a proper question. We are faced with an argument to a jury made in a deliberate fashion by one skilled in the law, an attorney. The Illinois courts have been reluctant to grant a new trial because of the inadvertence, unresponsiveness, or unexpected answer of a witness to a question, which informs the jury of the fact that an insurance company carried the risk involved in the litigation. Williams v. Consumers Co., 352 Ill. 51, 185 N.E.217 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">In Pinkerton v. Oak Park National Bank, 16 Ill.App.2d 91, at 100, 147 N.E.2d 390 at 395 (1958), relied upon by both sides in this case, the court pointed out that in Williams v. Consumers Co., supra, the Supreme Court concluded that, \u201cin order for the mentioning of insurance to be the basis for a mistrial, counsel must have persisted in showing the existence of insurance and referring to it in such a manner as to indicate his desire and intention to prejudice and influence the jury thereby, and that effort must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>resulted in such prejudice and passion that the verdict against the defendant was influenced thereby and defendant thereby injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The evidence as to the happening of the accident in the case at bar and the very serious injuries thereby sustained by plaintiff lead us with certainty to the conclusion that the verdict for defendant was the result of prejudice and passion induced by the improper argument of defendant\u2019s counsel. This conclusion requires a reversal of the judgment of the district court and remandment for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">2. It is unnecessary for us to discuss other grounds for reversal urged by plaintiff, because, upon a new trial, a record may be made which will be free of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-12\">. At the time of the trial there was an agreement by counsel that plaintiff would make no attempt to recover from defendant or against bis insurance company through the defendant in excess of the $25,000 coverage of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-17\">. The jury knew nothing of the stipulation, <em>ante </em>2, that plaintiff\u2019s claim against Mrs. Kaiser had been settled on a covenant not to sue. Neither -was the jury informed that defendant also was represented by an insurance company.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
