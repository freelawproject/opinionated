The District Court denied the motion without a hearing. This Court reversed, and the trial court held a hearing on the merits of appellant\u2019s contention that he was not mentally competent to enter the plea of guilty or to waive appointment of counsel or waive arraignment. Appellant was brought into court to testify on his own behalf and expert testimony was offered by a professional psychiatrist at the request of the Government. After a full hearing, the trial court found that appellant failed to carry the burden of showing that he was not mentally competent at the time of his plea of guilty. We conclude that the record fully substantiates the finding of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-19\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b802-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
