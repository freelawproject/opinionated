The exhaustive opinion of the trial court (Judge Van Pelt) published at 202 F.Supp. 624 contains a careful and detailed analysis of the essential facts. Judge Van Pelt\u2019s well considered conclusions, which we believe to be correct and with which we concur, are supported by a wealth of authority. On the basis of said opinion, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. Also see: Kostal v. Stoner, 10 Cir., 292 F.2d 492, certiorari denied 369 U.S. 868, 82 S.Ct. 1032, 8 L.Ed.2d 87 (4/30/62), rehearing denied 370 U.S. 920, 82 S.Ct. 1559, 8 L.Ed.2d 500 (6/11/62).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
