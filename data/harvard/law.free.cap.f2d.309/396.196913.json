The aliases consisted of combinations of the name of appellant plus one nickname in lieu of his given name. The cases cited by appellant to the contrary are inapposite, although United States v. Monroe, 2 Cir., 1947, 164 F.2d 471 teaches that any prejudice arising from the use of an alias, as there, may be cured by instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-22\">The record does not bear out the claim of prejudicial argument on the part of the prosecutor. Furthermore, there was no objection to the argument. Sikes v. United States, 5 Cir., 1960, 279 F.2d 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-23\">The denial by the court of the request of appellant for a handwriting expert to testify in his behalf was not an abuse of discretion in view of the limitation placed on the evidence sought to be attacked through the use of the expert. This too was a discretionary matter for the trial judge. Reistroffer v. United States, 8 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-24\">Appellant lost his case before the jury. The verdict was amply supported. No prejudicial error appearing we must and do</p>\n<p id=\"AJa\">Affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
