After proceedings which revealed repeated violations, the Secretary suspended for ten days the petitioner\u2019s license as a dealer and broker in perishable agricultural commodities. The statute authorizes license suspension up to 90 days for violations involving misrepresentation of kind, quality or other specified conditions of any perishable agricultural commodity and the hearing examiner recommended a 21 day suspension. The Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930, required proof of fraudulent purpose as an element of the misrepresentation violations. 46 Stat. 533 (1930). To achieve stricter enforcement as the legislative history discloses, the act was amended in 1956 to eliminate the need to show the existence of fraudulent purpose. 70 Stat. 726 (1956), 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 499b(5). See H.R.Rep. No. 1196, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 3-4; S.Rep. No. 2507, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., 4, 6, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News 1956, p. 3699. See also, Goodman v. Benson, 286 F.2d 896 (7th Cir. 1961); Eastern Produce Co. v. Benson, 278 F.2d 606 (3d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">Our examination of the record satisfies us that there is substantial evidence in the record to sustain the Secretary\u2019s findings. We also hold that petitioner\u2019s contention of procedural errors which render the suspended order invalid is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
