Lovette asserts the district court erred in concluding he was not entitled to qualified immunity. He specifically asserts the district court erred in concluding that his conduct violated clearly established law under the Fourth Amendment standard governing the treatment of arrestees. He contends the district court should have analyzed his qualified immunity argument under the Fourteenth Amendment, which governs the treatment of pretrial detainees. Alternatively, he argues that even if his case is analyzed under the more stringent Fourth Amendment standard, he is entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-20\">After a thorough analysis, the district court concluded Stephens\u2019 excessive force claim should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, and concluded that Lovette was not entitled to qualified immunity. We have reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, and conclude the district court did not err in applying the Fourth Amendment' to Stephens\u2019 excessive force claim and denying qualified immunity to Lovette. Thus, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-24\">.
