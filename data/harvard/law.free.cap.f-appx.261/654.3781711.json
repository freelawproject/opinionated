Lin argues that the BIA erred in denying her motion to reopen as numerically barred and untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-22\">This court has jurisdiction to review the issue. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this court applies a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard, regardless of the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of the alien\u2019s request for relief. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The BIA determined that the motion was both numerically barred and untimely and that Lin did not qualify for an exception to the numerical and time restrictions for filing motions to reopen found in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). The BIA determined further that, even if the motion was not barred, it would deny it \u201cas a matter of discretion\u201d for the same reason it had denied Lin\u2019s earlier motion to reopen, namely, Lin\u2019s fraudulent representations made during the immigration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The denial as a matter of discretion represents a separate, \u201cindependent\u201d ground for denying a motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Lin does not address or contest the BIA\u2019s determination that, even if the motion was not barred, it would deny the motion \u201cas a matter of discretion\u201d on the basis of her fraudulent representations. She likewise does not contest that she made such fraudulent representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Because Lin has not addressed the denial of her motion to reopen as a matter of discretion, she has abandoned the issue on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Lin\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. <em>See Walker v. Thompson, </em>214 F.3d 615, 624-25 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
