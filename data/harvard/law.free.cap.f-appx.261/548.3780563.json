Adembuh claims the Board erred in finding his asylum application was filed late. He further claims the Board\u2019s factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence. He also claims the Board\u2019s finding that his asylum application was frivolous is not supported by the evidence. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-18\">An alien applying for asylum must show \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000). The one-year period begins on the date of the alien\u2019s last arrival in the United States or April 1, 1997, whichever is later. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(2)(ii) (2007). An asylum application may be considered after the one-year time frame \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Extraordinary circumstances are \u201cevents or factors directly related to the failure to meet the 1-year deadline\u201d and may include ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cprovided that\u201d the alien complies with the requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A.1988), including the requirement that \u201c[t]he counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned has been informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and given an opportunity to respond.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(5) (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-19\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>der paragraph (2),\u201d which includes both the Attorney General\u2019s decisions whether an alien has complied with the one-year time limit and whether there are changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness. Courts of appeal have uniformly held this jurisdiction-stripping provision precludes judicial review not only of all such determinations but also the merits of the underlying asylum claim. <em>See Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). We find we are without jurisdiction to review Adembuh\u2019s challenge to the finding that his asylum application was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the CAT, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). Factual findings by the Board or the immigration judge \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). Furthermore, credibility findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. A trier of fact who rejects an applicant\u2019s testimony on credibility grounds must offer specific, cogent reasons for doing so. <em>Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989). \u201cExamples of specific and cogent reasons include inconsistent statements, contradictory evidence, and inherently improbable testimony.\u201d <em>Tewabe v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 533, 538 (4th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citations omitted). This court accords broad, though not unlimited, deference to credibility findings supported by substantial evidence. <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). If the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding is based on speculation and conjecture rather than specific and cogent reasoning, it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Tewabe, </em>446 F.3d at 538. We find after reviewing the record that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s denial of Adembuh\u2019s request for withholding from removal and relief under the CAT. We further find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s frivolousness finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
