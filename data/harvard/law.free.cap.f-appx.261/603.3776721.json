He was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence as an armed career criminal of one hundred eighty months\u2019 imprisonment, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2000). Spigler appeals his armed career criminal sentence. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-15\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing enhancements de novo and factual findings with respect to sentencing for clear error. <em>United States v. Bollin, </em>264 F.3d 391, 415 (4th Cir.2001). A person who violates \u00a7 922(g)(1) and has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses is an armed career criminal subject to enhanced penalties. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Under \u00a7 924(e), the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d is a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that is one of several numerated offenses, including burglary, or a crime that' otherwise \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">Spigler challenges the court\u2019s finding that his prior Maryland fourth degree burglary conviction was a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e). In <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598-99, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), the Supreme Court held that \u201cburglary,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e), is limited to \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary, defined as the \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>When the issue is contested, and the district court must determine whether a prior conviction constitutes a violent felony, the court generally must \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2148; <em>see James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594, 167 L.Ed.2d 582 (2007) (\u201cWe consider whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision [of the armed career criminal statute], without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.\u201d); <em>United States v. Mathias, </em>482 F.3d 743, 746 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cUnder the categorical approach, we consider the nature of the offense as defined by statute, not the conduct and circumstances underlying a specific conviction.\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>76 U.S.L.W. 3046 (U.S. July 12, 2007) (No. 07-61). However, because some states define burglary broadly, the district court in such cases may examine the indictment or information to determine whether the defendant was charged with entry of a building. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16-17, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">At the time of sentencing, the court had available to it the statement of probable cause and court\u2019s docket, which alleged that Spigler \u201cdid unlawfully break and enter the storehouse of [another] with the intent to commit (a theft/a crime of violence/arson in the second degree) in violation of Art. 27, Sec. 30(a).\u201d However, Spigler pled guilty to a lesser charge of burglary in the fourth degree under Md. Code Art. 27, \u00a7 32. The fourth degree burglary statute in effect in 1997 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">(a) Breaking and entering dwelling or storehouse.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">(1) A person may not break and enter the dwelling of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">(2) A person may not break and enter the storehouse of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">(b) Intent to commit theft.\u2014A person may not be in or on the dwelling or storehouse of another or any yard, garden, or other area belonging to the dwelling or storehouse of another with the intent to commit theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">(c) Possession of burglar\u2019s tools.\u2014A person may not possess burglar\u2019s tools with the intent to use or permit the use of the tools in the commission of any violation of this subheading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-13\">Md.Code. Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 32. The charging documents do not indicate under which subsection of the statute Spigler was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-14\">Because the Maryland statute defines three ways Spigler could have committed burglary in the fourth degree under Art. 27, \u00a7 32, and under at least one of those definitions there is no serious risk of physical injury, the district court could not use the categorical approach of examining the statutory elements of the crime to determine whether it was a crime of violence set forth in <em>Taylor. See United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186, 188 (4th Cir.2001). When the fact of a prior conviction does not categorically establish the nature of the prior offense, the sentencing court generally may consider only \u201cthe charging document, the terms of a plea agreement, the plea colloquy, the statutory definition, or any explicit finding of the trial judge to which the defendant assented or other admissions of the defendant\u201d to resolve the issue. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 25, 125 S.Ct. 1254).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">However, here, the district court correctly utilized the statement of probable cause to review the facts underlying the burglary conviction. <em>See United States v. Simms, </em>441 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>denied, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 233, 166 L.Ed.2d 184 (2006) (finding the district court\u2019s reliance on an application for charge to determine that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(e) did not violate <em>Shepard </em>because the \u201capplication ... was later explicitly incorporated into Maryland\u2019s statement of charges against [defendant].\u201d); <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>158 F.3d 199 (4th Cir.1998) (holding that, under Maryland law, affidavit setting forth facts demonstrating probable cause is part of the charging papers); and <em>United States v. Kirksey, </em>138 F.3d 120 (4th Cir.1998) (same). The facts in the statement of probable cause were incorporated into Maryland\u2019s Information, stating the charges against Spigler to which he pled guilty, and providing, as to the count Spigler pled guilty to, that he \u201cdid unlawfully break and enter the storehouse of [another] in violation of Art. 27, See. 32.\u201d Thus, it is clear Spigler was convicted under subsection (a)(2) of Art. 27, \u00a7 32, breaking and entering the storehouse of another. Because breaking and entering does provide the requisite \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), <em>see James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594-95, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), the district court did not err in finding the prior fourth degree burglary conviction qualified as a violent felony for the purposes of an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
