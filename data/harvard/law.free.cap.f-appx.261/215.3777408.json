Babbitt, </em>186 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.1999). Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to retaliate against an employee for enforcing her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>rights under the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of retaliation, Cain had to present evidence: \u201c(1) that she engaged in statutorily protected expression; (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) that there is some causal relation between the two events.\u201d <em>Meeks v. Computer Assocs. Int\u2019l, </em>15 F.3d 1013, 1021 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">I. PERFORMANCE RATING</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Prior to <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006), we defined an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d as \u201can ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or failure to hire, or other conduct that alters the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.\u201d <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 587 (11th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted). In <em>Burlington Northern, </em>however, the Supreme Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \u201cdoes not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment or occur at the workplace,\u201d but also covers those actions that are \u201cmaterially adverse to a reasonable employee.\u201d 126 S.Ct. at 2409. In this respect, \u201cthe employer\u2019s actions must be harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[a] lower score on [a] performance evaluation, by itself, is not actionable under Title VII unless [the employee] can establish that the lower score led to a more tangible form of adverse action, such as ineligibility for promotional opportunities.\u201d <em>Brown v. Snow, </em>440 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir.2006) (Title VII sexual harassment claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The district court did not err in concluding that receiving a \u201c2\u201d rating, the second highest performance rating, did not constitute an adverse employment action. It is undisputed that Cain was not disentitled to a bonus because of the \u201c2\u201d rating that she received. Specifically, Cain did not present any evidence that the \u201c2\u201d rating had an adverse impact on her ability to receive a promotion, raise, or any other type of employment benefit. Moreover, she failed to present any evidence, except her own self-serving allegations, that she would have been guaranteed a bonus had she received the higher rating of \u201c1.\u201d The record shows the comparator whom Cain identified received a \u201c1\u201d rating, but was not recommended for, and did not receive, a bonus. Further, Cain did not present any evidence that the \u201c2\u201d rating had an adverse impact on her ability to receive a promotion, raise, or any other type of employment benefit. Thus, without more, Cain failed to demonstrate how receiving a \u201c2\u201d rating led to a more tangible form of adverse action, or how a reasonable employee would consider receiving the second highest rating to be materially adverse. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that Cain failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of retaliation as to her performance evaluation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">II. PERFORMANCE BONUS</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">To establish a causal connection between the protected activity and an adverse employment action, \u201ca plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse employment action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Gupta, </em>212 F.3d at 590 (quotations and brackets omitted). \u201cIt is not enough for the plaintiff to show that someone in the organization knew of the protected expression; instead, the plaintiff must show that the person taking the adverse action was aware of the protected expression.\u201d <em>Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, Orange Coun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>ty, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1119 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u201cThe causal link element is construed broadly so that a plaintiff merely has to prove that the protected activity and the negative employment action are not completely unrelated.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001) (quotations omitted). In some cases, a \u201c[c]lose temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action may be sufficient to show that the two were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>256 F.3d at 1119. \u201c[A] plaintiff satisfies [the causality] element if [s]he provides sufficient evidence that the decision-maker became aware of the protected conduct, and that there was close temporal proximity between this awareness and the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Farley v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 1322, 1337 (llth Cir.1999) (addressing retaliation in ADA context where complaint made seven weeks before termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Concerning Cain\u2019s claim that she did not receive a performance bonus for the 2001-2002 year in retaliation for her filing the 1995 EEO complaint, the district court did not err in concluding that Cain failed to satisfy the causal connection <em>prima facie </em>element. The record shows there was a six-year period between the protected activity, the filing of the EEO complaint in 1995, and the alleged adverse employment action of not receiving a performance bonus for the 2001-2002 performance year. Without more, a six-year period between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is far too tenuous to create a jury issue on causation, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Additionally, there was no evidence that the decision maker was aware of the protected activity. Albert Fischer, Cain\u2019s supervisor who made the recommendations for performance bonuses, was not aware of Cain\u2019s 1995 EEO complaint until 2003, well after he had made the decision not to recommend her for a performance bonus for the 2001-2002 performance year. Moreover, although Bob Stauner was the ultimate decision maker as to who, if anyone, should receive a performance bonus, and Stauner was involved with, and had knowledge of, Cain\u2019s prior EEO complaint, Cain offered no evidence, other than her own self-serving allegations, to disprove Fischer\u2019s testimony that: (a) he did not recommend Cain for a performance bonus; (b) Stauner never attempted to influence Fischer\u2019s decision as to whom Fischer recommended for performance bonuses; and (c) none of the evaluees whom Fischer recommended for a performance award were turned down by his superiors, nor was anyone given an award whom Fischer had not first recommended. Thus, the district court did not err in concluding that Cain failed to demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation with respect to her performance award claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. Cain expressly abandons her race discrimination claims on appeal. Moreover, because Cain's brief does not present any argument with respect to her 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims, we conclude that she has abandoned these claims as well. <em>See Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., </em>257 F.3d 1249, 1255 n. 1 (11th Cir.2001) (holding an appellant abandons a claim by not raising it in the initial brief on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"><em>. </em>Cain also asserts, for the first time, an \u201congoing\u201d retaliation claim based on incidents that occurred during the years 1997 through 2001. We lack jurisdiction to consider this \u201congoing\u201d retaliation claim because Cain did not administratively exhaust this claim, and the claim was not reasonably expected to grow out of the EEO complaint she filed in 2002, which was limited to incidents that occurred during the 2001-2002 performance year. <em>See Crawford v. Babbitt, </em>186 F.3d 1322, 1326 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
