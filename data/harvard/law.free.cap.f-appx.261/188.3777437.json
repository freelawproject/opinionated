On appeal, Caldwell argues that: (1) the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by failing to consider and state what weight she gave to a state probate order of civil commitment; (2) the ALJ erred when she failed to explain what weight she gave to two medical opinions; (3) the ALJ erred by discrediting the opinions of two treating psychiatrists; and (4) the ALJ\u2019s combined errors result in reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b213-16\">On October 6, 2003, Caldwell applied for DIB and SSI. She alleged in her application that she suffered from hypertension and acute psychosis with depression. She stated that the disability onset date was June 17, 2003, the date on which an ALJ had denied her previous application for DIB and SSI. After a hearing, the ALJ denied her benefits on November 3, 2005. The Appeals Council denied her subsequent request for review, and, consequently, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security. <em>See Chester v. Bowen, </em>792 F.2d 129, 131 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam). Caldwell then filed suit in district court, and the district court affirmed the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-17\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b213-18\">We review a social security case to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-19\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-20\">\n<em>A Probate Court Commitment Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">Caldwell first argues that the ALJ erred because she failed to state what weight she gave to a state probate court order of civil commitment. While we agree with Caldwell that the ALJ is required to \u201cstate specifically the weight ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>corded to each item of evidence and why [she] reached that decision,\u201d <em>Cowart v. Schweiker, </em>662 F.2d 731, 735 (11th Cir.1981), the ALJ\u2019s failure only constitutes reversible error if it created an evidentiary gap that caused unfairness or clear prejudice. <em>Brown v. Shalala, </em>44 F.3d 931, 935 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Caldwell was committed for less than two weeks, from August 31, 2001 until September 10, 2001. As the district court recognized, the psychological expert that the ALJ consulted examined Caldwell\u2019s records from August 2001 to the date of the hearing. The ALJ adopted the expert\u2019s testimony that Caldwell\u2019s condition had improved significantly since August 2001. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s failure to explicitly state the weight that she gave to the commitment order did not create an evidentiary gap, and Caldwell\u2019s first argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\n<em>B. Weight Given to Medical Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Caldwell next argues that the ALJ erred when she failed to explain what weight she gave to the opinions of Dr. Kenneth Warren, an examining psychologist, and Dr. Scott Bell, an examining physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">An ALJ\u2019s failure to state with particularity the weight given different medical opinions is reversible error. <em>Sharfarz v. Bowen, </em>825 F.2d 278, 279 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam). When, however, an incorrect application of the regulations results in harmless error because the correct application would not contradict the ALJ\u2019s ultimate findings, the ALJ\u2019s decision will stand. <em>See Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\n<em>1. Dr. Bell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The ALJ consulted a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) to help her assess Caldwell\u2019s residual functional capacity. In response to a hypothetical question based on an individual with specific limitations similar to Caldwell\u2019s, the VE testified that such a person would have few restrictions beyond an inability to perform complex and varied tasks but could perform light, unskilled jobs such as production assembler, cafeteria attendant, and machine tending operator. Caldwell argued before the district court that the ALJ erred by not including Dr. Bell\u2019s findings in the hypothetical limitations that she presented to the VE. Dr. Bell had seen Caldwell for a consultative physical examination in relation to Caldwell\u2019s previous application for benefits on February 6, 2003. His examination notes indicated that Caldwell had no relevant \u201cvisual, communicative, or work place environmental limitations,\u201d but he recommended in his physical capacities evaluation that Caldwell only \u201coccasionally\u201d work around \u201cfumes, noxious odors, dust, mists, gases, or poor ventilation\u201d or around moving mechanical parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">We agree with the district court that the ALJ\u2019s failure concerning Dr. Bell\u2019s opinions was harmless error because the application of Dr. Bell\u2019s limitations would not have changed the result. Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, the ALJ found that Caldwell had the residual functional capacity to perform jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy. The job of production assembler, as normally performed in the national economy, requires no exposure to moving parts, humidity, atmospheric conditions, toxic or caustic chemicals, or \u201cother environmental conditions.\u201d Department of Labor, <em>Selected Characteristics of Occupations Defined in the Revised Dictionary of Occupational Titles, </em>706.687-010 (1993). Thus, because the limitations that Dr. Bell highlighted would not affect Caldwell\u2019s ability to perform one the of jobs that, according to the VE, is appropriate for Caldwell and exists in significant numbers in the national economy, the ALJ\u2019s failure to discuss the weight she gave to Dr. Bell\u2019s findings was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\n<em>2. Dr. Warren</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The ALJ\u2019s failure to state what weight she accorded Dr. Warren\u2019s opinion was also harmless. The record includes a Psychiatric Review Technique form and Mental Residual Functional Capacity Assessment form, both completed by Dr. Warren on January 9, 2004. The ALJ mentioned Dr. Warren\u2019s findings, but did not state what weight she gave them. The ALJ explicitly stated, however, that she gave substantial weight to the testimony of Dr. Doug McKeown, citing that his testimony was generally consistent with the record. Dr. Warren\u2019s findings do not contradict Dr. McKeown\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Dr. McKeown testified that Caldwell had a moderately impaired ability to maintain \u201cconcentration in persistence and pace for periods of time up to two hours.\u201d Dr. Warren similarly suggested that Caldwell would need a break every two hours. Both Dr. Warren and Dr. McKeown agreed that Caldwell could perform simple tasks. The doctors also agreed that Caldwell\u2019s medical records showed that she had improved with treatment. Dr. Warren recommended that Caldwell be restricted from \u201cclose personal contact with the general public,\u201d which is consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Caldwell could perform the jobs of machine tender and production assembler. Moreover, Dr. Warren\u2019s opinions do not otherwise contradict the ALJ\u2019s findings. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s failure to state what weight she gave to the opinions was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>C. Discredited Medical Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Third, Caldwell argues that the ALJ erred by discrediting the opinions of two treating psychiatrists, Dr. Mark Livingston and Dr. Josu\u00e9 Becerra. The testimony or opinion of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable weight unless there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for not doing so. <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. \u201cGood cause\u201d exists where (1) the treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence, (2) the evidence supported a contrary finding, or (3) the treating physician\u2019s opinion was eonclusory or inconsistent with his own medical records. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ must clearly articulate, however, the reasons for giving less weight to the opinion of a treating physician, and the failure to do so constitutes reversible error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">In her opinion, the ALJ explicitly rejected the assessments provided by Dr. Livingston and Dr. Becerra, stating that she discredited them opinions because they were inconsistent with their own treatment notes. The psychiatric records from South Central Alabama Mental Health, where Dr. Livingston and Dr. Becerra treated Caldwell, indicate that her mental status was \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cappropriate,\u201d and that she consistently experienced no acute symptoms. On May 18, 2004, the psychiatric records indicate that Caldwell\u2019s mental health status was \u201cwell maintained.\u201d On August 10, 2004, the psychiatric records reflect that no changes needed to be made to Caldwell\u2019s treatment. On January 18, 2005, the records indicate that the psychiatrists discontinued Caldwell\u2019s Wellbutrin treatment and that she was \u201cdoing well.\u201d The records also indicate that Caldwell\u2019s progress toward her treatments goals was consistently rated as \u201cgood,\u201d and the most recent record shows that Caldwell\u2019s progress was rated as \u201cexcellent.\u201d The latest psychiatric record, May 17, 2005, indicates that Caldwell\u2019s memory, attention span, and impulse control were good. The psychiatrist noted that Caldwell\u2019s mental status was normal, her behavior was normal, her affect was appropriate, her thought process was clear, and her thought content was normal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Unlike those records, the residual functional capacity questionnaires that Living<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>ston and Becerra completed for Caldwell on March 3, 2004 and May 31, 2005, respectively, both describe Caldwell\u2019s limitations as \u201cmild,\u201d \u201cmoderate,\u201d \u201cmoderately severe,\u201d and \u201csevere.\u201d Thus, substantial evidence supports a finding that the treatment records from South Central Alabama Mental Health contradict the medical opinions listed on the doctors\u2019 questionnaires. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\n<em>D. Combined, Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Caldwell lastly argues that the combination of errors results in reversible error. Because the ALJ did not commit any material errors, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
