He argues that the government breached an agreement not to prosecute him in exchange for information he provided in a debriefing. Wright has not shown that the district court clearly erred in finding there was no nonprosecution agreement and in denying his motion. Wright presented no evidence that he and the government entered into a nonprosecution agreement or that the government issued a formal grant of immunity from prosecution. Wright\u2019s argument is based solely on his subjective interpretation of the agents\u2019 statements 'during his debriefing. <em>See United States v. Conaway, </em>11 F.3d 40, 42 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Weiss, </em>599 F.2d 730, 735-36 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-23\">Wright contends that the government\u2019s decision to prosecute him and not his business partner, Evan Lowenstein, constitutes selective prosecution. Wright has presented no evidence to rebut the presumption of regularity supporting the government\u2019s decision to prosecute him under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Wright has not shown that Lowenstein was a similarly situated person of a different race who could have been prosecuted but was not. <em>See United States v. Arm</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>strong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 465-66, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996); <em>United States v. Webster, </em>162 F.3d 308, 333-34 (5th Cir.1998). Wright also does not assert that he was prosecuted based on his race or religion or to prevent his exercise of a particular constitutional right. <em>See Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 465-66, 116 S.Ct. 1480; <em>Webster, </em>162 F.3d at 333-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The government presented evidence showing that the reason it did not prosecute Lowenstein under \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2) is that Lowenstein\u2019s conviction had been set aside and because the firearms were found in a locked safe in Lowenstein\u2019s garage to which he could not provide a key or a combination. Therefore, Wright has not shown discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent to establish that he was selectively prosecuted. <em>See Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 465-66, 116 S.Ct. 1480; <em>Webster, </em>162 F.3d at 333-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b760-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
