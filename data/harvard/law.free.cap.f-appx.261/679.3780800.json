Garcia-Miranda argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider or give reasons for rejecting his diminished capacity argument, did not inquire into his current mental condition, and did not properly balance the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">The district court imposed a 60-month sentence within the advisory guidelines range which is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006). After considering Garcia-Miranda\u2019s written request for a downward departure, the information in the presentence report, and the parties\u2019 arguments concerning a downward departure at the sentencing hearing, the district court implicitly determined that a downward departure based on Gareia-Miranda\u2019s diminished capacity was not warranted and that a 60-month sentence was appropriate. Although the district court did not provide any written or oral reasons for denying Gareia-Miranda\u2019s motion for a downward departure or for the sentence imposed, little explanation is required when a district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Garcia-Miranda has not shown that the district court failed to consider his diminished capacity argument or any other factor that should have received significant weight, gave significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or made a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 (5th Cir.2006). Therefore, Garcia-Miranda has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>not shown that his 60-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Garda-Miranda argues that the district court did not clearly and unequivocally give him the opportunity to alloeute concerning his mental condition at the sentencing hearing. Garda-Miranda concedes that he did not raise this issue in the district court. Therefore, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Reyna, 358 </em>F.3d 344, 350-53 (5th Cir.2004) (en banc). Even if there was error that was plain and that affected Garcia-Miranda\u2019s substantial rights, we decline to hold that the error \u201cseriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See United States v. Magwood, </em>445 F.3d 826, 829-30 (5th Cir.2006). Although Garda-Miranda may have been able to provide current information concerning his disability or how it affected his offense, he has not identified any specific additional information that he would have provided, and thus, he has not demonstrated that his statement would have provided an \u201cobjective basis that would have moved the trial court to grant a lower sentence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Garda-Miranda also maintains that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision and not a separate criminal offense. <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
