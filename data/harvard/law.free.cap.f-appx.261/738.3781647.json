Holloway appeals his sentence. He contends that his sentence is improper because this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rulings have effectively reinstated the mandatory sentencing guideline regime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>condemned in <em>Booker. </em>This argument is foreclosed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">We note that there is an apparent clerical error in the judgment. Although textual portions of the judgment show that Holloway was convicted of two charges, the portion of the judgment listing the counts of conviction lists one count only. A review of the rearraignment and sentencing transcripts, as well as the textual portions of the judgment, shows that the omission of Count 2 from that portion of the judgment listing the counts of conviction is a clerical error. Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED TO THE DISTRICT COURT for correction of the clerical error in the judgment pursuant to Fed. R.CrimJP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-25\">. <em>United States v.
