Cornett\u2019s claim for supplemental security income benefits. The district court affirmed. On appeal, Cornett alleges various infirmities in the denial, including that the decision was the result of such severe ineffectiveness on the part of his counsel as to deprive Cornett of his constitutional rights. We find no merit to these appellate arguments. Because the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and comports with relevant legal standards, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-21\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b670-22\">Cornett applied for supplemental security income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits, claiming that physical and mental impairments rendered him disabled. Specifically, Cornett alleged that he suffered from back problems, arm injuries, obesity, hepatitis C, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. His application was denied as was his petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-23\">Cornett then requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). At the hearing, the ALJ heard testimony from Cornett (who at that time was represented by counsel, though he no longer has counsel on this appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) and a vocational expert. The ALJ received into the record the reports and diagnoses resulting from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>two physical examinations and one mental examination, the report and diagnosis of Cornett\u2019s \u201ctreating\u201d physician, and an evaluation by a non-examining psychologist. The ALJ determined that Cornett suffered from some \u201csevere\u201d impairments as defined by the relevant regulations, but those impairments did not render him incapable of performing jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. The ALJ offered the jobs of usher, ticket taker, and cashier as examples of work that Cornett was capable of performing.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The ALJ found that Cornett was not disabled and denied his claim for benefits. The Appeals Council denied his request for review and the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Commissioner. Cor-nett filed suit in the district court, seeking review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The magistrate judge recommended that the denial of benefits be affirmed. The district court adopted the report and entered an order dismissing Cornett\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On his appeal here, Cornett identifies three issues. Two are phrased in terms of violations of Cornett\u2019s due process rights and a third contests the adequacy of his counsel. Because Cornett is representing himself, we apply less stringent standards in interpreting his arguments than we would in the case of a counseled party. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). Applying that relaxed standard, we interpret Cornett\u2019s brief as attacking the district court\u2019s decision on these grounds: (A) the ALJ did not fully develop the record before ruling on Cor-nett\u2019s claim; (B) the ALJ gave insufficient weight to Cornett\u2019s subjective complaints of pain; (C) the ALJ failed to consider legal impediments to Cornett\u2019s ability to perform the jobs proposed by the vocational expert; and (D) Cornett\u2019s constitutional rights were violated by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s denial of SSI benefits, an appellate court determines if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the decision, and whether that decision fits within the relevant legal standards. <em>Brock v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 726, 727-28 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d has been defined as being relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion; quantitatively, it has been described as being more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance. <em>Ripley v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 552, 555 (5th Cir.1995). We neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our discretion for that of the Commissioner. <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999). Within the boundaries that these review standards establish, the judgment as to whether benefits should be awarded is for the Commissioner to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">\n<em>A. The ALJ\u2019s Duty to Develop the Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Cornett first argues that the ALJ did not fully develop the record and consider all of the relevant evidence before determining that he was not eligible for SSI benefits. An ALJ has a duty to develop the facts fully and fairly relating to an applicant\u2019s claim for disability benefits. <em>Ripley, </em>67 F.3d at 557. Reversal is appropriate only if the applicant shows that he was prejudiced. <em>Id. </em>Prejudice can be established by showing that, had the ALJ adequately performed his duty, he \u201ccould and would have adduced evidence that might have altered the result.\u201d <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>731 F.2d 1216, 1220 (5th Cir.1984). Discussed below is a specific ALJ duty, which is detailed by regulation, to seek additional medical evidence in certain circumstances. Though these evidentiary duties have been imposed on the ALJ, the claimant continues to bear the burden of proving that he suffers from a disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>once an adequate evidentiary record exists. <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Cornett suggests that the ALJ at the hearing failed to probe adequately into the factual issue of the debilitating effects of his physical impairments. However, Cor-nett was questioned about his impairments by both his counsel and the ALJ at the hearing. Cornett testified regarding his arm and back injuries, hepatitis C, and post-traumatic stress disorder. At the close of questioning, he was invited to tell the ALJ about any physical or mental conditions that had not been covered. He had the opportunity to give any testimony that he desired regarding his obesity and depression. Notwithstanding Cornett\u2019s silence at the hearing, the ALJ\u2019s decision explicitly considered the record evidence omthese latter two conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Cornett also suggests that the ALJ failed to consider the side effects of the medications that he took to control pain. However, the ALJ\u2019s decision notes that Cornett did not mention any side effects. Cornett concedes that he did not actually testify that he suffered from side effects, but argues that the ALJ should have discerned from the nature of his testimony that he was suffering from such effects. While Cornett\u2019s testimony was somewhat unfocused, it was not incoherent or unintelligible. The transcript demonstrates that Cornett was lucid and capable of discussing his various impairments at the time of his hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Cornett next argues that the ALJ should have given controlling weight to the determination of Dr. A.C. Walkes, who rendered an opinion that Cornett was temporarily unable to work for a period of one year. The ALJ accorded Dr. Walkes\u2019s opinion \u201cno weight\u201d because it was rendered in conjunction with Cornett\u2019s application for public benefits with \u201cunknown standards for establishing disability.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.904 (\u201c[A] determination made by another agency that you are disabled or blind is not binding on [the Commissioner].\u201d). In addition, there was little evidence that Dr. Walkes provided any form of treatment for Cornett. The ALJ set forth valid reasons for rejecting Dr. Walkes\u2019s opinion and his decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201c[W]hen good cause is shown, less weight, little weight, or even no weight may be given to the physician\u2019s testimony.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">Finally, Cornett argues that the ALJ erred by failing to recontact Dr. Walkes in order to obtain a definitive statement regarding the extent of Cor-nett\u2019s work-related limitations. The Commissioner is required to recontact a medical source \u201c[w]hen the evidence ... from [the] treating physician or psychologist or other medical source is inadequate for [the Commissioner] to determine whether [the claimant is] disabled.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(e). In one precedent, an ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits was reversed when the record did not clearly establish the effect of the claimant\u2019s condition on his ability to work and the ALJ had not made additional contact with the treating physician. <em>See Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 458 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Ripley, </em>67 F.3d at 557 (\u201cThe only evidence regarding Ripley\u2019s ability to work came from Ripley\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>own testimony.\u201d). However, the lack of a statement from Dr. Walkes as to what Cornett could still do in spite of his impairments does not automatically render his report incomplete. As already noted, the ALJ\u2019s need to contact a medical source arises only when the available evidence is inadequate to determine if there is a disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.912(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">In this case, the ALJ considered over 500 pages of medical evidence before rendering his decision. At least two physicians reported that Cornett\u2019s impairments do not preclude him from performing certain types of work; a vocational expert testified to the same effect. It is difficult to characterize such an extensive record as \u201cinadequate.\u201d Further, there is no basis for us to conclude that recontacting Dr. Walkes would have overcome the substantial medical evidence in the record and altered the ALJ\u2019s decision. Because we cannot say that Cornett was prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s decision not to recontact Dr. Walkes, there is no basis for reversal. <em>Ripley, </em>67 F.3d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The ALJ fulfilled his duty to develop the record fully before ruling on Cornett\u2019s claim for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">\n<em>B. Cornett\u2019s Subjective Complaints of Pain</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Cornett also contends that the ALJ gave insufficient weight to his subjective complaints of pain. The ALJ found that Cor-nett\u2019s allegations regarding his physical limitations were \u201cnot totally credible.\u201d Cornett\u2019s challenge to the ALJ\u2019s finding on credibility focuses on what he argues was the ALJ\u2019s improper use of an admission he made below. The admission was that Cor-nett was convicted of possession of child pornography under federal law in June 1992 and served a five year prison term for the crime. The ALJ\u2019s decision referred to Cornett\u2019s statement that the crime was \u201cvictimless,\u201d an assertion that the ALJ described as \u201ca gross misstatement\u201d and a demonstration that Cornett had \u201ca disregard for truth and a debased conscience.\u201d Consequently, the ALJ gave \u201cless weight\u201d to his testimony. Cornett refers to this conclusion as his sole reason for arguing that the ALJ revealed an improper bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">The ALJ\u2019s reference to the child pornography matter is preceded by five pages of detailed record analysis, comparing Cornett\u2019s subjective complaints with the diagnoses of medical professionals. The ALJ\u2019s decision sets forth several reasons for attaching diminished weight to Cornett\u2019s assertions, including: (1) Cornett took fewer medications than a person with his alleged level of pain would be expected to take, (2) Cornett did not seek medical treatment at the level one would expect for a person with his alleged symptoms, and (3) inconsistencies between Cornett\u2019s subjective complaints and the results of clinical evaluations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Considering the decision in its entirety, it is clear that the ALJ considered both the objective medical evidence and Cornett\u2019s subjective complaints of pain before making an eligibility deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>initiation. The decision to credit the medical evidence to a greater extent than Cor-nett\u2019s subjective complaints was valid. <em>See Loya v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 211, 214 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Further, the ALJ did not totally reject Cornett\u2019s subjective complaints; he merely ascribed \u201cless weight\u201d to them. An ALJ\u2019s failure to consider a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain or failure to indicate the basis for his credibility determinations is reversible error. <em>See Scharlow v. Schweiker, </em>655 F.2d 645, 648-49 (5th Cir.1981). Here, the ALJ referred to the complaints and gave them some weight. Cornett\u2019s argument that his subjective complaints were not given <em>enough </em>weight is unavailing. <em>See Carrier v. Sullivan, </em>944 F.2d 243, 247 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and we will not reweigh that evidence on appeal. <em>See Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1024 (5th Cir.1990) (\u201c[A] factfinder\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of subjective complaints is entitled to judicial deference if supported by substantial record evidence.\u201d). Further, there is no basis in the record for Cornett\u2019s claim that the ALJ exhibited a \u201cbias\u201d against him. The ALJ\u2019s remarks do not indicate that he was predisposed to rule against Cornett because of his conviction for possession of child pornography, nor do they reveal an excessive dislike of Cornett. Instead, they disclose a reasoned judgment that Cornett\u2019s claims should be received with some skepticism. <em>See Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 500 (\u201c \u2018[Jjudicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge\u2019 unless \u2018they reveal such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.\u2019 \u201d) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">\n<em>C. Legal Impediments Preclude Cornett from Working</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Cornett argues that the ALJ erred in finding that he was capable of performing jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. \u201cIf the Secretary fulfills his burden of pointing out potential alternative employment, the burden then shifts back to the claimant to prove that he is unable to perform the alternate work.\u201d <em>Selders v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 614, 618 (5th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). This finding was vigorously disputed in Cornett\u2019s initial appeal to the magistrate judge. There, Cornett attacked the vocational testimony offered in support of this finding as unreliable and inadequately accounting for his mental limitations. Those arguments were rejected by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Cornett did not pursue those arguments on appeal to the district court or to this Court. Instead, he now argues that the ALJ failed to consider legal impediments to his ability to perform the jobs of usher, ticket taker, or cashier. He offers two alleged legal impediments to his performance of these jobs, one based on his use of certain prescription medications, the other on his conviction: (1) state and federal law prohibit a person from being under the influence of drugs at the workplace and while driving a vehicle; and (2) Texas state law prohibits sex offenders from working \u201canywhere children may go or congregate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">Cornett did not present his legal impediments arguments to the magistrate judge and, therefore, is not entitled to raise them on appeal. <em>See Cupit v. Whitley, </em>28 F.3d 532, 535 n. 5 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, in making this new argument on appeal, Cornett provided no citation to a particular statute, regulation, ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>or any other authority. Though we review the briefs of pro se appellants with some relaxation of the usual demands on counseled parties, we do not abandon the insistence that some minimal legal basis for arguments must be offered. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Even a <em>pro se </em>appellant must set forth \u201cthe reasons he deserves relief \u2018with citation to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on.\u2019 \u201d <em>Weaver v. Puckett, </em>896 F.2d 126, 128 (5th Cir.1990) (quoting Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Finally, Cornett\u2019s new argument about legal impediments reflects a misunderstanding of the meaning of \u201cdisability.\u201d Whether Cornett is capable of performing work which exists in the national economy is determined by reference to vocational factors (such as age, education, and work experience) and his residual functional capacity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.920(a), (g); 416.960(c). A regulation informs a claimant of what does not constitute sufficient proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">(c) Inability to obtain work. We will determine that you are not disabled if your residual functional capacity and vocational abilities make it possible for you to do work which exists in the national economy, but you remain unemployed because of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">(1) Your inability to get work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">(3) The hiring practices of employers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">(7) You would not actually be hired to do work you could otherwise do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.966(c). We agree that the proper interpretation of these exclusions is that a \u201cclaimant will also be considered not disabled if the claimant is able to do work which exists in the national economy but remains unemployed because of a criminal record.\u201d 3 Social Security Law and Practice \u00a7 43:138 (Michael Flaherty and Wendy S. Sigillo eds., West 2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">\n<em>D. Cornett\u2019s Constitutional claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">Cornett asserts that the Commissioner violated his right to due process and equal protection under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">First, Cornett claims that he was denied a fair hearing. However, he took full advantage of the administrative claims process, was provided with a hearing before an ALJ, and exercised his right to appeal to the district court and this Court. He has not identified any aspect of these proceedings that was constitutionally deficient. Our review of the record reveals that Cornett has been afforded a full and fair opportunity to present his case. His conclusory allegations to the contrary are not availing. <em>See Kinash v. Callahan, </em>129 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">Cornett next claims he was the victim of a \u201cclass based animus\u201d exhibited by the ALJ. But he has not offered any evidence that he was treated differently than other Social Security claimants. <em>Cf. Wheeler v. Miller, </em>168 F.3d 241, 252 (5th Cir.1999) (\u201cGenerally, to establish an equal protection claim the plaintiff must prove that similarly situated individuals were treated differently.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-16\">Finally, Cornett argues that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel at his hearing before the ALJ. However, this claim does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. The Supreme Court has never recognized a constitutional right to counsel in Social Security proceedings. <em>Brandyburg v. Sullivan, </em>959 F.2d 555, 562 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-17\">Therefore, we reject Cornett\u2019s claim that his due process and equal protection rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>were violated. We also reject his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In conclusion, the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny Cornett\u2019s claim for SSI benefits is supported by substantial evidence and comports with relevant legal standards. Accordingly, the order of the district court dismissing Cornett\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b670-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b670-16\">. Cornett was represented by counsel in proceedings before the ALJ and his appeal to the magistrate judge. However, his counsel withdrew after receipt of the magistrate judge's report and recommendation. Cornett filed his objections to the district court <em>pro se </em>and continues to represent himself on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">. Cornett describes Dr. Walkes as his \u201ctreating\" physician. The ALJ found no evidence in the record that Dr. Walkes actually treated Cornett. However, even if we assume that Dr. Walkes was Cornett\u2019s treating physician, the ALJ was still entitled to give diminished weight to his opinion so long as he offered valid reasons for doing so. <em>See Greenspan, </em>38 F.3d at 237 (affirming ALJ\u2019s decision to accord \u201cno weight\u201d to opinions of applicant\u2019s treating physicians).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">. Cornett claims that he cannot afford additional medications or treatment and, therefore, the ALJ\u2019s consideration of these factors was improper. There is authority that even when medical treatment would remedy a condition, a person unable to afford that treatment may still be considered disabled. <em>Lovelace v. Bowen, </em>813 F.2d 55, 59-60 (5th Cir.1987). But <em>Lovelace </em>is inapplicable because the record does not support that Cornett\u2019s alleged disabilities would be alleviated by regular medical treatment. The AO properly gave weight in the credibility determination to Cornett's minimal efforts to obtain treatment. <em>See Villa v. Sullivan, </em>895 F.2d 1019, 1024 (5th Cir.1990) (ALJ was not precluded from relying on lack of treatment as an indication that subjective complaints of pain were not credible where there was no evidence that medical treatment would have alleviated alleged disability).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
