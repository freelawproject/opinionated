She appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and lost. She now seeks review of the BIA\u2019s order in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Dhulasaniya, a native and citizen of India, entered the United States without being legally admitted or paroled. She was therefore declared subject to removal pursuant to \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)\u00ae of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Upon appearing before an immigration judge as ordered, Dhulasaniya, alleging she suffered persecution in India on account of being a Muslim, applied for asylum under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), withholding of removal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b), and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), applied domestically through 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">As evidence of her entitlement to asylum, Dhulasaniya alleged before the IJ various incidents of past persecution, two of which are of particular importance to this appeal. First, Dhulasaniya claimed that on March 4, 2002, a group of approximately 100 Hindus attacked her largely Muslim colony, and while there, beat and tortured her. [R. at 206]. Second, Dhulasaniya claimed that, a few weeks after the March 4th incident, \u201cHindu parties\u201d and police allegedly abducted Dhulasaniya, confined her for six days, and admonished her to convert to Hinduism. [R. at 207]. Dhulasaniya predicted that she would continue to suffer such abuse should she return to India. [R. at 206].</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">Concluding that Dhulasaniya\u2019s accounts of the aforementioned incidents contained significant inconsistencies, the IJ determined that her testimony was unreliable, denied Dhulasaniya relief on all grounds asserted, and ordered her removal. Focusing on the same inconsistencies, the BIA affirmed, concluding that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. Dhulashaniya filed a timely petition for review in this Court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">In reviewing an order of the BIA, this Court -will consider the underlying decision of the IJ only if it \u201cha[d] some impact on the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Because the BIA\u2019s decision rested on its conclusion that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding was not clearly erroneous, we must consider that underlying finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-18\">As a preliminary matter, the government argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this matter due to Dhulasaniya\u2019s failure to exhaust her administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-19\">Section 106(c) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, codified as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), provides that courts may not review final orders of removal unless the alien \u201chas exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right....\u201d \u201cBecause it is statutorily mandated, an alien\u2019s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies serves as a juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>(fictional bar to our consideration\u201d of his petition. <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Townsend v. INS, </em>799 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Dhulasaniya\u2019s failure to exhaust, according to the government, arises from her failure to challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination before the BIA. As the argument goes, because the IJ\u2019s \u201cadverse credibility determination was the fulcrum of the denial of relief and protection,\u201d Dhulasaniya\u2019s failure to attack that \u201cfulcrum\u201d on administrative appeal deprives this Court of jurisdiction with respect to that issue. [Brief at 14]. Although this reasoning is supported by case law, <em>see, e.g., Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004), the Court disagrees with its factual premise: the BIA interpreted Dhulasaniya\u2019s argument to be that \u201cthe Immigration Judge erred in his adverse credibility finding.\u201d [R. at 6], The BIA then disagreed, concluding that the IJ\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. We read this statement as confirmation that Dhulasaniya in fact challenged the IJ\u2019s credibility determination on administrative appeal, and that the BIA squarely disposed of that challenge, rendering it eligible for consideration by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The government further argues that Dhulasaniya has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s credibility determination due to her failure to attack that determination in her appellate brief. To be sure, few are the number of express references in Dhulasaniya\u2019s brief to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding. The entire thrust of Dhulasaniya\u2019s brief, however, is her contention that she, with her testimony, established the requisites for relief. It follows that Dhulasaniya is, before this Court, attacking the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusions to the contrary, conclusions based on adverse credibility findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Having decided that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain Dhulasaniya\u2019s petition, and that the viability of the lower tribunals\u2019 credibility findings is an issue properly before us, we proceed to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The provisions under which Dhulasaniya has sought relief all have in common a requirement that an applicant demonstrate either past persecution, or a well-grounded fear of future persecution. <em>See generally </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13,1208.16. In attempting to prove her eligibility under these provisions, Dhulasaniya relied entirely on her accounts of past persecution. Thus, her success depended on the degree to which the IJ found those accounts credible. Indeed, the IJ, as the factfinder, has the \u201cduty to make determinations based on the credibility of ... witnesses,\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994), and this court gives great deference to those determinations, <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Thus, when an IJ\u2019s credibility determination is based on \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence,\u201d it will be upheld. <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">On two separate occasions, Dhulasaniya provided an account of each of the two aforementioned incidents of persecution: once in her written' application for relief, and again orally before the IJ. In denying Dhulasaniya relief, the IJ and BIA focused on several major inconsistencies between her written and oral accounts. For example, with regard to the March 4, 2002 incident, Dhulasaniya, in her asylum application, stated that her home was set aflame, and that she was severely beaten and tortured by a group of approximately 100 Hindus. [R. at 206]. Her application did not mention that local police had either facilitated or encouraged the attack. By contrast, during oral examination, Dhulasaniya, when asked whether the mob burned her home, answered \u201c[n]ot ours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>personally, [but rather] the houses around us.... We were in the midst of Hindu houses so we only got looted.\u201d [R. at 131]. Interestingly, later in her testimony, when pressed on the contradiction, Dhulasaniya changed her story yet again, testifying that after her home was looted, it was set aflame. [R. at 161]. Dhulasaniya also alleged orally that the mob physically attacked her father and attempted to rape her mother, two significant details absent in her written application. [R. at 161-62]. Also missing from Dhulasaniya\u2019s application was her allegation, stated orally, that local police were present during the attack and encouraged the beatings. [R. at 133].</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">With regard to the second major incident, Dhulasaniya asserted in her application that she was abducted by Hindus for six days but made no mention of any physical violence. [R. at 207]. By contrast, Dhulasaniya testified orally that her abductors attempted to rape her. [R. at 134].</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Dhulasaniya presented no corroborating evidence that might lend credence to her accounts of persecution. Given the great deference this Court owes to administrative credibility determinations, <em>see Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 905, we cannot say that the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision rested on an \u201cunreasonable interpretation of the record,\u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Dhulasaniya does invoke one relevant provision which exempts an applicant from having to prove a reasonable possibility of future persecution by way of credible accounts of past persecution; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2) (iii) (A) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">[i]n evaluating whether the applicant has sustained the burden of proving that he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution, the asylum officer or immigration judge shall not require the applicant to provide evidence that there is a reasonable possibility he or she would be singled out individually for persecution if ... [t]he applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country ... of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of ... religion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">As the text of the provision makes clear, Dhulasaniya\u2019s success in invoking it does not depend on her ability to establish past persecution. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is irrelevant for purposes of the above paragraph. Dhulasaniya, however, overlooks 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)(i), which provides that \u201c[i]n cases in which the applicant has not established past persecution, the applicant shall bear the burden of establishing that it would not be reasonable for him or her to relocate, unless the persecution is by a government or is government-sponsored.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">In her application, Dhulasaniya claimed persecution by the Hindu majority in a particular geographic region, rather than by the Indian national government. The IJ concluded that Dhulasaniya failed to establish \u201cthat her entire country is no longer safe, [and] that her problems are not just localized____\u201d [R. at 68]. We cannot say that such a finding can follow only from an unreasonable reading of the record. Dhulasaniya testified that she never sought sanctuary in another region of India. [R. at 144]. Indeed, Dhulasaniya briefly resided in Mata, another location within her home region; when asked whether she experienced problems there, she responded \u201c[n]o, not at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the IJ\u2019s finding with respect to the feasibility of relocation withstands substantial evidence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">Finding no legal or factual error in the BIA\u2019s order, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-11\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the Court has determined that this order should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
