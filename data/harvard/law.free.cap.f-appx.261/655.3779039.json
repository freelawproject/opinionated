To the extent that Omozee seeks reversal of the BIA\u2019s decision of July 2006 denying his motion to reopen the removal proceedings, we dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction. The denial of a motion to reopen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>removal proceedings is construed as a final order of removal for purposes of an appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Giova v. Rosenberg, </em>379 U.S. 18, 85 S.Ct. 156, 13 L.Ed.2d 90 (1964). A petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of a final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). A deportation or removal order is final and reviewable when issued. <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). The period for filing a petition for review is mandatory and jurisdictional and not subject to tolling by a motion for reconsideration. <em>Id. </em>Omozee did not seek any type of relief in this court until September 29, 2006, which was more than 30 days after the denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">We do, however, have authority to review the denial of Omozee\u2019s motion for reconsideration under a \u201chighly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 302-03 (5th Cir.2005). Under this standard, even an erroneous decision can stand if \u201cit is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304. The BIA\u2019s decision on Omozee\u2019s reconsideration motion easily meets this standard. \u00c1 motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of fact or law in the prior decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Omozee\u2019s motion failed to specify any errors of fact or law in the decision denying reopening. Omozee merely recycled the legal arguments he had presented earlier. Additionally, we cannot fault the BIA\u2019s other reason for denying reconsideration as a matter of its discretion based on Omozee\u2019s lack of forthrightness during his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">We also reject Omozee\u2019s contention that the BIA violated his due process rights by deciding his case without oral argument. In his notice of appeal to the BIA, Omozee checked the \u201cno\u201d box when asked if he desired oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b679-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
