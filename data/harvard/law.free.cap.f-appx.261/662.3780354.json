McMorris asserted causes of action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and Louisiana law. On February 9, 2007, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>district court granted Appellees\u2019 motions for summary judgment. McMorris now appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to her Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">First, McMorris asserts a Title VII sexual harassment claim against Appellees. To sustain this claim, Appellant must prove, in part, that \u201cthe employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take remedial action.\u201d <em>Mota v. Univ. of Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr., </em>261 F.3d 512, 523 (5th Cir.2001). The alleged sexual harassment began in May 2002 and continued through November 2002. On November 7, 2002, McMorris reported the alleged sexual harassment to her supervisors. On the same day, the LSP Investigative Unit immediately initiated an official investigation, culminating in the voluntary resignation of Chaplain Mitchell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> LSP\u2019s response clearly constitutes proper and prompt remedial action, and McMorris\u2019s sexual harassment claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Second, McMorris asserts a Title VII retaliation claim. To prove this claim, McMorris must show that her \u201cemployer\u2019s actions [were] harmful to the point that they could well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2409, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006). Due to the distress caused by the events surrounding the alleged sexual harassment, on December 9, 2002, McMorris submitted and LSP granted an extended leave request with an expected return date of March 3, 2003. On March 3, 2003, LSP granted another request by McMorris to extend her leave until April 1, 2003. According to McMorris, one of her supervisors called her house during this time period and told her that she had to report back to work immediately or she would be fired. As a result of this threat, on March 29, 2003, McMorris sent LSP a letter of resignation, to be effective April 13, 2003. Given that McMorris could have returned to work three days later on April 1 instead of resigning, and given that LSP promptly responded to McMorris\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment, twice granted her requests for leave, and had already accepted Chaplain Mitchell\u2019s resignation and barred him from the premises, a rational jury could not find that the supervisor\u2019s alleged threat was so harmful that it \u201ccould well dissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b686-26\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">. The \u201ceffective\u201d date of Mitchell's resignation was extended until at least February 7, 2003. However, it is undisputed that on November 7, 2002, after Mitchell resigned, he was escorted from the premises, barred from re-entering, and had no contact with McMorris thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
