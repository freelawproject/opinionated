Villarreal argues that the district court erred by denying him a downward adjustment under the safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. Our review is for clear error. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>65 F.3d 430, 433 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-25\">Villarreal\u2019s assertion that he was denied the reduction based solely on the Government\u2019s assertion that it did not believe him when he claimed to have limited knowledge of the transaction is without merit. The district court\u2019s determination that Villarreal had not truthfully provided the' Government with all relevant information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>concerning the offense was based on the testimony of Special Agent Jerry Cedillo, who in turn, had investigated the case and interviewed both Villarreal and Mario Saldua. Villarreal\u2019s contention that Saldua\u2019s testimony was unreliable also is without merit. Saldua was not granted immunity. Further, the court\u2019s decision to credit Agent Cedillo\u2019s testimony was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Gillyard, </em>261 F.3d 506, 509 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Villarreal also argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by denying him the safety-valve adjustment without setting forth its reasons for doing so. Villarreal\u2019s argument fails as a matter of fact because the district court did set forth its reasons for denying the adjustment. Further, in <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, the Supreme Court held that only a fact that increases a penalty above the statutory maximum must be afforded Sixth Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
