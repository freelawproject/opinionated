He argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of an upward departure and the extent of the departure is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-24\">Because the district court departed upwardly pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3 and 5K2.0, Stanley received a guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). We review the decision to depart upwardly and the extent of the departure for abuse of discretion, ultimately determining whether the sentence is reasonable under 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u00a7 3558(a). <em>United States v. Rajwani, </em>476 F.3d 243, 248-50 (5th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>479 F.3d 904 (5th Cir.2007). An upward departure is not an abuse of discretion when the departure 1) advances the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2); 2) is authorized by \u00a7 3553(b); and 3) is justified by the facts of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 249-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in upwardly departing from the advisory guidelines range. Its reasons for departing advanced the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offenses, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public from future crimes by Stanley. The district court\u2019s decision also was based on circumstances that take Stanley\u2019s convictions \u201coutside the heartland\u201d of cases under the applicable guideline provisions and was justified by the facts of the case. Stanley\u2019s offense conduct affected multiple persons other than the identified victims, and his conduct relative to those persons was not adequately accounted for in the advisory guidelines range. Stanley recklessly engaged in high-speed flights from police through school and residential areas, including passing school busses and driving through a school playground. Stanley has a history of similar criminal conduct and has been undeterred from engaging in criminal conduct by probation and imprisonment. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A consecutive sentence of 84 months of imprisonment was statutorily required for Stanley\u2019s conviction for brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. The advisory guidelines range for Stanley\u2019s other convictions was 262 to 327 months of imprisonment. The degree of the departure and the ultimate sentence are not unreasonable in light of the seriousness of Stanley\u2019s conduct, his past criminal conduct, and the overwhelming indication that he was inclined to return to a similar course of behavior. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>38 F.3d 803, 810 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b719-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
