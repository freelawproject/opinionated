Duran-Hernandez appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing that the district court erred in determining that his prior Virginia involuntary manslaughter conviction constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2005), thereby warranting application of a sixteen-level enhancement to his Guidelines range. Although the Government concedes that the district court erred and agrees that Duran-Hernandez should be resentenced, we are \u201cnot at liberty to vacate and remand for resentencing on the Government\u2019s concession of error alone.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 414 n. 6 (4th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Because we find that the district court did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>\u201cIn assessing a challenge to a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review the [district] court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) of the Guidelines directs a sixteen-level enhancement if the defendant was previously deported from the United States following \u201ca conviction for' a felony that is ... a crime of violence.\u201d Prior to November 1, 2003, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\">(I) ... an offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">(II) includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses (including sexual abuse of a minor), robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(ii) (2002). This definition was amended in 2003, however, and is now defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">[M]urder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible,sex offenses, statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or any offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person,of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Although Duran-Hernandez argues that involuntary manslaughter is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it does not have \u201cas an element the use ... of physical force against the person of another,\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2 contains no such requirement. As explicitly stated by the Sentencing Commission, the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was amended to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">[C]larif[y] the meaning of the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by providing that the term \u201cmeans any of the following:----\u201d The previous definition often led to confusion over whether the specified offenses listed in that definition, particularly sexual abuse of a minor and residential burglary, also had to include as an element of the offense \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d The amended definition makes clear that the enumerated offenses are always classified as \u201ccrimes of violence,\u201d regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">USSG App. C, Vol. II, amend. 658, at 401-02 (Nov. 1, 2003). Because all that is necessary for an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2 to apply is that a prior conviction for manslaughter exist, <em>see United States v. Payton, </em>28 F.3d 17, 19 (4th Cir.1994) (holding that the Guidelines commentary \u201cthat is interpretative or explanatory controls, so long as it is not clearly inconsistent with the Guidelines or unconstitutional\u201d), it is irrelevant whether the conviction was for voluntary or involuntary manslaughter. <em>See id. </em>(finding that although the note construing \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 does not differentiate between involuntary and voluntary manslaughter, it includes both).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Atf\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
