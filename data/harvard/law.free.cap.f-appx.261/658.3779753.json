Harris has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-20\">Harris alleged that the defendants were liable for his physical injuries because he slipped and fell on the wet prison kitchen floor and because they failed to provide him with proper medical treatment for those injuries. Harris fails to allege a viable deliberate indifference claim on these bases. <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). Although Harris also alleges that he was attacked in the infirmary by some prison personnel, that claim fails because it is not supported by a physical injury that is more than de minimis. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997). Harris\u2019s claim regarding the prison administrative process fails because he does not have a liberty interest in having his prison administrative complaint resolved in a certain manner. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373-74 (5th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s certification that Harris\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Harris\u2019s motion for IFP is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-25\">Harris is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Harris that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-26\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
