Brooks appeals his sentence. He argues that the district court clearly erred by determining that his offenses were committed for profit and by sentencing him in accordance with this determination. Our review of the record both refutes Brooks\u2019s assertions concerning the propriety of the district \u25a0 court\u2019s findings and shows that he was ineligible for the requested adjustment under the plain language of the pertinent Guideline. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(l); <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.Sd 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005). Brooks has failed to show error in connection with his sentence. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
