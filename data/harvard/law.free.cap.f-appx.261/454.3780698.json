We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Hoai v. Hien, </em>No. 8:05-cv-03420-AW (D.Md. Mar. 28, 2007). Hoai also asserts that the district court should have transferred his state law claims to the state court to avoid having the statute of limitations expire as to these claims. We find that transfer of such claims was not necessary. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d) (2000) (tolling limitation period for claim asserted under supplemental jurisdiction while case is pending in federal court and for a period of thirty days after dismissal under \u00a7 1367). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
