Because there was no evidence of malice or \u201cactual intent to cause injury\u201d by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>the pursuing law enforcement officer, Harris, as a fleeing suspect, is precluded from recovery under Georgia law. We affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In an interlocutory appeal from a denial of Scott\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity from liability for Harris\u2019s complaint of excessive force, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Supreme Court articulated the relevant facts in this case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">In March 2001, a Georgia county deputy clocked respondent\u2019s vehicle traveling at 73 miles per hour on a road with a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. The deputy activated his blue flashing lights indicating that respondent should pull over. Instead, respondent sped away, initiating a chase down what is in most portions a two-lane road, at speeds exceeding 85 miles per hour. The deputy radioed his dispatch to report that he was pursuing a fleeing vehicle, and broadcast its license plate number. Petitioner, Deputy Timothy Scott, heard the radio communication and joined the pursuit along with other officers. In the midst of the chase, respondent pulled into the parking lot of a shopping center and was nearly boxed in by the various police vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">Respondent evaded the trap by making a sharp turn, colliding with Scott\u2019s police car, exiting the parking lot, and speeding off once again down a two-lane highway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">Following respondent\u2019s shopping center maneuvering, which resulted in slight damage to Scott\u2019s police car, Scott took over as the lead pursuit vehicle. Six minutes and nearly 10 miles after the chase had begun, Scott decided to attempt to terminate the episode by employing a \u201cPrecision Intervention Technique (\u2018PIT\u2019) maneuver, which causes the fleeing vehicle to spin to a stop.\u201d ... Having radioed his supervisor for permission, Scott was told to \u201c \u2018[g]o ahead and take him out.\u2019 \u201d ... Instead, Scott applied his push bumper to the rear of respondent\u2019s vehicle. As a result, respondent lost control of his vehicle, which left the roadway, ran down an embankment, overturned, and crashed. Respondent was badly injured and was rendered a quadriplegic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\"><em>Scott v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1773-74, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007). The Supreme Court concluded that \u201cit was reasonable for Scott to take the action that he did,\u201d and he was entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Id. </em>at 1778-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Upon remand, we vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to the district court. The district court adopted our mandate and concluded that there were no remaining issues to be decided. In this final appeal, Harris seeks to revive his state law claims against Scott, Fenninger, and Yeager, which were disposed of by the district court in earlier summary judgment orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">We review the grant of summary judgment by a district court <em>de novo. Beshers v. Harrison, </em>495 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and \u201cthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">Harris argues that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment against his complaints of negligence and battery. Harris argues that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the law enforcement officers acted with \u201cactual malice or actual intent to cause injury.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-14\">Under Georgia law, an officer\u2019s pursuit of a fleeing suspect \u201cshall not be the proximate cause or a contributing proximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>cause of the damage, injury or death caused by the fleeing suspect unless the law enforcement officer acted with reckless disregard for proper law enforcement procedures,\u201d Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 40-6-6(d)(2), but when the injured party is the fleeing suspect, the rule is different. <em>City of Winder v. McDougald, </em>276 Ga. 866, 583 S.E.2d 879, 881 (2003). In <em>City of Winder, </em>the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded that \u201c[bjecause the legislature enacted subsection (d)(2) to limit liability when a fleeing suspect injures an innocent person ... the legislature did not intend simultaneously to expand liability to cover injuries to the fleeing suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 880. The court left open the possibility that \u201c[t]he fleeing suspect may be able to recover for her own injuries if an officer acts with an actual intent to cause injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 881. The court referenced its earlier opinion of <em>Kidd v. Coates, </em>271 Ga. 33, 518 S.E.2d 124 (1999), in which it cited with approval the definition of a Missouri appellate court of the phrase, \u201cactual intent to cause injury.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZU\">The phrase \u201cactual intent to cause injury\u201d has been defined in a tort context to mean \u201can actual intent to cause harm to the plaintiff, \u2018not merely an intent to do the act purportedly resulting in the claimed injury.\u2019 ... \u2018This definition of intent contains aspects of malice, perhaps a wicked or evil motive.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 125 (citing <em>Frame v. Boatmen\u2019s Bank, </em>782 S.W.2d 117, 121 (Mo.App.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Although it is unclear whether Georgia law ever allows a fleeing suspect to recover for his own injuries, the Supreme Court of Georgia has held that a fleeing suspect is not entitled to recover for his injuries when \u201cthere was no evidence that the officer acted with malice or an actual intent to cause injury.\u201d <em>See City of Winder, </em>583 S.E.2d at 881. That precedent governs this appeal. Harris cannot recover because he has not identified evidence of malice or an \u201cactual intent to cause injury\u201d by the pursuing law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The summary judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"At-\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
