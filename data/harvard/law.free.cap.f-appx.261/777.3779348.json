Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. RApp. P. 24(a)(3). The district court properly dismissed Richbourg\u2019s challenge to the disciplinary proceedings brought against him pursuant to <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-21\">However, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Riehbourg\u2019s claim of retaliation based on his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies was premature because it was not clear from the face of his complaint that Richbourg had not exhausted all remedies available to him. <em>See Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007);. <em>Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 328 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Holloway v. Gunnell, </em>685 F.2d 150, 154 (5th Cir.1982). Thus, the district court erred in certifying that this claim did not raise a nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-22\">Richbourg\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED with respect to his retaliation claim. The district court\u2019s judgment and certification decision is AFFIRMED with respect to the challenge to the disciplinary conviction; VACATED with respect to the retaliation claim, and the ease is REMANDED for further proceedings with respect to the retaliation claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b801-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
