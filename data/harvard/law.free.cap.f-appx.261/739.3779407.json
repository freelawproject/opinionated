Nunez argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress. She did not, however, preserve her right to appeal this adverse ruling by entering a conditional guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 238 (5th Cir.), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 336, 169 L.Ed.2d 236 (2007); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2); <em>cf. United States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.3d 193, 197-98 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-26\">Nunez asserts that the district court erred by denying her relief under the safety valve. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5), Nunez must establish that she \u201ctruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct.\u201d Nunez cannot establish that the district court clearly erred in determining that she failed to meet this requirement. <em>See United States v. Treft, </em>447 F.3d 421, 426-27 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 555, 166 L.Ed.2d 413 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-29\">Nunez also maintains that the district court erred in denying her a four-level reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 for her minimal role in the offense. Nunez <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>did receive a two-level reduction for a minor role. Nunez cannot establish that she is entitled to relief on this ground; even if the district court erred in denying the motion, the record establishes that the district court would have imposed the same sentence. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>126 F.3d 655, 661 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Tello, </em>9 F.3d 1119, 1131 (5th Cir.1993). Nunez\u2019s conviction and sentence are thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b763-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
