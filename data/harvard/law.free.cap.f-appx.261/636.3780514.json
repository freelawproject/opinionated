Based on our review of the record, we find we lack jurisdiction to review Mwaura\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen her deportation proceedings. <em>See Zhao Quan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>492 F.3d 153, 155 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 n. 1 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Harchenko v. INS, </em>379 F.3d 405, 410-11 (6th Cir.2004); <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999). To the extent Mwaura attempts to avoid the jurisdictional bar by claiming a constitutional violation or a question of law, we find the claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
