Springfield appeals his 188-month sentence for one count of distribution of 5 grams or more of cocain base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). His sole contention is that he should have received a downward departure from the advisory guideline range for his timely acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">The district court, contrary to the recommendation contained of the probation officer, gave Springfield a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) &amp; (b). The court did so even though it found Springfield to have been evasive. That reduction lowered the guidelines range from one of 262 to 327 months to one of 188 months to 235 months. After considering all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Springfield to the low end of the guidelines range, 188 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Springfield. His contention that the court should have granted the government\u2019s motion for a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure is not cognizable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d 1490, 1497 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
