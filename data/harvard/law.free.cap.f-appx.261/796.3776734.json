Felder, Texas prisoner # 1210034, challenges, <em>pro se, </em>the dismissal of his civil rights and .Federal Torts Claims Act claims as barred by the statute of limitations. Felder does not brief, however, the dismissal of his complaint as untimely. Contentions must be properly briefed in order to be preserved for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). In short, Felder has abandoned the dispositive issue on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Accordingly, Felder\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Felder is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b820-31\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
