She named several defendants, including: (1) the Volusia County School Board; (2) Dr. Margaret Smith, the superintendent of the School Board; (3) Tamara Wenzel, an attorney for the School Board; (4) Mark Corruthers, the assistant principal of Deltona Middle School; (5) Dr. Michael Gebel; (6) Dr. Bruce Hoffen; (7) United Self Insured Services (USIS); and (8) Suzanne Evans, a nurse with USIS. The complaint alleged, among other things, that those defendants violated her Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Before dismissing Lampkin-Aram\u2019s second amended complaint, the district court had dismissed two prior versions of the complaint for violating Rule 8. The first time, the defendants moved to dismiss her complaint, asserting that it was so full of \u201cincomprehensible allegations\u201d that it was impossible to formulate an answer. In dismissing Lampkin-Asam\u2019s initial complaint, the district court agreed with the defendants, and observed that the complaint was \u201cdisjointed, repetitive, disorganized and barely comprehensible.\u201d The district court also noted that because the complaint grouped several claims under each \u201ccount,\u201d it was not possible to \u201cdecipher which claims [were] brought against which parties under which counts.\u201d The district court dismissed that complaint without prejudice, giving Lampkin-Asam twenty days to file an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">She re-filed her complaint, adding additional \u201ccounts\u201d and \u201cclaims,\u201d but in the district court\u2019s estimation, she again failed to comply with Rule 8. The court characterized that first amended complaint as a \u201cshotgun pleading,\u201d and concluded that it was still \u201cdisjointed, repetitive, disorganized, and barely comprehensible.\u201d Accordingly, the district court dismissed it, giving her twenty days to exercise a \u201cfinal chance\u201d to re-plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Lampkin-Asam took advantage of the opportunity to re-plead her complaint again. Her second amended complaint contained six \u201ccounts,\u201d each comprised of various \u201cclaims.\u201d Almost every \u201ccount\u201d began with the phrase \u201cVolusia County School Board is liable,\u201d followed by a string of factual allegations. Five of the named defendants were not mentioned at all in any of the counts and claims. The complaint also included seventeen pages of numbered paragraphs, each containing scattered and sometimes inconsistent references to the counts and claims presented at the beginning of the complaint. In its order addressing her second amended complaint, the district court described it as a \u201clabyrinth of claims, counts, accusations and repetition.\u201d Because the court concluded that Lampkin-Asam had once again failed to comply with Rule 8, and because the court had warned her that her second amended complaint would be her last, it dismissed her second amended complaint with prejudice. Lampkin-Asam appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s order dismissing Lampkin-Asam\u2019s complaint. <em>See Valderrama v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir.2005). While \u201ca trial judge is to employ less stringent standards in assessing <em>pro se </em>pleadings ... than would be used to judge the final product of lawyers,\u201d <em>Hepperle v. Johnston, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>544 F.2d 201, 202 (5th Cir.1976),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this leniency does not permit the district court to act as counsel for a party or to rewrite deficient pleadings, <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (\u201c[W]e have never suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.\u201d). In fact, we have recently observed that district courts have a \u201csupervisory obligation,\u201d under Rule 12(e), to <em>sua sponte </em>direct a plaintiff to better plead his complaint \u201cwhen a shotgun complaint fails to adequately link a cause of action to its factual predicates.\u201d <em>Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">A complaint that fails to articulate claims with sufficient clarity to allow the defendant to frame a responsive pleading constitutes a \u201cshotgun pleading.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1128-29 (11th Cir.2001). Pleadings of this nature are prohibited by Rule 8(a)(2), which requires a claim for relief to be \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">After our own review of Lampkin-Asam\u2019s second amended complaint, we agree with the district court that it is confusing, incoherent, and clogged with seemingly irrelevant factual allegations. In it, Lampkin-Asam alleges the same facts repeatedly, and much of it is devoted to matters entirely outside the scope of this action. Because Lampkin-Asam failed to set forth in her second amended complaint a \u201cshort and plain statement of [her] claim\u201d showing that she was entitled to relief, it does not pass muster under Rule 8. The district court provided Lamp-kin-Asam with two opportunities to correct this problem, and because she failed to do so, dismissal with prejudice was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Lampkin-Asam\u2019s contention that the district court held her to a higher standard than a typical <em>pro se </em>plaintiff because she is a former attorney is of no moment. The district court gave her two opportunities to amend her complaint, and she failed to correct the deficiencies in it. Such leniency would have been sufficient even if Lampkin-Asam was a typical <em>pro se </em>litigant, which she is not. <em>Cf. Friedlander v. Nims, </em>755 F.2d 810, 811-12, 813-14 (11th Cir.1985) (concluding that dismissal with prejudice was appropriate where the district court gave \u201cspecific and repeated warnings,\u201d which went ignored by the plaintiff, that the complaint required amendment). Moreover, even if the district court had held Lampkin-Asam to a higher standard, we would not reverse. We give a \u201cliberal\u201d reading to <em>pro se </em>filings because those litigants lack formal legal training. <em>See GJR Invs., </em>132 F.3d at 1369 (\u201cCourts do and should show a leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants not enjoyed by those with the benefit of a legal education.\u201d). Lampkin-Asam, as a former attorney and person who possess formal legal training, should have been able to draft a complaint that complies with Rule 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-21\">.
