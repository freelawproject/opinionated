Orleans\u2019 counsel has filed an <em>Anders</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>brief, stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>there are no meritorious issues for appeal but questioning whether Orleans\u2019 sentence was plainly unreasonable. Although informed of his right to do so, Orleans has declined to file a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of probation to determine whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 656 (4th Cir.2007). In doing so, we first assess whether the sentence is unreasonable, using a more deferential standard as to issues of fact and the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion than that applied in reviewing a Guidelines sentence. <em>Id. </em>If we find the sentence to be reasonable, the inquiry ends. <em>Id. </em>at 657. If we find the sentence unreasonable, we must then decide whether it is plainly so. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he sentencing court retains broad discretion to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">We conclude that Orleans\u2019 sentence is procedurally reasonable because, although Orleans\u2019 offense is not covered by the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 1B1.9 (2006), the district court expressly considered the arguments raised by Orleans as well as other relevant factors. It is substantively reasonable because the district court articulated its reasons for selecting the sentence, namely, Orleans\u2019 repeated failure to comply with court orders and traffic laws. In addition, the sentence is substantially below the statutory maximum of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the revocation of Orleans\u2019 probation and his sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client in writing of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"><em> Anders v.
