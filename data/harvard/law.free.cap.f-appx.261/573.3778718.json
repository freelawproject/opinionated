The district court sentenced Vasquez to concurrent terms of ten years\u2019 imprisonment, which was the statutory mandatory minimum punishment. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) (2000). Vasquez timely appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Vasquez initially contends his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, because he claims he never agreed to the Government\u2019s factual basis demonstrating he possessed at least five kilograms of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine. Vasquez raised this contention at the sentencing hearing; although Vasquez never formally moved to withdraw his guilty plea, the district court stated it would deny such a motion to the extent Vasquez sought this relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">A defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991), and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 and sentencing hearings. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). Vasquez was advised he faced a statutory mandatory minimum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment on both counts, and Vasquez indicated he understood the district court would impose a sentence within the statutory range of ten years to life imprisonment. Thus, we conclude Vasquez knowingly and voluntarily entered his guilty plea, with an understanding of its consequences. <em>See United States v. Wood, </em>378 F.3d 342, 349 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Vasquez also contends the district court erred in sentencing him to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, notwithstanding the statutory mandatory minimum of that length and the validity of his guilty plea. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a sentence for unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). A sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the advisory sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 455-56 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. In determining the sentence, however, courts are still required to calculate and consider the guidelines range and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006). <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455-56. \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding application of presumption of reasonableness to within-guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">The district court appropriately held Vasquez responsible for at least five kilograms of cocaine. <em>See Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 456, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991) (holding weight of drug includes net weight of drug plus any dilutant, cutting agent or carrier medium). Furthermore, the district court correctly determined Vasquez had more than one criminal history point, making him ineligible for a reduction below the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(l) (2006). The court sentenced Vasquez within the properly calculated sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>guidelines range, and we therefore conclude the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Vasquez\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
