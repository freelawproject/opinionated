Hardaway argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress the evidence because the affidavit supporting the warrant that led to his arrest was a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. \u25a0 He contends that the magistrate judge was not presented with sufficient information to make an independent probable cause determination because the only fact provided to support the affiant\u2019s conclusion that the informant was reliable was a reference to the informant having given1 \u201ctrue and correct\u201d information about controlled substances in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">If an affidavit is based on information supplied by a confidential informant, this court examines the informant\u2019s veracity and basis of knowledge to determine if in the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d his information is credible. <em>See United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 904-05 (5th Cir.1992). Detective Saenz\u2019s assertion that the informant had provided information in the past that proved to be true, reliable, and correct sufficiently established the informant\u2019s veracity. <em>See McKnight, </em>953 F.2d at 904-05; <em>see also, Christian v. McKaskle, </em>731 F.2d 1196, 1200 (5th Cir.1984). Additionally, Saenz\u2019s statement that the informant personally observed Hardaway possess cocaine at Hardaway\u2019s residence twenty four hours before he gave his affidavit and that the informant knew Hardaway\u2019s alias, race, and birth date established that the informant had a sufficient basis of knowledge. <em>See e.g., Mack v. City of Abilene, </em>461 F.3d 547, 551 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>818 F.2d 345, 349 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">Thus, the information contained in the affidavit was sufficient to support a good-faith conclusion by an objectively reasonable officer that the affidavit on which the warrant was based was adequate to establish probable cause. <em>See Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d at 320. The district court did not err when it denied Hardaway\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
