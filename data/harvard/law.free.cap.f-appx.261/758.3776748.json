Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">The district court noted that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(C) provides that the removal period shall be extended if the alien fails or refuses to make a good faith effort to obtain a travel document or acts to prevent his removal and concluded that Blankson\u2019s own actions and conflicting claims of citizenship hampered the DHS\u2019s ability to effectuate his removal. The district court also found that Blankson failed to show that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The district court did not err in denying the petition. Blankson\u2019s frequently changing claims of citizenship hampered the DHS\u2019s ability to effectuate removal and, under \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(C), has served to extend the removal period of \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). <em>See Balogun v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 347, 350-51 (5th Cir.1993). Blankson has failed to show that under the circumstances his continued detention violates his constitutional rights and that \u201cthere is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED; Blankson\u2019s motion to enter exhibit lists is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
