We find that although the district court only considered the motion as one filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), it should have been construed instead as one filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) because it was filed more than ten days after entry of judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), 60; <em>In re Burnley, </em>988 F.2d 1, 2-8 (4th Cir.1992). Because Keyes\u2019 motion failed to demonstrate any grounds that would entitle him to relief pursuant to Rule 60(b), however, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the motion. <em>See Heyman v. M.L. Mktg. Co., </em>116 F.3d 91, 94 (4th Cir.1997) (stating standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Keyes v. Kauffman, </em>No. 1:07-cv-01149-JFM (D.Md. August 3, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
