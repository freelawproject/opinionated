The offense level was further increased by two levels because the offense occurred after Mayo had a previous conviction for a felony immigration and naturalization offense. The PSR recommended that the offense level be reduced by two levels for acceptance of responsibility. With a Criminal History Category of III, Mayo\u2019s guidelines range was 21 to 27 months of imprisonment. However, the statutory minimum sentence for conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii) was three years of imprisonment. The district court sentenced Mayo to the three-year minimum term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Mayo argues that the district court erred in applying an enhancement to the offense level for reckless endangerment. As the district court applied no such enhancement, the appeal on this issue is frivolous. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Liljeberg Enters., Inc., </em>38 F.3d 1404, 1413 (5th Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Mayo also asserts that \u201che did not deserve the indictment under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(2)(B)(ii),\u201d that he was instead only \u201cguilty of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(l)(B)(i),\u201d that the district court should have dismissed the charge under subsection (a)(2), and that the district court should have sentenced Mayo to a sentence within the guidelines range despite the statutory minimum. The import of these assertions is that Mayo\u2019s plea to subsection (a)(2) is somehow invalid, but Mayo never actually argues that his plea is invalid. Mayo, who is represented by counsel, has thus abandoned any issue as to the validity of his plea and his assertions state no cognizable legal claim regarding his conviction or sentence. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>cf. Olivares v. Martin, </em>555 F.2d 1192, 1194 n. 1 (5th Cir.1977) (holding that attorney litigant is not entitled to same liberal construction accorded pro se litigants).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co., </em>38 F.3d at 1413; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
