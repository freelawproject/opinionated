Castro\u2019s 60-month sentence included an upward departure from criminal history category VI pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Castro argues that the district court acted unreasonably in upwardly departing from the advisory guideline range when imposing his sentence. He also challenges the extent of the departure and the sufficiency of the district court\u2019s written reasons for the extent of the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we ultimately review sentences for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Smith </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). In making this reasonableness determination, we review both the decision to depart and the extent of the departure \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also Smith, </em>440 F.3d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">The distinct court indicated at sentencing that its decision to depart upwardly was based upon the information contained in the presentence investigation report (PSR), which indicated that Castro\u2019s criminal history category substantially underrepresented his prior offenses or the likelihood that he would commit other crimes in the future. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a). The court\u2019s written statement of reasons similarly relied upon \u00a7 4A1.3(a). The PSR indicated that Castro had an extensive list of criminal convictions by the time he reached age 23. In addition, Castro was on probation at the time he committed the instant offense, and he had used numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>alias names and birthdates in the past. In light of Castro\u2019s criminal history category and the nature of Castro\u2019s prior offenses, the district court did not err in determining that Castro\u2019s prior criminal history was underrepresented. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348-49 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>548 U.S. 918, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Moreover, the extent of the upward departure was reasonable. The district court\u2019s 60-month sentence was 30 months more than the top of the advisory guidelines range but well below the 10-year statutory maximum for the offense. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48. Although the district court could have stated its reasons for the upward departure with a higher degree of specificity, the district court\u2019s written statement nevertheless was sufficient to inform the parties and aid this Court. <em>Id. </em>at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Castro challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This Court has held that this issue is \u201cfully foreclosed from further debate.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Aug. 28, 2007) (No. 07-6202).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
