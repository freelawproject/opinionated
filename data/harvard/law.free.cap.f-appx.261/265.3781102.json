Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and (2) the district court failed properly to consider the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in arriving at his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We reject appellant\u2019s first contention because the court, in treating the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory, did not commit <em>Booker </em>error. We turn then to appellant\u2019s second point, that the court failed properly to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Section 3553(a) lists several factors a court must consider in determining a reasonable sentence: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence to criminal conduct; (4) the need to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The weight the court gives to a particular \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the court\u2019s sound discretion. Here, the record establishes that district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and then concluded that the sentence it imposed was appropriate to satisfy the purposes of sentencing. We find no basis in the record for disturbing appellant\u2019s sentence. It is accordingly</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">. The sentence range the Guidelines prescribed called for a term of imprisonment of 235 to 293 months. The maximum sentence prescribed by statute was 20 years. Because the Guidelines sentence range of 235 to 293 months exceeded that maximum, the high end of the range became 240 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
