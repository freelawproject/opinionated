To qualify for withholding of removal, \u201cthe alien [must] demonstrate \u2018a clear probability of persecution\u2019 on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Dankam v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 113, 115 (4th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). The protected grounds are defined as \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2007). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s holding that Samb failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-22\">Samb also alleges that the Board erred in denying her protection under the CAT, asserting that the Board applied an incorrect standard to her claim. We reject her contention that a \u201cclear probability\u201d of torture is a higher standard than the regulatory language, \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2007). Although Samb relies on language in <em>Stevie </em>to support her position, <em>Stevie </em>is concerned with the difference in burden between the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard of an asylum claim and the \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard for withholding of removal. The CAT had not been enacted in 1984, and the language used in the CAT, \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2), is the same as that used as the standard for withholding of removal, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2), and has been equated to \u201cclear probability.\u201d <em>See Kouljinski v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 534, 544 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cTo prevail on a petition for withholding of removal under the [Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) ], or on a petition for withholding of removal under the CAT, an alien must show that there is a \u2018clear probability1 that she would be subject to persecution, for the INA, or to torture, for the CAT____\u201d); <em>Fadiga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>488 F.3d 142, 160 (3d Cir.2007) (noting the Board erred in holding the alien to the underlying \u201cclear probability\u201d standard for withholding of removal and CAT protection rather than to motion to reopen standard); <em>Yakovenko v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 631, 637 (8th Cir.2007) (\u201cTo be entitled to relief under the [CAT], it is not necessary that torture be motivated by a protected basis, but there must be a clear probability the petitioner will be tortured if returned to her homeland.\u201d); <em>Sulaiman v. Gonzales, </em>429 F.3d 347, 351 (1st Cir.2005) (rejecting claim that \u201cclear probability\u201d was not CAT standard, holding \u201c \u2018[c]lear probability5 simply means \u2018more likely than not,\u2019 which is the correct standard for the immigration judge to apply....\u201d\u2019). We conclude that the Board did not err in using the \u201cclear probability\u201d language. Further, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Samb failed to meet that standard. <em>See Lin-Jian v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 182, 193 (4th Cir.2007) (applying substantial evidence standard to CAT claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Therefore, we deny Samb\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-19\"> Samb does not challenge the Board\u2019s denial of asylum relief as untimely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
