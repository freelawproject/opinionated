He argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">This court will uphold the jury\u2019s verdict if a reasonable trier of fact could conclude from the evidence that the elements of the offense were established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). The evidence, both direct and circumstantial, is viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 910, 911 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">To prove that a defendant violated \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly possessed a controlled substance with the intent to distribute it. \u00a7 841; <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>491 F.3d 237, 242 (5th Cir.2007). To sustain a defendant\u2019s conviction on an aiding-and-abetting charge, the evidence must support beyond a reasonable doubt the inference that the defendant knew that a drug transaction was occurring, that he associated himself with the actors involved in the transaction, that he participated in the venture with the desire that the venture succeed, and that he perform some designed or intended action to achieve the goal of the crime. <em>See United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.3d 920, 923 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-14\">Before his arrest, Rodriguez-Marin accompanied Gonzalez-Rodriguez when Gonzalez-Rodriguez was either negotiating drug deals with Frank Rodriguez or dealing drugs to Frank Rodriguez. On those occasions, he listened to the drug negotiations or watched Gonzalez-Rodriguez and Rodriguez exchange drugs for cash. On the day of his arrest, Gonzalez-Rodriguez went to Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s house and had methamphetamine with him. Gonzalez-Rodriguez spoke to Rodriguez on the phone about a three-pound methamphetamine deal while he was in Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s house. Gonzalez-Rodriguez and Rodriguez-Marin then checked into a motel that was close to where the drug deal was going to take place, and, before going to the drug deal, Gonzalez-Rodriguez and Rodriguez-Marin drove around and looked around in a manner consistent with counter-surveillance by drug dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-15\">When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we conclude that the jury reasonably found that Rodriguez-Marin actively participated in Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s possession of the three pounds of methamphetamine that were supposed to be delivered to Rodriguez. <em>See Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d at 910, 911. Rodriguez-Marin was a known associate of Gonzalez-Rodriguez, he knew that when Gonzalez-Rodriguez was meeting with Rodriguez it concerned drugs, he knew Gonzalez-Rodriguez was planning on delivering three-pounds of methamphetamine. to Rodriguez, he accompanied Gonzalez-Rodriguez on the delivery, and he acted as if he were conducting counter-surveillance of the area where the drugs were going to be delivered. The combination of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>circumstances created sufficient evidence of guilt. <em>See United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1484-88 (5th Cir.1995). Rodriguez-Marin\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b793-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
