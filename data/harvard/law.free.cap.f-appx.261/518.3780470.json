In his appeal, Martin claims there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, the district court erred in not including his proposed jury instruction on weaker and less satisfactory evidence in its charge to the jury, and the district court erred in allowing the government to improperly bolster their case through the testimony of Sergeant Purkey and admission of the videotape. Finding no error, we affirm Martin\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">The government cross-appeals Martin\u2019s sentence, claiming the district court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>in holding that the court was unable, pursuant to <em>United States v. Milam, </em>443 F.3d 382 (4th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448 (4th Cir.2006), to make any additional factual findings that had not been determined by the jury nor admitted by the defendant. Finding the district court erred, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">I..</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Martin argues the lack of physical or forensic evidence presented by the government and the questionable character of some of the government\u2019s witnesses warrant a finding that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In determining whether the government presented sufficient evidence at trial, the reviewing court examines the evidence in the light most favorable to the government to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) <em>(en banc). </em>The reviewing court must be aware that \u201c \u2018[t]he jury, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented, and if the evidence supports different, reasonable interpretations, the jury decides which interpretation to believe.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Habegger, </em>370 F.3d 441, 444 (4th Cir.2004)(quoting <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994)). This court has repeatedly held that the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness at trial may be sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1190 &amp; n. 9 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">We find that, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5. <em>See Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 227-28, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (providing the elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)); <em>United States v. Randall, </em>171 F.3d 195, 209 (4th Cir.1999) (providing elements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)); <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>135 F.3d 291, 306 (4th Cir.1998) (providing elements of conspiracy with intent to distribute and to distribute crack cocaine).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">Martin argues the district court erred in not including his proposed jury instruction on weaker and less satisfactory evidence in its charge to the jury. Martin argues this jury instruction was necessary based upon the lack of physical and forensic evidence linking him to the drug distributions and the inability of the district court to define reasonable doubt. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">This court considers de novo whether a district court has properly instructed a jury on the statutory elements of an offense, <em>see United States v. Rahman, </em>83 F.3d 89, 92 (4th Cir.1996), but reviews for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision of whether to give a jury instruction and the content of the instruction. <em>See United States v. Abbas, </em>74 F.3d 506, 513 (4th Cir.1996). The court\u2019s denial of a proposed jury instruction constitutes reversible error only if the proposed jury instruction \u201c(1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">We find that the district court did not err in refusing to include Martin\u2019s proposed jury instruction because it is not a correct statement of law. We have consistently held that the district court, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>instructing the jury, \u201cneed not, and in fact should not, define the term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 even upon request.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>152 F.3d 294, 298 (4th Cir.1998). The district court properly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt and their duty to interpret the evidence presented at trial and determine its weight. Additionally, Martin had the opportunity to argue the lack of physical or forensic evidence to the jury in his closing statement, and therefore, the failure to give this instruction did not impair his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Martin argues the district court erred in allowing the government to improperly bolster the testimony of their other witnesses through Sergeant Purkey\u2019s testimony and the admission of the video detailing a controlled buy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">This court reviews whether the district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>986 F.2d 65, 68 (4th Cir.1993). The admission of evidence \u201cwill not be turned over on appeal unless the court\u2019s decision is shown to be arbitrary or irrational.\u201d <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>990 F.2d 119, 122 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Martin\u2019s objection to the videotape, as only depicting a portion of the controlled buy in which he is absent, goes to its weight, not its admissibility. The videotape corroborated the testimony of other witnesses, and we find its admission was not arbitrary or irrational. Sgt. Purkey\u2019s testimony on the types of drugs, the typical drug weights found in Harrison County, and the drug weights associated with the other witnesses\u2019 testimony likely aided the jury in ascertaining the truth. Additionally, the district court properly provided limiting instructions and gave the defendant the opportunity to voir dire Sgt. Purkey and conduct extensive cross examination of his testimony. We find, therefore, the district court did not commit reversible error in admitting Sgt. Purkey\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">The government appeals Martin\u2019s sentence, arguing the district court improperly concluded, based upon <em>United States v. Milam, </em>443 F.3d 382 (4th Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Revels, </em>455 F.3d 448 (4th Cir.2006), that it could not enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence based upon facts not found by the jury nor admitted by the defendant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">Martin faced a maximum possible sentence of life imprisonment for Count 1, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A). The jury, in its verdict, found no specific relevant drug weight beyond the fifty grams or more of cocaine base in Count 1. The presentence report attributed 11.23 kilograms of cocaine base to the defendant and added sentencing enhancements for his managerial role in the offense, pursuant to <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7 3B1.1, and obstruction of justice, pursuant to <em>United States Sentencing Guidelines </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. The presentence report determined Martin\u2019s total offense level to be 43 and his criminal history category to be IV, resulting in a guideline range of life imprisonment with an additional five years, to run consecutively, for Count 5: The district court concluded, based upon <em>Milam </em>and <em>Revels, </em>that it could only rely upon the factual findings made by the jury.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>therefore, attributed only 50 grams of crack cocaine to the defendant and did not include the additional sentencing enhancements, resulting in a new offense level of 82. The district court sentenced Martin to 210 months for Counts 1, 2, and 4 and 60 months for Count 5, to be served consecutively to the other Counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The federal sentencing guidelines are now advisory following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>548 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). When calculating the guideline range sentencing courts may make factual determinations regarding sentencing enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005) (\u201c <em>\u2018Booker </em>does not in the end move any decision from judge to jury, or change the burden of persuasion.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Both <em>Milam </em>and <em>Revels </em>involved pre<em>Booker </em>dispositions and neither of these decisions, as noted in <em>Revels, </em>affect the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing court\u2019s calculation of a defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range. <em>Revels, </em>455 F.3d at 451 n. 2. The district court, therefore, erred in concluding that it was unable to make additional factual findings on sentencing enhancements for the amount of drugs, the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, and whether the defendant obstructed justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Martin argues the district court\u2019s misinterpretation of <em>Milam </em>and <em>Revels </em>should not result in a new sentence because his sentence is still reasonable. The reviewing court examines a post <em>-Booker </em>sentence for unreasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 264, 125 S.Ct. 738. A sentence may be unreasonable for both substantive and procedural reasons. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 434 (4th Cir.2006) (stating that a substantially unreasonably sentence occurs when \u201cthe court relies on an improper factor or rejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission\u201d and a procedurally unreasonable sentence occurs when the district court \u201cprovides an inadequate statement of reasons or fails to make a necessary factual finding\u201d). The district court\u2019s misinterpretation of the law warrants a finding that Martin\u2019s sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Martin\u2019s conviction but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\"> We note that the district court acknowledged during Martin\u2019s sentencing that it may have misinterpreted the law and, but for its misunderstanding, the court would have adopted the findings in the Presentence Report and would have found a life sentence reasonable and justified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
