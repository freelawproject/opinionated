We deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Insofar as Biftu petitions for review of the Board\u2019s order adopting and affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision, we deny the petition for review because Biftu did not challenge the decision in the argument section of her brief. \u201cIt is a well settled rule that contentions not raised in the argument section of the opening brief are abandoned.\u201d <em>United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004). This rule applies in the immigration context as well. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001) (issues not raised in the opening brief are abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We further find the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider or to reopen. <em>See Nibagwire v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir.2006); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006) (stating standard of reviews). We find the Board did not clearly err by finding after reviewing Biftu\u2019s submissions that she failed to support her claim that she would be subjected to persecution if she returned to Ethiopia. We will not review the claim that the Board erred by not independently reviewing her claims for withholding from removal and withholding under the CAT. According to Biftu, a finding of firm resettlement does not prevent the alien from receiving either of those forms of relief. Biftu did not raise this claim in her motion to reopen. <em>See Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
