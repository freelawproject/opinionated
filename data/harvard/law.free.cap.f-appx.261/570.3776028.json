He was sentenced to fifty-seven months of impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>onment. His counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising for the court\u2019s consideration whether Barrera\u2019s constitutional rights were violated because his sentence was increased based on a prior conviction not alleged in the indictment. Barrera was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. The Government did not file a reply brief. After reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Under \u00a7 1326(a), an alien who illegally returns to the United States after being removed may be imprisoned for up to two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides that, if the alien\u2019s removal was subsequent to an aggravated felony, he faces a maximum prison term of twenty years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Barrera argues that the district court improperly sentenced him to a term exceeding two years under \u00a7 1326(b) because his prior aggravated felony conviction was not charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Barrera concedes that the Supreme Court ruled in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that \u00a7 1326(b) is a penalty provision, not an element of the offense, and the aggravated felony conviction need not be charged in the indictment. However, he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was called into question by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny and should no longer be considered binding precedent. Although <em>Apprendi </em>expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>AlmendarezTorres, </em>we have subsequently concluded that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi, </em>and remains the law. <em>United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.2005) (reaffirming continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)). We therefore conclude that Barrera\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Barrera\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Barrera, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Barrera requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Barrera. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
