Habib-Rodriguez pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting possession with intent to distribute marijuana. He was sentenced to 57 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-24\">Habib challenges the reasonableness of his sentence, particularly the district court\u2019s failure to impose a sentence below the calculated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range, based on the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). For sentencing, Habib neither contested the calculation of that range nor objected to a sentence being imposed within it. Therefore, review is only for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-25\">The district court gave sufficient reasons for sentencing Habib within that sentencing range. Furthermore, Habib\u2019s sentence within that advisory range was presumptively reasonable, and Habib has not shown that the \u201csentence ... constitute^] a clear error in the court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion\u201d as to whether the sentence \u201c(1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors\u201d. <em>United States v.
