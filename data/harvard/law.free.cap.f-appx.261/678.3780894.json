Davis argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint against employees of the Texas Workers Compensation Commission because the defendants are not immune from suit. He also contends that the definition of disability in the Texas Workers Compensation Act is unconstitutionally vague. Davis does not challenge findings from the district court that he failed to allege a property interest, that his equal protection claim is without merit, and that he pleaded facts showing that he was not prevented from employment by a disability, but rather incarceration. Because Davis failed to brief these issues, they are deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-19\">Davis\u2019s argument challenging the defendants\u2019 immunity status is without merit. The district court did not determine that the defendants were immune. The judgment from which Davis appeals is not based upon immunity. Additionally, Davis\u2019s argument challenging the constitutionality of the Texas Workers Compensation Act\u2019s definition of disability was not raised before the district court. Therefore, the issue will not be considered on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-20\">Davis\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Davis\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this court\u2019s dismissal of Davis\u2019s appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Davis is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-17\"> Pursuant to Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and does not constitute precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in Fifth Circuit Rule 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
