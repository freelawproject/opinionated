She argues that the district court plainly erred in determining that she had two prior Texas convictions that qualified as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d for purposes of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) base offense level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-24\">According to the appellate record, McCoy was convicted in 2003 for possession with intent to deliver cocaine pursuant to Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(a). This conviction qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 2K2.1. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 714-15 (5th Cir.2007). The record additionally discloses that in 2000 McCoy was charged by bill of information with delivery of a controlled substance, also a violation of \u00a7 481.112(a), with the judgment reflecting that she pleaded guilty to delivery by actual transfer. The judgment therefore confirms that her con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>viction was for activity that constituted a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). <em>Cf. United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.) (holding that inspection of indictment and jury instructions confirmed that the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 481.112(a) conviction may have been for activity that did not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d i.e., activity constituting an offer to sell), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3031, 168 L.Ed.2d 748 (2007); <em>United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 360-61 (5th Cir.) (holding that an undifferentiated guilty plea to an indictment charging the \u00a7 481.112(a) offense in the conjunctive did not necessitate a finding that the defendant committed a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d because it was unclear whether the defendant pleaded guilty to transfer of cocaine or the offer to sell cocaine), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 410, 169 L.Ed.2d 287 (2007). As such, McCoy has not demonstrated plain error on the part of the district court in calculating her base offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD AND LEAVE TO SUPPLEMENT RECORD EXCERPTS GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
