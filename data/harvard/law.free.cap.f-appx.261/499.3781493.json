He argues that the district court improperly assessed criminal history points for two prior convictions. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">On appeal, Harrison challenges the assessment of criminal history points as he did at sentencing; however, his challenge rests on an entirely different basis than his objection below. Furthermore, Harrison challenges a criminal history point based on his 2003 habitual traffic offender conviction, to which he did not object below. Because Harrison raises issues for the first time on appeal, this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 215 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1023, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). To establish plain error, Harrison must show that an error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4A1.2(c) (2006), all felony and misdemeanor offenses are counted for purposes of calculating criminal history, except \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l) lists certain misdemeanor offenses counted only if the sentence is a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, and \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(2) lists a smaller number of misdemeanor and petty offenses that are never counted. Although Harrison asserts that his 2002 conviction for driving under suspension was not countable because it is a listed exception under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1) and no sentence or probation was imposed, nothing in the record suggests that Harrison was assessed a criminal history point based on the driving under suspension conviction. Harrison had two convictions for which he was sentenced on July 17, 2002, and received a total of one criminal history point. Harrison was properly assessed a criminal history point for his 2002 conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, an offense that is not listed as an exception under \u00a7 4A1.2 (c)(1) or (c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Harrison also argues that the court erred in applying one criminal history point for his 2003 habitual traffic offender conviction because the offense of habitual traffic offender is similar to driving under suspension, an offense listed as an exception under \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), and the record does not establish that actual imprisonment was ordered. However, all felony offenses are included in the calculation of criminal history. USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(c). A \u201cfelony offense\u201d for sentencing purposes includes any federal, state or local offense punishable by death or a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, regardless of the actual sentence imposed. USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(o). Harrison\u2019s South Carolina law habitual traffic offender conviction was punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year and is therefore a felony conviction under the guidelines. <em>See </em>S.C. Ann.Code \u00a7 56-1-1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Concluding the district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, we affirm Harrison\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
