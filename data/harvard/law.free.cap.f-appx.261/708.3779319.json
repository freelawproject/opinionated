(\u201cDiversified\u201d) on Cross\u2019s claim for wrongful denial of disability benefits. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Cross was hired by Diversified as Director of National Account Sales on January 1, 2001. As of April 1, 2001, Cross was insured under Diversified\u2019s Long-Term Disability Plan (\u201cPlan\u201d), which is governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>To receive benefits under the terms of the Plan for the first twenty-four months of the claim, a claimant must be found to be totally disabled, which means that he cannot perform the material duties of his regular occupation. The claimant must be totally disabled throughout the elimination period of ninety days from the first date of total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Cross had an aortic valve abnormality which first required surgery in 1984, and afterwards he occasionally experienced cardiac symptoms and underwent additional catheterization and stenting procedures. On April 8, 2002, Carlos Sotolongo, Cross\u2019s physician, indicated that Cross was never expected to return to full or part-time work. On February 24, 2003, Cross underwent a left internal mammary artery implant. On February 4, 2004, he took a stress test which showed normal blood pressure response and a borderline abnormal baseline electrocardiogram. The test was clinically positive for ischemia<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but electrocardiographically negative for it. Cross underwent a second stress test on March 4, 2004, in which he achieved ninety percent of his maximum predicted heart rate. He also achieved 9.4 METS.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The test also indicated that he was clinically borderline positive for myocardial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ischemia versus deconditioning and electrocardiographically borderline positive. On June 7, 2004, he visited cardiologist Barry Kusnick, his last doctor visit before his June 25, 2004 stated disability date. He complained of fatigue, dyspnea<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on walking from his front' door to the car, insomnia, and severe work-related stress. Kusnick\u2019s notes from the visit indicate that Cross \u201cappealed] distraught\u201d and indicated \u201csevere ... work stress. Up against a very adversarial supervisor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">Beginning on April 21, 2004 and continuing through June 7, 2004, Cross sent resumes to several employers and contacts, seeking a sales or sales manager position. On June 22, 2004, three days before his stated disability date and one day before the disability letter issued by his doctor, Cross sent one final resume to a prospective employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">In a letter dated June 23, 2004, Kusnick informed Reliance that Cross was permanently disabled effective immediately, noting Cross\u2019s extensive medical history. Cross\u2019s claimed disability date was June 25, 2004 and his elimination period ran through September 23, 2004. On July 26, 2004, when first visiting Kusnick after his disability date, Cross told him that he had walked 1.5 miles in thirty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Reliance requested a review of Cross\u2019s medical records by nurse Dorothy McGarry which was conducted on August 25, 2004. She concluded that Cross was \u201ccapable of sedentary restrictions and limitations\u201d which would have to be permanent. Reliance then requested a review by cardiologist Marvin Goldstein who evaluated Cross\u2019s records and the March 2004 stress test and concluded that Cross should be able to perform a light duty occupation. He saw no change in Cross\u2019s cardiac condition on or around June 2004, when the disability was to have occurred. On September 24, 2004, Reliance denied Cross\u2019s application for long-term disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">After claiming disability, Cross moved to North Carolina. There, on December 7, 2004, he saw cardiologist Richard Jacoby, his first doctor\u2019s visit since his July 26, 2004 appointment with Kusnick. After a March 3, 2005 office visit, Jacoby wrote that Cross\u2019s functional limitations, largely based upon Cross\u2019s reports of dyspnea on completing daily activities, \u201cwould make meaningful employment difficult.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Cross requested a review of his medical records by another doctor, William Porter, who practiced in internal medicine, hematology, and oncology. Porter indicated that a January 5, 2005 stress test was normal but still noted Cross\u2019s significant dyspnea and concluded that he was disabled for any occupation as continued employment would pose considerable medical risk to him. On March 10, 2005, Cross made a declaration that his position with Diversified was not sedentary and involved significant activity. He also noted the considerable stress of his position and his supervisor\u2019s relentless expectations. He, however, added that the stress level would be similar at other companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">At Reliance\u2019s request, Jeffrey Caren, a cardiologist, reviewed Cross\u2019s records from Sotolongo, Kusnick, Goldstein, Jacoby, Porter, Cross\u2019s declaration, the 2004 stress tests, and additional reports from December 2004. Caren concluded that Cross was capable of working at a light occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Following an administrative appeal, Reliance made a final determination that Cross was not entitled to disability benefits under the Plan. Reliance noted, \u201cDr. Jacoby documents that Mr. Cross\u2019s reported functional limitations would make \u2018meaningful employment difficult.\u2019 \u201d It also observed that Kusnick indicated that Cross was at \u201cmaximum medical rehabilitative state,\u201d even though he had not participated in a cardiac rehabilitation program after his bypass surgery which had been recommended by Kusnick. In response to Porter\u2019s concerns about job-related stress, Reliance noted that Cross\u2019s blood pressure remained constant from before stopping to work to nine months after stopping work.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">Reliance observed that the Plan provided benefits if Cross was unable to perform the material duties of his occupation, not his job which it defined as \u201ca set of specific tasks performed for a specific employer.\u201d It concluded that Cross\u2019s stress associated with his adversarial supervisor was a specific job circumstance, but did not preclude him from performing his occupation. Reliance pointed to Cross\u2019s attempts to find similar jobs up until he claimed disability. It also noted that Cross did not consult with his cardiologist between January 21, 2004 and June 7, 2004. However, Cross emailed his resume for a sales and management position on the evening after the June 7, 2004 doctor visit. He sent his last resume on June 22, 2004, the day before Kusnick sent a letter in support of Cross\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Cross commenced this action on July 6, 2006. After both parties filed motions for summary judgment, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>granted Reliance\u2019s motion on April 20, 2007, 2007 WL 1191808. Cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision that a plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying disability benefits. <em>Barhan v. Ry-Ron Inc., </em>121 F.8d 198, 201 (5th Cir.1997). Because the terms of the Plan give the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine benefits, the district court reviews the denial of benefits for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]f the administrator\u2019s decision on eligibility is supported by substantial evidence and is not erroneous as a matter of law, it will be upheld.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, because Reliance acts as both the insurer and the plan administrator, it operates under a conflict of interest because it \u201cpotentially benefits from every denied claim.\u201d <em>Vega v. Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Servs., Inc., </em>188 F.3d 287, 295 (5th Cir.1999). This Court therefore applies a \u201csliding scale standard\u201d and grants Reliance\u2019s decision \u201cless than full deference.\u201d <em>Gooden v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>250 F.3d 329, 333 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThe greater the evidence of conflict on the part of the administrator, the less deferential our abuse of discretion standard will be.\u201d <em>Vega, </em>188 F.3d at 297. However, \u201cour review of the administrator\u2019s decision need not be particularly complex or technical; it need only assure that the administrator\u2019s decision fall somewhere on a continuum of reasonableness\u2014even if on the low end.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Cross primarily claims that the stress of his occupation exacerbated his heart condition. He argues that Reliance\u2019s actions or inaction in evaluating his claim evidences a conflict of interest and that, therefore, we should accord its decision less deference. He concurrently points to Reliance\u2019s actions or inaction to indicate that its decision to deny him benefits was arbitrary and capricious. Cross concedes that he could have physically performed the requirements of his job on the day after he retired. He does not challenge Reliance\u2019s interpretation of the Plan that he had to be disabled from performing the material duties of his occupation, not his specific job, to qualify for benefits. He also concedes in his reply brief that a plan administrator\u2019s decision is not necessarily arbitrary and capricious because it accepts the decisions of its physicians conducting a review of records over the claimant\u2019s treating physicians. <em>See Sweatman v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>39 F.3d 594, 601-03 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">Contrary to Cross\u2019s argument, the administrative record does not show a strong conflict of interest necessitating a less deferential review, nor does it show that Reliance was arbitrary and capricious in deciding Cross\u2019s claim. First, it was reasonable for Reliance to rely on Goldstein\u2019s opinion over that of McGarry\u2019s and Kusnick\u2019s. It was not arbitrary for Reliance to accept the opinion of a cardiologist over that of a nurse, McGarry. Moreover, Goldstein\u2019s opinion was based on the March 2004 stress test which was the test closest in time to Cross\u2019s claimed disability date. Goldstein relied on the best stress test available which gave objective indications of how Cross\u2019s body would react to stress. Cross concedes in his reply brief that he was factually incorrect in his original brief in asserting that Goldstein was not provided with the previous opinions of Sotolongo and Kusnick. Goldstein considered those records when making his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Although Cross claims there were several flaws in Goldstein\u2019s conclusions, we are not persuaded. He suggests that Gold-stein\u2019s reliance on the March 2004 test was in error because it was performed approximately four months before the disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>date. This argument does not support Cross\u2019s disability claim, because, if the most recent stress test was unreliable, then Kusnick had few, if any, objective bases for his conclusion that Cross became disabled on June 23, 2004. It is also difficult for Cross to argue that Goldstein\u2019s reliance on the test was misplaced because his doctors did not have him take another stress test for several months. Cross further claims that Goldstein erred in relying on the March 2004 test because his condition was deteriorating. However, the objective tests taken before and after his disability date indicate no such deterioration. Cross also argues that Goldstein erred in relying on an approximation of his walking speed to determine that he was capable of light work, but a review of Goldstein\u2019s report shows that he relied on objective data from the stress test for that particular determination. Furthermore, considering that Cross had reported the numbers used to determine his mile per hour walking rate a month after his disability date, neither Goldstein nor Reliance were unreasonable in approximating his walking speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Second, Reliance\u2019s acceptance of Caren\u2019s conclusion over Jacoby\u2019s and Porter\u2019s was also reasonable. Caren reviewed the records from the other physicians, the results of the 2004 stress tests, Cross\u2019s declaration, and additional tests from December 2004. His conclusions were based on the objective evidence available in those records. On the other hand, Jacoby\u2019s opinion that meaningful employment would be difficult was based upon Cross\u2019s reported ailments months after his elimination period ended. Porter\u2019s conclusions had a similar basis. However, Porter also indicated that the objective data from a January 7, 2005 exercise test \u201cshowed a normal ejection fraction and no wall abnormalities.\u201d Because of the objective criteria used, Reliance reasonably accepted Caren\u2019s conclusions over Jacoby\u2019s and Porter\u2019s. Nor does its acceptance of Caren\u2019s opinion indicate a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Furthermore, the record does not indicate that Reliance had a conflict of interest or was arbitrary and capricious in its evaluation of Cross\u2019s job stress. Goldstein\u2019s opinion was based upon stress tests that provided objective criteria to evaluate Cross\u2019s cardiac health. Cross\u2019s blood pressure remained constant from the periods before and after his disability date, indicating that job stress was not a factor in Cross\u2019s condition. Even if it were, the administrative record shows that the stress of which Cross complained was the result of his specific job, not his occupation. First, on June 7, 2004, Kusnick noted Cross\u2019s complaints about his adversarial relationship with his supervisor as a cause of his severe work stress. Second, Cross\u2019s own actions in seeking the same occupation in Florida at approximately the same time he applied for disability benefits, indicates that the stress that he claims was dangerously deleterious to his health was associated with his job at Diversified, not his occupation as a sales manager. While Cross speculated that such stress would occur in any sales manager position, his . own actions indicate otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Cross specifically asks this Court to decide whether an insured\u2019s contemplation of working for another employer against medical advice would defeat an otherwise valid disability claim. We hold that, based upon the facts of this case, Reliance was reasonable and exhibited no conflict of interest in considering Cross\u2019s actions in determining the validity of his claim. As Cross was the source of much of the bases for his doctors\u2019 opinions, the seriousness with which he took their advice was relevant in determining the validity of their conclusions. Cross\u2019s actions were also relevant in determining whether it was his job at Diversified or his occupation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>was the cause of the stress he claimed to be harmful to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Cross also asks this Court to consider whether an insured is disabled if his occupation is \u201cdangerously deleterious to his health\u201d but could otherwise perform the work. We need not decide that question. Reliance did not conclude as a factual matter that Cross\u2019s occupation was dangerously deleterious to his health, and this Court holds that Reliance\u2019s conclusions were reasonable and not the result of a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">IV.
