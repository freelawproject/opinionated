The district court deviated from the advisory guidelines range of 6-12 months to impose a non-guideline sentence of 21 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-26\">We review sentences for \u201cunreasonableness\u201d in light of the sentencing considerations set forth in <em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 </em>(a). <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d 531, 534 (5th Cir.2007). The guidelines provide but a \u201crough approximation\u201d of a sentence that will meet all the objectives of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-29\">Alfaro contends that the non-guideline sentence was unreasonable because the district court based it on factors already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>adequately accounted for by the guidelines. The district court\u2019s grounds for the variance went beyond the rough approximation of the guidelines to include the dangerous nature of Alfaro\u2019s DWI and assault crimes, the accelerated pace of his convictions, his lack of maturity and responsibility despite his age, his acute disregard for the law as shown by his frequent and repeated illegal entries, the failure of prior lenient sentences to have a deterrent effect, and Alfaro\u2019s evident inability to control his drinking while not incarcerated. The court did not base the sentence on factors already considered by the advisory guidelines. It implicitly viewed the facts in this case as more egregious than a typical illegal reentry crime by another defendant with Alfaro\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d at 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Alfaro contends that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court did not consider a guideline-based departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. We rejected a contention like this in <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007). As in <em>Mejia-Huerta, </em>the non-guideline sentence was not based solely on under-represented criminal history under \u00a7 4A1.3, but \u201con a number of \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including extensive criminal history, the need to promote respect for law, deterrence of future criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public.\u201d <em>Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d at 723. As we emphasized in <em>Mejia-Huerta, </em>\u201c\u00a7 4A1.3 applies only to departures\u2014based on unrepresentative criminal history\u201d and is by its own terms irrelevant to non-guideline variances. <em>Id. </em>at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">Alfaro contends that the district court did not give due consideration to the 75% disparity between the maximum guideline sentence of 12 months and his sentence of 21 months. Alfaro does not address any specific factor that the court found to distinguish him from others who have illegally reentered the United States and who may have similar criminal history scores. \u201cCiting one case in which a lower sentence was imposed clearly cannot establish an unwarranted disparity.\u201d <em>Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d at 536 n. 4. Alfaro does not compare his sentence to that of any other defendant and thus makes only the general and unremarkable assertion that non-guideline sentences are different than guideline sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Alfaro has failed to show that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence under any standard of review that might apply to the review of a sentence. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b794-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
