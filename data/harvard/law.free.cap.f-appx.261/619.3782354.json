She was sentenced to twenty-five months of imprisonment. On appeal, Winkler argues that the district court erred in denying her request for a jury instruction on entrapment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-22\">We find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s refusal to issue the instruction. <em>United States v. Phan, </em>121 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1997) (stating review standard). The record does not support Winkler\u2019s claim that she was induced to commit her crimes and that she had no previous predisposition to do so. <em>See Mathews v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 58, 63, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988); <em>United States v. Sarihifard, </em>155 F.3d 301, 308 (4th Cir.1998). In particular, Winkler failed in her evidentiary burden to establish grounds for the affirmative defense, <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 33 n. 8 (4th Cir.1995), and the evidence of her predisposition to commit the crimes was abundant. <em>United States v. Sligh, </em>142 F.3d 761, 762-63 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">Accordingly, we affirm her convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
