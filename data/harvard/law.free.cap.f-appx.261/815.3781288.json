The district court dismissed Amadi\u2019s civil rights action, filed under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for failure to state a claim, and it also denied Amadi\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal. In order to obtain leave to proceed IFP, Amadi must show that he is a pauper, and he must raise a nonfrivolous issue. <em>See Jackson v. Dallas Police Dep\u2019t, </em>811 F.2d 260, 261 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-21\">Amadi argues in conclusory fashion that his complaint states a constitutional claim. Amadi\u2019s second amended complaint, however, contains no allegations of personal involvement on the part of the only named defendant, nor does the second amended complaint contain allegations of a causal connection between the defendant\u2019s acts or omissions and the claimed violation of Amadi\u2019s constitutional rights. Amadi fails to raise a nonfrivolous issue in his appeal of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. <em>See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1965, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>Lozano v. Smith, </em>718 F.2d 756, 768 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-24\">Amadi\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his request for leave to proceed IFP is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-25\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Amadi\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). See <em>Adepeg</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>ba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Amadi is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any \u25a0civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
