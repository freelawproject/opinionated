May 21 leave was granted, without prejudice, and the bill was accordingly filed. As such an application by a State is usually granted as of course, we thought' it wiser to allow the bill to be filed, but reserving to. the United States-the right to object to the jurisdiction thereafter, and hence the words, \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d were inserted in the order. October'9 leave was granted to the United States to file-a demurrer, and in lieu of this a motion to dismiss was substituted, which was submitted November 12 on printed briefs on both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The bill was filed by\u2019 the Attorney General of Kansas, on behalf of the State, as trustee for .the Missouri, Kansas- and Texas Railway Company, of certain lands in the Indian Terri-, tory, alleged to have been granted to the State for the benefit .of the railway company..</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">It is stated by counsel for complainant, as appearing from the bill, that- in 1866' \u201cthere were three Kansas railroad companies running through the State to the Indian Territory line. The first was the Union Pacific Railway Company, Southern Branch, since the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company, extending from Fort Riley, now Junction City, Kansas, .in a southeasterly direction, down the -valley of the Neosho River, to the southern line of the State of Kansas, near Chetopa, Kansas; the 'second was the Leavenworth, Lawrence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>Fort Gibson Railway Company, since conveyed to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa F\u00e9\u2019 Railroad Company, extending from Leavenworth, through Lawrence, to the northern line of the. Indian Territory, near Coffeyville, Montgomery County, Kansas, in the direction of Galveston Bay, in Texas; and the third was the Kansas and Neosho Valley Railway Company, since .the Kansas City, Fort Scott-and Memphis, and now-a part of . the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad Company,.' extending from a point of connection with the Union Pacific Railroad at or near the mouth of the Kansas River; thence southeasterly, through the ..eastern tier of counties, to the northern line of the Indian Territory, at or near:Baxter Springs,, in Cherokee County,. Kansas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">On July 25, 1866, an act of Congress was passed entitl\u00e9d \u201cAn Act granting lands to the State of Kansas to aid in the construction of the Kansas, and Neosho Valley. Railroad and its extension to Red River.\u201d 14 Stat. -236, c. 241. On the next day, July 26, an act was passed, using the same language, except as to\u2019 the routes, entitled \u201cAn Act granting lands to the State of Kansas to aid in the. construction of a Southern Branch of the Union Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company, from Fort Riley, Kansas, to Fort Smith, Arkansas,\u201d .14 Stat. 289, c. 270, which provided as-follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">\u201cThat for the purpose of aiding the Union Pacific Railroad Company, Southern Branch, the same being a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Kansas to construct and operate a railroad frohi Fort Riley, Kansas, or ne\u00e1r said' military reservation, thence down the valley of the Neosho River to the southern line of the State of Kansas, with a view to an extension of the same through a portion of the Indian Territory to Fort Smith, Arkansas, there is hereby granted to the State of Kansas, for the use and benefit of said railroad company every alternate section of land or parts thereof designated by odd numbers, to the extent of five alternate sections per mile on each side of said road and not exceeding in all ten sections per mile; . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u201cSec. 3. . ...

It was prayed that a, decree- be entered 'adjudging the State to be- the owner, as trustee for the railway company, of all odd-numbefed sections of land to the extent of the grant along the'line'of the road'through the Creek'Nation, in .the Indian Territory, .and that the allottees be di-. rected to surrender the-possession to the State as .trustee and be enjoined from disposing-of said lands, or \u201cin the event that frbm - any equitable considerations the court shall entertain the view that the1 allottees and those claiming under them should not be disturbed, then that an account be taken of the value of the lands in controversy,\u201d and that the United States be adjudged to.pay to th\u00e9 State as trustee the sum of such values, estimated! at more than $10,000,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">In our opinion it appears upon'the face of. the bill that 'the State of Kansas is only nominally a party, and that the -real-party .in interest is the railroad company. Section 3 provided that patents should be issued not to the State but to the company direct, which made the State nothing but a -mere conduit for the passage of title.1 'And this is so even if it.were ruled that the State of Kansas was made trustee under section 9, because- it would only be trustee of .the bare legal title. In very many cases \u201cin which the grant was directly to the railroad company', or in which the act' of Congress required that the patents for -lands earned should be issued, not to the State for the benefit of the railroad company, but directly to the company itself/\u2019 it has been held that the title vested absolutely in the railroad company. <em>Sioux City &amp;c. Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>159 U. S. 349, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Title -passed by the grant on the performanc\u00e9 of its conditions and to the grantees to whom the patents were to be. issued, and here section 3 provided that patents should issue not to the State but to tlie railroad company direct. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">And if the lands in the -Indian Territory could be held in any \"view to have been granted <em>in prtssenti, </em>such, grant was certainly not to the State of Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The road, in aid of which the grant was made to the. State, extended no farther than the southern boundary thereof, and the patents were' to be issued to the company. True^ as declared,in section 1, the road was\u2019to be constructed \u201cwith a view to an extension of the same through, a portion of the Indian Territory to Fort Smith,. Arkansas,\u201d and that extension was authorized by section 8, but the lands referred to in section 9 were not lands in the State of Kansas, nor was that State mentioned in the section. It seems clear that those lands were hot ..intended to be granted to that State for the construction of a road beyond its boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Moreover, the bill sets forth many communications and protests by the railroad company to the Dawes Commission,the townsite commission, the Indian' agent and the Secretary of the Interior, in all of which the tracts in controversy were claimed by the railroad compaiiy as its own without reference to any interest of the State of Kansas therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In these circumstances' we think it apparent that the name of 'the State is being used simply for the prosecution in this' court of the claim of the railroad company, and our original-.jurisdiction can not be maintained,.</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">Again, the 'United States is the real party in interest as defendant and has not consented to be sued, which it caii not be without its consent. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>185 U. S. 373, 387; <em>Oregon v. Hitchcock, </em>202 U. S. 60; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>106 U. S. 196, 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u201c If whether a suit is one against a State is to be determined, not by the fact of the party named\u2019 as defendant on the record; but by the result of the judgment or decree which may be\"' entered, the same rule must apply to the United States. The question whether the United States is a party to a controversy is not determined by the merely nominal party on the record butuby the question of the effect of the judgment or decree' which can be entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">In the present c\u00e1se the parties defendant other than the United States and its officers are Creek Indian allottees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>persons claiming under them, .and if their allotments should be taken from them, which is part of the relief sought by the bill, the United States would be subject to a demand from them for the value thereof or for other lands,.while the'bill prays in the alternative that \u201cin the event that from any equitable considerations the court should entertain the view that the allottees and those claiming under them should not be disturbed, then that an account be taken of the value of the. lands in controversy at the time of the respective allotments, and the defendants, the United States of America, be ordered, adjudged, and decreed to pay to your oratrix, as trustee, the-sum of such values.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">It does not follow that because a State may be sued by the United States without'its consent, therefore the United States may be sued by a State without its consent. Public policy \u25a0forbids that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>143 U. S. 621, 646, it was held that .the exercise by this court of original jurisdiction \u201cin a suit brought by one State against another to determine the boundary line' between them, or in\u2019 a' suit brought by the United States against a State to determine the boundary between a 'Territory of the United States and that State, so far from infringing, in. either case,\u2019 upon the sov\u00e9reignty, is ' with the consent of the State sued. Such consent was given by Texas when admitted into the Uni\u00f3n upon an equal footing in all respects'with the other States.\u201d That case was quoted from with approyal in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, supra, </em>where Mr. Justice- Brewer, delivering the opinion, pointed out that the judicial power of the United States extends to cases in which the United States is a party plaintiff as well as to cases in which it is a party defendant, for \u201cwhile the. United States 'as a.government may not be sued without its consent, yet with its conseht.it may be sued, and the judicial power of the United States\u2019extends to such a controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">,We are not dealing here with the merits of the controversy, raised by the bill, but solely with the question of the original' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>jurisdiction of' this court. : And as the United States'has not .consented to be sued, it results that, on this ground also the bill must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><em>And it is </em>so <em>ordered.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b371-5\">Me.
