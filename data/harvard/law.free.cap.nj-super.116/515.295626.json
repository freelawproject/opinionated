J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AVL\">Defendant Ulious Green was found guilty by a jury of assault and battery on a police officer <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:90-4), carrying a dangerous knife <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-41(c)), and threatening life <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:113-8). Defendant Jesse Green, who was tried at the same time, was found guilty of the first two charges and not guilty of the last. On February 25, 1970 Dlious was sentenced to New Jersey State Prison for terms of three to five years on each charge, all terms to run concurrently. Jesse was sentenced to Yardville Eeformatory for two concurrent indeterminate terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">In their appeal from the judgments of conviction, defendants contend:</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">(1) The trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury with regard to the charge of carrying a dangerous Imife was erroneous (not raised below).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">(2) The trial judge erred in not allowing defendants to testify as to whether or not the knives were a necessary tool in their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>(3) Defendant Jesse Green was unlawfully convicted of assault and battery on a police officer, under indictment 54-69. The verdict on that charge was improperly rendered and, therefore, all other verdicts rendered at the trial were thereby tainted.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">(4) The judge\u2019s charge on threatening to kill was erroneous (not raised below).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">(5) Defendant Ulious Green\u2019s sentence was illegal in that the judge considered prior arrests not followed by convictions in determining the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">There was testimony and other evidence at the trial from which the jury could make the following findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">On June 6, 1969 James Butler, a plain clothes security detective for Bamberger\u2019s, observed defendants enter the department store and purchase two shopping bags Butler and another detective, Smith, watched from the balcony as defendants put merchandise into their bags. When the two men left the store without paying, the detective pursued them.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Outside the store Butler flagged down an \u201cunmarked\u201d Newark police car. There were three officers in the car. Officer Hagel was driving, Engler was in the front seat and Reid was in the back. The two store detectives got in the car and they quickly overtook the two defendants who were standing on the corner waiting for a light to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Officer Engler \u2014 in plain clothes \u2014 got out of the ear with his badge drawn. He approached defendants and said, \u201cStop. I\u2019m a police officer, I want to talk to you.\u201d Defendants immediately fled in opposite directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Engler, along with Detective Smith, pursued Jesse. As Engler reached him, that defendant turned and struck the officer in the mouth. Engler than took out his \u201cslapper\u201d (blackjack) and struck Jesse once or twice. He wrestled him to the ground but the handcuffs jammed and the officer needed assistance to get Jesse back to the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Officer Hagel apprehended defendant Ulious Green and had him handcuffed and in the car. Hagel was driving with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Engler in the middle o\u00ed the front seat and Butler next to him. 'Reid was in the rear with the two prisoners. Jesse was bleeding. When ITlions saw this, he became enraged at Officer Engler. lie spat at the officer. When Engler turned around in his seat, Hlious leaned back, raised his feet and kicked him in the chest. The officers grabbed Ulious\u2019s feet and attempted to subdue him. According to Engler, Ulious shouted that \u201che was going to kill me. He said that no matter how long he spent in jail when he gets out he\u2019s going to kill me * * Engler also testified that Jesse said he was going to kill him.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">At police headquarters defendants were searched and pocket knives were found in their possession. Defendant continued to threaten Engler while they were at the precinct. The knives were identified and received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Both defendants testified. Jesse stated that he never struck Engler, but that when the officer caught him the officer immediately began to strike him with the \u201cslapper.\u201d He denied ever threatening Engler. Ulious also denied making the threats. He testified that when he saw Jesse he told him to press charges against Engler. Engler told him to \u201cshut up\u201d or he would \u201cgive him some.\u201d Ulious challenged Engler saying that if he hit him, he would spit on the officer. Engler struck him with the \u201cslapper\u201d and Ulious spat. Engler then hit him a number of times. Ulious, handcuffed, put up his feet to ward off the blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">After the usual summations, charge and submission to the jury, the jury returned its verdict. Defendants requested a poll. During the poll of the verdict of guilty as to Jesse Green for assault and battery on a police officer \u2014 the second poll \u2014 juror No. 8 made no response. The following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">THE COURT: What is your response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-d\">JUROR NO. 8: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOsP\">THE COURT: No what? That\u2019s not your verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALs\">JUROR NO. 8: No, it was not. Are we talking about the final verdict?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>THE COURT: We are talking about tbe verdict that\u2019s just been \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFX\">JUROR NO. 8: Excuse me. Wasn\u2019t it decided this was unanimous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmY4\">THE CLERK: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVV\">THE COURT: I want to know how did you vote. Did you vote in favor of being guilty, Jesse Green, with reference to Indictment 53 of the 1969 Term?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmZ\">JUROR NO. 8: This is before it became unanimous that the jury decided?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apo\">THE COURT: What is your vote? Do you vote in favor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS4y\">A JUROR: Now. Now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALR\">JUROR NO. 8: It was yes to make it unanimous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">THE COURT: Whether it be to make it unanimous or not, did you vote to find Jesse Green guilty of assault and battery on a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGV\">JUROR NO. 8: Yes, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-17\">Later the juror went and spoke with the trial judge. He told the defense attorney \u2014 who had moved for a new trial on the basis of the incident \u2014 and the prosecutor that \u201cin view of what she told me I think that this woman ought to be interrogated by you and by Mr. Wolf to decide whether or not this .defendant had been proved guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d During a hearing on the motion, the juror testified. She explained that she agreed with the guilty verdict, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-18\">Yes. You see, my \u201cno\u201d came because I thought first you asked for a unanimous verdict and that was yes; then when the attorney said, \u201cPoll the individual jurors,\u201d I considered that to mean \u201cBefore the ultimate verdict how were you thinking?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b538-20\">. The first question on appeal is this: Did the court err in its charge concerning possession of a dangerous knife?</p>\n<p id=\"b538-21\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:151-41(c) provides in part that anyone-who has in his possession a \u201cdagger, dirk, <em>dangerous knife </em>or knife as defined in chapter 5 of the laws of 1952 (C. 2A:151-62), stiletto * * * is guilty of a high misdemeanor.\u201d (Emphasis added). The trial judge in his charge mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>only the \u201cdangerous knife.\u201d He did not mention \u201cdagger, dirk * * * stiletto,\u201d words referrable to objects of the same class as \u201cdangerous knife,\u201d that is, <em>sui generis. Gf. Gei-mmn v. Mat\u00f1ss, 55 N. J. </em>193, 220 (1970). He added that \u201cdangerous knife\u201d uses for its meaning \u201cits common, everyday accepted connotation.\u201d He stated that it was for the jury to decide whether the State had proven that defendants had possession of a dangerous knife. The knives found in defendants\u2019 possession were received in evidence as exhibits and submitted to the jury for inspection. No requests to charge were made on this issue, nor were any objections made to this portion of the charge, as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Defendants contend that \u201cdangerous knife\u201d has a meaning other than its ordinary meaning, and that pocket knives cannot be included therein. They also maintain that no sufficient standard for a determination was supplied since the whole section of the statute was not read.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The determination of what is a \u201cdangerous knife\u201d was properly left for the jury. <em>State v. Horton, </em>98 <em>N. J. Super. 258 </em>(App. Div. 1967), certif. den. 51 <em>N. J. </em>393 (1968). <em>Cf. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th ed. 1951) 471. In <em>Horton </em>the defendant attacked the statute as unconstitutional on the ground that the term \u201cdangerous\u201d was too vague. The knife in that case was a folding pocket knife with a 4)4\" blade, and was 9\" long when opened. This court stated that when the term is viewed in the context of the entire statute it is obvious that the statute contemplates \u201ca knife dangerous to life or human safety; one by the use of which a fatal wound may probably or possibly be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>98 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 261. The trial judge had read the pertinent sections of the statute and the jury had the knife in front of them. It was for them to determine whether under the circumstances the knife was dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Defendants cite <em>People v. Forrest, </em>67 <em>Cal. </em>2d 478, 62 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>766, 432 <em>P. </em>2d 374 (Sup. Ct. 1967). That case is not on point. The court there was called upon to determine whether an oversized pen knife was a \u201cdagger or dirk.\u201d Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the blade did not lock in place the majority held that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Nor is <em>People v. </em>Cricuoli, 157 App. Div. 201, 141 <em>N. Y. S. </em>855 (App. Div. 1913), very strong authority for their contention. In that case the defendant had a razor in his possession. The statute had at the time of the offense proscribed \u201cdagger, dirk, and dangerous knife.\u201d Subsequently, but prior to trial, the statute was amended to include razors, stilettos, etc. The trial court had charged the new statute. The appellate court reversed. They found that the new inclusion showed a legislative intent that razors were not \u201cdangerous knives.\u201d Moreover, the charge of the new statute required a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The proscription of <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:151-41 first appeared in New Jersey in <em>L. </em>1924, <em>c. </em>137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">* * * Any person who shall carry any * * * dagger, dirk, <em>dangerous knife, </em>stiletto * * *. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In <em>L. </em>1966, <em>c. </em>60, this section was redefined and expanded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">* \u00ab * razor blades imbedded in wood slivers, daggers, dirk, <em>dangerous knife or knife as defined in chapter 5 of the laws of 1952 </em>( <em>O. 2A :151\u2014 62), stiletto * </em>* * [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The statute does not intend to catalogue all the weapons but merely lists under generic terms the common designation of those prohibited. <em>State v. </em>Witcher, 58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>464 (App. Div. 1959). There is nothing which would indicate that the. Legislature intended \u201cdangerous knife\u201d to mean other than its connotation in everyday parlance \u2014 a knife which could be used by the possessor as a weapon. There is nothing which would have led the jury to conclude that the knife must be other than one \u201cdangerous to life or human safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The trial judge should have read the whole statute to the jury, especially the list of other dangerous weapons, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>should have elaborated more fully on the meaning of \u201cdangerous knife\u201d by giving some guidelines or standards to the jury for reaching a proper conclusion. But such failure did not amount to \u201cplain error,\u201d <em>B. </em>2:10-2, which defendants were required to demonstrate where, as here, no objection was made to the charge and no request for further instruction was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">No argument is made that the knives in issue were not within the rule expounded in <em>State v. </em>Horton, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The next question to be answered is, Did the court err in refusing to permit defendants to testify that the knives were necessary for their work?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The determination of whether a knife is dangerous is dependent upon consideration of many factors. One of these is the instrument itself. But this cannot be taken alone; it must be viewed in light of all the circumstances, including its concealment. The fact that the instrument has been used in some lawful fashion at some other time is irrelevant to the determination. The \u201cconcealment\u201d of the weapon at the time of the incident constitutes an important factor of the offense, rather than its mere possession at some other time and place for a lawful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Did the confusion of juror No. 8 and the questioning by the trial judge mandate a new trial? This is the third question raised by defendants in their appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">In <em>Solar v. United </em>States, 86 <em>A. </em>2d 538 (D. C. Mun. Ct. App. 1952), a similar occurrence had taken place. There, however, the trial judge had entered the judgment of guilty and had never questioned the juror. In the instant case (although the inquiry may have been initiated by the juror or by the motion) a complete inquiry was made in accord with <em>State v. Schmelz, </em>17 <em>N. J. </em>227 (1955). It is clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>final discussion that the juror concurred in the final verdict and was merely confused during the poll. Defendants were not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Did the trial judge err in his charge on threatening to kill? Our conclusion is that there was no reversible error in this aspect of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">As conceded by defendants in their supplemental brief, this court held in <em>State v. Schultheis, </em>113 <em>N. J. Super. </em>11 (App. Div. 1971), that intent to carry out the threat is not an element of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>3A:113-8. That case also states, \u201cIt is necessary only that the threats impart the expectation of bodily harm or death, thereby inducing fear and apprehension in the person threatened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, citing <em>State v. Lizotte, </em>356 <em>A. </em>2d 439 (Me. Sup. Jud. Ct. 1969). In <em>Lizotte </em>the court specifically held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">It matters not whether the defendant had or had not the intention to carry out the threat. The essence of an oral threat is that it is a verbal act and if that act is of such a nature as to convey menace to an ordinary hearer, the statute is violated. No more does it matter whether or to what degree the threat engenders fear or intimidation in the intended victim. Some men are braver than others and less easily intimidated, [at 442]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">This is a sound rationale. Since Officer Engler\u2019s actual reaction was irrelevant there was no error in excluding testimony concerning it.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The final question for determination is, Did the court err in considering in a presentence report information concerning \u201carrests which were not followed by conviction?\u201d There is an indication that the trial judge \u201cconsidered\u201d these arrests in fixing Jesse Green\u2019s sentence. There is no evidence that the sentence was influenced thereby. A presentenee report is submitted to the sentencing judge in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to give him as clear a picture of defendant as is possible so that a proper sentence may be fixed. <em>Williams v. People of New York, </em>337 <em>U. S. </em>241, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (1949). Such reports are also \u201cintended to benefit the individual offender and lessen the severity of the penal laws. They were incident to the penological approach which sought, and still seeks, to tailor the sentence to the background and present circumstances of the offender along with the nature of his offense.\u201d <em>State v. Kunz, </em>55 <em>N. J. </em>128, 132 (1969). The judge can be aided only by being given as complete a picture as possible so long as the picture is accurate. There is no contention here that it is not. Compare <em>State v. Pohlable, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>242 (App. Div. 1960). Nor is there any indication that the judge was misled, mistook arrest for conviction, or this defendant was prejudiced in being given an indeterminate term. <em>Cf. Townsend v. Burke, </em>334 <em>U. S. </em>736, 68 S. Ct. 1252, 92 <em>L. Ed. </em>1690 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">While a sentencing judge may \u201cconsider\u201d the recital in a presentence report which refers to previous \u201carrests\u201d which did not result in \u201cconvictions,\u201d under no circumstances should the mere fact of an \u201carrest\u201d influence the imposition of sentence, since the most innocent person may be arrested. We are satisfied that in the instant case the concurrent terms meted out were not made greater by reason of the notation of arrests, especially in light of the record of convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We find no valid basis for a reversal of the judgments. Accordingly, the judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
