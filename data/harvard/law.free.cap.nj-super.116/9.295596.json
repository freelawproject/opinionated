J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Az\">Petitioner appeals from final judgments of the State Division of Tax Appeals, affirming deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ruinations of the Middlesex County Board of Taxation, upholding the 1967 assessed valuations fixed for local taxation by the municipal authorities of the Townships of Edison, Piscataway, Woodbridge and Borough of Carteret.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The property consists of pipelines of varying dimensions owned by Texas Eastern, to the extent of their footage in the respective municipalities. Some of these were used in combination with continuances thereof for the transmission of natural gas from Texas to the Mew York metropolitan area. Other pipelines of Texas Eastern in these New Jersey municipalities were \u201cidle,\u201d not being in active use.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Uo useful purpose would be served by a recital of the footage and dimensions of each particular kind of pipeline in each municipality; or when the pipelines were built; or the respective municipal assessed valuations. A common formula, known as the \u201cMiddlesex County Formula,\u201d because it had been approved and recommended for common use by the Middlesex County Assessors Association, had been employed by the respective local assessors in calculating values. The propriety and the correctness in the application of that formula are the main issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Two local assessors, one from South Plainfield and the other from South Brunswick, testified as to the \u201cMiddlesex County Formula.\u201d All the lines were appraised at their \u201chistorical cost,\u201d meaning the cost when the lines were built. The \u201cper foot cost\u201d was determined by dividing the cost of the \u201cspread\u201d of the pipeline in blew Jersey by the footage in the particular spread. There was deducted from cost 15% as a single, non-recurring depreciation factor. This was done to stabilize the annual valuations and thus avoid the need to recalculate true value from year to year. By way of exception, a 20% deduction in the historical cost was made in the case of the 20-ineh pipeline.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Applying this formula to the various lines, the 36-inch line\u2019s cost was fixed by the local assessors at $46 a foot and, with a 15% depreciation, true value per foot was determined to be $39.10. The 24-ineh pipeline\u2019s cost was set at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>$27 a foot and depreciated 15% to make it $22.95. The 20-inch line was valued at $16 a foot and applying the 20% depreciation factor was reduced to $12.80. The 12-inch line was valued at $10 a foot and then reduced 15% to $8.50. The 10-inch line, valued at $8 a foot, by similar deduction of 15%, became $6.80. The 8-inch line, valued at $6 a foot, was reduced by 15% to $5.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The idle 12-inch line was valued at $4.20 a foot since it was idle. The idle 10-inch line was valued at $3.40 a foot and the idle 8-inch line at $2.55. This represented 50% of the value of the active lines. The reason why these idle lines have not been in service is that the so-called \u201cBig and Little Inch\u201d pipelines were built for the transmission of oil from the Texas fields to New Jersey refineries during World War II, but thereafter they ceased to be useful for the transmission of oil to customers, because Texas Eastern does not have customers for <em>oil. </em>The company uses its pipelines for the transmission of <em>natural gas </em>to different customers. It admittedly owns the \u201cidle\u201d lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">By multiplying the per foot valuation of each kind of pipeline, determined as above, by the footage of each kind of pipeline in a particular municipality, the respective local assessors calculated the \u201ctrue value\u201d of the pipelines for local tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">All municipalities in Middlesex County are supposed to assess at a ratio of 50% of true value, according to a County Board directive. Belying upon that directive, each of the respondent municipalities fixed the \u201cassessed value\u201d of Texas Eastern\u2019s pipelines at 50% of \u201ctrue value,\u201d as calculated above. Texas Eastern had been so billed and had paid the taxes so determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Following a hearing before Judge Gotshalk in the State Division on June 2, 1969, the judge determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">There was not before me evidence of the <em>cost </em>of these lines from which X could make a positive finding of value * * *. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>By reason thereof, the judge felt \u201ccompelled to affirm the finding of the County Board as to true value * * Ac-</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">cordingly, Texas Eastern\u2019s appeals were dismissed and the County Board\u2019s valuations were affirmed by judgments of the State Division entered on December 5, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u201cThe settled rule is that there is a presumption that an assessment made by the proper authority is correct and the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to show otherwise. * * * the presumption stands until sufficient competent evidence is adduced to prove a true valuation different from the \u25a0 assessment. Such evidence must be definite, positive and certain in quality and quantity to overcome the presumption.\u201d <em>Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. City of Newark, </em>10 <em>N. J. </em>99, 105 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">On appeal to the county board, \u201cthere exists a presumption in favor of the <em>quantum </em>of the tax assessment made by the local taxing authority and the burden is on the taxpayer to prove otherwise. * * * It has also been held that a similar presumption attaches to the judgment of the county board on the appeal to the Division of Tax Appeals.\u201d <em>Riverview Gardens Section One v. North Arlington Borough, </em>9 <em>N. J. </em>167, 174-175 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">As noted above, the taxpayer\u2019s appeals to the Division from the judgments of the County Board were dismissed on the ground that there was no evidence before the Division of the \u201ccost\u201d of these lines from which a finding of value could be made. On the contrary, the \u201chistorical cost\u201d of the pipelines constituted part of the very formula applied by the local assessors in calculating \u201ctrue value.\u201d We have set forth above the per foot cost of each kind of pipe, as used by the local assessors in deciding first \u201ctrue value\u201d and thereafter diminishing it by the 50% county ratio to arrive at \u201cassessed value.\u201d The testimony of witnesses, Prothro, Linger and Renk, produced by Texas Eastern, and the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ventories and tax bills introduced as petitioner\u2019s Exhibits P-2, P-3, P-4 and P-5 established without contradiction both the details of the \u201cMiddlesex County Formula\u201d and their use in computing the contested assessments. Judge Gotshalk also made specific factual findings as to the \u201ccost\u201d figures in the early part of his opinion, as set forth herein <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Presuming the correctness of these \u201ccost\u201d figures used by the local assessors in their computations and the correctness of the footage of each kind of pipe in their respective municipalities, wo find that the depreciation percentage, rather than \u201ccost,\u201d presented the real basic issue. The local assessors reduced the \u201ccost\u201d figures by 15% as to all pipelines, except the 20-inch lines, and depreciated the cost of those lines by 20% to arrive at \u201ctrue value.\u201d This was in accordance with the \u201cMiddlesex County Formula,\u201d recommended by the unofficial Middlesex County Assessors Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">On the contrary, as shown by the evidence, the New Jersey Assessors Association, also an unofficial body, had recommended on a state-wide basis a standard depreciation deduction from historical cost of 4-5%, continuing the resultant value from year to year. So, too, there was proof that the Federal Power Commission, which exercises control over these interstate natural gas transmission companies, had limited to 3% the annual depreciation deduction, as opposed to the constant 15% or 45% recommended by the County and State associations, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Moreover, in an analogous set of appeals by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, involving similar pipelines in these same respondent municipalities and others in New Jersey, heard by Judge Gotshalk in the State Division on March 3, 19C9, prior to the Division\u2019s hearing the instant appeals, the Federal Power Commission\u2019s 3% depreciation was used as a factor, <em>inter alia, </em>in determining those appeals. As noted above, the Transcontinental judgments were entered in the Division on August 28, 1969, more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>three months before entry of the December 5, 1969 judgments in this Texas Eastern case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">We heard contemporaneously the municipalities\u2019 appeals in the Transcontinental case and the pipeline company\u2019s cross-appeal (Docket Wo. A-190-69) and the instant appeal by Texas Eastern. We feel that the same standards ought to be applied to both taxpayers by these same municipalities, common issues being involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The pipeline company taxpayer and the municipalities agree, as does the State Division, that the ordinary rule for determining true value for purposes of taxation is not applicable here. Judge Gotshalk recognized this when he said in his opinion, in referring to the great difficulties in assessing the value of pipelines, \u201cour willing buyer and willing seller theory cannot be applied to a pipeline in Wew Jersey or in any particular municipality.\u201d He advocated that pipelines should be subject to State taxation, not local assessment, with money returned to the municipalities \u201cin the same method as other utility taxes, such as Second Class Railroads are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\"> We agree that the ordinary theory of value, \u201cwhat a willing buyer would pay a willing seller,\u201d is not applicable to mere segments of a pipeline which extends from Texas to Wew York. The application of an \u201chistorical cost\u201d minus \u201cdepreciation\u201d to arrive at \u201ctrue value\u201d is a reasonable approach. The parties seemingly agree. \u201cHistorical cost\u201d is used because these utility companies, under regulation by the Eederal Power Commission, are required to set up in their books the original investment cost as the basis for the limited percentage income thereon to which they are subjected. They may not increase that figure on their books, even though economic conditions may have brought about an increase in the value of things. At the same time, these utility companies are limited by federal regulations to an annual depreciation of 3% in the historical cost figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The State Division applied that 3% depreciation factor against historical cost in the Transcontinental appeal. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>that extent, we are in accord and would apply that formula basically to the facts herein. We would, however, as hereinafter noted, limit the period of depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\"> We find, too, that assessing the \u201cidle\u201d lines at 50% of the value of the lines in use is not unreasonable. The taxpayer urges that the assessment should be only nominal. We do not agree. The mere inutility of property does not justify making it tax-exempt, or almost so. A non-user of land or of structures and improvements thereon does not reduce the taxable value of the land or of the structures or improvements. An unoccupied home is none the less taxable. Taxpayers are wont to demolish structures on land to remove them from the tax rolls. Here, the pipeline company still has a potential use of the oil pipelines now idle. Lack of functional use has been recognized by the local assessors by the 50% deduction in value. We are not persuaded that a reduction to nominal value of the idle lines is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We do not subscribe to the State Division\u2019s use of a <em>25% </em>\u201cappreciation\u201d in the cost, because of rising economic conditions, as was done in the Transcontinental case. These utility companies are limited by federal regulations to a fixed rate of income (6.50%) and that rate is based on \u201chistoric cost.\u201d So, too, the depreciation is limited by the E. P. C. to 3% of the same historic cost and is not based on any \u201cappreciation\u201d in the cost resulting from rising values. So restricted, it would be inconsistent and unfair to add a 25% appreciation factor in deciding true value for tax assessment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The 15% depreciation constant deduction from cost, recommended by the Middlesex County Assessors Assoeia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>tion, and the 45% deduction recommended by the State Association, are not devoid of all merit. They would produce a single value, usable from year to year, without the need for annual change to take care of ever-increasing depreciation and obsolescence. Obviously, developing technical improvements in the quality, size and functioning of these pipelines will render the present pipelines obsolete. They will probably be replaced by newer and better pipes, longer lasting, less subject to corrosion and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The 3% depreciation fixed by federal regulation for the existing pipelines is seemingly based on an approximate 30-year functional life-span. Apportioning depreciation over an entire life-span at the inception of the period, for once and for all, would require a depreciation of approximately 40 to 50%, as testified to by the taxpayer\u2019s witness, Broley E. Travis, a consulting valuation engineer since 1962. This simply means that you apply the depreciation percentage at the approximate median point of the functional life and apply it from beginning to end. The net result balances the over-percentage for half of the years against the under-percentage for the other half of the years. It would produce a common percentage throughout the life-span, as contrasted with the ever-increasing percentage, where a figure of 3% for the first year becomes higher with each passing year. We find the Division\u2019s use of the 3% annual and ever-increasing annual percentage of depreciation, authorized by the Eederal Power Commission, a common method employed in business, reasonable, consistent with everyday realities and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We next consider the taxpayer\u2019s claim of discrimination. Judge Gotshalk found that Piscataway and Carteret, for the year 1967, were adhering to the 50% county ratio. As to Edison, its ratio was 41% and he applied it in the Transcontinental case. As to Woodbridge, the judge found a 37% ratio should be applied. Ye.t, he doubted his need of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>plication of those ratios herein only because \u201cthere was no finding by me of value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Yet, the \u201cvalues\u201d fixed by the local assessors and approved by the County Board were adopted by the State Division. Without applying the true ratios of 41% and 37% applied respectively by Edison and Woodbridge to other properties in their townships, discrimination was effected against Texas Eastern. This is especially obvious when we consider that the State Division applied those lower ratios to the true values of Transcontinental\u2019s pipelines, while upholding the higher 50% of true value as to Texas Eastern\u2019s pipelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The municipalities argue that the taxpayer did not adequately prove the common level or average ratio. The judge\u2019s finding of the reduced ratios in the Transcontinental case should be equally applied to Texas Eastern. Fairness mandates that the ratio applied to Texas Eastern should not be higher than that applied to the other taxpayers of these two municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">One difficulty with the 3% depreciation method lies in the potentiality that, unless checked at some point, the cost figure minus the ever-increasing depreciation figure can become zero. In Transcontinental, depreciation at 3% over a IG-year period has reached 48%. It would be unrealistic to continue this item unlimitedly to a point where theoretically the pipelines would have no value and would, in effect, be tax exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Our concern is with the 1967 valuations. The issue of allowing further depreciation beyond the 48% figure has not been determined or briefed on this appeal. Accordingly, we make no determination as to the point when further depreciation should stop. As suggested by the State Division, the valuation of these pipelines should be considered by the Legislature and a suitable state-wide formula enacted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>universal guidance throughout the State. We are in accord with this suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The State Division\u2019s affirmance of the County Board\u2019s judgments is reversed. The local assessments for the purpose of taxing Texas Eastern pipelines will be calculated by taking the historical cost of each bind of pipeline, as per the figures noted above; then deducting 3% per annum cumulatively but not exceeding 48% pending clarifying legislation or a more suitable record than that before us, and after that, applying the particular municipal ratio used in assessing other properties in the municipality. \u201cIdle\u201d pipelines will be assessed at 50% of active pipelines. The 25% \u201cappreciation\u201d factor will not be added.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The matter is remanded to the State Division for a recalculation of the 1967 assessed valuations consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
