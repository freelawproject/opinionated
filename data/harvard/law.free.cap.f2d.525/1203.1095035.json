School Commissioners of Mobile County, </em>402 U.S. 33, 37, 91 S.Ct. 1289, 1292, 28 L.Ed.2d 577 (1971), requiring \u201cevery effort to achieve the greatest possible degree of actual desegregation, taking into account the practicalities of the situation\u201d and the rule of <em>United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education, </em>372 F.2d 836 (5th Cir. 1966), <em>affirmed en banc </em>380 F.2d 385, 389 (1967), that \u201cpublic schools in this circuit have the affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to bring about an integrated, unitary school system in which there are no Negro schools and no white schools \u2014 just schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-28\">These assertions are inaccurate. This panel could not and does not depart from prior precedents. It would blink reality and authority, however, to hold the Atlanta School System to be nonunitary because further racial integration is theoretically possible and we expressly decline to do so. <em>See Carr v. Montgomery County Board of Education, </em>D.C., 377 F.Supp. 1123, <em>affirmed </em>511 F.2d 1374 (5th Cir.), <em>rehearing and rehearing en banc denied </em>511 F.2d at 1390 (June 27, 1975), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 96 S.Ct. 394, 46 L.Ed.2d 303 (Nov. 17, 1975). We also judicially notice the corresponding declaration of unitary status by Judge Herbert W. Christenberry relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>to the Orleans Parish School System. <em>Bush v. Orleans Parish School Board, </em>Civ.Ac.No. 3630 (E.D.La., August 22, 1975).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
