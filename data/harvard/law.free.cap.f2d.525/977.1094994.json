Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1046-18\">DYER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1046-19\">Appellants are husband and wife who brought suit under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against defendant police officer Thaler, and the City of Brenham, Thaler\u2019s employer. The gravaman of the complaint is that Thaler\u2019s fatal shooting of appellants\u2019 son while he was attempting to flee from a burglary was an unconstitutional deprivation of their son\u2019s life. Appellants seek monetary damages for the loss of their son, a declaratory judgment that the old Texas justifiable homicide statute, V.T.C.A., Penal Code, Art. 1222, under which Thaler acted,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is unconstitutional, and an injunction against the enforcement of Art. 1222. The district court dismissed the action against the City of Brenham on the authority of <em>City of Kenosha v. Bruno, </em>1973, 412 U.S. 507, 93 S.Ct. 2222, 37 L.Ed.2d 109. It later granted defendant Thaler\u2019s motion for summary judgment, on the grounds that (1) defendant Thaler\u2019s good faith reliance on the constitutionality of Article 1222 precluded an award of monetary damages under Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>tion 1983,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) declaratory relief<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>is unavailable because (a) there is no case or controversy between the parties and (b) Article 1222 has been replaced by V.T.C.A., Penal Code \u00a7 9.42<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> so that declaratory relief with respect to Article 1222 would be without significance. Appellants challenge the dismissal of the City and the denial of declaratory relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Although appellants argue the constitutionality of both the old and new Texas justifiable homicide statutes, that issue is not before us. Since we agree that <em>Kenosha </em>required dismissal of the action against the City of Brenham, the sole question is the propriety of declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">A declaratory judgment may only be issued in the case of an \u201cactual controversy.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2201. That is, under the facts alleged, there must be a substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy and reality between parties having adverse legal interests. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>1941, 312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 85 L.Ed. 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-12\">No such controversy exists here. Once Thaler is absolved from liability for damages under Section 1983, his interest in the constitutionality of Article 1222 is no different than appellants or any other citizen of the state of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-13\">Nor is there any immediacy or reality to the alleged controversy. Article 1222 has been supplanted. A declaratory judgment with respect to its constitutionality would be pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-14\">Appellants rely heavily on <em>Mattis v. Schnarr, </em>8 Cir. 1974, 502 F.2d 588. On similar facts save one, the <em>Mattis </em>court held that defendant police officers had a sufficient adverse interest because (1) a declaratory judgment would define their rights and powers as police officers and (2) they have an interest in assuring that the law governing their official conduct is clear so that they may perform their duties in a constitutional manner. <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">The distinguishing fact is fatal to reliance on <em>Mattis: </em>the Texas law has been amended. Therefore, neither basis offered by <em>Mattis </em>creates the necessary \u201cactual controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">. Texas law provides that a death action may be brought on behalf of a child by parents within 3 months of the death or thereafter by the executor or administrator of the deceased, V.A.T.S., art. 4675, and that a cause of action survives the death of a person, V.A.T.S., art. 5525. Under these circumstances, appellants have standing under Section 1983. <em>Brazier v. Cherry, </em>5 Cir. 1961, 293 F.2d 401. <em>See Mattis v. Schnarr, </em>8 Cir. 1974, 502 F.2d 588, 590.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">.

Theis, \u201cGood Faith\u201d as a Defense to Suits for Police Deprivation of Individual Rights, 59 Minn.L.R. 991, 1011, 1025 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">.
