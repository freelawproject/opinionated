Lugo contends that the sentence was unreasonable because the court failed to consider that he committed the offense in order to pay for his 15-year old daughter\u2019s birthday party or that he has not been convicted of a crime since 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Lugo did not argue in the district court that his sentence was unreasonable. Nor did he argue that the motive for his offense should affect the sentence he received. Therefore, his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 390-93 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">The district court committed no procedural error at sentencing. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Moreover, the district court addressed the nature and circumstances of Lugo\u2019s offense, the seriousness of his offense, and the need to deter him from additional crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (2). The district court also considered the guideline range and any policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4) <em>&amp; </em>(5). Thus, Lugo has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was an abuse of discretion that constituted error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
