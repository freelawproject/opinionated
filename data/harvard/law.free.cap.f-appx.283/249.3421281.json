He contends that the district court failed to give an adequate explanation of its application of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>(2007). The Government contends that this claim should be reviewed for plain error due to Rodriguez-Ramirez\u2019s failure to object to the lack of reasons in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Rodriguez-Ramirez has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. His 50-month sentence was within the applicable guideline range and therefore is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness on appeal. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>see also United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Further, because the district court imposed a sentence within the guideline range, a lengthy explanation of the sentence was not required. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Rodriguez-Ramirez does not argue that the district court improperly calculated the applicable guideline range. Although the district court did not offer explicit reasons for the 50-month sentence, the record reflects that the district court considered the evidence and arguments presented by Rodriguez-Ramirez; and that the court found that Rodriguez-Ramirez\u2019s circumstances did not warrant a different sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 2469. Rodriguez-Ramirez fails to show any error that is clear or obvious. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). Additionally, he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness by showing that the court\u2019s failure to give explicit reasons affected his substantial rights or called into question the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
