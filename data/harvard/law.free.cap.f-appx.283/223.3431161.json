Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Diaz\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, Diaz\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th C\u00ede. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
