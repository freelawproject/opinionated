Wilkins argues that the district court clearly erred in denying him a two-level minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. He contends that the adjustment was warranted because he was a mere courier who was less culpable than other participants in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Whether a defendant is a minor or minimal participant is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant. An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Wilkins a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, 885 F.2d </em>243, 245 (5th Cir. 1989); <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
