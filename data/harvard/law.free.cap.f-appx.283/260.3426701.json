California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Toribio has filed a response. The record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration at this time of Toribio\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel; such claims generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when [they have] not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th <em>Cir.2000) </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Toribio\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>sponsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b286-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
