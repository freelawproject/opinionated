On appeal, Mills argues that the court erred in denying relief on her disparate treatment claim and in finding that she failed to adequately allege a disparate impact claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-25\">This court reviews de novo a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. <em>Moore Bros. v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 717, 722 (4th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there are no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Evans v. Technologies Applications &amp; Serv. Co., </em>80 F.3d 954, 958 (4th Cir.1996). In order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>withstand a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must produce competent evidence sufficient to reveal the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Greensboro Prof'l Fire Fighters </em>Ass<em>\u2019n v. City of Greensboro, </em>64 F.3d 962, 967 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">We have reviewed the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the materials submitted in the joint appendix, and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
