Snowden filed a complaint alleging that he was demoted after he complained to his supervisor and the City Council that an employee had used a racial slur at work. Snowden argues that the district court erred in granting the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his retaliation claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the City\u2019s articulated reasons for demoting him, that he failed to improve communication with his staff and that the City\u2019s right-of-ways deteriorated under his management, are a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-20\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards utilized by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>court. <em>S.E.C. v. Adler, </em>137 F.3d 1325, 1332 (11th Cir.1998). Summary judgment is only proper if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the non-moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating \u201cagainst any of his employees ... because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a); <em>Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, -, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2410, 2412, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (noting that the anti-retaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on their conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework, a plaintiff relying on circumstantial evidence to support a claim first must show an inference of discriminatory intent, and thus carries the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>see Wright v. Southland Corp., </em>187 F.3d 1287, 1305 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analytic framework applies to retaliation claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Once a plaintiff has established a <em>prim.a facie </em>case, the employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir. 2001). If the employer proffers such an explanation, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to prove that the defendant\u2019s explanation is merely a pretext. <em>Lubetsky v. Applied Card Sys., Inc., </em>296 F.3d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir.2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">To show that the employer\u2019s reasons were pretextual, the plaintiff must demonstrate \u201csuch weaknesses, implausibilities,</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Jackson v. State of Alabama State Tenure Comm\u2019n, </em>405 F.3d 1276, 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations and citations omitted). If \u201cthe proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it, and the employee cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason,\u201d or showing that the decision was based on erroneous facts. <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) (quotations and citations omitted). A claimant cannot establish pretext by simply demonstrating facts that suggest retaliatory animus but must specifically respond to the explanation of the defendant. <em>Crawford v. City of Fairburn, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 495, 169 L.Ed.2d 340 (2007). Importantly, the pretext inquiry is concerned with the employer\u2019s perception of the employee\u2019s performance, not the employee\u2019s own beliefs. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir.1997) (holding that when an employer produces negative performance reviews, an employee\u2019s assertion of his own good performance is insufficient to defeat summary judgment). To show pretext, the plaintiff must show that the movant\u2019s explanation is both false <em>\u201cand </em>that discrimination was the real reason\u201d for the decision. <em>Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006); <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">After concluding that Snowden had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the district court properly concluded that Snowden failed to show that the City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>articulated reasons for demoting him were false. Specifically, evidence showed that Snowden\u2019s supervisors had consistently and repeatedly expressed concerns regarding Snowden\u2019s communication skills and his supervisors were dissatisfied with the maintenance of the City\u2019s right-of-ways. Moreover, although Snowden presented evidence that the City\u2019s mayor and his supervisors wanted him removed from his position and, indeed, made and instituted plans to that effect, he did not present evidence which rebutted their stated, legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for his demotion. Because Snowden did not demonstrate that the City\u2019s articulated, legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for demoting him were a pretext for retaliation, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b720-13\">. The district court also granted summary judgment to the City on Snowden\u2019s claims of race discrimination under Title VII and age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 622. Snow-den conceded below that he could not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in either instance and does not challenge the entry of summary judgment as to these claims on appeal. Accordingly, any issue in this respect is abandoned. <em>See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 </em>F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (holding that arguments not raised on appeal are deemed abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
