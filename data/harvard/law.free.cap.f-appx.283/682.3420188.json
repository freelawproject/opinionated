We earlier affirmed the summary judgment in favor of Walt Disney World Company and against Anesh Gupta\u2019s complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>of employment discrimination, <em>Gupta v. Walt Disney World Co., </em>256 Fed.Appx. 279 (11th Cir.2007), but Gupta now appeals the denial of his motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal regarding the taxation of costs against him. Gupta challenges the denial of his motion for an extension on two grounds: (1) Gupta established excusable neglect, see Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(ii); and (2) the district court should have treated Gupta\u2019s motion as a motion to reopen the time to file an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). Although the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied relief under Rule 4(a)(5), we vacate and remand for the district court to consider whether Gupta is entitled to relief under Rule 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">A party in a civil case must file a notice of appeal \u201cwithin 30 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered\u201d to invoke the jurisdiction of the appellate court. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Grant, </em>256 F.3d 1146, 1150 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cThe timely filing of a notice of appeal is a mandatory prerequisite to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Grant, </em>256 F.3d at 1150 (quoting <em>United States v. Ward, </em>696 F.2d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Ordinarily, \u201c[l]ack of notice of the entry by the clerk\u201d does not affect the time to appeal or authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time allowed, Fed. R.Civ. P. 77(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">There are two ways that a late filing may be excused. A district court may extend the time to appeal if the party establishes \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d to justify the late filing. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(ii). The district court may also reopen the time to file an appeal if \u201cthe court finds that the moving party did not receive notice ... of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed[.]\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6)(A). We review the decision by the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, </em>130 F.3d 996, 997 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to extend the time for Gupta to appeal, under Rule 4(a)(5). To determine whether to extend the time for filing a notice of appeal, a district court must \u201c[tjake account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party\u2019s omission,\u201d and consider, among other factors, the \u201creason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.\u201d <em>Advanced Estimating Sys. v. Riney, </em>77 F.3d 1322, 1325 (11th Cir.1996) (quoting from <em>Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick </em>Assoc. <em>Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1498, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court was forced to resolve conflicting evidence to reach its decision and reasonably balanced the above factors to reach its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Gupta alleged in his August 28, 2007, motion for an extension of time that he did not receive a copy of the amended bill of costs and \u201cwas informed\u201d on August 27, 2007, that the \u201cClerk of the Court ... forgot to mail the [amended bill of costs][,]\u201d but the record contained evidence that Gupta received notice of the July 9, 2007, entry of judgment. Gupta received a copy of the order of July 5, 2007, 2007 WL 2002454, in which the district court directed the clerk to \u201center an Amended Bill of Costs [in] the amount of $6,395.84\u201d and attached a copy of the order to his July 18, 2007, motion to stay the proceedings. An electronic receipt states that the clerk mailed a copy of the amended bill of costs to Gupta on July 9, 2007, to the mailing address listed on Gupta\u2019s pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The district court had \u201csome range of choice\u201d when it concluded that Gupta was not entitled to extend the time to appeal. <em>Advanced Estimating Sys., </em>77 F.3d at 1325 (citing <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 745 (11th Cir.1989)). The record suggested that Gupta received notice of the amended bill of costs and the district court had already reviewed and reduced the bill of costs. In this circumstance, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Gupta\u2019s motion for an extension of time. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cPrimary importance should be accorded to the absence of prejudice to the nonmoving party and to the interest of efficient judicial administration.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Although the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Gupta relief under Rule 4(a)(5), the record is unclear whether the district court considered Gupta\u2019s motion under Rule 4(a)(6). Rule 4(a)(6) allows a district court to reopen the time to file an appeal if the movant did not receive notice of the entry of judgment. The record established that the clerk used the same mailing address to notify Gupta of the entry of judgment on April 11, 2007, and July 9, 2007, and Gupta alleged that he did not receive notice of the entry of either judgment. The district court stated that Gupta had failed to establish good cause or excusable neglect, which is relevant under Rule 4(a)(5), but the district court did not mention the standard applied under Rule 4(a)(6). Because \u201cwe have a duty to liberally construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s assertions to discern whether jurisdiction to consider his motion can be founded on a legally justifiable base[,]\u201d we remand the case to the district court to consider whether to grant Gupta relief under Rule 4(a)(6). <em>Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 187 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Fernandez v. United States, </em>941 F.2d 1488, 1491 (11th Cir.1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We AFFIRM the denial of Gupta\u2019s motion under Rule 4(a)(5), but otherwise VACATE the denial of Gupta\u2019s motion and REMAND for further consideration under Rule 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
