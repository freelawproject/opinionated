We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Kilgore v. United States Gov\u2019t, </em>No. 0:08-cv-00506-HFF, 2008 WL 759325 (D.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>filed Mar. 20 &amp; entered Mar. 21, 2008). We further deny Kilgore\u2019s motion to amend/correct caption, deny as moot his motions for stay pending appeal and for bail or release pending appeal, and grant his motion to amend his informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
