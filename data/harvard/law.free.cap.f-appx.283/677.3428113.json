He argues that the district court erred in enhancing his base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2006) predicated on a previous Texas conviction for burglary of a vehicle. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b703-27\">The investigation prior to Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s sentencing hearing revealed the following: A Texas highway patrol officer had observed a vehicle being driven without a registration tag. When the officer pulled the vehicle over, the driver had said that he did not have a driver\u2019s license, but had handed the officer a Tennessee identification card issued in the name of Arturo Navarrete. A check of the identification card revealed that the person to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>card had been issued had also been issued a driver\u2019s license, but when the officer asked the driver if his name was really Arturo Navarrete, he stated that his name was actually Juan Manuel Monteroso. During a later interview with the driver, it became clear that the driver\u2019s true identity was Juan Carlos Alfaro-Gramajo. The officer also determined that Alfaro-Gramajo had been deported in 2005 and had reentered the United States without authorization. !</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In calculating the proper guideline sentence, the probation office assigned Alfaro-Gramajo a base offense level of eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). It then applied an eight-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), because it determined that Alfaro-Gramajo had been convicted of an aggravated felony in Texas: burglary of a vehicle. The subtraction of three levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b), resulted in a total offense level of 13. Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s criminal history category was VI. This gave him a guideline range of 33 to 41 months of imprisonment. The probation office recommended a sentence of 37 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Alfaro-Gramajo objected to the eight-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), arguing that his state conviction for burglary of a vehicle was not an aggravated felony. At the sentencing hearing, the district court heard arguments on whether burglary of a vehicle was an aggravated felony. Alfaro-Gramajo, citing Ninth Circuit caselaw, argued that the offense was not an aggravated felony. The government responded that the offense was a crime of violence because it involved a substantial risk that physical force might be used against the person or property of another. The government further argued that the 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a)(l)(A) ought to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The government also submitted into evidence the indictment related to the Texas offense. The indictment charged that Alfaro-Gramajo \u201cdid unlawfully, knowingly and intentionally break into and enter a vehicle, without the effective consent of ... the owner thereof, with the intent to commit theft[.]\u201d R.Exh., Gov. 1; R4-I at 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then rescheduled the sentencing proceeding so that it could consider the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">When the proceeding resumed two weeks later, the court determined that the eight-level enhancement did apply because Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s offense fit the definition of aggravated felony. The court noted that \u201cyou can weave your way through the various sections and subsections and get back to that definition in more ways than one.\u201d R4-II at 5. However, the court refused to apply the 16-level enhancement because the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the purpose of that enhancement required that the charged offense include the use of violence as an element of the offense, and the Texas statute at issue did not do so. <em>Id. </em>After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court sentenced Alfaro-Gramajo to 37 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">On appeal, Alfaro-Gramajo argues that burglary of a vehicle does not constitute an aggravated felony for the purpose of the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(c) because it is neither an attempted theft offense nor a crime of violence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether a prior conviction qualifies for enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b). <em>United States v. Llanos-Agostadero, </em>486 F.3d 1194, 1196 (11th Cir.2007) (per curiam). We may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that finds support in the record. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a base offense level of eight if a defendant alien has been convicted of unlawfully reentering the United States. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). \u201cIf the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after ... a conviction for an aggravated felony,\u201d that base is increased by eight levels. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). The application notes for this section define \u201caggravated felony\u201d as having \u201cthe meaning given that term in ... 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">A. <em>Theft or Attempted Theft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, includes in the definition of aggravated felony \u201ca theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year,\u201d and also includes an attempt or conspiracy to commit such an offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G), (U). Because Congress did not define the terms \u201ctheft offense\u201d or \u201cburglary offense,\u201d courts define them in \u201cthe generic sense in which the term[s are] now used in the criminal codes of most States.\u201d <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (interpreting the term \u201cburglary\u201d for the purpose of applying 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">The Supreme Court has held that, in determining whether a prior state offense qualifies as a predicate offense in a criminal enhancement statute, courts generally must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense. This categorical approach, however, may permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of [the] generic [offense].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-12\"><em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, -, 127 S.Ct. 815, 818, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007) (observing that, for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, \u201c[i]n determining whether a conviction ... falls within the scope of a listed offense <em>(e.g., </em>\u201ctheft offense\u201d), the lower courts uniformly have applied the approach ... set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States </em>\u201d). If the state statute includes additional conduct that does not meet the elements of the generic offense in the enhancement statute, then sentencing courts can look at the charging documents and jury instructions to show that the defendant was actually convicted of the generic offense. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143 at 2160. This holding now extends to convictions following guilty pleas. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 19, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1259, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). In such cases, to determine whether the offense of conviction is included in the generic offense triggering an enhancement, courts may consider the charging document, plea agreement, and plea colloquy transcript or other comparable record establishing the factual basis for the plea. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We have confirmed that the basic elements of a generic theft offense include a \u201ctaking of property\u201d with \u201ccriminal intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.\u201d <em>Jaggernauth v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1353 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (quotations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Vasquez-Flores, </em>265 F.3d 1122, 1125 (10th Cir.2001); <em>Hernandez-Mancilla v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1002, 1009 (7th Cir.2001). Similarly, we have recognized that the \u201cbasic elements of an attempt are (1) an intent to engage in criminal conduct and (2) conduct constituting a \u2018substantial step\u2019 towards the commission of the substantive offense which strongly corroborates the defendant\u2019s criminal intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Collins, </em>779 F.2d 1520, 1533 (11th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The Texas statute under which Alfaro-Gramajo was convicted provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u00a7 30.04 Burglary of Vehicles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">(a) A person commits an offense if, without the effective consent of the owner, he breaks into or enters a vehicle or any part of a vehicle with intent to commit any felony or theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">(b) For purposes of this section, \u201center\u201d means to intrude:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">(1) any part of the body; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">(2) Any physical object connected with the body.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">(c) An offense under this section is a felony of the third degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.04 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">To be convicted of burglary of a vehicle in violation of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.04, Alfaro-Gramajo must have had \u201cthe intent to commit any felony or theft.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Thus, the statute alone does not tell us whether Alfaro-Gramajo had the intent to commit a theft or the intent to commit some other felony. However, the Texas charging document clarifies that Alfaro-Gramajo \u201c[broke] into and enterfed]\u201d a vehicle \u201cwith the intent to commit theft.\u201d R.Exh., Gov. 1; <em>see Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160; <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1263. The issue, therefore, is whether breaking into and entering a vehicle with the intent to commit theft constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">Because Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.04 does not include the element of a taking, we find that it is not a theft offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>See Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1353. However, Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s conviction under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.04 required both the intent to commit a theft and the breaking into and entering of an automobile, which constituted a substantial step toward committing a theft. Thus, Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s prior offense qualifies as an attempted theft under the categorical approach of <em>Taylor, </em>which compares the elements of the offense of conviction with a generic definition of the offense listed in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), in this case an attempted theft offense under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and (U).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160; <em>Collins, </em>779 F.2d at 1533. Accordingly, it constitutes an aggravated felony for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>purpose of a \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">B. <em>Crime of Violence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Even if Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s conviction for burglary of a vehicle did not constitute an attempted theft for purposes of \u00a7 1101(a)(4S), the INA definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d also includes \u201ccrime[s] of violence,\u201d incorporating the definition from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). In relevant part, that section defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any offense \u201cthat is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Alfaro-Gramajo argues that burglary of a vehicle is not a crime of violence because the broad construction Texas courts have given the offense means that it often involves no physical force against the property of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The Supreme Court has explained that the \u201csubstantial risk\u201d in 16(b) refers to the intentional use of force, not to the possible effect of a person\u2019s conduct. <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 11, 125 S.Ct. 377, 383, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (in the context of a DUI offense). We have further clarified that the issue of determining whether an offense is a crime of violence is a \u201ccategorical question, and is thus not dependent upon the specific facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>399 F.3d 1297, 1301-02 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (interpreting crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. 3156(a)(4)(B) which has a definition similar to that in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">On its face, the plain language of 16(b) encompasses Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.04, which proscribes breaking into, or entering, a vehicle with the intent to commit a theft or felony. Breaking into a vehicle, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the property of another. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s argument that the Texas courts have construed the statute too broadly for it to be considered a crime of violence is unpersuasive. The cases cited by Alfaro-Gramajo show that Texas courts have interpreted the statute within the plain meaning of its terms. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. State, </em>919 S.W.2d 810, 814 (Tex.Ct. App.1996) (holding a car was broken into or entered when defendant reached in through the open window of a car). However, to qualify under \u00a7 16(b), the offense need not always require physical force against the property of another, but rather must lie within a category of offenses the commission of which presents a substantial risk that physical force will be used. Accordingly, we join the Fifth Circuit in holding that Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.04 describes a crime of violence for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). <em>See Lopez-Elias v. Reno, </em>209 F.3d 788, 792 (5th Cir.2000). This, in turn, makes Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s burglary of a vehicle an aggravated felony for the purpose of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Alfaro-Gramajo appeals his 37-month sentence, arguing that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on a prior Texas conviction for burglary of a vehicle. Because we conclude that this pri- or offense qualifies as an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G \u00a7 2L1.2(b), both as an attempted theft offense and, alternatively, as a crime of violence, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">. Although the record on appeal lists five separate volumes, the fourth and fifth volumes are designated as sub-volumes I and II of a single volume 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-13\">. In his first brief, Alfaro-Gramajo also argued extensively that burglary of a vehicle does not constitute a burglary offense for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). The gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ernment concedes that it does not, and the issue warrants no further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b706-13\">. Although Texas law of burglary of a vehicle changed after the time of Alfaro-Gramajo\u2019s conviction, reducing the crime from a felony to a misdemeanor offense, the parties agree that the change does not bear on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b706-14\">. Alfaro-Gramajo's argument that there is no evidence that the theft attempted would have been a felony under Texas law, as opposed to a misdemeanor, is without merit, as the offense must viewed in light of the definition in \u00a7 1101 (a)(43)(G) and (U), and Alfaro-Gramajo does not dispute that his sentence was more than one year. <em>See Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. at 2160; <em>Collins, </em>779 F.2d at 1533.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
