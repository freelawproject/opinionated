The district court sentenced Pettaway to life plus fifty-seven years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-22\">On appeal, counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), questioning whether the trial court erred by denying Pettaway\u2019s motions to substitute counsel, for a continuance, and for a mistrial but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Pettaway was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-23\">Pettaway\u2019s counsel questions whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Pettaway\u2019s motion to substitute counsel, in refusing to continue the case, and in denying his motion for a mistrial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Our careful review of the trial transcript convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>515 F.3d 327, 330 (4th Cir.2008) (stating standard of review for denial of motion for mistrial); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>445 F.3d 724, 738 (4th Cir.2006) (stating standard of review for denial of continuance); <em>United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review for denial of motion to substitute counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for any potentially meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We deny Pettaway\u2019s pro se motion for the appointment of counsel and his application to proceed with new counsel under the Criminal Justice Act. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
