Bradley has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, challenging the district court\u2019s certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>cation that his appeal was not taken in good faith pursuant to <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Bradley argues that (1) he was assigned to a prison housing facility that is not appropriate for prisoners with his medical disabilities, thereby violating his due process rights, and (2) his prison housing assignment was the result of retaliation for filing a prior lawsuit. Because Bradley does not have a liberty interest in his housing classification, he has failed to state a valid due process claim on this basis. See <em>Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 435-36 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Moody v. Baker, </em>857 F.2d 256, 257-58 (5th Cir.1988). Moreover, his conclusional allegations of retaliation are insufficient to state a claim. See <em>Moody, 857 </em>F.2d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The district court\u2019s certification that Bradley\u2019s appeal is not taken in good faith is upheld, Bradley\u2019s motion for IFP on appeal is denied, and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Bradley is hereby informed that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), in addition to the strike for the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bradley also earned a strike in <em>Bradley v. Thompson, </em>No. 4:98-cv-00171-GHD (N.D.Miss. May 19, 1999). As Bradley now has accumulated at least three strikes, he is barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm.
