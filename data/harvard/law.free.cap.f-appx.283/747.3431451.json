On appeal, Simpson argues that the district court (1) clearly erred in imposing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), for the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification, on the ground that \u201cthe taxpayers\u201d gave him their personal information; (2) clearly erred in imposing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, for obstruction of justice, on the ground that he did not instruct a witness to lie to the IRS, as alleged; (3) clearly erred by denying a three-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility, on the ground that he accepted responsibility by pleading guilty; and (4) imposed an unreasonable sentence by failing to consider the factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Simpson submitted to the IRS with his individual tax return a fictitious W-2 statement that included inflated earnings from, and withholdings by, his employer. Simpson also used the names and social security numbers of Corye E. Dorsey, Vickie D. Harris, and Elisha L. Willis to file tax returns. With their tax returns, Simpson submitted fictitious W-2 statements including false employers, earnings, and withholding amounts. Simpson received tax refunds in connection with these tax returns. Regarding Dorsey and Willis, Simpson also used their names and social security numbers to establish bank accounts for the purpose of receiving the tax refunds. Although he did not plead guilty to these other acts, Simpson also used the names and social security numbers of others to file at least 16 other tax returns, and submitted, with these tax returns, fictitious W-2 statements that included false employers, earnings, and withholding amounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">The IRS interviewed several of the people whose personal information Simpson used. Some of these people indicated that they were aware that Simpson was filing then* tax returns. The record does not clarify whether these people knew that Simpson was using false information to do so. Some of these people indicated that they were aware that Simpson was filing their tax returns, but were not aware that he was using false information to do so. Some of these people indicated that they were not aware that Simpson was using them names and social security numbers to file tax returns and had not given him permission to do so. The record does not clarify into which category of knowledge Dorsey or Willis fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">One of the people whose social security numbers were used, Tsushima Marshall, reported to the IRS that, approximately one hour after her initial IRS interview, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Simpson called her on the telephone and instructed her that she might be interviewed by the IRS and should deny knowing him. Simpson instructed Marshall to instead claim that someone else prepared her tax return for the year in question. Also, during a post-conviction interview with a probation officer concerning his assets, Simpson only reported ownership of a single residence. This information, which was used to set Simpson\u2019s bond, later was determined to be inaccurate when the probation officer learned that Simpson also had ownership interests in five other residences. Furthermore, although Simpson was indicted on January 23, 2007, for his activity within the tax-return scheme, he later attempted, on January 27, 2007, to submit to the IRS with his individual tax return a fictitious W-2 form that included inflated earnings from and withholdings by his employer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">At his sentencing hearing, Simpson apologized for his actions and indicated that he accepted full responsibility for what he had done. He also stated that: (1) just before his incarceration, his wife had been a good influence on him, he had been running a legitimate catering business, and he had been paying child support and becoming close with his children; (2) his wife had since become sick, and he would like to return to her as soon as possible; (3) since being incarcerated, he had behaved and had learned discipline and to live with a little bit, rather than a lot, of money; and (4) if released, he would not break the law again. The government requested a sentence at the low end of the guideline imprisonment range.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">The district court acknowledged Simpson\u2019s \u201cproblems,\u201d but stated that its primary objective was to protect society from Simpson. To this end, the district court noted Simpson\u2019s relatively high criminal history category and stated that nothing in Simpson\u2019s \u201ctrack record\u201d indicated that Simpson could or would stay out of trouble if released. The district court noted that, in its experience, those convicted of financial fraud have a high tendency toward recidivism. The district court concluded that, given his criminal history, Simpson did not merit lenient treatment and that a sentence within Simpson\u2019s guideline imprisonment range probably did not \u201cadequately capture[] the extent of [Simpson\u2019s] wrongdoing,\u201d but stated that it would have faith that a guideline sentence would suffice. Accordingly, the district court sentenced Simpson at the low end of that range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the sentencing court first must correctly calculate the guideline imprisonment range and then must treat that range as advisory and impose a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). With regard to the district court\u2019s guideline-imprisonment-range calculation, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Humber, </em>255 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), a two-level enhancement is warranted when the defendant\u2019s offense conduct involved \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any means of identification.\u201d \u201c[T]he term \u2018means of identification\u2019 refers to any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific individual, including any\u201d name, social security number, or access device. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(d)(7)(A), (D); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 9(A)). An \u201caccess device\u201d includes any \u201caccount number\u201d that can be used to initiate a transfer of funds. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(e)(1). The commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 sets forth examples of the types of conduct to which the means-of-identification enhancement applies, including when \u201c[a] defendant obtains an individual\u2019s name and social security number from a source (e.g., from a piece of mail taken from the individual\u2019s mailbox) and obtains a bank loan in that individual\u2019s name.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 9(C)(ii)(I)). The commentary explains that, \u201c[i]n this example, the account number of the bank loan is the other means of identification that has been obtained unlawfully.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The district court did not err in imposing a means-of-identification enhancement. <em>See Humber, </em>255 F.3d at 1311. The record demonstrates that Simpson obtained Dorsey\u2019s and Willis\u2019s names and social security numbers and then obtained bank accounts using this information. Accordingly, Simpson used two means of identification\u2014names and social security numbers\u2014to obtain another means of identification\u2014bank account numbers. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028(d)(7), 1029(e)(1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n. 9(A), (C)(ii)(I)). The record also suggests that Simpson obtained and used Dorsey\u2019s and Willis\u2019s names and social security numbers without their permission. Although Simpson claims that \u201cthe taxpayers\u201d provided their information, he presents no evidence to, and the record otherwise does not, show that Dorsey and Willis gave him their information. Moreover, Simpson does not argue, and the record otherwise does not suggest, that Dorsey and Willis gave Simpson permission to use any information provided to open bank accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1, a two-level enhancement is warranted when the defendant willfully obstructs the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of his offense of conviction, in a manner related to his offense of conviction, relevant conduct, or a closely related offense. The commentary to \u00a7 3C1.1 provides a non-exhaustive list of conduct to which the enhancement might apply, including \u201cthreatening, intimidating, or otherwise unlawfully influencing a codefendant, witness, or juror, directly or indirectly, or attempting to do so\u201d and \u201cproviding materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence or other investigation for the court.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(a), (h)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>The commentary, however, also limits, the conduct to which the enhancement might apply, by specifically excluding \u201cproviding incomplete or misleading information, not amounting to a material falsehood, in respect to a presentenee investigation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 5(c)). Based on this commentary, we have held that determining whether the enhancement applies depends on whether the information withheld was material. <em>United States v. Odedina, </em>980 F.2d 705, 706-08 (11th Cir.1993) (regarding a defendant\u2019s failure to disclose to a probation officer his aliases and prior misdemeanor arrest). The commentary defines \u201cmaterial\u201d as \u201cevidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">The district court did not err in imposing an obstruction-of-justiee enhancement. <em>See Humber, 255 </em>F.3d at 1311. The record demonstrates that Simpson attempted to influence a witness to lie to the IRS and lied to a probation officer in the course of the presentence investigation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(a)(h)). Although Simpson \u201cvehemently\u201d denied telling Marshall to lie, an IRS agent told the district court that he overheard Marshall recounting the situation before testifying before the grand jury. Nothing in the record suggests that the district court erred in crediting the agent\u2019s statements over Simpson\u2019s denial. Also, the probation officer informed the district court that Simpson failed to inform a probation officer of his ownership of certain residences. His ownership of these assets was material to the presentence investigation because it would tend to influence the district court to set a higher bond for Simpson. <em>See Odedina, </em>980 F.2d at 706-08; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1, a two-level reduction is warranted if the defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d An additional one-level reduction is warranted if the government indicates that the \u201cdefendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). The commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 instructs that \u201c[cjonduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct,\u201d such that an obstruction-of-justice enhancement and aeceptance-of-responsibility reduction should be applied in tandem only in \u201cextraordinary cases.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 4). The commentary also instructs that the district court, in determining whether to apply the initial reduction, may consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">In <em>United States v. Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527, 1529 (11th Cir.1991), we affirmed the denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction on continuing-criminal-activity grounds when, \u201calthough [the] appellant acknowledged responsibility for his criminal behavior, [the PSI demonstrated that] since his release on bond he has committed, and has been found guilty of, nine additional offenses.\u201d Likewise, in <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d 1204, 1215-16 (11th Cir.1989), we affirmed the denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction on continuing-criminal-activity grounds when the \u201cevidence showed [that the defendant] continued to use cocaine after his arrest and thus had not turned away from the lifestyle that motivated his offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>The district court did not err in declining to apply an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction. <em>See Humber, </em>255 F.3d at 1311. The record demonstrates that Simpson continued his criminal activity after being indicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 1(b)). Specifically, after being indicted on January 23rd, Simpson attempted to file a fraudulent individual tax return on January 27th. This continued criminal activity was not only similar to that in <em>Villarino </em>and <em>Scroggins, </em>it demonstrated even less acceptance of responsibility because Simpson\u2019s continued criminal activity involved the same crime as that charged in the indictment. <em>See Villarino, </em>930 F.2d 1527 at 1529; <em>Scroggins, </em>880 F.2d at 1215-16. Also, as discussed above, Simpson appropriately received an obstruetion-of-justice enhancement, suggesting that he did not accept responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 4). Simpson has not demonstrated the \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances necessary to overcome this suggestion. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">d.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Supreme Court has held that the reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-10\">The Supreme Court has explained that a sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court improperly calculates the guideline imprisonment range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the appropriate statutory factors, bases the sentence on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to adequately explain its reasoning. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The Supreme Court also has explained that review for substantive reasonableness involves inquiring whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Id. </em>at -, 128 S.Ct. at 598-99. Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The statute also instructs the sentencing court to consider certain factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasoning behind its choice of sentence, the district court need not discuss or state that it has explicitly considered each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Rather, even a brief explanation of its reasoning, coupled with a clear consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, will suffice. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">The district court did not impose an unreasonable sentence. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Although the district court did not explicitly refer to \u00a7 3553(a), the record makes clear that the district court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the principles espoused by \u00a7 3553(a). Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>cally, before imposing a sentence, the district court heard the parties\u2019 arguments on the objections and Simpson\u2019s statement on his character and family\u2019s troubles. The district court explicitly stated that it had considered Simpson\u2019s family\u2019s troubles. Thus, it is clear that the district court considei'ed the parties\u2019 arguments. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In choosing a sentence, the district court indicated that it especially was guided by Simpson\u2019s lengthy criminal history, the fear of Simpson\u2019s recidivism, and the need to protect the public from Simpson. The district court also indicated that it felt that a 41-month sentence was the minimal sentence that it could impose and may actually be insufficient. Thus, it is apparent that the district court implicitly considered the relevant factors, namely Simpson\u2019s history and characteristics, promoting respect for the law, deterring criminal conduct, and protecting the public from future criminal conduct by Simpson. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2); <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at -, 127 S.Ct. at 2469. The fact that the district court did not consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors does not render Simpson\u2019s sentence unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. It also is apparent that the district court strived to impose a sentence that was not greater than necessary. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Because the district court did not clearly err in applying a means-of-identification and obstruction-of-justice enhancements or denying an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, and did not impose an unreasonable sentence, we affirm Simpson\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-5\">. Based on this information, the probation officer calculated a guideline imprisonment range of 51 to 63 months. Specifically, the probation officer set Simpson\u2019s base offense level at 14, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B 1.1(b)(1)(E). The probation officer applied a two-level enhancement for the unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification; a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) because Simpson was the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of the scheme; and a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. The probation officer declined to apply an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, over Simpson's objection. Also, the probation officer set Simpson\u2019s criminal history category at IV. Each count of Simpson's conviction carries a statutory maximum of 60 months' imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7 287.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\">. The district court calculated a guideline imprisonment range of 41 to 51 months. While the district court applied the means-of-identification and obstruction-of-justice enhancements recommended by the probation officer, and also declined to apply an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction despite Simpson's objection, it chose not to apply a role enhancement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
