Liggett Group, Inc., </em>61 F.3d 270, 274 (4th Cir.1995). Summary judgment may be granted only when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). However, \u201c[cjonclusory or speculative allegations do not suffice, nor does a \u2018mere scintilla of evidence\u2019 in support of his case.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>312 F.3d 645, 649 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Phillips v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>190 F.3d 285, 287 (4th Cir.1999)). Summary judgment will be granted unless a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ing party on the evidence presented. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">In light of these principles, we have reviewed the parties\u2019 pleadings and the transcript of the summary judgment hearing, and we find no reversible error in the reasoning of the district court as stated in its bench ruling. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Jorgensen v. Rhoads, </em>No. 1:06-cv-01409-CMH-TCB (E.D.Va. Oct. 15, 2007). We grant Jorgensen\u2019s motion to supplement her informal brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b191-15\"> The district court also entered judgment against Rodney Rhoads, from which Rhoads does not appeal, on Jorgensen's third count and dismissed her fourth and fifth counts without prejudice. These counts were unrelated to the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
