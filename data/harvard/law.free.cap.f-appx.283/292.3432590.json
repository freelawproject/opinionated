Hawkins filed the instant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition to raise claims concerning credit for time served while on parole or mandatory supervision, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>district court dismissed the petition without prejudice for want of exhaustion. The respondent appeals the district court\u2019s judgment and argues that the dismissal should have been with prejudice. The respondent argues that the exhaustion requirement should be flexibly applied and that, because Hawkins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was untimely and lacked merit, the district court should have dismissed it with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the petition without prejudice for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Horsley v. Johnson, </em>197 F.3d 134, 136 (5th Cir.1999). Our review of the record does not show that the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Hawkins\u2019s petition without prejudice was based on a legal error or a clearly erroneous view of the pertinent facts. <em>See Rodriguez v. Johnson, </em>104 F.3d 694, 696 (5th Cir.1997). Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it decided to dismiss Hawkins\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition without prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b318-25\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
