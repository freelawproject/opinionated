Bermudez\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the district court clearly erred in denying him a two-level minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. He contends that the adjustment was warranted because he was a mere courier who was less culpable than other participants in the offense. Bermudez was the driver and sole occupant of a truck carrying some 819 kilograms of marijuana from Alto Bonito, Texas to Mission, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The district court accepted the PSR and its calculation of the advisory guideline range of 97 to 121 months. Bermudez\u2019s counsel requested a two level downward adjustment in offense level under section 3B1.2, arguing that Bermudez had only a minor role in the offense. As Bermudez\u2019s counsel points out on this appeal, a minor role adjustment would have produced a guideline range of 78 to 97 months. The PSR recommended denial of the requested minor participant adjustment. The district court considered and rejected it, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-15\">\u201cWith regards to the role in the offense, as far as I\u2019m concerned this is someone who could not be possibly considered minimal or minor. This is somebody who had to take some serious steps with regards to his involvement in this case, and I would deny that objection, also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-16\">... This is 800 kilograms of marijuana. This is 16-1800 pounds of marijuana. This is a lot of marijuana. He had just been placed on probation two months before for 26 pounds of marijuana. This is not somebody who is at the bridge or trying to cross here looking for a job and somebody says, I\u2019m going to throw a hundred dollars at you, you take this across the border.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">The court ultimately sentenced Bermudez to 97 months, stating \u201cI did closely consider all of the factors that would apply in 3553(a) and found this to be the appropriate sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-18\">Whether a defendant is a minor or minimal participant is a factual determination that is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2, a district court may decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant. An adjustment for a minor role applies to a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.5). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>defendant bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to the minor participant adjustment. <em>United States v. Deavours, 219 F.3d 400, 404 (5th </em>Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Bermudez\u2019s courier status alone did not entitle him to a role adjustment because a defendant may be a courier without being \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>54 F.3d 234, 241 (5th Cir.1995). Thus, the district court did not clearly err in denying Bermudez a minor role adjustment. <em>See United States v. Atanda, </em>60 F.3d 196, 199 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Nevarez-Arreola, </em>885 F.2d 243, 245 (5th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Buenrostro, </em>868 F.2d 135, 138 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
