Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l) (2000). In his informal brief, Wilson fails to address the district court\u2019s ruling that his action could not proceed because a favorable outcome of the lawsuit would undermine the validity of his conviction, citing <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Therefore, Wilson has waived appellate review of that issue. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (\u201cThe Court will limit its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
