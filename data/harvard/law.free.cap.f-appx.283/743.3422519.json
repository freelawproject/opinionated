Beltran Rodriguez appeals from his 156-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1), and 846 (\u201cCount 1\u201d), and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine hydrochloride, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and (b)(1)(A) (\u201cCount 2\u201d). On appeal, Beltran argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his counsel made no objections to: (1) the facts in the PSI; and (2) two Sixth Amendment errors that occurred when the district court found that Beltran was a manager or supervisor, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), even though this was not charged in the indictment or found by the jury, and when the district court found a drug quantity that was in excess <em>of the </em>amount to which he pled guilty. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-12\">\u201cWhether a criminal defendant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective is a mixed question of law and fact, subject to <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) (quotations omitted). \u201cWe will not generally consider claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised on direct appeal where the district court did not entertain the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we can review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim irrespective of whether the district court held an evidentiary hearing, so long as \u201cthere is sufficient evidence in the trial record regarding the claim.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>40 F.3d 349, 355 n. 6 (11th Cir.1994), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. Sanchez, </em>269 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-13\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is considered under the two-part test announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, and (2) that he was prejudiced as a result. <em>Id. </em>If the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one component, the court need not address the other. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel\u2019s representation is judged by an objective standard of reasonableness, and \u201cIjjudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Unless the defendant can rebut the \u201cstrong presump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>tion that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d he cannot show that counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient. <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We also have noted that counsel is \u201cnot ineffective for failing to raise a nonmeritorious issue.\u201d <em>Chandler v. Moore, </em>240 F.3d 907, 917 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">If the district court applies the guidelines as advisory, nothing in <em>Booker </em>prohibits district courts from making, under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, additional factual findings that go beyond a defendant\u2019s admission or facts found by the jury. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1324 (11th Cir.2005). Extra-verdict enhancements \u201cremain[ ] a constitutional part of guidelines sentencing in the <em>post-Booker </em>era,\u201d where the guidelines are applied in an advisory manner. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">As an initial matter, Beltran\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is ripe for disposition on direct appeal because the record is sufficiently developed to consider the claim. <em>Camacho, </em>40 F.3d at 355 n. 6. Turning to the merits, Beltran\u2019s claim that his counsel should have objected to the facts in the PSI fails because Beltran himself twice told the court that he had read the PSI and had no objections to the facts in the PSI or to the application of the Guidelines to those facts. Moreover, Beltran does not even argue on appeal that these facts were inaccurate; rather, he simply says that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to them. He thus has not shown that counsel\u2019s errors, if any, \u201cactually had an adverse effect on the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">Likewise, we are unpersuaded by Beltran\u2019s contention that the district court violated Beltran\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by finding certain facts by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court clearly treated the guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Beltran to a sentence below that which was authorized by the counts of conviction. <em>Chau, </em>426 F.3d at 1324. In short, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise these nonmeritorious objections in the district court. <em>Chandler, </em>240 F.3d at 917.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">We therefore affirm Beltran\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\">. Because Beltran asserts for the first time in his reply brief that the district court\u2019s explanation of the chosen sentence was insufficient to satisfy 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c), this issue is waived and we will not address it. <em>United States v. Day, </em>405 F.3d 1293, 1294 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
