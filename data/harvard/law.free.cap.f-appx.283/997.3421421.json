Gross was sentenced to a total of 102 months of imprisonment: forty-two months for Counts 1 and 3, and sixty months for Count 2, to run consecutively to Counts 1 and 3. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issue: whether the district court erroneously denied Gross\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-21\">A defendant who enters a guilty plea waives the right to raise a constitutional challenge to his or her conviction, except in narrow circumstances not presented in this appeal. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). Direct review of an adverse ruling on a pre-trial motion is available only if the defendant expressly preserves that right by entering a conditional guilty plea. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(a)(2); <em>see Tollett, </em>411 U.S. at 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602 (holding entry of guilty plea waives challenges to \u201cthe deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea\u201d); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 52 (4th Cir.1990) (\u201cA defendant who enters a guilty plea waives the right to raise a constitutional challenge to his or her conviction, except in narrow circumstances.\u201d). Because Gross entered an unconditional guilty plea to his offenses, he cannot now attack the district court\u2019s pre-trial decision denying his motion to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-22\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>form his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1023-23\"> Despite notice, Gross has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
