Devore, federal prisoner # 11147-014, appeals the judgment dismissing for lack of jurisdiction his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, wherein he sought to challenge the 235-month sentence imposed following his conviction of being a felon in possession of a firearm. He argues that the district court improperly applied the armed career criminal enhancement at sentencing and that a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Section 2255 provides the primary-means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence based on errors that occurred at or prior to sentencing. <em>Cox v. Warden, </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). A \u00a7 2241 petition attacking the imposition of a federally imposed sentence may be considered only where the petitioner establishes that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citations omitted). Devore bears the burden of showing that a \u00a7 2255 motion is an inadequate vehicle in which to bring his claims into federal court. <em>See McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979). Devore\u2019s contention is based on sentencing, and he therefore has not made the requisite showing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213-14 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Devore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
