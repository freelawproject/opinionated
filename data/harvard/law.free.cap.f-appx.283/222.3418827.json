Martin PUENTES, Jr., Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b248-9\">No. 07-10604</docketnumber>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A8Z\">Conference Calendar.</p>\n<court data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b248-10\">United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b248-12\">June 19, 2008.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-13\">Camille Elizabeth Sparks, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-14\">Leigh Warren Davis, Fort Worth, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b248-16\">Before JONES, Chief Judge, and JOLLY and DENNIS, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b248-17\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">Martin Puentes, Jr., was convicted by a jury of conspiracy, distribution of a controlled substance, possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, and aiding and abetting. He was sentenced as a career offender to an aggregated sentence of 360 months of imprisonment and 10 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-23\">After briefing was completed in this case, Puentes moved to relieve appointed counsel and have new counsel appointed. Alternatively, he moved to proceed pro se on appeal and file a new appellate brief. Puentes\u2019s assertion of his right to self-representation is untimely. <em>Cf. United States v. Wagner, </em>158 F.3d 901, 902 (5th Cir.1998). All of Puentes\u2019s outstanding pro se motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-24\">Puentes argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on a finding that his Texas conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver was a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Puentes correctly concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ford, </em>509 F.3d 714, 717 (5th Cir.2007), and he raises it solely to preserve it for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-25\">Puentes also raises arguments challenging the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851 that are, as Puentes concedes, foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See United States v. Mata, </em>491 F.3d 237, 245 (5th Cir.2007). The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, which is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time for filing an appellate brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
