Cotton appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he challenged the manner in which his sentence was executed. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3, the district court ordered that Cotton\u2019s 108-month federal sentence be served concurrently with a previously imposed 10-year state sentence for violation of probation. Cotton argues that the Bureau of Prisons did not properly credit him for the time he spent in state custody prior to the commencement of his federal sentence and that the district court could have adjusted his sentence under \u00a7 5G1.3, but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u201c[A] defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences ... that has not been credited against another sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). Here, however, the period of time for which Cotton seeks credit against his federal sentence was credited against his state sentence. Thus, the Bureau of Prisons properly determined that Cotton was not entitled under \u00a7 3585(b) to a credit for the time he spent sending his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Further, whether the sentencing court should have reduced Cotton\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.3(b) is an issue that challenges the correctness of the sentence, and therefore Cotton is not entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 unless he can demonstrate that he is entitled to relief under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e), which he has failed to do. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-13\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b241-9\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
