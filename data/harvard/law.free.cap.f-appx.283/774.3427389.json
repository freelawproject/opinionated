First, Minton argues that he merely \u201cbrandished\u201d the firearm used in the first bank robbery, and, therefore, the district court erred by applying a six-level increase to his offense level for \u201cotherwise use\u201d of a firearm. Second, Minton argues that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), because, among other things, he did not receive an enhancement for obstruction of justice. Finally, Minton argues that his above-Guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-18\">Minton pled guilty to: (1) armed bank robbery of approximately $2,326.00 from Wachovia Bank on or about December 20, 2006 (Count I); (2) armed bank robbery of approximately $37,477.86 from Bank of America on or about December 29, 2006 (Count III); and (3) using and carrying a firearm in relation to the Bank of America robbery (Count TV). Lindsey Orr was also charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-19\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u00bb) summarized the testimony of the two Wachovia Bank tellers who testified at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Orr\u2019s trial. One of the tellers testified that Minton walked up to her work station with a gun and demanded \u201c50\u2019s and 100\u2019s.\u201d Minton told the teller to be calm, do what he said, and he would not hurt her. When the teller told Minton that she did not have 50\u2019s or 100\u2019s, Minton stated, \u201cstop lying bitch and waved the gun in her face.\u201d The teller testified that she put the money in the bag because \u201c[s]he did not want to \u2018get shot\u2019 as he (Minton) had a gun in her face. She believed that if she did not give him (Minton) the money he demanded, he would have shot her.\u201d One of the still photos of the robbery showed Minton at the teller\u2019s station with the gun in his hand, but resting on the counter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Minton testified at Orr\u2019s trial that he did not author the demand note that' was found in Orr\u2019s apartment. Even after the government presented evidence at Orr\u2019s trial that the handwriting on the note matched Minton\u2019s, Minton continued to deny that he wrote the note. The demand note was not used during the bank robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">In the PSI, Minton received a six-level increase for Count I (the Wachovia Bank conduct), pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(b), because a firearm was \u201cotherwise used.\u201d The probation officer also applied a two-level increase for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l). Minton objected to the increase for \u201cotherwise use\u201d of a firearm and to the obstruction of justice enhancement. Minton also asserted that he was entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the government stated that the demand note that Minton testified about at Orr\u2019s trial was not material to its investigation or to the outcome of Orr\u2019s trial. However, the district court found that the misrepresentation was \u201cmaterial\u201d because it affected Orr\u2019s sentencing. Nonetheless, the district court sustained Minton\u2019s objection concerning the obstruction of justice enhancement because the government indicated that it did not wish to pursue the enhancement further. The court overruled Minton\u2019s other objections. Without the obstruction of justice enhancement, the court calculated a Guidelines range of 87 to 109 months for Counts I and III. The court sentenced Minton to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on Counts I and III, and 84 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count IV,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to run consecutively with the sentence imposed for Counts I and III. Minton preserved his objections to the court\u2019s rulings on the acceptance of responsibility and \u201cotherwise use\u201d issues, and he also objected to the reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, and we review factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilks, </em>464 F.3d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 693, 166 L.Ed.2d 539 (2006) (internal citations omitted). The district court must correctly interpret and apply the Guidelines when calculating the appropriate advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-15\">In calculating a defendant\u2019s robbery offense level, six levels are added if a firearm was \u201cotherwise used,\u201d and five lev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>els are added if a firearm was brandished or possessed. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(B), (C). \u201c \u2018Otherwise used\u2019 with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, comment, (n. 1(1)). The Guidelines state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">\u201cBrandished\u201d with reference to a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) means that all or part of the weapon was displayed, or the presence of the weapon was otherwise made known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the weapon was directly visible to that person. Accordingly, although the dangerous weapon does not have to be directly visible, the weapon must be present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b803-6\"><em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 1(C)).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">We have recently noted that \u201c[a]s ornease law has made clear, the use of a firearm to make an explicit or implicit threat against a specific person constitutes \u2018otherwise use\u2019 of the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>489 F.3d 1117, 1129 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1875, 170 L.Ed.2d 752 (2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted). In <em>Douglas, </em>we found that the defendant \u201cotherwise used\u201d a firearm when he showed the gun to the victim and verbally threatened her, even though the defendant never pointed the gun at the victim and kept the gun \u201cin as secretive location as he possibly could.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128-29. Thus, we concluded that the district court properly applied the six-level increase in offense level. <em>Id. </em>at 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">Minton\u2019s argument that he merely \u201cbrandished\u201d the firearm is foreclosed by binding precedent. According to the bank teller\u2019s testimony that is referenced in the PSI,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Minton used the firearm to make an implicit threat against a specific person, and his behavior constitutes \u201cotherwise use\u201d of the firearm, even though he neither pointed the weapon at the teller nor placed the weapon in close proximity to her. <em>See Douglas, </em>489 F.3d at 1129. Thus, that the district court properly applied the increase in offense level for Minton\u2019s having \u201cotherwise used\u201d a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">We review the district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d 1305, 1320 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is not entitled to acceptance of responsibility will not be set aside unless the facts in the record clearly establish that a defendant has accepted personal responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>180 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of clearly demonstrating acceptance of responsibility and must present more than just a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">A defendant is entitled to a two-level reduction in his offense level if he \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). Even where a defendant pleads guilty, he is not entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility if he acts in a way inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n. 3). For example, a defendant is not entitled to a reduction when he \u201cfalsely denies, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 1(a)). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. For this reason, the determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">\u201cConduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 (Obstructing or Impeding the Administration of Justice) ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. There may, however, be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both \u00a7 \u00a7 3C1.1 and 3E1.1 may apply.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 4). \u201c[Pjroviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate\u201d is an example of the type of conduct to which the obstruction of justice enhancement applies. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(f)). \u201c \u2018Material\u2019 evidence, fact, statement, or information ... means evidence, fact, statement, or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment, (n. 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Initially, Minton\u2019s argument, that he is entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because his misrepresentations at Orr\u2019s trial did not qualify for an obstruction of justice enhancement, is without merit. Although the commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 (acceptance of responsibility) states that \u201c[cjonduct resulting in an enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 ... ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct,\u201d contrary to Minton\u2019s assertions otherwise, it does not follow that, if an obstruction of justice enhancement is not applied, a reduction for acceptance of responsibility must be applied. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), comment, (n. 4). Further, although the court stated at the sentencing hearing that Minton\u2019s representation was \u201cmaterial,\u201d a denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility does not <em>require </em>a finding of materiality. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Minton acted in a way inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility because he falsely denied relevant conduct that the disti\u2019ict court determined to be true. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), comments, (n. 1(a), n. 3, n. 5). Thus, the district court did not clearly err by denying him a reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a). <em>See Amedeo, </em>370 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">\u201c \u2018In reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750 (11th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). The party challenging the reasonableness of a sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">The Supreme Court recently clarified the reasonableness standard as a review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate courts should \u201ctake into account the totality of circumstances, including the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id., </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. We will remand for resentencing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>(quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the district court must impose a sentence that is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">When reviewing the sentence for procedural reasonableness, we must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW4\">ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">\u201cIn considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness where a sentence is outside of the Guidelines range, and we must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1091 (11th Cir. 2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cGall makes clear that \u2018it also remains true that the district court\u2019s choice of sentence is not unfettered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201c[T]he district court is obliged to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and those factors in turn guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and punctuation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Because we review for substantive unreasonableness under the \u201ctotality of circumstances,\u201d \u201ca district court need not discuss each Section 3553(a) factor, although where the judge imposes a sentence outside the Guidelines, the judge will explain why he has done so.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 n. 8 (internal citations and punctuation marks omitted). \u201c[A] district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one Section 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1191. However, such a sentence is not necessarily unreasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 602 (holding that a district court did not commit reversible error simply because it \u201cattached great weight\u201d to one factor). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to afford adequate deterrence, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to protect the public, and to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the advisory guidelines range; (5) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">The district court adequately explained, based upon the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances in this case, why it varied above the Guidelines range. The record does not support Minton\u2019s contention that the court focused on the single issue of incapacitating him in order to prevent an early release from prison, and Minton has not shown that his 120-month sentence, which was well below the statutory maximum of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment, was unreasonable in light of both the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court did not commit a clear error in judgment sentencing Minton.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">In light of the foregoing, Minton\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">. Minton conceded at his sentencing hearing that 18 seconds of the robbery were not depicted in the still photographs taken from the bank\u2019s surveillance video.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-16\">. The district court was required by statute to impose an 84-month sentence for Count IV. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b803-10\">. Minton did not object to the PSI\u2019s facts. Therefore, those facts are deemed admitted for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (finding that factual findings set forth in a PSI and not objected to by a defendant are deemed admitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-18\">.
