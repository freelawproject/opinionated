Adams and Maribel F. Murray appeal the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing their civil action filed to quiet title to certain residential real property and for specific performance of a purchase option as to the property. After a bench trial, this court reviews the district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Minyard Enter., Inc. v. Southeastern Chem. &amp; Solvent Co., </em>184 F.3d 373, 380 (4th Cir.1999); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>In re Green, </em>934 F.2d 568, 570 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-26\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 informal briefs and the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Adams v. Brooks, </em>No. 8:05-cv-03332-DKC (D. Md. July 25, 2007; Jan. 2, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
