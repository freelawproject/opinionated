The district court sentenced him to 70 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-18\">Guzman-Valdez argues that he was wrongly denied a downward adjustment for his minor or minimal role in the offense. The advisory Sentencing Guidelines provide for a reduction in the base offense level of a \u201cminor\u201d or a \u201cminimal\u201d participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. To merit a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, the defendant must have been \u201csubstantially less culpable\u201d than the average participant. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n. 3(A)). The role of a defendant in the offense is a factual determination that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-23\">The presentenee report (PSR) indicates that Guzman-Valdez\u2019s car crossed into Mexico nine times in just over two months. On one of these occasions Guzman-Valdez was found to have $1450 hidden in the air vent of his car. The PSR also indicates that Guzman-Valdez had a history of unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-24\">Guzman-Valdez has not shown that his participation in the offense was \u201cperipheral to the advancement of the illicit activity\u201d or that it was not \u201ccritical to the offense,\u201d given that he directly transported a sizable load of cocaine and was found with a large sum of money concealed in his car\u2019s air vent on a prior occasion. <em>Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204; <em>United States v. Tremelling, </em>43 F.3d 148, 153 (5th Cir.1995). Guzman-Valdez has not demonstrated that the district court\u2019s denial of a role adjustment was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b255-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
