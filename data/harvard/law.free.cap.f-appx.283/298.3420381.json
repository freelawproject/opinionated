Canterbury contends that, pursuant to <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), the IJ erred when he determined that Canterbury had been convicted of an aggravated felony and therefore was not eligible for cancellation of removal. Canterbury has abandoned any challenge to the denial of his applications for withholding of removal and for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004). Canterbury\u2019s motion to supplement his reply brief is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we do not have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal of an alien who is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2001). We do, however, have jurisdiction to consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with the appropriate court of appeals.\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Flores-Ledezma v. Gonzales, </em>415 F.3d 375, 380 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-19\">The INA lists as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d \u201cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance ... including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18),\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B), but does not define \u201cillicit trafficking.\u201d Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) defines \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to include \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d (CSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">In <em>Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 633, the Supreme Court held that a state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the CSA only if such offense proscribes conduct that would be punishable as a felony under that federal law. Under the CSA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) prohibits the distribution of a controlled substance. Distribution of specified controlled substances, including cocaine, is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Accordingly, <em>Lopez </em>provides no relief to Canterbury, so we deny his petition for review. <em>See Arce-Vences v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 167, 171-73 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>A successive petition for review, filed by Canterbury in the Second Circuit, has been transferred to us from that circuit. We lack jurisdiction to consider Canterbury\u2019s successive petition for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION GRANTED; SUCCESSIVE PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
