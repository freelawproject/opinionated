Specifically, he challenges the enhancement of his sentence based upon the district court\u2019s determination that his prior conviction in California for robbery is a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Rivas argues that Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 211 may be violated not only by the use of force but also by threats to property. Because \u00a7 211 may be violated by fear of property damage alone, Rivas argues, it does not necessarily have the use or threatened use of force as an element, does not fall within the contemporary meaning of robbery, and is not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Because Rivas did not object below to the enhancement on the grounds he asserts on appeal, this court reviews for plain error. See <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>386 F.3d 632, 636 (5th Cir.2004). In <em>United States v. Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d 813, 815 (5th Cir.2008), this court specifically held that \u201crobbery under \u00a7 211 of the California Penal Code falls within the generic or contemporary meaning of robbery as understood by this court\u201d and is, therefore, a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2. Rivas\u2019s arguments to the contrary are, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Rivas additionally challenges, in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. As Rivas concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Toires v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
