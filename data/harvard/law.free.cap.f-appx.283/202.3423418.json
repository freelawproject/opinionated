The district court dismissed Moore\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), holding that his challenge to a prison rule violation report did not implicate the Due Process Clause. The district court denied Moore\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith, finding that he had no basis in law or fact to appeal. By moving for leave to proceed IFP on appeal, Moore is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-20\">Moore\u2019s IFP motion addresses only his indigence. He does not brief any argument regarding the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal from the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 complaint would be frivolous. Failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Moore has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Moore\u2019s request for IFP is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202, n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Moore is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Moore is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
