Dorval pleaded guilty to all counts without a written plea agreement. Over Dorval\u2019s objections, the court sentenced Dorval to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the distribution counts, to be served concurrently. The court did not impose sentences for the conspiracy or possession with intent to distribute offenses, and the government failed to bring this omission to the court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-20\">Dorval now appeals his sentences, arguing that the mandatory minimum sentence required under \u00a7 841 violates the Fifth and Eighth Amendments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the government argues that there was plain error in the district court\u2019s failure to impose sentence on two counts to which Dorval pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>We review constitutional questions <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>364 F.3d 1266, 1268 (11th Cir.2004). Section 841(b)(1)(A) provides, in part, that \u201cany person who violates subsection (a) of this section shall be sentenced as follows ... to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years or more than life ...\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). This court has held that \u00a7 841(b)(1) does not violate equal protection or due process. <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>848 F.2d 156, 157 (11th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The Eighth Amendment, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment, contains a narrow proportionality principal that applies to noncapital sentences. <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 20, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 1185, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003). The Supreme Court has made it clear that, \u201c[ojutside the context of capital punishment, successful challenges to the proportionality of sentences [are] exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Solem v. Helm, </em>463 U.S. 277, 289, 103 S.Ct. 3001, 3009, 77 L.Ed.2d 637 (1983). This court repeatedly has affirmed that the district courts are \u201cbound by the statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cMoreover, a sentence which is not otherwise cruel and unusual does not become so simply because it is mandatory.\u201d <em>United States v. Raad, </em>406 F.3d 1322, 1324 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, Dorval\u2019s Fifth Amendment equal protection and Eighth Amendment cruel and unusual punishment arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s binding precedent, and we affirm his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We decline to address the government\u2019s argument that the court failed to sentence Dorval on two counts. Although a party may raise any argument in support of a judgment, a party who has not appealed may not bring an argument in opposition to a judgment or attack the judgment in any respect, <em>United States v. American Ry. Express Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435-36, 44 S.Ct. 560, 564, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924), or \u201chitch a ride on his adversary\u2019s notice of appeal\u201d to \u201cenlarge his rights under the judgment or diminish those of the opposing party.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Wainwright, </em>726 F.2d 702, 704 (11th Cir.1984); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(B) (\u201cWhen the government is entitled to appeal, its notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 30 days after the later of: (i) the entry of the judgment or order being appealed; or (ii) the filing of a notice of appeal by any defendant.\u201d). Thus, by failing to file a cross-appeal, the government has not properly preserved the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-13\">. We note that it is unclear that Dorval preserved an Eighth Amendment claim before the district court. Nevertheless, under either plain error or <em>de novo </em>review, Dorval\u2019s claim fails. We further note that Dorval does not raise the claim that the disparity between sentences for crack offenses and cocaine offenses violates the Fifth Amendment. In any event, the Supreme Court's recent opinion involving the disparity does not affect statutory mandatory minimum sentences. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 571, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
