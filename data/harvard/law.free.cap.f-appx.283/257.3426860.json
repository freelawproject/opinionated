Parker appeals the district court\u2019s judgment that granted summary judgment and dismissed his claims against Major Nettles for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Parker has not briefed any challenge to the dismissal of his claims against any defendant other than Nettles. Accordingly, he has abandoned these issues. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Whittaker v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2000). A prisoner may not bring a civil rights action \u201cuntil such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Competent summary judgment evidence established, and there is no competent summary judgment evidence to the contrary, that Parker did not exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing this action. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
