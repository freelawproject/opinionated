Marshall seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-35\">The writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy and should be granted only in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>extraordinary situations when no other remedy is available. <em>In re: Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Marshall filed his Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion on October 17, 2007. According to the district court\u2019s docket sheet, there has been no action on the motion since the date of filing. Because the matter has been pending before the district court for just over six months, we find that there has been no undue delay in processing Marshall\u2019s motion. We therefore deny the petition for mandamus relief without prejudice to Marshall\u2019s right to refile if the district court does not act expeditiously. In light of this disposition, we deny Marshall\u2019s motion to expedite. We grant Marshall\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis in this court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
