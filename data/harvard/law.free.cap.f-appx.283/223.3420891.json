Diggs argues that the sentences imposed for his crimes were too harsh and that the sentences violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">Regardless of the label affixed to Diggs\u2019s motion, it was a collateral challenge to the sentences imposed by the district court and therefore fell within the purview of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>Solsona v. Warden, F.C.I., </em>821 F.2d 1129, 1131-32 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, audita querela was not the proper vehicle for Diggs\u2019s claims. <em>See Banda, </em>1 F.3d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-22\">Diggs has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion. His present motion was successive, and he was required to obtain this court\u2019s authorization to file it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(b)(3), 2255(h). Because he did not do so, the district court properly denied his motion. As Diggs\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit, see <em>Howard v. King, 707 </em>F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See id.; </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
