On June 25, 2001, an Administrative Law Judge found Hunter was disabled, but also recommended Hunter submit to a medical examination within eighteen months to check for any improvement in his condition. Upon review, it was determined that Hunter\u2019s disability ceased on April 1, 2003. Hunter requested reconsideration, and a disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>officer concluded that he was no longer disabled. Hunter requested and received a hearing before an ALJ. On November 21, 2005, the ALJ handed down its decision, concluding that Hunter was no longer disabled as of April 1, 2003. On March 15, 2006, the Appeals Council denied Hunter\u2019s request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Hunter appealed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge. Hunter filed a motion for summary judgment or remand based on newly discovered evidence. The new evidence was a cancer diagnosis; following exploratory surgery on September 26, 2006, Hunter was diagnosed as having pancreatic cancer, liver metastasis, obstructive jaundice, and possible obstructive duodenum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commissioner also moved for summary judgment. The magistrate recommended affirming the ALJ\u2019s determination, and further concluded that there was no basis for remand because Hunter\u2019s new evidence was \u201cimmaterial to the appropriate time period.\u201d Hunter timely objected, and the district court conducted a <em>de novo </em>review. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendations, and accordingly denied Hunter\u2019s motions and granted the Commissioner\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Hunter timely appealed; however, he succumbed to the cancer shortly after filing his notice of appeal. Hunter\u2019s personal representative is pursuing the appeal. The only issue raised on appeal is whether the district court erred in declining to remand the case to the Commissioner because of new evidence, a \u201csentence six\u201d remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s remand decision for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">Section 405(g) provides, in pertinent part, that the courts \u201cmay at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d Evidence that was \u201cnot in existence at the time of the administrative and district court proceedings, meets the \u2018new\u2019 requirement for remand to the Secretary.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cFor new evidence to be material, there must exist the \u2018reasonable possibility that it would have changed the outcome of the Secretary\u2019s determination.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cImplicit in the materiality requirement ... \u2018is that the new evidence relate to the time period for which benefits were denied, and that it not concern evidence of a later-acquired disability or of the subsequent deterioration of the previously non-disabling condition.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-Z\">The Commissioner concedes that Hunter\u2019s evidence is \u201cnew\u201d and there is good cause for Hunter\u2019s having not raised it during the administrative proceeding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The only question is whether Hunter\u2019s new evidence is material. The magistrate determined that \u201cthe evidence is not material because it does not relate to the time period for which benefits were denied.\u201d We conclude that there is no reversible error in this determination. Nothing in the medical evidence submitted demonstrates that Hunter was suffering from pancreatic cancer during the relevant time period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The physician\u2019s report is largely silent about how long Hunter had. cancer, but it did relate that Hunter \u201chad recent 15-pound weight loss, early satiety and trouble with eating.\u201d And the affidavit Hunter attached to his summary judgment motion stated that \u201c[rjecently, I became jaundiced and sought medical attention.\u201d Hunter in essence only speculates that the cancer may have existed long before it was discovered. Without some basis to tie the pancreatic cancer to the period for which benefits were denied, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in declining to remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
