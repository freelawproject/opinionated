He renews his claim that he was improperly sentenced and asserts that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will result from the failure to consider the merits of his claim. However, even if his brief is liberally construed, Ciprano makes no argument that the district court erred in determining that he did not meet the criteria for raising his claims in this \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). He has thus abandoned the only issue on appeal by failing to brief it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-21\">The appeal is without arguable merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The instant petition and appeal are continuations of Ciprano\u2019s repetitious filings in an attempt to circumvent the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. Ciprano is warned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-22\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b237-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
