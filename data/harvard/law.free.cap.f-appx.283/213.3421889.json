Austin is challenging his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction for brandishing a firearm in furtherance of a bank robbery and the sentences imposed for his convictions for bank robbery and for the \u00a7 924(c) offense. He argues that he should not be precluded from seeking \u00a7 2241 relief for violations of his constitutional rights based on the criteria announced in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-24\">Section 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal conviction and sentence, and relief is reserved for errors that occurred at trial or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>sentencing. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cHowever, \u00a7 2241 may be utilized by a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his or her conviction or sentence if he or she can satisfy the mandate of the so-called \u00a7 2255 \u2018savings clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 901. Under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), a federal prisoner may bring a writ of habeas corpus under \u00a7 2241 if the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing \u00a7 2255). The savings clause thus applies to a claim \u201c(i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">The court has determined that the requirements of the savings clause under \u00a7 2255 do not violate the Suspension Clause or the Due Process Clause. <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 346-47 (5th Cir.2002). Austin\u2019s claim that <em>Reyes-Requena </em>impermissibly deprived him of his right to seek habeas relief is without merit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Austin argues that he received an enhanced sentence in violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because the district court relied on factors not admitted or proved to a jury. Austin relies on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to support his argument. The holdings in <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Apprendi </em>are not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral \u00a7 2241 review. <em>See Wesson, </em>305 F.3d at 347; <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Further, a successful argument regarding the enhancement of his sentence would not establish that Austin was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. Austin has not shown that this claim meets the criteria set out in <em>Reyes-Requena.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Austin also argues that he is innocent of the \u00a7 924(c) offense because the indictment did not charge the type of firearm used in furtherance of the bank robbery, which was an element of the offense that was required to be proved or admitted. Austin has not demonstrated that a Supreme Court decision has been retroactively applied to support his assertion that he was convicted of a nonexistent firearm offense. Austin has not demonstrated that this claim falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. The district court did not err in dismissing Austin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b239-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
