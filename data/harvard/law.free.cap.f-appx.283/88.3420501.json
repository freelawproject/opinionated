He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. The district court has denied the bail motion, and we find there has been no undue delay in the district court with regard to the \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, although we grant leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis, we deny the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
