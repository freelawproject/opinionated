Warfield, </em>225 Fed.Appx. 241 (5th Cir. 2007), and remanded the case for further consideration in light of the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) . <em>See Warfield v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 864, 169 L.Ed.2d 713 (2008) .</p>\n<p id=\"b260-28\">In the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Defendant-Appellant Pearlie Warfield (\u201cWar-field\u201d) pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit health care fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. In connection with her sentencing, Warfield urged the district court to consider her age, health, family respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>sibilities, and limited role in the offense as factors warranting a sentence below the Guidelines range. The district court declined to consider those factors in imposing sentence, finding that it was bound by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Guidry, </em>462 F.3d 373 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In <em>Guidry, </em>we vacated a non-Guidelines sentence in part because the sentencing court took into account the defendant\u2019s family circumstances without giving weight to the policy statement in United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5H1.6, which states that \u201cfamily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted.\u201d <em>Guidry, </em>462 F.3d at 377. We found that the sentencing court erred in considering the defendant\u2019s family ties as a factor without addressing whether those family ties were \u201cextraordinary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377-78. The district court below interpreted our opinion in <em>Guidry </em>to mean that it could not consider Warfield\u2019s age, health, family conditions, or role in the offense unless it found those factors \u201cextraordinary,\u201d noting that policy statements similar to the one at issue in <em>Guidry </em>exist for most or all of those factors. Because it did not find the factors extraordinary -with respect to Warfield, it imposed a sentence of fifteen months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, the district court repeatedly stated that its sentence would have been different had it not been constrained by <em>Guidry, </em>such that it could have considered those factors. It also expressed hope that the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court would find either that the district court\u2019s reading of <em>Guidry </em>was too broad or that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s standards as expressed in <em>Guidry </em>were erroneous. Warfield appealed, and this court affirmed Warfield\u2019s sentence, again relying on <em>Guidry. Warfield, </em>225 Fed.Appx. at 242. The Supreme Court granted Warfield\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Gall. Warfield, </em>128 S.Ct. 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">In their supplemental briefs, both parties agree that this case should be remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Gall. </em>In <em>Gall, </em>the Supreme Court expressly rejected \u201can appellate rule that requires \u2018ex-traordinary1 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 595. It emphasized that a district judge must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented and the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. If the district court decides an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, it should \u201cconsider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thus, <em>Gall </em>overruled <em>Guidry </em>to the extent that <em>Guidry </em>required a court to find that certain factors were extraordinary with respect to the defendant before deviating from the Guidelines range, instead of merely making an individualized assessment in light of all of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. Because the district court relied on <em>Guidry, </em>we agree with the parties that remand to the district court for resentencing in this case is appropriate. On remand, the district court should consider whether Warfield\u2019s age, health, family responsibilities, and role in the offense are factors that warrant an additional variance from the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In conclusion, we VACATE the sentence of the district court and REMAND for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>resentencing consistent with this opinion and with <em>Gall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
