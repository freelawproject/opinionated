On December 13, 2007, the district court found Dixon in violation of the terms and conditions of his supervised release and sentenced him to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment\u2014the statutory maximum\u2014and an additional one year term of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3) (2000); 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007). On appeal, Dixon asserts that the district court plainly erred in sentencing him to an additional year of supervised release. The Government agrees and has filed a motion to remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">On January 26, 2002, when Dixon committed the underlying offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) permitted reimposition of supervised release only if the district court imposed less than the maximum prison term for a defendant\u2019s supervised release violation. Thus, because the active prison term imposed upon Dixon for violation of supervised release was the statutory maximum, the imposition of an additional one year term of supervised release on Dixon constituted plain error that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Castorani, </em>88 Fed.Appx. 552 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished) (citing <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>285 F.3d 336, 342 (4th Cir.2002)). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Dixon violated the terms of supervised release, vacate the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>imposed by the district court, and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
