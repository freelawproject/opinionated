His complaint alleged that he is disabled because he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u201csemi-legally blind\u201d and that the defendants violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and his right of access to the courts by failing to provide him with equipment in the law library that would accommodate his eye condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Regarding his claims under the ADA, he argues that the district court erred in imposing an excessive burden of proof on him and in determining that the Corrections Corporation of America detention facility in Houston, Texas was not covered by Title II or Title III of the ADA. His arguments are unavailing because Title II and Title III of the ADA are not applicable to any of the defendants in this case. <em>See 42 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131(1), 12181(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Regarding his claim of denial of access to the courts, he challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to allege actual prejudice. He does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that he has filed at least 10 federal actions in the district court, and, moreover, his complaint did not allege actual injury with respect to court filings. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 290 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
