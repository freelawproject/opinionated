Rodriguez, </em>15 F.3d 408, 414-15 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-20\">Renteria contends that false statements that he made to a probation officer during his presentence interview concerning a November 2006 incident did not violate \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) because they did not constitute statements to the \u201cGovernment.\u201d Although a probation officer, for purposes of \u00a7 5C1.2, is not the Government, Renteria has not shown that he met his burden of providing the Government with all of the information and evidence that he had concerning the incident, and thus he has not shown that the district court plainly erred concerning this issue. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 146-47 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 F.3d 193, 196 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-21\">Renteria also argues that the district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility alone should not have prevented him from receiving the safety valve reduction. He further contends that he met the requirements of \u00a7 501.2(a) and that his failure to provide the Government with information concerning the November 2006 offense should not prevent him from receiving the safety valve reduction under \u00a7 501.2(a)(5) because it was not part of a common scheme or plan with the instant offense. However, nothing in the record indicates that the district court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Renteria a safety valve adjustment solely on the basis that he was denied acceptance of responsibility, and the district court\u2019s factual determinations concerning Renteria\u2019s eligibility for a safety valve adjustment cannot constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b226-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
