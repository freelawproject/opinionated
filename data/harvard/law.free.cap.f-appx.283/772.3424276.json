On appeal, Gonzalez-Lopez argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because the district court enhanced his sentence based on facts that it found under a preponderance-of-the-evidenee standard and that were not charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-16\">We review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1314 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-17\">Section 1326(a) of Title 8 provides that an alien who has been removed from the United States and subsequently re-enters the United States without receiving permission from the Attorney General may be imprisoned, but not for more than two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Subsection (b)(2) provides that any alien described in subsection (a), \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony, [ ] shall be fined under such Title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both[.]\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-18\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>a defendant who was charged with illegally re-entering the United States after being deported under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), argued that he could not be sentenced to more than two years\u2019 imprisonment because his prior aggravated felonies were not mentioned in the indictment, such that he could not be sentenced under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). 523 U.S. 224, 227, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). The Supreme Court rejected his argument and held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision, not a separate crime, and that \u201cneither the statute nor the Constitution requires the Government to charge ... an earlier conviction[ ] in the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-19\">The district court did not err in enhancing Gonzalez-Lopez\u2019s sentence using a pri- or aggravated felony that was not alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>in the indictment. This practice is permitted under <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>which remains binding precedent. <em>See United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2006) (recognizing that we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Toms </em>until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court). Furthermore, Gonzalez-Lopez did not object to the statement in the PSI nor the government\u2019s proffer that he had a prior conviction that constituted an aggravated felony. Therefore, he admitted that fact, and the district court did not engage in any erroneous judicial fact-finding about his prior conviction. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>480 F.3d 1277, 1281 (11th Cir.) (\u201cwhen a defendant fails to object to a fact contained in the PSI or in the government proffer at the plea colloquy, the defendant is deemed to have admitted the fact, which may then be used to enhance the sentence\u201d) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 175, 169 L.Ed.2d 119 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Accordingly, the district court committed no reversible error, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
