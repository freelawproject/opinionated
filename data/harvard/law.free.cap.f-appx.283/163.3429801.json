The district court sentenced Saenz-Torres to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by five years of supervised release. Saenz-Torres\u2019 sole challenge on appeal is to the district court\u2019s refusal to grant his request for a hearing on the Government\u2019s decision not to make a motion under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-16\">The explicit terms of the plea agreement at issue unambiguously provide that the Government had sole discretion to determine whether Saenz-Torres provided substantial assistance to the Government thereby warranting a motion under \u00a7 5K1.1.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> At the sentencing hearing, the Government described to the court multiple instances in which Saenz-Torres had been untruthful and had failed to disclose information he possessed to law enforcement, thereby frustrating the Government\u2019s continuing investigation of the drug conspiracy to which Saenz-Torres had pled guilty. The Government stated that because of Saenz-Torres\u2019 lack of credibility, it would be unable to use Saenz-Torres as a witness, and declined to make a substantial assistance motion on behalf of Saenz-Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-17\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of Saenz-Torres\u2019 request for a hearing to determine whether the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>had proved a breach by Saenz-Torres of his obligations under the plea agreement. Given that the Government retained sole discretion regarding whether it would make a substantial assistance motion, and there was no indication that the Government had acted in bad faith or with unconstitutional motive in its decision to refuse to make the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, Saenz-Torres was not entitled to a hearing. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Saenz-Torres\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b190-13\"> Saenz-Torres\u2019 assertion that paragraphs 18 and 19 of the agreement require a hearing on the issue of substantial assistance is without merit, as those provisions of the plea agreement clearly relate to remedies for breach of the agreement and are not applicable to the Government\u2019s discretionary decision of whether to make a motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
