Clark, Jr., federal prisoner # 09895-035, seeks leave to proceed in for-ma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for appointment of counsel. Clark was convicted of conspiracy to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base (crack) and distribution of 50 or more grams of crack and was sentenced, in 1999, to 360 months of imprisonment on the conspiracy count and 240 months of imprisonment on the distribution count. We affirmed Clark\u2019s conviction and sentence on direct appeal. Clark previously filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court denied, and he was denied a certificate of appealability by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-26\">Clark thereafter filed in the district court two freestanding motions for appointment of counsel, which the district court denied. This appeal followed. The district court denied Clark leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-27\">As Clark had no proceeding pending in the district court at the time he requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>appointment of counsel, Clark has not shown that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d required that the district court appoint counsel to represent him. <em>Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir.1985). Because Clark\u2019s appeal is frivolous and wholly without merit, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983), his IFP motion is denied and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
