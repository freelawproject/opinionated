The plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction prohibiting future advertising containing weight-loss claims and a mandatory injunction requiring the defendants to undertake a \u201ccorrective market campaign\u201d stating that consumption of dairy products would either cause weight gain or at best have no effect. In addition, Holmes demanded damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint on various grounds. The only grounds relevant to this appeal are the district court\u2019s conclusions that neither Virginia statute authorizes an action by a private plaintiff for injunctive relief and that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction applied to this case, because the plaintiffs appealed only those rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Because we agree with the district court\u2019s reading of the two Virginia statutes, we affirm on that ground and do not reach the second issue of primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Count I of the complaint was brought under the VCPA, which declares unlawful a broad range of \u201cfraudulent acts or practices\u201d by a supplier, including \u201c[mjisrepresenting that goods or services have certain quantities, characteristics, ingredients, uses, or benefits\u201d and \u201c[u]sing any other deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, or misrepresentation\u201d in connection with a consumer transaction. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 59.1-200(A)(5), (14). For their claim for injunctive relief, the plaintiffs rely on \u00a7 59.1-203, which authorizes suits for injunctions as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, <em>the Attorney General, any attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for any city, county, or town </em>may cause an action to be brought in the appropriate circuit court <em>in the name of the Commonwealth, or of the county, city, or town </em>to enjoin any violation of \u00a7 59.1-200. The circuit court having jurisdiction may enjoin such violations notwithstanding the existence of an adequate remedy at law. In any action under this section, it shall not be necessary that damages be proved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">B. Unless <em>the Attorney General ... </em>determines that a person subject to the provisions of this chapter intends to depart from this Commonwealth or to remove his property herefrom ... he shall, before initiating any legal proceedings as provided in this section, give notice in writing that such proceedings are contemplated____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">C. The circuit courts are authorized to issue temporary or permanent injunctions to restrain and prevent violations of \u00a7 59.1-200.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-14\">D. The Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services ... shall have the power to inquire into possible violations of \u00a7 59.1-200, and, if necessary, to request, but not to require, <em>an appropriate legal official </em>to bring an action to enjoin such violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">Even though \u00a7 59.1-203 grants no explicit authority to private parties to obtain injunctive relief for violations of the VCPA, the plaintiffs argue that subsection (C) stands separately and by implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>authorizes <em>private </em>suits for injunctive relief. As they explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">[Section 59.1-203(A) ] provides that the Attorney General or any other public prosecutor may bring an action to enjoin violations of the statute, \u201cnotwithstanding the existence of an adequate remedy at law....\u201d In contrast to \u00a7 59.1-203A, subsection C provides that \u201cthe circuit courts are authorized to issue temporary or permanent injunctions to restrain and prevent violations.\u201d This provision allows private parties to seek such relief. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\"><em>% % </em>#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">The reason for the lack of detail in Subsection C is apparent from review of the fundamental requirements for obtaining injunctive relief\u2014whether the legal remedy of damages is adequate to cure an irreparable harm that has been suffered.... In providing [in subsection A] that public prosecutors may obtain an injunction, \u201cnotwithstanding the existence of an adequate remedy at law,\u201d the Virginia legislature is making a distinction between those who are exempted from the general proof requirement for injunctive relief and those who are not. It follows that subsection C is included to allow for injunctive action for those [private parties], such as Appellants, who must prove that their legal remedies are inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 arguments must be rejected for several reasons. Although \u00a7 59.1-203(C) standing alone does, indeed, not specify <em>who </em>may seek the injunctions that the \u201ccircuit courts are authorized to issue,\u201d <em>id., </em>when that subsection is viewed in the context of \u00a7 59.1-203 as a whole, as well as within the overall structure of the VCPA, it becomes apparent that the Act provides no <em>private </em>cause of action for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\"><em>First, </em>we begin by observing that no language in \u00a7 59.1-203 explicitly authorizes <em>private </em>suits for injunctions, and certainly no language does so with the clarity of language used in \u00a7 59.1-204(A), which does authorize private suits, but only for damages or a penalty. Section 59.1-204, entitled \u201cIndividual action for damages or penalty,\u201d states broadly that \u201c[a]ny person\u201d who suffers loss may bring an action to recover \u201cactual damages\u201d or a $500 penalty, \u201cwhichever is greater.\u201d In contrast, \u00a7 59.1-203 refers narrowly to the ability of \u201cthe Attorney General, any attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for any city, county, or town\u201d to bring suits for injunction. It is \u201csignificant that the General Assembly ... chose not to use language parallel\u201d to \u00a7 59.1-204 in defining the cause of action in \u00a7 59.1-203. <em>Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va. v. Harris, </em>239 Va. 119, 387 S.E.2d 772, 775 (1990). Since \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-203 and 59.1-204 are part of a common and comprehensive statutory scheme, we conclude that the better reading of this narrowly-tailored language in the VCPA is that two distinct classes of <em>plaintiffs\u2014public officials </em>on the one hand, and <em>private parties </em>on the other\u2014are authorized to seek two different kinds of relief. <em>See, e.g., H.D. Oliver Funeral Apartments, Inc. v. Dignity Funeral Servs., Inc., </em>964 F.Supp. 1033, 1039 (E.D.Va.1997) (\u201cNor is there any provision in the VCPA authorizing Oliver to seek an injunction against Altmeyer [for conduct allegedly violating the statute]\u201d); <em>VNB Capital Corp. v. Fisher, </em>1982 WL 215231 at *5 (Va.Cir.Ct.1982) (\u201cAlthough the primary enforcement mechanism provided in the VCPA is that of injunctive and civil actions prosecuted by the Attorney General or local enforcement officials, Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-201, 59.1-202, 59.1-203 and 59.1-206, the Act also provides for individual consumer remedies of damages and resti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tution[,] Va.Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-204, 59.1-205 and 59.1-207\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><em>Second, </em>even though \u00a7 59.1-203(C) does not contain an explicit statement of who can sue for injunctive relief, it cannot for that reason be properly read to contain an implicit authorization for <em>private </em>actions for injunctive relief. Subsection (C) is not a free-standing provision; rather, it is part of \u00a7 59.1-203 as a whole and follows subsection (A), which authorizes only <em>public </em>officials\u2014\u201cthe Attorney General, any attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for any city, county, or town\u201d\u2014to seek an injunction \u201cin the name of the Commonwealth, or of the county, city, or town.\u201d Likewise, it follows subsection (B), which speaks of what measures the Attorney General and other <em>public officials </em>must take before bringing a suit for injunction as authoi\u2019ized by subsection (A). Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 59.1-203(B). And no mention of any private cause of action is present in subsection (D), which follows subsection (C) and again relates to when an officer of the Commonwealth may request that another <em>public official </em>bring a suit authorized by subsection (A) to enjoin conduct in violation of the VCPA. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 59.1-203(D). Given that subsection (C) follows subsection (A)\u2019s authorization of suits by public officials and is found between two other subsections unambiguously dealing with the power of public officials to seek injunctions under subsection (A), the plain and natural reading of subsection (C) is that it, too, qualifies subsection (A) and concerns suits brought by public officials thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The plaintiffs argue that this reading renders subsection (C) surplusage, because subsection (A) already authorizes injunctions. While subsection (A) of \u00a7 59.1-203 does provide that the circuit courts may issue injunctions in suits brought by public officials without regard to traditional equitable requirements, such as proof of damages and inadequacy of remedies at law, it is silent as to the <em>type </em>of injunction that may be granted. Subsection (C) therefore qualifies subsection (A) by stating specifically that either \u201ctemporary or permanent\u201d injunctions may be issued in suits by public officials, as the Virginia legislature has repeatedly chosen to state elsewhere in the Virginia Code despite the seeming obviousness of that fact. <em>See, e.g., </em>Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 3.1-296.21 (authorizing court to grant, upon application, \u201ca temporary or permanent injunction\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3.1-106.17 (same); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3.1-828.13 (same); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 56-525 (same). Thus, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that subsection (A)\u2019s authorization of suits for injunction means that \u201c[i]t goes without saying that ... the courts may issue either temporary or permanent injunctions,\u201d the General Assembly\u2019s decision to make explicit in subsection (C) what the plaintiffs would have us <em>assume </em>in subsection (A) cannot somehow render that legislative statement surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\"><em>Third, </em>the bifurcated remedy scheme of the VCPA, whereby individuals may sue for damages under \u00a7 59.1-204 and government officials may sue for injunctions under \u00a7 59.1-203, is reflected and assumed in other provisions of the VCPA. Subsection (A) of \u00a7 59.1-204.1, for example, provides a two-year statute of limitations for \u201c[a]ny <em>individual action pursuant to \u00a7 59.1-204,\u201d </em>the VCPA damages provision. (Emphasis added). This statute of limitations makes no mention of a time limitation for individual suits for injunctions under \u00a7 59.1-203, suggesting that such <em>individual suits for injunctions </em>are not contemplated under the VCPA. Likewise, \u00a7 59.1-204.1(B) tolls the limitations period for individual actions when \u201cany of the authorized government agencies\u201d files suit, but only for <em>individual \u201caction!s] under \u00a7 59.1-204 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Section 59.1-206, another provision of the VCPA, refers to the ability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u201cthe Attorney General, the attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for the county, city, or town\u201d to recover civil penalties for violations of injunctions issued under \u00a7 59.1-203, but it makes no mention of a similar recovery by <em>private parties </em>seeking injunctions. And \u00a7 59.1-207, which concerns unintentional violations of the VCPA states that attorney\u2019s fees and costs may be awarded to <em>\u201cindividuals aggrieved\u201d \u201cpursuant to \u00a7 59.1-2CH B,\u201d </em>the damages provision, but makes no mention of awarding similar costs of suit for individuals suing under \u00a7 59.1-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">It is apparent from this statutory structure that damage suits under \u00a7 59.1-204 are the private remedy authorized by the VCPA, and that no corresponding cause of action for private suits exists under \u00a7 59.1-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">For these reasons, we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs were not authorized to bring claims for injunctive relief under the VCPA and therefore it was appropriate for the district court to have dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Count II of the complaint was brought under the VFAS, which, in relevant part, makes it a misdemeanor to use \u201cany promise, assertion, representation or statement of fact which is untrue, deceptive or misleading\u201d in connection with certain advertisements to the public. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-216.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Like the VCPA, the false advertising statute contains a bifurcated remedy scheme, whereby <em>government officials </em>may seek to enjoin violative conduct and <em>individuals </em>may seek damages. Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-68.2 to 59.1-68.5. The statute contains two remedial provisions concerning injunctions, both of which undisputedly authorize only suits by public officials. The first of these states that \u201cthe <em>Attorney General </em>may investigate and bring an action in the name of the Commonwealth to enjoin any violation of [the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 59.1-68.2 (emphasis- added). And the second provides that \u201cany <em>attorney for the Commonwealth, or the attorney for any city or county, </em>may investigate and cause to be brought suit in the name of the Commonwealth, or of the county or city, to enjoin any violation of [the statute].\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 59.1-68.4 (emphasis added). In contrast, each of the VFAS damages provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-68.3 and 59.1-68.5, allows <em>\u201c[a]ny person </em>who suffers loss\u201d as a result of a violation of the VFAS to \u201cbring an <em>individual action </em>to recover <em>damages, </em>or $100, whichever is greater.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 59.1-68.3, 59.1-68.5 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">In light of the unambiguous language of the two VFAS injunction provisions, the plaintiffs do not contend that any statutory text directly authorizes a private suit for injunctive relief. Rather, they argue that \u201c[bjecause injunctive relief is a standard remedy when legal remedies are not adequate, it may be said that injunctive relief is an implicit extension of any statute granting damages,\u201d and that there is therefore an <em>\u201cimplied </em>right to injunctive relief pursuant to Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-68.3 and 59.1-68.5,\u201d the VFAS damages provisions. (Emphasis added). But as with the VCPA, the explicitly bifurcated structure of the statute, as well as the distinct language used to create a cause of action for damages that may be brought by <em>\u201c[a]ny person </em>who suffers loss\u201d and a cause of action for injunctive relief that may be brought by only specifically named public officials, indicates that there can be no such implied right. <em>Compare </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-68.3 and 59.1-68.5 (damages) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 59.1-68.2 and 59.1-68.4 (injunctions). In addition, \u00a7 59.1-68.3 itself states that in an individual action for damages under the false advertising statute, exhibits from any action \u201cin which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Attorney General </em>has obtained a permanent injunction\u201d may be introduced into evidence. (Emphasis added); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 59.1-68.5 (noting same where <em>\u201cthe Commonwealth, or a county or city </em>has obtained a permanent injunction\u201d) (emphasis added). The inclusion of this language in the statute, with no proviso made for introduction of evidence from <em>private </em>suits for injunction, belies the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the legislature implicitly intended to authorize private claims for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">With this statutory language and structure, we are not free to imply a private equitable remedy. The statute reveals a conscious choice by the Virginia legislature to limit its availability to suits by public officials. <em>See Sch. Bd. of City of Norfolk v. Giannoutsos, </em>238 Va. 144, 380 S.E.2d 647, 649 (1989) (\u201c[WJhere a statute creates a right and provides a remedy for the vindication of that right, then that remedy is exclusive unless the statute says otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The plaintiffs nonetheless contend additionally that an independent basis for obtaining private injunctive relief exists under the Virginia false advertising statute because it is a <em>criminal </em>statute. They base their position on <em>Black &amp; White Cars, Inc. v. Groome Transportation, Inc., </em>247 Va. 426, 442 S.E.2d 391 (1994), arguing that in that case \u201cthe Virginia Supreme Court recognized that an injunction may issue to private parties where violation of a penal statute results in damages that would be difficult to quantify,\u201d even where the statute does not specifically authorize such equitable relief for private parties. But the plaintiffs read <em>Black &amp; White Cars </em>too broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In that case, the plaintiff taxicab companies sought an injunction against an unlicensed competitor who was advertising as a taxi service, in violation of a Norfolk city ordinance. <em>Black &amp; White Cars, </em>442 S.E.2d at 393. Although the court permitted the plaintiffs to obtain an injunction, it began by noting that \u201cthe general rule\u201d was \u201cthat a penal statute or ordinance does not automatically create a private right of action, and that equity will not enter an injunction merely because such a statute has been violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394. Importantly, the court\u2019s reason for finding an exception to this general rule was the principle that \u201can injunction is appropriate relief where violation of a penal statute or penal ordinance results in <em>special damage to property rights </em>which would be <em>difficult to quantify.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The taxicab companies, as franchisees of the city holding \u201cvaluable property rights\u201d in their licenses, made this showing. <em>Id. </em>at 395. For this distinguishable reason, <em>Black &amp; White Cars </em>was noted to be an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">In this case the plaintiffs have not alleged the existence of any property right akin to the taxi franchises in <em>Black &amp; White Cars </em>that could suffer special damage by a violation of the VFAS, an omission that is fatal to their argument. Moreover, reading a private equitable cause of action into the VFAS under <em>Black &amp; White Cars </em>would be particularly inappropriate where, as here, the statute is not silent as to whether a private cause of action exists, but rather explicitly authorizes a private cause of action that is limited to only damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">Because neither the VCPA nor the VFAS permits a private suit for injunctive relief, we affirm the order of the district court dismissing the plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief. And because we rely on this ground to affirm, we do not reach the issue of primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
