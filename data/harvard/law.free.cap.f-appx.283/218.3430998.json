Lampton argues that the prior Louisiana felony convictions used to enhance his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) were insufficient to support the enhancement under <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), because the convictions would have been misdemeanor convictions under federal law. He maintains that <em>Lopez </em>is retroactively applicable. He asserts that his claim is cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) because it shows that he is actually innocent of the sentence enhancement. As Lampton is challenging only his sentence and not his conviction, his claim does not fall within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) and is not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Pursuant to 5th Cir.
