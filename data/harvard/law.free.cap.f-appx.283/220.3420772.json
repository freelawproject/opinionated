Polk argues that his claims fall within the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) because the ruling on his \u00a7 2255 motion denying his challenge based on <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), as harmless error makes \u00a7 2255 inadequate to test the legality of his sentence under <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">A \u00a7 2241 application attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be considered only where the petitioner establishes that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). To show that \u00a7 2255 was rendered inadequate or ineffective in his case, Polk must show that his claim (1) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and (2) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">By his own admission, Polk\u2019s challenge under <em>Richardson </em>to the legality of his conviction was raised in his initial \u00a7 2255 motion in the Eastern District of Michigan, the district in which he was convicted and sentenced. His argument was not foreclosed under Sixth Circuit law. <em>See Murr v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 895, 905-06 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Richardson </em>challenges could be retroactively applied on collateral review in a \u00a7 2255 motion). That Polk brought a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion raising this claim and that he would now not be able to meet the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion raising this claim does not render \u00a7 2255 an inadequate remedy. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Polk has also not shown that his claim that his conviction and sentence violate <em>Ring </em>comports with the savings clause criteria because the Supreme Court has held that <em>Ring </em>does not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review. <em>See Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 358, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004). The judgment of the district court dismissing Polk\u2019s application for lack of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
