He was sentenced to twelve months and one day imprisonment. On appeal, Raxcaco argues his sentence was unreasonable based on the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and he challenges the district court\u2019s decision to impose a variant sentence. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-19\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, it must calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range. It must then consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine an appropriate sentence. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-20\">Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-23\">If there are no procedural errors, the appellate court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. While the court may presume a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable, it may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>imposing a variant sentence and to its determination regarding the extent of any variance. Even if the reviewing court would have reached a different sentencing result on its own, this fact alone is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">Here, the district court followed the necessary procedural steps in sentencing Raxcaco, properly calculating the Guidelines range and considering that recommendation in conjunction with the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In light of the facts of this case, and the district court\u2019s meaningful articulation of its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its bases for departing from the recommended guideline range, we find the district court\u2019s decision to depart, and the extent of the departure, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the <em>court </em>and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
