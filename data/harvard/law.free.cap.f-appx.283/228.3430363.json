Gallegos-Orozco is serving a 292-month sentence for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute more than 100 grams of methamphetamine. Gallegos-Orozco\u2019s motion to file an out-of-time reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-22\">Gallegos-Orozco argues that the district court erred in finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 petition and that the district court erred in failing to consider the merits of his \u00a7 2241 petition because he had alleged a fundamental defect in his criminal conviction and he made a claim of actual innocence. He argues that the district court could not construe his petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-23\">The district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is subject to de novo review. <em>See Hager v. NationsBank N.A., </em>167 F.3d 245, 247 (5th Cir.1999). Gallegos-Orozco is incarcerated in Kentucky. Accordingly, the Southern District of Texas was not Gallegos-Orozco\u2019s custodial court, and the district court correctly concluded that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to consider his \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2241; <em>United States v. Gabor, </em>905 F.2d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1990). Further, the district court correctly concluded that it could not construe Gallegos-Orozco\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion because such a motion would be successive, and Gallegos-Orozco had not obtained this court\u2019s permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See \u00a7 </em>2255(h); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
