Within the rules applicable to cases of this kind, therefore, a cause of action was apparent, and the proof warranted a recovery unless the jury should accept as sufficient the defendant\u2019s evidence of its system of inspection, which they were not bound to do. Palmer v. D. &amp; H. C. Co., 120 N. Y. 170, 24 N. E. 302, 17 Am. St. Rep. 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">The case of Kelly v. Railroad Co., 109 N. Y. 44, 15 N. E. 879, relied upon by the appellant, had to do with the proof necessary to sustain an action where the passenger\u2019s injury was due to a fall caused by catching her clothing in a broken hook of a window shade, and it was held that the defect was not sufficiently dangerous to require inspection and correction in avoidance of such an accident. The circumstances of the accident in the case at bar involved an omission of care in the operative means of conveyance, and, for the reasons stated in the Palmer Case (at page 177 of 120 N. Y., page 304 of 24 N. E. [17 Am. St. Rep. 629]), the Kelly Case is clearly distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
