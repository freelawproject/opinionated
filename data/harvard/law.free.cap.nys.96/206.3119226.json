One Mardorf purchased of the defendant a quantity of tools, machinery, drills, etc., and subsequently sold the property to the plaintiff. The defendant claimed that the sale did not include a certain tool called a \u201cdividing head.\u201d Pie brought a replevin action against Mardorf, and Mardorf claimed that he had sold the tool to these plaintiffs. The replevin action was subsequently dismissed, leaving the tool in the defendant\u2019s possession, but the ownership in question. \"Plaintiff thereupon demanded the tool of the defendant, and upon his refusal brought this ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tion.
