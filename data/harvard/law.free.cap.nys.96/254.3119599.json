Plaintiff\u2019s claim is that, while he was standing in the aisle of a crowded street car, the sudden starting of the car threw the people in front of him against him with sufficient force to produce a fall from which the injuries complained of are alleged to have resulted. The car was somewhat crowded when the plaintiff boarded it. The plaintiff did not have hold of a strap, but he testified that there was none available at the place where he was standing. The court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">\u201cI charge that there is no question of contributory negligence in the case; that the plaintiff has shown himself free from contributory negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The respondent seeks to sustain this charge by cases which hold that it is not contributory negligence as a matter of law to board a crowded street car and occupy a position such as the plaintiff occupied when injured; but these cases are beside the question here. The inferences to be drawn from the evidence, as well as the credibility of the plaintiff, were for the jury; and, while the plaintiff may not have been guilty of negligence as matter of law, it is obvious that it was error to charge as matter of law that he was not guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">For this reason the judgment and-order must be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
