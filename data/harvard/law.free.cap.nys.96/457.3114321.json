J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0Ug\">The plaintiff claims to have been injured by the negligent starting of one of the defendant\u2019s trolley cars, while he was attempting to board it on Third avenue at Stuyvesant street in the borough of Manhattan. The appellant raises no question on the appeal as to the facts of the accident, but confines its assertion of grievance to two rulings at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">One of these rulings relates to the reception of the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s doctor, to the effect, that at the time of the trial the plaintiff was suffering from a varicose vein in the injured leg,. Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>though the doctor admitted that he could not ascribe it to the accident, the evidence was proper, inasmuch, as it was proven that it did not exist before the accident and was discovered in the injured member impiediately afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">But it was error to exclude the evidence, offered on the defendant\u2019s behalf, designed to show that one of its rules required that a report be made to it of the happening of an accident. The defendant was entitled to insist that no accident had occurred; it was permitted to prove that no report of the accident had in fact been made by the conductor in charge of the car; and it was entitled to strengthen and supplement this evidence, by competent proof that one of its rules required such a report to be made in all cases. See Shadletsky v. New York City Ry. Co. (Sup.) 88 N. Y. Supp. 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Judgment of the Municipal Court reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
