Siff, composing the firm of Louis Siff &amp; Bros., brought an action in the Municipal Court for the Seventh District, Borough of Manhattan, against the defendant to recover the sum of $72 for its alleged failure as a common carrier to transport and deliver within a reasonable time certain merchandise. Such proceedings were had that the defendant obtained judgment for costs against the plaintiff, taxed at $111. The judgment was docketed in the office of the clerk of the Municipal Court and the time for plaintiff to appeal has expired. A transcript of said judgment was filed, and said judgment was docketed in the New York county clerk\u2019s office. Thereafter an execution was issued, and execution returned unsatisfied. This proceeding was instituted against the assignors of said claim to charge them with the costs under section 3247 of the Code of civil procedure which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201cWhere an action is brought in the name of another by a transferee of the cause of action, or by any other person, who is beneficially interested therein, * * * the transferee or other person so interested, is liable for costs, in the like cases and to the same extent as if he was the plaintiff; and where costs are awarded against the plaintiff, the court may by order, direct the person so liable to pay them.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-15\">The proceeding resulted in the order appealed from, which, inter alia, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">\u201cThat said Louis Siff, Max Siff, and Moses L. Siff, composing the firm of Louis Siff &amp; Bros., as the persons who brought the aforesaid action, entitled \u2018Philip Friedman, Plaintiff, against Metropolitan Steamship Company, Defendant.\u2019 and as the persons who were beneficially interested in the recovery therein, be, and they each are hereby, directed to pay \u00ab * * the costs recovered * * * against * * * the plaintiff in this aforesaid action, amounting to the sum of $111.30. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-18\">Upon the merits, namely, that the appellants were the persons who were beneficially interested in said suit, the evidence fully sustains the action of the learned court in making the order at bar. It is necessary, therefore, to consider only the questions raised as to practice, jurisdiction, and technical requirements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>By section <em>261 of </em>the Municipal Court act (Laws 1903, p. 1565, c. 580) upon the docketing of the judgment of the. Municipal Court upon the transcript in the county clerk\u2019s office, \u201cthenceforth the judgment is deemed a judgment of the Supreme Court and may be enforced accordingly.\u201d The proceeding is a special proceeding founded upon the statute, summary in its nature, and properly commenced by notice or order to show cause. Marvin v. Marvin, 78 N. Y. 541. It has for its basis the judgment awarding costs against the plaintiff. It therefore is a proceeding to enforce the judgment ; and, as the judgment is now a statutory judgment of the Supreme Court, this court, and not the Municipal Court, has jurisdiction of this special proceeding. As a statutory remedy to collect the amount found due by the judgment, by seeking to have substituted for the nominal party the real parties in interest, it is analogous to the other special proceedings after judgment of which up,on docketed Municipal Court judgments this court has been held to have jursidiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">There is, however, one objection urged which is <em>of </em>weight. In pleading or proving a judgment of a court of limited or special jurisdiction, the facts necessary to confer jurisdiction to render the judgment must be fully set forth, or every fact necessary to confer jurisdiction to render judgment in the action must be recited. Section 533 of the Code allows an alternative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">\u201cIn pleading a judgment or other determination of a court or officer of special jurisdiction, it is not necessary to state the facts conferring jurisdiction ; but the judgment or determination may be stated to have been duly given or made.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The moving papers do not set forth the necessary jurisdictional facts, nor do they comply with the Code provision cited. In Werbelovsky v. Michael, 106 App. Div. 138, 94 N. Y. Supp. 156, the learned Appellate Division in the Second Department set aside an injunction in a judgment creditor\u2019s action upon a Municipal Court judgment upon this precise point, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u201cThe mere fact that, a judgment was rendered in the Municipal Court in his favor and against said defendant does not establish his right to maintain the action; and there is no presumption that the court had jurisdiction\u201d (citing Frees v. Blyth, 99 App. Div. <em>541, 91 </em>N. Y. Supp. <em>103).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Dor this reason the order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, with leave to renew the application upon proper papers to the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
