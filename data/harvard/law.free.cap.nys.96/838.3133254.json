Not long after the title was taken a gas company showed that it owned the ranges and took them away. This action and recovery are for their value. While movable, the attached ranges were so of kin to fixtures that the parties might by agreement treat them as of the realty, and not requiring mention in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>the conveyance to pass with the land and appurtenances. Here they were included in a covenant of sale and warranty which did not merge, as the defendant would have it, in the conveyance (Morris v. Whitcher, 20 N. Y. 41; Stearns v. Lichtenstein, 48 App. Div. 498, 62 N. Y. Supp. 949), and so upon breach thereof through the removal of the ranges by a third party the real owner was bound to make good their loss. It may be remarked that the case chiefly relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant does not necessarily hold all that might seem upon a first perusal and that Howes v. Baker, 3 Johns. 506, 3 Am. Dec. 526, has been mentioned (20 N. Y. 47) as one of two cases \"which perhaps have not been always understood in later times.\u201d The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
