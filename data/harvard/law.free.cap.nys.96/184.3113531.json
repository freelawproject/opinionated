It appears that the defendant, as a connecting carrier, received the box in St. Louis, and that it reached its destination here on or about April 18, 1903, but was not delivered until a year and a half later, when it was discovered in a storage warehouse, where it had been stored by the defendant. The address upon the box read, \u201cWm. Wood &amp; Co., New York, N. Y.,\u201d while the shipping ticket read, \"W. Wood, N. York, N. Y.\u201d Though the shipping ticket was received by the defendant from a preceding carrier, it does not appear that it constituted the contract of shipment. The box received and carried bore the name of the consignee and destination, and notice mailed to that name and destination would have fulfilled the diligence in such cases required of the defendant, unfulfilled by notice mailed to the \u00f1am\u00e9 upon the shipping ticket to a chance address selected from 40 such appearing in the City Directory. It may not thus escape its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
