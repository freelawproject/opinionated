The finding is based upon the levelings taken of the average minimum flow of water; whereas, the rights of the parties are to be governed by the ordinary stage of the water. The finding that \u201csuch backing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>the water greatly reduced the plaintiff\u2019s head at said site, so that in low and medium water the power will be seriously diminished,\u201d erroneously implies that the rights of the parties may be based upon \u201clow and medium water,\u201d instead of the ordinary flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">The seventh finding of fact, determining the head or ,height of the fall of water which could be produced at the proposed site for a dam, is also based upon the erroneous figures found in said eleventh finding, as is also the rest of this finding. The facts found in said seventh finding of fact, and in the eighth, and the second, third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs of the eleventh finding of fact, are matters which should be passed upon and determined upon a reference or by a commission in assessing the damages which the plaintiff has and will sustain, if any, by reason of the construction and maintenance of the defendant\u2019s said dams at their present height, and the same should therefore have been omitted from the findings as a basis of an interlocutory judgment. While it is unfortunate that a new trial of this case should be had, still we see no other way to dispose of it, unless the parties stipulate to correct the errors referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
