Interurban St. Ry. Co., 97 App. Div. 137, 89 N. Y. Supp. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-21\">He also' urges as improper the failure of the moving affidavit to state that the affiant had fully and fairly stated the case to counsel, with the name and address of such counsel, as required by rule 23 of practice. While so determined by this court, notwithstanding the statement that he has been advised by his counsel (Bowman Cycle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>Co. v. Dyer, 23 Misc. Rep. 620, 622, 52 N. Y. Supp. 159), it was so determined before issue joined, which is not this case. Here the defense and its merits have been exhibited by answer, and therefore the rule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements.
