Claiming to have fulfilled substantially all of his undertaking, the plaintiff brought this action, and has recovered judgment f\u00f3r a balance of $300 on the agreement, and $492 besides for extra work. These sums are not supported sufficiently by his proof, which fails to show substantial performance of his undertaking. He agreed, for example, to, but did not, alter all the closet partitions between the dining rooms and kitchens, fill up door openings to dining rooms, cut new openings in kitchens, and furnish new doors, trim and hardware. As excuse for nonperformance, he offered the assertion: \u201cMy agreement specifies distinctly that I shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d although there was.for it only the provision, \u201cthe ice box partition is not to be removed.\u201d Again he said: \u201cI did not do those new doors; that was excepted from my contract.\u201d The contract shows no such exception. Of 16 new wardrobes, he put in but 2, a substantial omission, amounting to 10 per cent, of his whole undertaking, according to' testimony, not contradicted, that the wardrobes, of rather elaborate fashion and fittings, were worth $15 apiece. For another omission, one equaling 15 per cent, of the contract price, he claimed verbal authorization from Mr. Silverman, who denied it, and who was plausibly supported by the architect and by defendant\u2019s son. Turning to the claims for extra work: Possibly to avoid the call \u201ceach man to his trade,\u201d it was provided, as noted above, that the plaintiff should \u201cdo all the carpenter work to be done,\u201d but he asserted a claim of $150 for the cutting of the beams, called \u201cheadering,\u201d with other items for other things covered, at least, in part, by his agreement and undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
