It having been determined that the right of the plaintiff to recover under the second cause of action must be based upon a breach of the contract by the defendant, it was proper for the court to allow an amendment to the complaint, so as to present the questions at issue. The court had power to make such an amendment whether, strictly speaking, a new cause of action was or was not alleged. We think that such an amendment, however, should only be allowed upon condition that the plaintiff should pay all the costs of the action up to the date of the <em>amendment; </em>and the order appealed from should be modified, requiring the payment of such costs as a condition for allowing the plaintiff to serve the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be modified accordingly, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
