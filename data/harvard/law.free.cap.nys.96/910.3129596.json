When the time-came for closing title, a defect, in the title of one of the parcels to be conveyed by the defendant was discovered, and deeds of the other two parcels were exchanged, the consideration in the deed from the defendant to the plaintiff of the parcel with the good title being stated at $15,000 ; and a supplementary agreement was made, in which the plaintiff agreed to accept partial performance and to give a reasonable adjournment to enable the defendant to make complete performance in consideration of the defendant\u2019s agreement to perfect the title to the remaining parcel and convey the same to the plaintiff. After several adjournments and extensions of time had been granted, the defendant being unable to perform further, this action was brought by the plaintiff to recover damages for such partial failure of performance; and the only question litigated on the trial was the question of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-20\">Plaintiff contends that the court erred in holding as matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the difference between the sum of $15,000, the consideration stated in the deed of the parcel conveyed, and the sum of $18,000, the valuation of the two parcels stated in the original agreement. While ordinarily in such an action the plaintiff is entitled to recover back the purchase price, this is not a case of purchase and sale, and it is expressly stated in the original agreement that the valuations are stated for the purpose of the contract of exchange, and while the plaintiff undertook to show, by subsequent conversations between the parties and their agents, that the. sum of $3,000 was fixed by agreement between the parties as the value of the parcel not conveyed, we think the trial court was right in holding that the evidence failed to establish any thing more than an agreement fixing the price for the sole purpose of carrying out the contract of exchange. The correct measure of damages was the value of the property, together with such reasonable and necessary expenses as the plaintiff incurred in the attempted performance of the contract; and the supplementary agreement expressly provided that the defendant should reimburse the plaintiff for any reasonable expense incurred by reason of the change in the contract and manner of performance and the adjournment and delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">While the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was attempting to prove the damages sustained by the plaintiff by way of expenses incurred, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-6\">\u2022\u25a0Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Then your honor excludes all the items of expense\u2014 as to the legal expenses incurred by the attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-7\">\u201cThe Court: Tes; but that is all that I have in mind. I have nothing in mind except the commissions and expenses of examining title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-8\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Tour honor excludes the evidence of the apportionment of taxes and interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-9\">\u201cThe Court: Tes; I exclude that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-10\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Then your honor will exclude, I suppose, what he paid for the searching of that title?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-11\">\u201cThe Court: Tes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-12\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: And the proportionate part of the brokerage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-13\">\u201cThe Court: I will exclude that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-14\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Counsel: As to those we except.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">The court, in its charge, limited the damages by way of reimbursement for expenses incurred to the reasonable value of the services of the attorney employed by the plaintiff upon the different adjournments, to which an exception was taken. We do not understand the learned counsel for the respondent to argue seriously that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the examination of the title, and certainly the law is well settled in this state that such expenses are recoverable. Northridge v. Moore, 118 N. Y. 419, 23 N. E. 570. But it is argued that the exception does not present a question for review, for the reason that no question was asked calling for a ruling. The trial court is not obliged to rule on offers, and it is undoubtedly the better practice to require the exceptions to be taken to the rulings upon objections to questions put, thus presenting the precise question sought to be raised; but where the court has distinctly stated that it will exclude a certain class of evidence, and has permitted an exception to be taken to such ruling with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>out requiring the precise questions to be put, we think the^exception presents the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. There can be no doubt, from the colloquy quoted, that the court intended its statement, to be understood as a distinct ruling upon the question, and permitted the exception to be taken to the ruling for the purpose of obviating the necessity of taking the time necessary to' raise the question upon the record by question, objection, answer, and ruling. If the court did not so intend, when the exception to the remark was taken, the court should have distinctly advised counsel that he could only raise the question by question and exception to the ruling, excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The plaintiff sought to prove the value of the property by an expert witness, who testified to his familiarity with the property 'and to his knowledge of sales of property in that neighborhood, but who had not actually made any sales himself. The defendant sought to show the value of the property by expert witnesses who testified to having made actual sales of property in the neighborhood. The court in its charge, immediately after referring'to the defendant\u2019s witnesses as having been \u201cselling property down there for the last three or four years,\u201d and to the fact that their testimony was corroborated by the evidence of the prices for which property had actually been soldi said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201cSo the court can very well see, when your verdict comes in, whether you have obeyed or whether you have disregarded the court\u2019s injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel requested the court to charge the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-8\">\u201cThat they are to say which of the opinions of the experts they shall give credit to, and which opinion they will believe.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">To which the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-10\">\u201cThat is for them to say, but it is for the court hereafter to observe whether that finding is according to the weight of evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">And an -exception was taken to the modification. Exception was also taken to the remark made by the court in the main charge quoted supra, and in \u2018taking the exception the plaintiff\u2019s counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-12\">\u201cI submit that is an intimidation of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">To.which the court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-14\">\u201cNo; the -jury is perfectly free to act, but I caution them not to waste either their time, which the public has to pay for, or mine, which the public has to pay for, in a trial which goes for nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">After the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had excepted to said\" remark the court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-16\">\u201cIt is the duty of the court, where it can see that the jury has disobeyed its injunctions, to set aside what they have done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">To which remark an exception was also taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-18\">The court might just as well have told the jury that, if they did not accept the value given by the defendant\u2019s witnesses, their verdict would be set aside, and the jury practically obeyed the injunction, because the verdict rendered is only slightly more than the amount named by said witnesses, together with. the. legal expenses incurred in connection with the different adjournments testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>ness. Such invasion of the province of the jury should not be disregarded in this court, unless at least a verdict ought to have been directed in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
