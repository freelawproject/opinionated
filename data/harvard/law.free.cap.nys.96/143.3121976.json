Defendants claim that this was an extension of credit, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>relieved them from their guaranty. When the notes were not paid, plaintiff sued defendants on the guaranty. It is the claim of plaintiff that defendants agreed to the taking of the notes, at the time they were made, and he produces a witness, an employ\u00e9 of plaintiff, who swears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\u201cI told him [Greenberg] that Mr. Lamport [the plaintiff] sent me down to ask Mr. Greenberg whether the acceptance of the notes would be satisfactory to him, in payment of the Fawer Slipper account, and he said it would be all right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">There is a conflict of testimony, but the court believed plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and gave judgment for plaintiff for $72.80. There has been no revocation of the guaranty or termination thereof by defendants, either verbally or in writing. Defendants, however, claim that it was intended to cover merely the first purchase made by the company of plaintiff to the extent of $100. The defendant Greenberg swears: .\u201cI gave a guaranty of $100 for the first purchase.\u201d This assertion does not appear to be directly contradicted by the plaintiff, although the theory of plaintiff\u2019s case was that the guaranty was continuous. It appears that goods were sold to the company by plaintiff, after the making of the guaranty, to the extent of $268.55; that of this sum $123.75 were apparently paid in cash; that $120 were paid, in five notes of $24 each, of which notes two remain unpaid; that the amount of these unpaid notes\u2014i. e., $48\u2014together with the $24.80, the amount remaining due and not included in any of the notes, make up the $72.80, sued for in this action. It will therefore be observed that the first purchases, to the extent of a greater sum than the amount of the defendants\u2019 guaranty, have been paid for. The wording of the guaranty itself would seem to imply that it was intended to cover only the first $100 worth of goods purchased. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\u201c* * * We hereby guaranty the sum o\u00ed $100, the amount which they will sell to the Fawer Slipper Company,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">That is to say, the plaintiff was to sell $100 worth of goods to the company, which defendants were to guaranty would be paid for. This language hardly seems to imply that the guaranty is to cover an indefinite number of purchases up to the sum limited of $100. It seems to us that the court below misconstrued the meaning of the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The judgment is reversed, and- a new trial is granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
