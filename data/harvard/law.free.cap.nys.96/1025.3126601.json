From a judgment for the defendant rendered upon evidence sufficient to support a favorable finding of the facts thus set up as a defense, the plaintiff has appealed; and it is contended that the defense was not available, because of an equitable nature, and so without the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, and that the defendant\u2019s testimony was erroneously received over objection upon the ground that it tended to vary the written contract embodied in the chattel mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">Neither point is well taken. Evidence which goes to the intention of the parties to make any contract at all, when executing a writing purporting to be a contract, does not offend the rule which excludes parol proof to vary the terms of an actual contract (Brown on Parol Evidence, \u00a7 33, and cases cited) ; nor does such a defense call for the exercise of equitable jurisdiction by the court, since the inquiry simply relates to the legal effect of the writing upon the facts, and is of cognizance as a common-law defense not substantially different in character from a claim that the instrument had been given up (Grierson v. Mason, 60 N. Y. 394).</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
