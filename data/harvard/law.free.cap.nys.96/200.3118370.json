There was a conflict of proof as to the ownership of the horse and as to the viciousness of the animal being known to defendant. The latter\u2019s daughter, however, admits identity of the defendant as the man shown to be the owner of the hopse. The defendant was not called as a witness at all. It also appears that the horse was frequently kept muzzled, which implies knowledge of his viciousness. _ No contributory negligence on part of plaintiff was proven. The jury were warranted in finding for plaintiff. No claim that damages awarded are excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The defendant also appeals from an order adjourning the trial upon payment of costs to defendant. This was allowable under section 195 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1548, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"pAP-T\">MacLEAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUbK\">(concurring). Erequent exhibitions of mischievous propensity of the horse of the defendant, coupled with evidence, conflicting though it was, that the horse had been muzzled, both before and after he had bitten the plaintiff, warranted a finding of scienter, though doubtful, if muzzling were the only proof, for that might be to avoid \"cribbing\u201d or liability under the provisions of sections 43a and 43b of the highway law (Birdseye\u2019s Rev. St. p. 1604) of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">As the adjournment of the trial was made pursuant to section 195 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1548, c. 580), the judgment should stand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
