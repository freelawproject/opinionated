The petitioner was appointed stenographer to the board of coroners of the Bronx on January 10, 1902, at a salary of $2,000 per annum, and has been receiving said salary ever since. He claims that section 1768 of the Consolidation Act, Laws 1889, p. 610, c. 443, fixed his salary at $2,500, and that therefore he does not come within any of the provisions of the charter, original or amended, which gives an)rbody or any board power to fix his salary at any other amount; and that, being fixed by law, he is entitled to a mandamus to compel the observance of the law by the board of estimate and apportionment. At the outset it should be pointed out that the peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>tioner alleges that among the duties required of the board of estimate and apportionment is \u201cthe fixing of the salaries of the various municipal employes and officers, and, among others, are the stenographers attached to the board of coroners in the various boroughs in said city\u201d; and the prayer is that a peremptory mandamus issue directing said board to fix the petitioner\u2019s salary at $2,500, as required by law. The case cited and the argument had upon this petition, however, are to the effect that the board had no power to fix the said salary, as it was already fixed by law. If that contention be sound, how can the court compel the board to perform an act for which there is no warrant in law? Mandamus proceeds upon the theory of a clear legal right. It is to correct the neglect or refusal of an officer or board to do that which by law it is bound to do. If the officer or board has discretion, the court will not control the exercise of that discretion. It may tell the officer to act, but it will not compel him to act in a particular way. If he has no power to act, the court will not compel him to do that which the law does not. So that if the petitioner\u2019s contention is sound, and his salary is fixed by law, the board has no control over it; it cannot fix it. He has mistaken his remedy, and mandamus will not lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">Examining the question on its merits, in the case relied on (Baker v. City, 56 App. Div. 350, 67 N. Y. Supp. 814), the salary of Baker, the stenographer to the Manhattan coroners, had been fixed at $2,500, and there was no question about that. He sued for services rendered between January 1, 1898, and January 1, 1899, in furnishing transcripts to the District Attorney, and there was a stipulation which bound this court upon the facts. If the provisions of the charter then construed still remain the law, that case is controlling. Before the charter took effect, the consolidation act provided for four coroners in the city and county of New York. By section 1767, Laws 1882, p. 429, c. 410, each of the coroners was to receive a yearly salary of $5,000. By chapter 732, p. 893, of the Acts of 1896, section 1768 was amended so that they might appoint a clerk at $3,500 a year, two assistant clerks at $1,500 a year, and a skilled stenographer at a salary of $2,500 a year, and 6 cents per folio for all transcripts made for the use of the District Attorney\u2019s office by direction of said board; and said salary and folio rate shall be provided for and paid to the said stenographer \u201cin the same manner as the clerk of said board of coroners is paid,\u201d which was \u201ca county charge, and payable as other county salaries are paid.\u201d By the charter (Laws 1901, p. 645, c. 466, \u00a7 1570) it was provided that thereafter four coroners should be elected in the borough of Manhattan, two in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, three in Queens, and two in Richmond. Section 1571 provided that the coroners in each borough shall appoint a clerk, who shall receive an annual salary to be fixed by the board of estimate and apportionment and the Municipal Assembly, and such and so many assistant clerks as shall be provided for in the annual estimate. They shall also appoint a stenographer in each borough, whose duty it shall be to take accurate and full stenographic minutes, and transcribe the same, of all proceedings and testimony taken before a jury in any coroner\u2019s court held by any of said coroners. The salaries or other compensation of such coroners shall be fixed by the board of estimate and apportionment and the Municipal Assembly. Here was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>provision for coroners and their subordinates in each of the five boroughs of the city. So far as the Manhattan coroners are concerned, their salaries and that of each of their subordinates had been theretofore fixed by statute law. The salary of all of them in express language was now left to be fixed by the board of estimate and apportionment and the Municipal Assembly, with the exception of the stenographers. This court held in the Baker Case that section 1768 of the consolidation act still governed, and that the stenographer to the Manhattan board was entitled to $3,500 and 6 cents a folio for transcripts. The provisions of the charter have been considerably changed since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Section 97 of the consolidation act reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201cThe salaries of all the officers, whose offices may be created by the common council for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this act, shall subject to the other provisions' of this act, be prescribed by ordinance or resolution to be passed by the common council and approved as hereinbefore provided for the approval of ordinances or resolutions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">This court said in the Baker Case that section 56 of the charter appears to be a re-enactment of section 97 of the consolidation act. But it seems to be something more. The language was at the time of the facts under consideration in that case as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cSec. 56. The salaries of all officers whose offices may be created by the Municipal Assembly for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this act, shall, subject to the other provisions, of this act be prescribed by ordinance or resolution. The Municipal Assembly shall have power upon the recommendation of the board of estimate and apportionment to fix the salary of any officer or person whose compensation is paid out of the city treasury, irrespective of the amount fixed by-this act, except that no change shall be made in the salary of an elected officer or head of a department during the term for which he was elected or appointed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">That seems to be a broad grant of power. I am inclined to think that \u201cany officer or person whose compensation is paid out of the city treasury\u201d is limited only by the words \u201can elected officer or head of a department during his term.\u201d That the words \u201cirrespective of the amount fixed by this act\u201d .are not words of limitation, but were inserted for abundant caution, as this section expressly changed the law as to salaries \u201cfixed in the act\u201d from the provisions of the consolidation act. There was a still further change in the Revised Charter of 1901:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-10\">\u201cThe salaries of all officers whose offices may be created by the board of aldermen for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this act, shall, subject to the other provisions of this act be prescribed by ordinance or resolution. It shall be the duty of the board of aldermen, upon the recommendation of the board of estimate and apportionment, to fix the salary of every officer or person whose compensation is paid out of the city treasury other than day laborers, and teachers, examiners and members of the supervising staff of the department of education, irrespective of the amount fixed! by this act, except that no change shall be made in the salary of an elected officer or head of a department during his term of office. Salaries need not be uniform throughout the several boroughs, etc. * * * All salaries as fixed on the first day of January, 1902, shall continue in' force until fixed by the board of aldermen as in this section provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">On April 8, 1902, by chapter 435, p. 1067, this section was amended by adding this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">\u201cAll salaries as fixed on the 1st day of January, 1902, shall continue in force until fixed by the board of aldermen as in this section provided, ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>cept as may be otherwise determined by the board of estimate and apportionment prior to the first day of May in the year 1902 under the provisions of \u00a7 10 thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">And on the same day, by chapter 436, p. 1068, the Legislature amended section 10 by adding this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201cBetween January 1st and May 1st in the year 1902, the board of estimate and apportionment shall have power from time to time to alter, modify and amend the budget for the year 1902, to change the titles, terms and condition of appropriations contained therein; to add new appropriations, and abolish any that may be unnecessary; and also upon the recommendation of the mayor or any borough president or head of any department, bureau, office, board, or commission of the city of New York, or of any of the counties embraced therein, to fix the salaries in any of said offices, departments, bureaus, boards or commissions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This seems to have been as broad a grant of power as human language could frame. On April 30,1902, the board of estimate and apportionment, in accordance with the power conferred, upon the written recommendation of the coroners of the borough of the Bronx, under date of April 14, 1902, fixed the salary of their stenographer at $2,000, and he has been paid that amount ever since, and has received the same, \"so far as appears, without complaint up to the 1st day of March, 1905. I do not think that the petitioner was entitled to the relief granted, and the order must be reversed, with costs of the appeal, and the motion denied, with costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">PATTERSON, INGRAHAM, and LAUGHLIN, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b157-9\">O\u2019BRIEN, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX8\">I concur in the result for the reason that I think the further change made in the Revised Charter of 1901, and the amendment by chapter 435, p. 1067, of the Laws of 1902, operated to change the law as it stood when this court considered the question in Baker v. City, 56 App. Div. 350, 67 N. Y. Supp. 814. Under these amendments, I think that the Legislature has conferred upon the board of estimate and apportionment the power to fix the salary of stenographers upon the written recommendation of the coroners of the borough of the Bronx.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
