We cannot say that he should have believed plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, rather than those called by defendant. The judgment awards defendant $20 costs. No verified pleading or written notice of appearance was filed. Consequently, under section 332 of the municipal court act (Laws 1902, p. 1585, c. 580), the defendant was not entitled to hosts. Rice v. Hogan, 45 Misc. Rep. 400, 90 N. Y. Supp. 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">The judgment must be modified, by striking out the award of costs, and, as so modified, affirmed, with' costs; the award of costs upon appeal being made because the defect in the judgment is one which might have been, and probably would have been, corrected in the court below, if a proper application to that effect had been made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
