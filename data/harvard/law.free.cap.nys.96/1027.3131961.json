At the trial the plaintiff introduced the following receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-12\">Nov. 16, 190-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-13\">\u201cReceived for Mary Rosenfeld gaved a deposit of $100.oo/100 One hundred dollars on house No 10 Cannon St. The outside and inside belongs to the leaser, including the sidewalk. Security is $600.oo/100 Six hundred Dollar. Yearly rent $32o0.\u00b0\u00b0/ioo- Thirty two fifty Dollars. If the house gets sold the leaser gets $100. To lease \"for three years and apart of commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-14\">\u201cMary Rosenfeld promise to make the lease on the 17th of November at night from six to nine o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-15\">\u2018Taymint monthy rent on the 10 and the 15 day of the month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADiN\">\u201cMax Silver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-17\">By fair interpretation the deposit was given as security for the execution of a lease by the plaintiff, though its purpose, was not expressly stated in the receipt. It was clearly not as security for rent under the lease, for a lease introduced in evidence by the defendant, between himself and Annie Silver of the first part, and Morris Gilman of the second part, recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-18\">\u201cThe tenant herein deposits the sum of six hundred ($600) dollars for the faithful performance of all the terms, covenants and conditions on the part of the tenant to be performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-19\">Even if the determination of the trial justice be held to be, upon the evidence, a determination as fact that the lease as executed by Gilman, mentioned as the son of the plaintiff, was the lease of the plaintiff, still the defendant was not entitled to retain the deposit of the plaintiff, for it was not apparently given for such a purpose. If the right to retain be founded upon plaintiff\u2019s refusal to fulfill her agreement, we may say, as was said by this court in Weinberg v. Greenberger, 47 Misc. Rep. 117, 118, 93 N. Y. Supp. 530, 532 :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1052-20\">\u201cThere is nothing in the receipt to justify a finding that the deposit was given as a penalty, or as liquidated damages in case of a refusal. It was therefore a deposit as security for actual damage, if any, suffered by the defendant by reason of plaintiff\u2019s default. No such damage was pleaded or shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1052-21\">The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-22\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
