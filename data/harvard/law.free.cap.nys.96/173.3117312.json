J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auj\">This is an appeal from a final order in favor of the landlord in a holdover proceeding. On July 5, 1904, one Jennie Youngelson, the tenant of the premises under a lease from the owner, made a lease of the rooms involved in'this proceeding to the appellant for the term of four years, and the appellant went into possession. This lease was duly recorded. Shortly after making this lease Youngelson surrendered her lease to the owners of the fee. Of course, this surrender did not affect the appellant\u2019s rights under his lease; its only effect being to make him the tenant of the owner. Ritzler v. Raether, 10 Daly, 286; Eten v. Luyster, 60 N. Y. 252; Weiss v. Mendelson, 24 Misc. Rep. 692, 53 N. Y. Supp. 803. Some months after the premises were sold to one Steuer, who simultaneously executed a lease of the same premises to the respondent, who has never been able to take possession, owing to the appellant\u2019s refusal to surrender. The respondent\u2019s right to possession is based upon the. claim that appellant\u2019s lease was condition\u00e9d to terminate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>upon a sale of the property. Unless-this claim be' well founded, the final order must be reversed and the proceeding fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The lease is in the customary printed form, with the blanks filled in in writing. It provides for the payment of a yearly rental of $150. Then follow three lines, partly printed and partly written, as follows, the printed portion being italicized: (1) <em>\u201cto be paid in equal </em>monthly <em>payments </em>in advance\u201d (2) \u201con the first day of each and every\u201d (3) \u201cmonth.\u201d At the end of the first line, after the word \u201cadvance,\u201d is written in the margin the words \u201cof eleven\u201d; at the beginning of the second line, before the word \u201con,\u201d is written in the margin the word \u201cdollars\u201d; at the end of-the second line, after the word \u201cevery,\u201d is written in the margin the word \u201cwhen\u201d; and, again in the margin, before the first two lines of the following clause, are written the words \u201cthe houses are sold.\u201d All the words written in the margin are evidently in the same handwriting and written in the same ink; the handwriting and ink being different from those used in the other parts of the lease. The succeeding clause is the customary one providing for re-entry in case of nonpayment of rent or default in any covenant. The respondent insists, and the justice held, that the words written- -in the margin, \u201cwhen the houses are sold,\u201d must be read as if written as a part of the re-entry clause, and that, if so read,' they would authorize a re-entry when the sale was effected, or, in other words, that a sale of the premises ipso facto terminated the lease. .</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We do not consider that the words should be so read, and, if they were, they would not have the effect claimed for them. In considering the meaning and intent of the interpolation, we must consider and read-all the interpolated words, and not, as respondent would have us, ignore and disregard part of them; and we should, if possible, so read them as to make an intelligible clause. The fact that the interpolated words are in the same handwriting and ink indicates that they were written at the same time and were intended to compose one clause. If they be read in order, disregarding the words in different handwriting and ink, they would read: \u201cOf eleven dollars\u2014when the houses are sold.\u201d So read, the payment clause would read: \u201cAt the yearly rental or sum of $120, to be paid in equal monthly payments in advance of eleven dollars when the houses are sold, .on the first day of each and every month.\u201d Thus read, the clause, while perhaps not happily expressed, is perfectly clear and intelligible. The respondent\u2019s reading would ignore the words \u201cof eleven dollars,\u201d and make the reading \u201cwhen month the houses are sold and- it is agreed that if any rent shall be due.and unpaid or if default shall be made in any of the covenants,\u201d etc., the landlord may re-enter. Thus read, the clause would be unintelligible, and there certainly could be gathered from it no agreement that the lease should terminate ipso facto upon a sale. At the most it would only provide that, if the houses were sold, the landlord might re-enter for nonpayment of rent or the violation of some covenant. The general rule for construction of leases is that they must be construed most favorably for the lessee, and es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>pecially is this the \u00b0case when the clause to be construed is claimed to be one destroying or defeating the estate of the lessee. It is not, however, necessary to resort to this rule in the present instance; for it is apparent that the lease cannot be construed as the respondent seeks to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The final order must be reversed, with costs, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">GILDERSLEEVE, J., concurs.
