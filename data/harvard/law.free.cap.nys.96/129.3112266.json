There is absolutely no evidence of negligence. It was also manifest error to allow anything for the hire of a horse to replace the injured animal. There is no evidence of what plaintiff paid, or that he paid anything. All we have is his brother\u2019s testimony that he \u201cusually\u201d charged $2 a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
