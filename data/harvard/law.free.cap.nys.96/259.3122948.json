The particular negligence asserted by the plaintiff is a \u201cjerk\u201d or \u201cjolt,\u201d at the time the train was in the act of stopping at a regular station, that forced the passengers forward as they were moving toward the exit of the car. The plain-testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-21\">\u201cWhen the conductor hollered out \u2018Fifty-Ninth Street!\u2019 * * * and I saw others getting up, then I got up, * * * and when I was just going out the car gave such a jerk that it knocked me right on my back. * * * I got a terrible jerk\u2014an extraordinary jerk.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-22\">The substance of the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, who was with her mother, is that the car jerked, \u201cand she, with other passengers, was forced forward; that she saw her mother falling, got up, and went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to assist her, as other passengers did.\u201d From no point of view can it be truthfully said that the evidence in behalf of plaintiff shows that her injury was due to defective means or appliances employed in operating the train. There is no ground for invoking the doctrine of \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. Nelson v. Lehigh R. R. Co., 25 App. Div. 535, 50 N. Y. Supp. 63, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the fact that the car gave an extraordinary jerk, or jolt, that forced the passengers forward and knocked the plaintiff on her back. No error on the part of defendant\u2019s servants in operating the train is pointed out. The evidence is not sufficient to justify the inference that defendant or any of its servants were guilty of negligence. So far as appears, the jerk was incidental to the stoppage of the train in the usual course and customary method of operation. We think the rule laid down by this court in Needham v. Interborough R. T. Co. (App. Term, Oct., 1905) 95 N. Y. Supp. 561, applies here. See, also, Black v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 2 App. Div. 387, 37 N. Y. Supp. 830, and De Soucey v. Man. Ry. Co. (Com. Pl.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 108. The motion for the direction of a verdict in favor of the defendant should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">SCOTT, J., concurs. MacLEAN, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
