This was not improper, for, though the complaint might possibly be interpreted as framed in the cepit and in the detinet, it was apparently treated as in the detinet, in view of which \u201cthe general denial put in issue, not only the wrongful detention, but plaintiff\u2019s title, and upon that issue he had the right to show, not only title in himself, but title out of the plaintiff and in a stranger.\u201d Griffin v. Long Island Railroad Co., 101 N. Y. 348, 353, 4 N. E. 740. It was improper, however, to dismiss the. complaint therefor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>because, \u201cin case of a transfer of interest or devolution of liability, the action may be continued, by or against the original party, unless the court directs the person, to whom the interest is transferred, or upon whom the liability is devolved, to be substituted in the action, or joined with the original party, as the case requires\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 756), and it does not appear that the receiver has ever been so substituted. Wherefore the judgment and order herein must be reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
