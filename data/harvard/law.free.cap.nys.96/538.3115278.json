This was the only testimony as to the accident. At the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, which motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">On behalf of the defendant his superintendent testified that all of the work that the defendant did upon the building was mason work; that while the defendant was doing this work the employ\u00e9s of the General Electric Company were putting in these switch plates and electrical machinery; that the Western Electric Company was putting in its machinery; that another contracting firm was putting in its machinery, and Terry &amp; Tench Construction Company were putting in iron work, probably 4.0 or 50 contractors working there at that time; that the defendant did not have anything to do with the premises, except in relation to the mason work; that the cranes were being operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company\u2014the defendant had nothing to do with them; that the iron beams that fell were not placed upon the balcony by the defendant, or any of his employ\u00e9s; that he had nothing whatever to do with them. It was then admitted that an action had been commenced against the General Electric Company by the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and that that action was settle?! by the payment of $1,000 by the General Electric Company to the plaintiff, and the.plaintiff had signed an instrument under seal discharging the General Electric Company, but preserved the rights of the plaintiff against this defendant, and that in consideration of that payment, the action against the General Electric Company was discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The defendant then rested and moved for the direction of a verdict, upon the ground that no cause of action had been proved against the. defendant, and that if there was any negligence it was the negligence of the General Electric Company, with whom the plaintiff had settled. I think this motion should have been granted. There was no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was required in the course of his work to walk under this balcony upon which this ironwork was piled, or that he was required by the defendant or his superintendent to place himself in this particular position in the performance of his work. The defendant did not therefore supply this particular place for the plaintiff\u2019s intestate to do his work. Plaintiff\u2019s intestate was engaged in wheeling a barrow of cement. There was nothing to show that there was any necessity of placing himself in this position under the balcony. The evidence is uncontradicted that the iron frame that fell had been placed upon the balcony by other contractors and their-employ\u00e9s, over whom this defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>no control, and he was not responsible for the negligent piling of the iron frame close to the edge of the balcony. There were other employ\u00e9s of the defendant removing scaffolding upon this balcony at or about the time of the accident, but there is nothing to show that anything that they did had any relation to the fall of the iron plate that struck the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. If this negligence had. any connection with the accident, it was the negligence of a fellow servant for which the defendant was not responsible. It is clear that the defendant was not in any way responsible for the method by which these iron plates-were piled upon the balcony, or for any vibration of the building that caused them to fall. No act of the defendant or his employ\u00e9s in any way contributed to the accident, and there was therefore nothing to justify'a finding of negligence against this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">It follows that the judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
