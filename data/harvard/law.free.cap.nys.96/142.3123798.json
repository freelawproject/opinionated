On reporting at the Music Hall on April 10th, plaintiff was informed that his services were not wanted. He sued for breach of contract, and obtained judgment in his favor for $300, the full amount of his claim, and costs. The defense is mainly based upon the statutes commonly called the \u201cSunday Laws.\u201d It seems to us that the defense was well taken, and the contract was void as being in violation of such statutes. See Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 263, 265, 277; Charter, Laws 1897, p. 522, c. 378, \u00a7 1481; Mayer v. Eden Musee, 102 N. Y. 593, 8 N. E. 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
