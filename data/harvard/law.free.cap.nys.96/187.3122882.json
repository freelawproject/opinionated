Upon the question of completion or substantial completion of the work the contradictions were sharp and the conflict direct, with preponderance apparently in circumstantiality and in number of witnesses in favor of the plaintiff, particularly as impeachment, for want of consideration, of the note valid upon its face was a defense to be established affirmatively by the. party alleging it, and because the defendant, formerly a carpenter, had not spaced the hanging ceiling as required and that the side studding to which the metal was nailed was wide apart. Still the judgment would not be disturbed here for that appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-22\">Otherwise is it, however, as to extra work and material in ceil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ing a partition, for the reasonable value of which, as $50, evidence was given, but for which the jury allowed nothing, seemingly accepting the defendant\u2019s contention that failure to prove a specific order therefor from the defendant or more than a verbal direction from the architect precluded recovery therefor. It being in evidence, however, without gainsaying,' that the defendant, professedly conversant with carpentering and building, was at his place every day, and so must have seen the extra work and material applied, and so permitted it, he is impliedly liable to pay for it under the rule, that, if a person allows another to work for him under such circumstances that no reasonable man would suppose that the latter means to do work for nothing, he will be liable to pay for it. The doing of the work is the offer; acquiescence in its being done is the acceptance. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
