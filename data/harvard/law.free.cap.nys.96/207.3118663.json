In his own affidavit he admits that he resides in New Jersey. This cures the insufficient proof given by the plaintiff as to the residence of the defendant, if any existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-24\">The further ground urged for a vacating of the attachment was that the chose in action or money levied upon by the marshal as being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>property of the defendant was not his property. This is not available to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit alleges that the goods sold to the defendant, for which he claims he is indebted to him, were sold September 2,1905. His affidavit was verified June 5, 1905. This is clearly a clerical error, and it may be treated as surplusage. It then leaves the affidavit simply without stating any- time when the goods were sold, nor is it necessary that it should fix a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
