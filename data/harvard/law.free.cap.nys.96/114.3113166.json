But on cross-examination he said: \u201cIt might be moving a little bit. A child could have got on it, though. I say a child could have got on.\u201d The only other witness to the alleged accident said he hailed the car, the car stopped, and he tried to get on. Upon this state of the evidence, for none was offered by the defendant, except as to the absence of an}*report of the alleged accident, and under the pleading, it was error and afforded a good exception, to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-4\">\u201cThe mere fact of a car moving does not militate against the plaintiff. The law says it becomes a question for you to say whether or not that was negligence on the part of the defendant. If the plaintiff could reach the car, and the car was slowly moving, the law leaves it for you to say whether oi not the plaintiff was guilty of negligence at attempting to board the car at that time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">It was further error to refuse to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\u201cThat the plaintiff in his complaint in this case alleged that the car came to a standstill for the purpose of allowing him to board it, and that if the jury believes that the car was moving when he attempted to board the car, no matter how slightly, that the verdict must be for the defendant\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">See Coleman v.
