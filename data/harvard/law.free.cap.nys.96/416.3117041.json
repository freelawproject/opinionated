In view of the quasi public character of the defendant corporation; the necessary dependence of the public on the fidelity and alertness of its employ\u00e9s ; and the strict supervision exercised over its management by the state; the reasoning, which denies assignability to the fees and salaries of public officers (Bliss v. Lawrence, 58 N. Y. 442, 17 Am. Rep. 273 ; Bowery Nat. Bank v. Wilson, 122 N. Y. 478, 25 N. E. 855, 9 L. R. A. 706, 19 Am. St. Rep. 507) and to the commissioners of executors (In re Worthington, 141 N. Y. 9, 35 N. E. 929, 23 L. R. A. 97) would seem to have much applicability to the unearned wages of the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s. The difficulty with the argument, however, is that no such question is raised by this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">\u25a0 Although the assignments sued upon purported to cover unearned as well as earned wages, the plaintiff carefully limited his demand for judgment to the amount which was shown to be actually due to each assignor at the time the assignment was mad\u00e9, and the judgment is only for such amounts. The notes were made in Rhode Island, and were to be paid there. It does not appear that they were usurious there, and if they were, this defendant cannot defend on that ground, since that defense is-personal to the borrower. The statute (chapter 77, p. 156, Laws 1904) was not violated.- Its principal purpose appears to have been that prompt notice should be given to the employer of the assignment of wages. Such notice was given as soon as the assignment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>That the arrangement entered into by defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s was improvident, and laid them open to gross extortion, cannot be questioned, and it may be surmised that O\u2019Reilly was the agent, and in effect the alter ego of Courtwright, so that the agreement'to assign the wages as security was made at the same time that the loan or advance was made, and that so far as the employ\u00e9s were concerned they virtually assigned their wages when they executed the power of attorney to O\u2019Reilly. This, however, is only a matter of surmise and does not appear in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">As the record stands we feel constrained to affirm the judgment with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">BISCHOFF, J., concurs. MacLEAN, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
