Tonns, 20 App. Div. 39, 46 N. Y. Supp. 545. Otherwise, there was only a question of fact to be determined, and the judgment entered upon its determination by the jury upon a charge calling for no criticism by this court may stand.</p>\n<p id=\"pAF5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
