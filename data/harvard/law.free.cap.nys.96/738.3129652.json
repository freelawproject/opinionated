The defendants remained in possession until the latter part of August, and their goods, as one of them testified, \u201cwere spread over the whole floor\u2014you could not make a step there without interfering with the goods, on account of the fact that the loss was being adjusted\u2014so that the examiners from the insurance company could see them.\u201d While, as said by this court in Weinberg v. Savitzky (Sup.) 93 N. Y. Supp. 485, 487, \u201cthere may be an occupancy not inconsistent with a claim that the premises occupied were in fact untenantable,\u201d the evidence herein may not be said to present such an occupancy; for tenantable were the premises for the purpose for which they were occupied, and that purpose was for the benefit of the defendants. Wherefore the claim of untenantability and of nonliability for rent must be held not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
