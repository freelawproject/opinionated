In view of the fact that the gate was immediately controlled by the defendant\u2019s servant, stationed by it, the inference of notice of the condition was readily permissible, and the omission of reasonable care in thus maintaining the car, for the purpose for which passengers were invited to use it, was sufficiently established. The award of damages for the injury to the garment was well within the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">' Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
