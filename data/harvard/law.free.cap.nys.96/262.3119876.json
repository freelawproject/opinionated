J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">The plaintiff sues, for damages resulting from an accident which happened in September, 1904. The direct physical re- \u2022 suits of the accident were comparatively slight, and the principal basis alleged for substantial damages is that, as is said, the plaintiff suffered nervously, as a result of the accident, down to the very day of the trial. It is obvious that in such a case the burden rests upon the plaintiff to connect with a reasonable degree of certainty the alleged result with the cause. To do this the plaintiff produced as a witness the physician who attended her. He testified as to plaintiff\u2019s nervous condition at the trial, and that, so far as he could remember, she had been in a normal condition before the accident. He then testified that the accident had a \u201cgreat bearing\u201d upon her present nervous condition, that it has \u201ca great deal to do with it,\u201d that there were at the time of the accident \u201cother conditions of affairs which would lead to nervousness,\u201d that the accident \u201chad partially to do with\u201d her nervous condition, that her nervous condition \u201ccould come from the accident,\u201d and the like. The total effect of the physician\u2019s testimony went no further.than to establish that the nervous condition might have been caused by the injury. This was not competent evidence to show that the injury did 'cause the condition (Raynor v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 106 App. Div. 449, 94 N. Y. Supp. 632), and the defendant\u2019s motion that the evidence be stricken out should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"AR8\">This is not a case where the objecting party is not precluded because he failed to object to the questions, because the questions themselves were not, as a rule, objectionable, although the evidence, when elicited, proved to be insufficient, and should have been withdrawn from consideration as not tending to prove the only fact as to which it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>in -any sense be considered pertinent. We must assume that-this evidence affected the judgment, for in no other way can we account for-the damages, which are much larger than would ordinarily be given-for such injuries as the plaintiff proved, outside of her continued state of nervousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
