The complaint alleges that the defendants are the officers, directors, and trustees of the Roosevelt Hospital, a domestic corporation; that on or about the 5th day of December, 1903, Ella Jackson, the wife of this plaintiff, suffering at the time, as plaintiff is informed and believes, from pneumonia, was removed by this plaintiff to the- Roosevelt Hospital for treatment of her sickness and remained there until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>date of her death, December 19, 1903; that on the same day plaintiff had the body of the deceased wife removed from said hospital bjr an undertaker for the purposes of burial, on information and belief; that after the death of said Fila Jackson, and before the removal of her remains, these defendants, their agents, or employ\u00e9s, without the permission of this plaintiff or without the permission of any relation or friend of said Fila Jackson or without her permission before her death, mutilated and dissected her body, or caused her body to be mutilated and dissected, in such a manner that the muscles of her arms and other parts of her body were removed, and that her stomach was removed, and that portions of the flesh of her body were removed ; that the plaintiff had always lived in happiness with his wife; that the acts on the part of the defendants, their agents, or employ\u00e9s complained of, caused this plaintiff great suffering in mind and body, was a great shock to him, and deprived him of his natural right to inter the body of his deceased wife in as perfect a condition as her sickness and the due course of nature that led to her death would permit, and greatly outraged his religious feeling in respect to the mutilation of the corpse of his deceased wife, to his damage in the sum of $23,000, for which he demanded judgment. The defendants in their answer admitted the incorporation of the hospital and that they 'were the officers and trustees- thereof, and alleged \u201cthat they have no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the remaining allegations of the complaint, wherefore they deny the same and each of them.\u201d The answer proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cFourthly. And. for a further and separate defense these defendants state and show on information and belief that a person named Ella Jackson was brought to the said the \u2018Roosevelt Hospital,\u2019 suffering from a fibroid tumor, on or about the 8th day of December, 1903, and at her own request was operated upon, and died at said hospital on or about the 12th day of December, 1903.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">To this separate defense the plaintiff demurred upon the ground that it is insufficient in law upon the face thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The defendants claim that by demurring to the answer the sufficiency of the complaint is to be inquired into. By section 309 of the Penal Code the unauthorized dissection of the body of a human being is a misdemeanor. Foley v. Phelps, 1 App. Div. 551, 37 N. Y. Supp. 471, is a direct authority upholding the right of action here set forth and for the sufficiency of the complaint. The defense demurred to is bad. It does not meet the allegations of the complaint. Waiving the question of identity, the gravamen of the complaint is the unauthorized dissection of a body after death. The plaintiff must -establish that essential fact. Having established it, it would be no answer to prove a prior operation during life. If, as proof of dissection after death, he should introduce proof as to the condition of the body when received by him, it would be entirely competent to prove that the said condition was the result of an operation, and not of dissection. No averments in the answer would be required for the admission of such evidence. It would go to the destruction of the plaintiff\u2019s case, but in no sense would it be a defense of the cause of action set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The answer further sets up:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">\u201cFifthly. And for a further separate defense these defendants state and show that the allegations contained in said complaint do not constitute a cause of action against these defendants or any of them, wherefore these defendants and each of them demand that the said complaint be dismissed, with costs.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">To this defense the plaintiff demurred upon the same ground. Section 500 of the Code provides that the answer must contain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201c(1) A general or specific denial of each material allegation of the complaint 'controverted by the defendant or of any knowledge or information, thereof sufficient to form a belief. \u2022 (2) A statement of any new matter constituting-a defense or counterclaim in ordinary and concise language without repetition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">This is neither a general nor a specific denial of any of the allega-\\ tions of the complaint, nor is it the statement of any new matter constituting a defense, nor a counterclaim. Nor does it come within section-498:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">\u201cWhen any of the matters enumerated in section 488 of this act as grounds of demurrer do not appear upon the face of the complaint, the objection may be taken by answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">For this allegation is upon the face of the complaint and asserts in effect that, admitting the allegations thereof all to be true, they do not constitute a cause of action. This is a demurrer and has no place in an answer. It was not proper to plead it in the answer. Ward v. Smith, 95 App. Div. 432, 88 N. Y. Supp. 700. By the express provisions of section 499, the defendants would not have waived the objection as to the sufficiency of the complaint by not demurring on that ground or by failing to set it up in the answer, Upon the trial,without pleading, the defendants would be entitled, to move for a dismissal upon this precise ground. Therefore the demurrer to each of the alleged separate defenses should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">The interlocutory judgment is reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the defendants to serve an amended answer within 20 days upon payment of costs in this court, and in the court below. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
