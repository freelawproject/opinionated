White v. Brownell, 2 Daly, 329, 359. Within the limitations of that doctrine it is not disputed that the constitution and by-laws are the sole rule that governs the relations between the association and its members. Austin v. Dutcher, 56 App. Div. 393, 67 N. Y. Supp. 819. . As alleged and sought t\u00f3 be proven herein, the voluntary association, of which the defendant was and still claims to be a member and the secretary, was attempted to be amalgamated and consolidated with another, which would be a practical disbandment. The association\u2019s constitution (article 13) provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">\u201cThis Union shall not be disbanded as long as ten members have voted to continue its existence [expressed even more emphatically in counterpart of its bilingual text].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">In view of this, the refusal of evidence of the number of members who voted against consolidation, and so against practical disbandment, was reversible error, inadvertent of the chartered rights of the minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">SCOTT, P. J., concurs. GILDERSDEEVE, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
