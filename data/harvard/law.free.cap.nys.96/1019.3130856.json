It was also shown that the goods were selected by defendant in company with his wife, and that the agreement of sale, which was afterwards signed by defendant\u2019s wife, was not signed by defendant merely because he was unable to go to plaintiff\u2019s place of business. <em>Held, </em>that such a prima facie case was established against defendant that it was error to dismiss the complaint on the merits at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1043-20\">[Ed.

It was also shown that the agreement of sale, while signed by the defendant\u2019s wife, was not signed by the defendant merely because of his inability to come to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business, after the goods had been selected by him, with his wife. The inference was obvious that credit had been given the defendant, and that he, the disclosed principal, had ratified his wife\u2019s act, as his agent, yet the complaint was dismissed \u201con the merits\u201d at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, and without a submission of the issues on the whole case for determination by the justice. .Certainly the prima facie proof was sufficient, and, if the facts were to be found in favor of the defendant, this result could be reached only after he had rested his case, assuming that the condition of the proof authorized such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">Judgment reversed, -and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the-event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
