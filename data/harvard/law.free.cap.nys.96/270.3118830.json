J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsJu\">The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted. The plaintiff, traveling in one of defendant\u2019s cars, wished to alight at Forty-Second street. As the train approached that street, the conductor announced it, and plaintiff arose and went to the door, preparatory to alighting when the train should stop. He put his hand on the jam of the doorway, and, as he says, \u201cthrough the sudden stop of the train I bruised my hand when the door slammed.\u201d This is the only evidence as to how the accident came to happen. No reason is given why the plaintiff should have put his hand on the door jamb, and there is nothing in the case to show that there was any excessive or unusual jolt or jerk in the stopping of the train. The car was equipped with a safety catch to hold the door, and the conductor testified that he had caught the door back before the train stopped. The mere characterization of the stop as \u201csudden\u201d is not sufficient to justify the couclusion that it was unusual, or anything more than is necessarily attendant upon stopping a train. In our view there was no proof of negligence on defendant\u2019s part justifying the submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">GILDERSLEEVE, J., concurs.
