The action was discontinued as to the United States Express Company, and part of the package of trousers was returned to the plaintiff at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">When the carrier transported and tendered delivery to the consignee, and the consignee refused to accept, it performed its duty as carrier, and thereafter assumed another relation. While it has not been flatly determined in this state that notice under any and all circumstances to the consignor by the carrier is not required, the cases cited containing expressions looking that way seem to be cases where the consignor had been otherwise apprised of the fact or where there had not been a complete refusal to accept by the consignee. Assuming, but without deciding, that it was the duty of the carrier herein to notify the consignor-of the refusal of the consignee to accept, it must be determined that its failure so to do was not proximate to the loss of the goods, and \u201cwhere the refusal to deliver is explained by the fact appearing that the goods have been lost, either destroyed by fire or stolen by thieves, and the bailee is therefore unable to deliver them, there is no prima facie evidence of his want of care, and the court will not assume in the absence of proof on that point that such fire or theft was the result of his negligence.\u201d Claflin v. Meyer, 75 N. Y. 260, 262, 31 Am. Rep. 467. Loss by theft herein appearing, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover in the absence of proof that the defendant as bailee was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-13\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
