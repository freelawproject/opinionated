The authority to procure the loan is in writing, bears date of January 7, 1905, and is as follows, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-18\">\u201cNew York, Jany. 7th, 1905.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-19\">\u201cJohn Finck, Esq., 141 Broadway, City\u2014Dear Sir: I hereby authorize you to accept on my behalf a second (2d) mortgage of $5,000.00 at 6% for one year covering my property 207-209 E. 94th street. I further agree to pay fifteen (15) per cent, and disbursements in the event of your obtaining an absolute acceptance of the amount specified herein. The authorization to remain in force until nullified by me in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-20\">\u201cTruly yours, Franz Schmitt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-21\">It appears from the evidence that the same day the plaintiff received the authority he procured a person who was ready, willing, and able to make the loan on the usual terms, and wrote to the defendant to that effect. On the Monday -following defendant replied to the plaintiff\u2019s letter of January 7th, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-22\">\u201cI have changed my mind, and have taken other steps in this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-23\">The amended answer of the defendant first denies the employment of the plaintiff, and then, for a separate defense, alleges that the defendant retained the plaintiff to procure a certain mortgage loan, and that before the paintiff had procured said loan the retainer of the plaintiff by the defendant was terminated. The method of terminating the retainer, or revoking the plaintiff\u2019s authority, was, as we have seen, by the letter of January 9, 1905, in which the defendant stated he \u201chad changed his mind.\u201d This was too late. The plaintiff had already performed his part of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-24\">No fraud on plaintiff\u2019s part in the making of the contract is alleged by the defendant, and no proof thereof tendered. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>some testimony of the plaintiff calculated to show that he was .deceived and did not understand the contract of employment when he signed it. Not having pleaded fraud, the defendant cannot be heard to urge.it as a defense. The plaintiff made out his cause of action by undisputed testimony, and was entitled to the direction of a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">SCOTT, P. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"pAQj\">MacLEAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqD\">(dissenting). Inviting him to call promptly in the event of a mortgage proposition interesting him, the plaintiff wrote the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">\u201cI beg to call your attention to several funds aggregating upwards of $5,000,000 which I have been instructed to invest in bond and mortgage, in amounts to suit, at the low rates of four (4) and four and a half (4%) per cent. I am prepared to accommodate you with a satisfactory mortgage at a low rate of interest on any of your properties, particularly 207 E. 94th St. It is needless to state that no charge whatsoever is made unless the loan is actually approved and accepted by my clients.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In response the defendant called, and, as he says, was introduced to a man seated in a dark corner with a droplight over his desk, was asked some questions, and then asked to sign a paper placed on a board shoved out from the desk. It was dark, he could not see a letter on the paper, and thought it was blank; but, being told, on demurring, it did not bind him if he did not make the loan, that if he did not make the loan the paper would not be worth anything, and would be wiped out, he signed. \u201cI thought,\u201d he testified, \u201cit could do no harm to sign it, because Mr. Finck sent me a letter stating under what conditions I could make a loan.\u201d This, plausible of itself, is made credible by its turning out that the paper, with what followed, ostensibly bound the defendant to acceptance of a mortgage for a year at 6 per cent, interest and 15 per cent, commission, or <em>21 </em>per cent, per annum, besides lawyer\u2019s fees unpriced, too much of a pactum leoninum to be enforced without more support.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
