G. Brenack, Att\u2019y.\u201d To prove authority the plaintiff put the husband of the defendant on the stand as its witness, and, among other things, asked this question: \u201cWere you authorized to sign the name of the Brenack Paper Company, R. G. Brenack, Attorney?\u201d Objection was made and sustained, though apparently a proper question, under the decision of Jennings v. Davies, 29 App. Div. 227, 51 N. Y. Supp. 437. However, it did finally elicit that \u201cshe,\u201d referring to the defendant, \u201ctold me I should not sign any papers for the Brenack Paper Company; that any contracts that were to be made she. would make them.\u201d By this the plaintiff was bound. Failing, therefore, to, prove authority, and so a right to recover, judgment for the defendant must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-21\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
