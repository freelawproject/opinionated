Certainly the oral communication of the executor to Mr. O\u2019Mally, then the attorney for the claimant, does not make for'the allowance of the claim by the executor. If we disregard that communication, it then appears that the executor made no sign after the claim was presented until he filed his accounts, wherein he scheduled the claim as disputed. On the hearing of the objections filed by the claimant,.the executor stated in open court that he would enter into a written stipulation, submitting the merits of the claim to the surrogate, or permitting the same to be otherwise tried. But the learned surrogate determined that the claim had never been rejected, and therefore it was allowed. While the surrogate has jurisdiction to pass upon that question (Matter of Miles, 170 N. Y. 75, 62 N. E. 1084), I think that the determination was wrong. Aside from the dealings with Mr. O\u2019Mally, which could not, in any event, avail the claimant, such determination was necessarily based upon the failure of the executor to make any sign during the period intervening the filing o'f the claim and the filing of the accounts, and the disposition of the claim in the account, and the attitude of the executor upon the hearing of the claimant\u2019s objections to the account. But, first, the silence of the executor after the filing of the claim did not conclude him. The doctrine that the lapse of a reasonable time without objection made transforms an account rendered into an account stated has a much more restricted application when the claimant deals with an executor, and the Court of Appeals refused to apply it when similar inaction of an executor followed the presentation of a claim; observing, also, that the creditor must see to it that the claim is admitted or allowed, or else commence an action. Schutz v. Morette, 146 N. Y. 137, 40 N. E. 780. See, too, Matter of Callahan, 152 N. Y. 320, 325, 46 N. E. 486. Second, as to the account itself, it appears that the executor scheduled this claim as- disputed. And, third, on the hearing of the objections, the attitude of the executor was that of a disputant or rejector of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">I am far from prepared to hold that the communication of the executor to Mr. O\u2019Mally, if established, was not sufficient to show that the claim was then disputed or rejected; for if Mr. O\u2019Mally, as attorney for the claimant, had authority to present the claim, which is not now questioned, then I think that such authority,-in the absence of aught to the contrary, justified the executor in assuming that his decision as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>to the claim would be communicated to the attorney. Lockwood v. Dillenbeck, 104 App. Div. 71, 93 N. Y. Supp. 321 And I know of nc principle or rule, and am cited to none, which requires that the decision of the executor should be in writing, or in any particular form. Jessup\u2019s Surr. Prac. (2d Ed.) p. 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The decree, so far as appealed from, must be set aside, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
