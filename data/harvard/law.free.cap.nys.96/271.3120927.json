J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2JD\">In order to obtain a warrant of attachment, it was necessary for plaintiff to show, not merely to allege, that defendant is a-foreign corporation. Such fact may be said to be shown if it is positively alleged by some person who may be deemed to have personal knowledge upon the subject, so that his statement can be accepted as evidence of the fact. Ladenburg v. Com. Bk., 5 App. Div. 219, 39 N.Y. Supp. 119. It cannot be said to be so shown when the person making the allegation, although he may do so positively as of his own knowledge, is evidently and obviously not in a position to possess personal knowledge upon the subject. James v. Signell, 60 App. Div. 75, 69 N. Y. Supp. 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The affiant swears that he is in the employ of plaintiff and is manager for its hemp department. This fact may lend some color to his averment that he has personal knowledge of the purchase of hemp in the Philippine Islands and its shipment from Manila, although that does not appear wholly probable; but it certainly lends no color to the statement that he has personal knowledge of the fact and place of incorporation of the owner of the steamship by which the hemp was conveyed from Manila to New York. It may be that he is quite right in saying that defendant owns the steamship, and it may even be that his belief on that subject is based on evidence which, if submitted to the court, would be held to prove the fact, at least prima facie; but he does not submit such evidence, and contents himself with saying that he has personal knowledge of a fact, which under the circumstances is so improbable that we are forced to conclude that he made the statement inadvertently and without precise appreciation of the effect of his statement. Yet there is no other evidence of the vital fact that defendant is a nonresident corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the attachment granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
