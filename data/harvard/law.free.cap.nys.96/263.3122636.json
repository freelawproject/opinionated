One Traub, and (as defendant swears, but Hahn denies) Hahn and others entered into a game of poker. The chips represented money. At the conclusion of the game, defendant and Hahn went to Traub, who was acting game keeper, to settle their accounts for chips. Defendant owed $70, and $70 was due to Hahn. Therefore, at the suggestion of some one, apparently Traub, defendant made out his check in favor of Hahn for $70 and delivered the same to Hahn. The latter subsequently deposited the check in his bank, but payment thereof was refused. He subsequently indorsed said check, after such refusal of payment thereof, and delivered the same to plaintiff for the sum, as he swears, of $70. Plaintiff thereupon sued to recover on said check, and the court below gave judgment in favor, of plaintiff against defendant as maker of said check.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-17\">We think that the uncontradicted testimony shows that the check was given for a gambling debt, and was void from its inception. The, statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-18\">\u201cEvery * * * security whatsoever, given or executed by any person where the whole or any part of the consideration of the same shall be for . any money * * * won by playing at any game whatsoever, * * * shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-19\">It makes little difference whether the money was given in change for chips or otherwise used in the game. The debt incurred was a gambling debt, and the consideration therefor was utterly void. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tiff admits that he took the check with full knowledge that payment had been refused, and it is not pretended that he stands in any better position than Hahn would have stood, had he brought the suit himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
