The dispute here is whether the one year\u2019s service begins to run from the date of the appointment on probation, or from one month later when the probation ceases and the permanent tenure begins. The learned judge below held the former, and by command of the writ the relator would reach the sixth grade and its higher pay one month, earlier than if the writ were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Section 8 of the Civil Service Law (chapter 370, p. 798, Laws 1899) provides that \u201cAll appointments or employments in the classified service shall be for a probationary term not exceeding the time fixed in the rules\u201d; and the municipal civil service rule applicable to this case makes the term one month, and provides that if the conduct or capacity of the appointee be unsatisfactory to the appointing officer, the appointee shall be notified in writing during the probation term that at the end thereof he will not be retained. It then adds that \u201chis retention in the service otherwise shall be equivalent to permanent appointment\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The effect of these provisions is to make the probation period a separate and distinct term, the statute using that very word. It does not run into and become part of the permanent tenure. It ends, and there is then an appointment to the permanent tenure. The municipal civil service rule provides that a failure of the appointing officer to notify the probationer during his probationary term that he will not be retained \u201cshall be equivalent to permanent appointment.\u201d This does not destroy the separate identity of the probation term, and the necessity for an appointment to the permanent tenure; on the contrary, the rule intends such an appointment, and provides for an'\u201cequivalent\u201d, of a formal appointment. The effect is the same as though a formal appointment were made indispensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The permanent tenure being separate and distinct from the probation term, the year of service as a patrolman in the seventh grade requisite for promotion by the charter section began at the end of the probation term.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Order reversed and motion denied, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
