The plaintiff claimed at the habeas hearing that he had been illegally sentenced in violation of a plea agreement he had entered into with the state\u2019s attorney. Whether such a plea agreement existed was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>question of fact to be determined by the habeas court. The court found that the defendant failed to prove the existence of any such agreement. This finding is supported by the record and is not clearly erroneous.
