The dispositive issue is whether the admission of evidence, without objection by the defendant, under the constancy of accusation doctrine is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We conclude that it is not, and we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The victim was the defendant\u2019s twelve year old daughter. She testified to a series of sexual assaults committed upon her by the defendant which took place on an afternoon in June, 1985. After her testimony, the victim\u2019s school principal and the investigating police officer both testified, without objection by the defendant, to the victim\u2019s statements to them describing the sexual assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendant\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that the admission of the testimony of the school principal and the police officer went beyond the scope of the complainant\u2019s testimony with respect to the details of the assault in violation of his fundamental constitutional right to a conviction upon proper evidence by an impartial jury. We agree with the state that this claim is not reviewable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Evidence of constancy of accusation is admissible in a sexual assault case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 197, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). We need not resolve the question, suggested by the defendant and by Professors Tait and LaPlante, of whether constancy of accusation evidence is substantive evidence of guilt admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule, or is simply evidence corroborative of the victim\u2019s testimony analogous to a prior consistent statement and relevant only to her credibility. See C. Tait &amp; J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (1986 Sup.) \u00a7 11.22, pp. 173-75.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the evidence is hearsay introduced as substantive evidence, that status alone is insufficient to establish that its admission amounts to a constitutional violation. \u201c[HJearsay claims do not automatically invoke constitutional rights to confrontation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Veal, </em>201 Conn. 368, 376, 517 A.2d 615 (1986). If it is simply corroborative evidence admitted only on the issue of the victim\u2019s credibility, we fail to see a fundamental constitutional violation in its admission into evidence, and the defendant has failed to persuade us that one exists. The defendant\u2019s claim seeks to tag a nonconstitutional claim with a constitutional label. <em>State </em>v. <em>Veal, </em>supra, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> Indeed, the defendant has presented no analysis suggesting why his claim is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\"> We note that, although our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 506 A.2d 118 (1986), referred to the constancy of accusation doctrine as an \u201cexception to the hearsay rule\u201d; id., 197; it also explained that such evidence is admissible \u201c \u2018 \u201cin order to corroborate [the victim\u2019s] testimony.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., 199. Professors Colin Tait and Joseph LaPlante have, with some accuracy, pointed out the inconsistency between these two statements. See C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (1986 Sup.) \u00a7 11.22, pp. 173-75.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
