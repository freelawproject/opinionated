He claims that the court erred (1) in denying his motions to suppress and to dismiss, and (2) in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, which was based on a claim of insufficiency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>of evidence. We have fully reviewed his claims. We conclude (1) that the motions to suppress and dismiss were properly denied, because the police had reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the defendant\u2019s car, and (2) that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"AND\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
