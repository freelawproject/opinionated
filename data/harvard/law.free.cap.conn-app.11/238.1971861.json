The defendant was arraigned on the next regularly scheduled court date, September 20, 1985. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>155 Conn. 124, 133-34, 230 A.2d 573 (1967), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 391 U.S. 346, 88 S. Ct. 1488, 20 L. Ed. 2d 630 (1968), our Supreme Court rejected a claim of untimely arraignment under circumstances nearly identical to those in this case. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Vollhardt, </em>157 Conn. 25, 39, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>244 A.2d 601 (1968). The trial court, in refusing to suppress the defendant\u2019s statements, properly applied the holding in <em>Darwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that his constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses was violated. He claims that the trial court erred in not making a preliminary finding that the failure to produce privileged information contained in the psychiatric records of the victim-witness would be likely to impair the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 176-80, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). Such a finding could not have been made on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Here, the defendant not only failed to show that the witness had a mental problem that affected her testimonial capacity, he did not even establish that the witness was under psychiatric care or that any psychiatric records existed. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Burak, </em>201 Conn. 517, 523-24, 518 A.2d 639 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>197 Conn. 326, 329-30, 497 A.2d 758 (1985); cert denied, 475 U.S. 1119, 106 S. Ct. 1635, 90 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>supra. Further, at oral argument in this court defense counsel admitted that, prior to trial, he made no effort to secure the psychiatric records, if any, of the victim-witness, nor, at trial, did he ask for a continuance to do so. We cannot convert the defendant\u2019s default in this regard into error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>10 Conn. 130, 133, 521 A.2d 1051 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\"> At the time the defendant filed his supplemental motion to suppress, General Statutes \u00a7 54-lc provided: \u201cAny admission, confession or statement, written or oral, obtained from an accused person who has not been presented to the first session of the court, or on the day specified for arraignment under the provisions of section 54-lg, or who has not been informed of his rights as provided by section 54-lb or section 54-64b, shall be inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\"> At the time the defendant filed his supplemental motion to suppress, General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 54-lg provided: \u201cAny arrested person who is not released sooner shall be promptly presented before the superior court sitting next regularly for the geographical area where the offense is alleged to have been committed.
