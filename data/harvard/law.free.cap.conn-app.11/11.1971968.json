Ct. 1868, 20 L. Ed. 2d 889 (1968), an<em>d State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>171 Conn. 105, 112, 368 A.2d 212 (1976), and (4) in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the information. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The following facts as found by the trial court in its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized from his van and on his motion to dismiss are not in dispute. On the night of February 23,1984, Officers Gaten Landry and Bruce Tischofer, of the Hartford police department, were en route to their patrol assignment traveling westbound on Interstate 84 in Hartford. As they approached the Sisson Avenue exit, they noticed a green van in the center of the highway. This van then crossed two lanes of traffic, cut in front of their cruiser and entered the Sisson Avenue exit ramp without giving a right turn signal. The police officers decided to stop the driver of the van for the purpose of issuing a traffic summons charging an improper lane change in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-236. The police activated the flashing lights and siren of their cruiser and followed the van to a stop. At that time, the officers also noticed that one of the tail lights on the van was not operating, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-96c.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Landry approached the driver side of the van to question the driver and Tischofer went to the passenger side. The defendant was the sole occupant of the van. Landry requested the defendant\u2019s license, registration and insurance card. At the same time, Tischofer scanned the inside of the passenger compartment with his flashlight as part of a routine search for weapons to ensure the police officers\u2019 safety. During this pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>cedure, Tischofer saw a leather ammunition belt containing ammunition on the floor of the van just to the right rear of the operator\u2019s seat. The belt was partially covered by a towel. Tischofer immediately alerted his partner to the presence of the ammunition belt. The defendant was then ordered out of the van and was searched by a patdown for weapons. This search revealed no weapon. The defendant was then handcuffed and placed in the police cruiser. Although the defendant was not charged with a criminal offense at that point, the officers determined that such restraint was necessary to protect their safety, which they felt was jeopardized by the existence of the gun belt and their belief that there may have been a weapon in the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Tischofer returned to the van and removed the towel which partially covered the ammunition belt. The belt contained thirteen live rounds of .357 caliber ammuni- / tion. A holster was found attached to the belt and it contained a .357 caliber Ruger Black Hawk pistol fully loaded with six live rounds of ammunition. The belt, ammunition and pistol were seized and placed in the police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The officers again returned to the van and conducted a search of the passenger compartment. On the right side, underneath the seat cover, three brown packets of white powder and one clear packet of white powder were discovered. On the basis of their training and experience, the officers concluded that the four packets contained either cocaine or heroin. These packets were also seized and later identified as containing cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">As a result of the discovery of the weapon, ammunition and drugs described, the defendant was arrested and charged with the following crimes: carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38; criminal possession of a pistol or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>revolver, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217; possession of narcotics, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a); and possession of narcotics with intent to sell, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-277 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the items seized from his van without a warrant at the time of his stop. See Practice Book \u00a7 821.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 728 and 815. The court denied these motions. Thereafter, the defendant entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere only to the third count of possession of narcotics, a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a). The disposition of the other three charges in the original information is not before us in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the police had no probable cause to stop the defendant\u2019s motor vehicle. The parties are in agreement that the basis for the police officers\u2019 stop of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was to issue a traffic summons for an unsafe lane change under General Statutes \u00a7 14-236.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 14-236 provides in relevant part that, \u201c[w]hen any highway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, (1) a vehicle shall be driven as nearly as prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>ticable entirely within a single, lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has ascertained that such movement can be made with safety . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The police officers testified that they first encountered the defendant\u2019s van traveling in the center of Interstate 84, when it subsequently crossed two lanes of the highway and cut in front of their cruiser and entered the Sisson Avenue exit ramp without giving a right turn signal. The officers characterized these movements as \u201crather hazardous.\u201d The defendant claims that such statements were inadequate to establish a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-236, in light of Tischofer\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that the vehicle was approximately ten car lengths ahead of the police cruiser at the point the officers observed the defendant\u2019s van and that Tischofer could not recall if there were any cars between the police cruiser and the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Whether the police , were justified in stopping the defendant\u2019s van for a motor vehicle infraction is, of course, an issue of fact.. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brindley, </em>25 Conn. Sup. 216, 220, 200 A.2d 247 (1963). From the record it is clear that the trial court was convinced, notwithstanding Tischofer\u2019s testimony on cross-examination, that there was a reasonable belief on the part of the police officers that the defendant\u2019s operation of the van constituted a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-236. In challenging this finding, the defendant bears the burden of proving that the court\u2019s conclusion is clearly erroneous, which is to say that it is unsupported by the facts. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061 (formerly \u00a7 3060D); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stepney, </em>191 Conn. 233, 239, 464 A.2d 758 (1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1084, 104 S. Ct. 1455, 79 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984). The officers\u2019 testimony that the van crossed two lanes of traffic without signaling, that there were other cars on the road, that the van cut in front of the police cruiser, and the charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>terization of the maneuver as hazardous provided sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officers were justified in stopping the defendant\u2019s van to issue a summons for a moving violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error asserts that if the police were justified in stopping the defendant\u2019s van for a traffic infraction, the ensuing warrantless arrest of the defendant was invalid and the subsequent warrantless search could not be upheld as lawfully incident to an arrest. We note at the outset that a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is per se unreasonable, subject only to a few specifically established and well delineated exceptions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 423, 512 A.2d 175 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 193 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1987). It is the state\u2019s burden at trial to establish the exception. Id., 424. A review of the memorandum of decision demonstrates that the trial court found that the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s van was justified as incident to a lawful arrest. <em>See New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>453 U.S. 454, 101 S. Ct. 2860, 69 L. Ed. 2d 768 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">If evidence obtained without a warrant was obtained as a result of a valid search and seizure incident to a lawful arrest, such evidence was not illegally obtained and is admissible. See <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S. Ct. 2034, 23 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>161 Conn. 371, 377-79, 288 A.2d 439 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1017, 92 S. Ct. 677, 30 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1972). \u201c[A] lawful custodial arrest creates a situation which justifies the contemporaneous search without a warrant of the person arrested and of the immediate surrounding area, whether or not there is probable cause to search. . . . [Sjearches incident to arrests have long been considered valid because of the need \u2018to remove any weapons that [the arrestee] might seek to use in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>resist arrest or effect his escape . . . \u2019 and the need to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 425. In our analysis of the constitutional validity of the search, we note that the defendant was placed under arrest when he was handcuffed and detained in the police cruiser. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>198 Conn. 209, 213, 502 A.2d 404 (1985); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 5.1 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The defendant first argues that the officers\u2019 observation in plain view of a portion of the gun belt was insufficient to establish probable cause for his arrest on the weapons in a motor vehicle charge. Without probable cause to make a warrantless arrest, he argues, the officers\u2019 ensuing warrantless search which uncovered the narcotics was invalid. It is axiomatic that \u201c[a] search cannot be sustained as incident to an arrest unless the arrest itself was valid.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>supra, 375. It is fundamental that a valid arrest may only be made upon probable cause. See 2 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 5.1 (b). The defendant argues that prior to the search of the van and the discovery of the narcotics, there was no probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u201cProbable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that a felony has been committed.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>supra, 376. \u201cIn order to establish probable cause, it is not necessary to produce a quantum of evidence necessary to convict.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The trial court found that prior to the search of the van, Tischofer observed a gun belt and ammunition which the court characterized as \u201chighly indicative of the presence of a firearm.\u201d The court deemed as \u201ccommon knowledge that pistols are carried in holsters attached to belts such as the one observed.\u201d We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that the officers\u2019 observation of the defendant\u2019s sole occupancy of a motor vehicle in which one of them saw a gun belt with ammunition constituted sufficient facts or circumstances to support a reasonable belief that the defendant was also carrying a weapon in the vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> an unclassified felony. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-25 (a), (c). We also note that the observation of the gun belt and ammunition did not constitute a search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, as they were in plain view of Tischofer. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>supra, 377; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Federici, </em>179 Conn. 46, 56 n.6, 425 A.2d 916 (1979) (the use of a flashlight does not affect propriety of the view).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In determining whether the police officers had probable cause to arrest the defendant for carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle, we also note that probable cause may exist even without ascertaining whether the defendant had a permit to carry the weapon discovered. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 148-49, 92 S. Ct. 1921, 32 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1972). <em>In Adams, </em>a Bridgeport police officer, acting upon information received moments earlier, approached a vehicle and asked the occupant to open the door. The occupant rolled down the window instead, whereupon the officer reached into the car and removed a fully loaded revolver from Williams\u2019 waistband. The gun had not been visible to the officer from outside the car, but it was in precisely the place indicated by the informant. The occupant was immediately arrested for unlawful possession of a weapon in a vehicle in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u00a7 29-38. The officer then conducted a search incident to that arrest, whereupon substantial quantities of heroin were found on the defendant\u2019s person and in his car. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In upholding the subsequent search of the defendant as incident to a lawful arrest, the United States Supreme Court reasoned that <em>\u201c[pjrobable cause does not require the same type of specific evidence of each element of the offense as would be needed to support a conviction. </em>See <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 311-312 [79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327] (1959). Rather, the court will evaluate generally the circumstances at the time of the arrest to decide if the officer had probable cause for his action: Tn dealing with probable cause, however, as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u2019 <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 175 [69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879] (1949).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 149. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that at the time the defendant was ordered out of the van, the police had probable cause to believe that he was carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>We also note that the warrantless arrest of the defendant was legally permissible pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (b). That section authorizes a police officer to arrest, \u201cwithout previous complaint and warrant, any person who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe has committed or is committing a felony.\u201d See also General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (a) (arrest by a peace officer without a warrant when the person is taken or apprehended in the act). We conclude, therefore, that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant had committed a felony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>189 Conn. 429, 431, 456 A.2d 333 (1983) (reasonable grounds to believe is equivalent to probable cause); 2 W. LaFave, supra, \u00a7 5.1 (b). The warrantless arrest, therefore, was legal and valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">The defendant also claims that if the police officers had probable cause to arrest him, the subsequent search under the seat cover which yielded the four packets of cocaine exceeded the permissible scope of the search incident to a lawful arrest. The defendant\u2019s argument relies upon the reason supporting the validity of a search incident to a lawful arrest, namely: \u201c \u2018to remove any weapons that [the arrestee] might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape . . . \u2019 and the need to prevent the concealment or destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 425, quoting <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra. The defendant argues that before the time of the search the defendant had been handcuffed and placed in the police cruiser. Under such circumstances, it is argued, the defendant could not have reasonably used any weapon in the van to resist arrest or to effectuate an escape. Whether the restraining of an arrestee by handcuffing and placing him in a police cruiser precludes the police officers from conducting a subsequent search, as incident to a lawful arrest, of the arrestee\u2019s vehicle was recently addressed by our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>In <em>Badgett, </em>the court held that a warrantless search of the contents of a small black zippered bag found in a windbreaker underneath the seat in the defendant\u2019s automobile conducted by a state trooper as the defendant was being driven to the police station by a second officer was beyond the proper scope of a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest because \u201cthe defendant [was] no longer at the scene of the arrest when the warrantless search was undertaken.\u201d Id., 427. In so concluding, the court relied upon <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra, 461, which holds that \u201ca lawful custodial arrest justifies a contemporaneous search of the entire passenger compartment of an automobile, whether or not the arrestee actually had control over the area.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 425. The court recognized that <em>Belton </em>\u201cfashioned a rule, \u2018easily applied, and predictably enforced\u2019 ... in order to provide clear guidance to police officers \u2018who have only limited time and expertise to reflect on and balance the social and individual interests involved in the specific circumstances they confront.\u2019 . . . <em>Belton </em>established this standard based upon a generalization that the interior of a car is always within the immediate control of an arrestee who has recently been in the car.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 426. Consistent with <em>Belton, </em>our Supreme Court observed in <em>Badgett </em>that \u201cwe ordinarily will refuse to evaluate whether or not an individual arrested while in an automobile actually had access to the passenger compartment at the time of the search.\u201d Id., 427. In so stating, the court cited several \u201canalogous situations where the arrestee seemingly had no opportunity to gain access to the passenger compartment of the automobile. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cotton, </em>751 F.2d 1146 (10th Cir. 1985) <em>(Belton </em>applicable even though defendant outside car and handcuffed); <em>Traylor </em>v. <em>State, </em>458 A.2d 1170 (Del. 1983) (defendant in handcuffs); <em>State </em>v. <em>Valdes, </em>423 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App. 1982) (defendant seated in police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>car); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>163 Ga. App. 141, 293 S.E.2d 529 (1982) (defendant seated in police car); see 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure, Search Incident to Arrest, 1986 Pocket Part \u00a7 7.1, p. 224 n.46.12.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">On the basis of the reasoning of <em>New York </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>supra, as adopted and applied in <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, we conclude that the search of the defendant\u2019s van was proper as incident to the lawful arrest of the defendant and did not violate his state or federal constitutional guaranties of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizure. See U.S. Const., amends. IV, XIV; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7. The defendant\u2019s argument that the search under the seat cover was beyond the permissible scope of a search for weapons is unpersuasive. Under the circumstances existing, it was reasonable for the police officers to believe that other weapons or additional ammunition may have been hidden under the seat cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim of error is that the trial court erred in finding that the police officers\u2019 investigative stop of the defendant was warranted under <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Acklin, </em>supra. The defendant argues that the police had no reasonably articulable justification for stopping him to conduct an investigatory search. We disagree that the officers\u2019 stop of the defendant\u2019s van and his subsequent restraint by handcuffs and placement in the police cruiser were improper. As we have already discussed, the police were justified in stopping the defendant\u2019s van for the purpose of issuing a traffic summons. The officers\u2019 conduct in ordering the defendant out of the van and restraining him was justifiably based upon probable cause that he was illegally carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle. The officers\u2019 actions were based upon probable cause, and not merely on a hunch, suspicion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>guesswork. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Januszewski, </em>182 Conn. 142, 149, 438 A.2d 679 (1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 922, 101 S. Ct. 3159, 69 L. Ed. 2d 1005 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that since the court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence, it consequently also erred in failing to grant the motion to dismiss the charges, because, without the illegal evidence, there was no probable cause to arrest the defendant. Because we find that the evidence was legally seized and, therefore, admissible, there was sufficient evidence to proceed with the charges against the defendant. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 728, 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b24-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 54-94a. conditional nolo contendere plea, appeal OF DENIAL of motion to suppress or dismiss.

He posits that the visible \u201cbullets may have pertained to a shotgun or rifle, firearms not included under General Statutes \u00a7 29-38.\u201d \u201cIn order to establish probable cause, it is not necessary to produce a quantum of evidence necessary to convict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobuzzi, </em>161 Conn. 371, 376, 288 A.2d 439 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1017, 92 S. Ct. 677, 30 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1972). We find that the observation of the gun belt and live ammunition provided the officers with sufficient evidence to conclude that the weapon for which they were designed was a weapon which required a proper permit to be carried.
