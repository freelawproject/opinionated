The failure of a party to produce a witness who is available and who would naturally be produced, permits an inference that the evidence which that witness would have given would be unfavorable to that party. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>195 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>552, 556, 489 A.2d 373 (1985); <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Any testimony of the witnesses which the defendant claims the state should have produced would have been cumulative, inferior, or relatively unimportant and the defendant, therefore, was not entitled to such an instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>supra. None of the witnesses had peculiar or superior material information. See <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>200 Conn. 172, 190, 510 A.2d 972 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
