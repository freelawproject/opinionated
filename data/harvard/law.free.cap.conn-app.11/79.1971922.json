The defendant is asking us to retry this case. We cannot. On appeal, the function of this court is limited solely to the determination of whether the factual findings of the trial court are clearly erroneous or whether the decision is otherwise erroneous in law.

Plumbing &amp; Heating, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 54, 56, 475 A.2d 341 (1984). It is the province of the trial court to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence. <em>Essex Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Leeker, </em>2 Conn.

This court cannot find facts or draw conclusions from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>primary facts found, but can only review such findings to determine whether they could legally, logically and reasonably be found and whether the trial court could thereby conclude as it did. <em>Appliances, Inc. </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>186 Conn. 673, 676-77, 443 A.2d 486 (1982); <em>Hallmark of Farmington </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>1 Conn.
