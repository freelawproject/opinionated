We find error in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: On February 28, 1985, at approximately 1:20 p.m., Enrique Oquendo, as driver, and Iris Zavala, as passenger, were in Oquendo\u2019s car which was stopped on Seyms Street in Hartford. Oquendo was talking to a person on the sidewalk when they noticed the defendant\u2019s car come to an abrupt stop alongside of them. Jose Castillo, the defendant\u2019s brother, emerged from the passenger side of the defendant\u2019s car carrying a gun and approached the passenger side of Oquendo\u2019s car. When he was approximately four feet from Zavala, he fired eight rounds into the car, seriously injuring both Oquendo and Zavala. Jose then returned to the defendant\u2019s car and they sped away.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Upon learning that he was being sought by the authorities in connection with the shooting, the defendant turned himself in to the police. Upon his arrest, the defendant was charged with two counts of being an accessory to assault in the first degree (counts one and two), in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-59, and two counts of conspiracy to, commit assault in the first degree (counts three and four), in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 and 53a-59. After his transfer to Part A of the Judicial District for trial, a fifth count was added charging him with having a weapon in a motor vehicle, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38. He pleaded not guilty to all five counts and was tried by a jury. At the close of the state\u2019s case, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied. The defendant then proceeded with the presentation of evidence in his defense. Thereafter, the jury found him not guilty on counts three and four, conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, but guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>on counts one and two, accessory to assault in the first degree, and on count five, having a weapon in a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">After the jury delivered its verdict, the defendant again moved for a judgment of acquittal on counts one, two and five. This motion was denied and the defendant was sentenced accordingly. The defendant then took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. Our standard for review of such a claim is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Malines, </em>11 Conn. App. 425, 431, 527 A.2d 1229 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stellato, </em>10 Conn. App. 447, 452, 523 A.2d 1345 (1987). In making such an evaluation, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 116, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">As to count five of the information charging the defendant with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-38, having a weapon in a vehicle, the defendant claims that there was no evidence that he had knowledge of the presence of the gun in his car, or that the gun met the statutory definition of a pistol. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-27 and 29-38. The state has expressly conceded at oral argument before this court that the evidence introduced relevant to this charge was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict and, consequently, that the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on that count. Accordingly, we will not review the evidence as to this count further. We direct the trial court to set aside the judgment of conviction as to the fifth count and render a judgment of not guilty on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The defendant\u2019s remaining challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction relates to the two counts of being an accessory to assault in the first degree. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-8 and 53a-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a), assault in the first degree* provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Section 53a-8 of the General Statutes provides that \u201c[a] person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d See footnote 1, supra. The essence of the defendant\u2019s claim is that there was no evidence from which the jury could conclude that he intended to aid his brother in the commission of the first degree assault. The defendant concedes for the purpose of this appeal that the actions of the brother, Jose Castillo, constituted an assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We find that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts. While fraternal relationship is not proof of aiding and abetting, it is relevant that the defendant is the brother of Jose Castillo. There was testimony that the defendant, approximately one week before the shooting, approached Oquendo on behalf of his brother and asked him to drop criminal charges initiated by Oquendo against the brother. As to the events surrounding the shooting, there was testimony that the defendant drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>his. brother to the scene of the shooting and pulled alongside Oquendo\u2019s car in an abrupt and threatening manner. There was also testimony that after the shooting, Jose Castillo returned to the defendant\u2019s car and the defendant quickly drove away without ascertaining if anyone was injured and without notifying the police:</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u25a0 Intent is rarely proven by direct evidence, but is classically proven by circumstantial evidence and the inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>7 Conn. App. 149, 155, 508 A.2d 49, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 512 A.2d 229 (1986). From the aforementioned facts, the jury could reasonably have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not an innocent bystander, but rather he intentionally aided his brother in committing the assaults in the first degree. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>9 Conn. App. 161, 163-65, 517 A.2d 640 (1986). The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the first and second counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument is that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt his version of the events surrounding the shooting. In reviewing the facts surrounding the shooting, the trial court gave the following instruction: \u201cI think all the testimony in this case boils down to a very simple situation. There is no question that this incident occurred on Seyms and Main Street. There is no question\u2014I do not think there is any question that it occurred on February 28, 1985, at about the time stated. There is no question that the defendant was driving his blue and white Pontiac and that he was in the vicinity of the victim\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\u201cThe only difference in the testimony is his knowledge of what was going on there. I mean that is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>difference in testimony because there was no other testimony of what his purpose was, other than that he was driving the car and that he was seen by the victim, Iris, and then the witness\u2014the defendant\u2019s own testimony of why he was there or how come he happened to be there, if that is as he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\u201cYou can take all of those things into consideration. You can take the actions which led up to this particular situation and draw whatever logical, reasonable inferences you feel that the evidence leads you to. So, remember, they must all be beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The defendant concedes that he took no exception to the court\u2019s instruction, but seeks review of this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), claiming that the court\u2019s instructions represent an impermissible shifting of the burden of proof onto the defendant. See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979). We decline to review this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, because we find that the instruction cannot reasonably be read to support the defendant\u2019s claim that the court impermissibly diluted the state\u2019s burden to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, or shifted such burden onto the defendant. In ascertaining whether the court\u2019s charge amounted to a constitutional deprivation, we further note the defendant\u2019s concession in his brief that in a number of places during the charge, the jury was correctly instructed that the state had the burden to prove the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We also note, as indicated in the state\u2019s brief, that the trial court correctly admonished the jury as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cThe accused does not have to prove that he did not commit the offenses with which he is charged, but the state must prove that he did, and to prove that, they must prove every essential element necessary to constitute the offense with which he is charged. The burden then is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the crime with which he is charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We find, therefore, that the record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that he has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>11 Conn. App. 80, 90-91, 525 A.2d 1353 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">There is error only as to the conviction of having a weapon in a motor vehicle, the judgment of conviction is set aside as to that count and the trial court is directed to render judgment of not guilty thereon and to amend the defendant\u2019s sentence accordingly; there is no error in the judgment of conviction on counts one and two, being an accessory to assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-8. criminal liability for acts of another.
