The plaintiff was represented by Connecticut Legal Services, Inc., a federally funded nonprofit organization which provides legal representation without cost to persons unable to afford private counsel. The plaintiff claimed attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62 and filed an affidavit of legal services rendered, including time sheets listing such services. The plaintiff claimed attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2100 which the trial court found to be justified and to be a \u201cmodest sum compared with what some of the divorce lawyers of [counsel\u2019s] experience would have charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Nonetheless, the court reduced the amount awarded because her counsel was employed by a federally funded nonprofit organization. The court stated: \u201cI think I\u2019ll cut the fees down because of its nonprofit status. If Mrs. Siegel was a private attorney then I would certainly have no hesitation [in] awarding twenty-one hundred dollars. But what I think I\u2019m going to do is simply cut in half, again without depreciating in any way her services because she\u2019s not getting the money anyway, and make it for an order of one thousand fifty. The fifty percent credit representing in some off-hand way in my own mind that since it is a federally funded organization that probably under all the circumstances a thousand fifty is fair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The plaintiff appeals from the 50 percent reduction in the amount of counsel fees claiming the trial court erred in arbitrarily reducing by half what it found to be justifiable and reasonable counsel fees under the circumstances in this case. We agree with the plaintiff and find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Although Connecticut courts have not addressed this issue, we may look to other jurisdictions for guidance. In family matters, the majority of courts have held that the award of counsel fees to the prevailing party is proper even when that party is represented without fee by a nonprofit legal services organization. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>492 A.2d 270, 274 (D.C.

Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1984), the United States Supreme Court held that an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a nonprofit legal service organization in a civil rights action was to be calculated according to the prevailing market rate. The court concluded from the legislative history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 that \u201cCongress did not intend the calculation of fee awards to vary depending on whether plaintiff was represented by private counsel or by a nonprofit legal services organization.\u201d Id., 894. Before the Supreme Court decided <em>Blum, </em>various circuit courts of appeal had also concluded that nonprofit legal service organizations are eligible for attorney\u2019s fees under federal civil rights laws. <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>Lamm, </em>713 F.2d 546, 551-52 (10th Cir. 1983); <em>Gautreaux </em>v. <em>Chicago Housing Authority, </em>690 F.2d 601, 613 (7th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 961, 103 S.

Cir. 1980) (en banc); <em>Perez </em>v. <em>Rodriguez Bou, </em>575 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Sachs, </em>538 F.2d 10, 12 (2d Cir. 1976) (attorney\u2019s fees under Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 19731 [e]); <em>Tillman </em>v. <em>Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc., </em>517 F.2d 1141, 1147-48 (4th Cir. 1975). These courts relied on both the legislative history of the civil rights acts and independent policy grounds in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We are aware that indigents are represented by legal services attorneys in a large number of family relations matters. It would be unreasonable to allow a losing party in a family relations matter to reap the benefits of free representation to the other party. A party should not be encouraged to litigate under the assumption that no counsel fee will be awarded in favor of the indigent party represented by public legal services; see <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Ferrigno, </em>supra; or as in this case, that a reasonable fee will be discounted for the same reason. \u201cPut in another way, the public should be relieved from the financial burden of obtaining an indigent plaintiff\u2019s divorce or successfully defending against a husband\u2019s complaint, to the extent that the husband is able to pay all or part of her attorney\u2019s fees. The taxpayer has an interest in recovering where possible a portion of the costs in these situations.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">An award of counsel fees that does not discriminate against nonprofit legal service entities will encourage nonprofit counsel to expend its resources in the representation of those clients who are unable to afford pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>vate counsel in disputed child custody and child support enforcement litigation. The purposes of such acts as the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act in Connecticut, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-91, are advanced and are made more available to the poor where there is an expectancy that the nonprofit legal sendees will recoup at least part of its resources through an award of counsel fees to its client. Furthermore, a realization that the opposing party, although poor, has access to an attorney and that an attorney\u2019s fee may be awarded deters noncompliance with the law and encourages settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We note that the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 do not include the court\u2019s consideration of counsel\u2019s status as a nonprofit or publicly funded organization when making an award of counsel\u2019s fees. The court in making its determination \u201cmay order either spouse to pay the reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of the other in accordance with their respective financial abilities and the criteria set forth in Sec. 46b-82.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62. Section 46b-82 sets forth the criteria for awarding alimony. Therefore, in addition to the financial ability of the parties, the court must also consider the length of the marriage, causes for the dissolution, age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties and, in the case of a parent to whom custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability of such parents securing employment. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The trial court, in expressly stating that it was halving the award because of \u201cits nonprofit status\u201d and \u201csince it is a federally funded organization,\u201d introduced a factor not contained in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82. The language of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-62 and 46b-82 makes no provision for any consideration of the status of the legal services rendered, be it private coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>sel or nonprofit counsel. While the court in the exercise of its inherent equitable powers may consider factors other than those enumerated in the statutes if such factors are appropriate for a just and equitable resolution of the marital dispute; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>187 Conn. 70, 72, 444 A.2d 234 (1982); <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>2 Conn. App. 635, 642, 482 A.2d 77 (1984); the court here made no effort to establish how a reduction in half of attorney\u2019s fees solely because of the nonprofit status of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was appropriate for a just and equitable resolution of the dispute. We therefore cannot consider such a reduction to be anything other than arbitrary and erroneous. See <em>In re Marriage of Brockett, </em>supra, (error for trial court to refuse attorney\u2019s fee to nonprofit organization where statute does not expressly limit a fee awarded to a legal services office).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">There is error, the order for counsel fees is set aside and the case is remanded with instructions to award counsel fees in the amount of $2100.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> As one commentator has stated: \u201cLegal services for the poor is free only to the indigent person. Someone has to pay for it and that someone\u2014 the taxpayer\u2014should be compensated, the compensation being the increased effectiveness of the legal services program.\u201d G.
