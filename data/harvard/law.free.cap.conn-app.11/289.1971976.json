J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsF\">The plaintiffs, a husband and wife, appeal from the order of the trial court which reduced the sum of a prejudgment remedy of attachment of the defendant\u2019s property. This court previously decided that the appeal was untimely and therefore dismissed the appeal. <em>Gibbs </em>v. <em>Mase, </em>10 Conn. App. 144, 523 A.2d 506 (1987). After reconsideration, we find that the untimely filing of the appeal was not a jurisdictional defect because of our Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Giordano Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>182 Conn. 577, 438 A.2d 772 (1980), and that the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was properly before this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This opinion, therefore, supersedes our previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The plaintiffs purchased a home which was built and sold by the defendant. After subsequently discovering defects in the home, the plaintiffs brought a five count complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against the defendant, claiming unworkmanlike construction, breach of warranty, and a breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. On May 29,1985, the plaintiff obtained an ex parte attachment of the defendant\u2019s property in the amount of $23,232, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">On August 21,1985, the defendant brought a motion to dissolve or modify the ex parte prejudgment attachment. A probable cause hearing was held on November 6, 1985, in which the parties introduced expert testimony as to damages. The trial court concluded that the plaintiffs did not establish that they would prevail on their CUTPA claim. Moreover, the trial court found that the reasonable cost of correction, with interest and costs, was $2500. The trial court therefore granted the defendant\u2019s motion, and reduced the amount of the attachment to the sum of $2500.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The sole claim of error raised by the plaintiffs on appeal is that the trial court erred in holding that they did not establish probable cause that the defendant had violated the provisions of CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Before we reach the substance of the plaintiffs claim, we must determine if the trial court\u2019s action was an appealable final judgment. <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>181 Conn. 42, 44, 434 A.2d 310 (1980); <em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford Special, Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 388, 390, 480 A.2d 561 (1984). Not all orders which grant or deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>a motion to modify a prejudgment remedy are final judgments. A defendant may bring a motion for the modification of a prejudgment remedy pursuant to either of two statutes: General Statutes \u00a7 52-278e, or General Statutes \u00a7 52-278k.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 52-278e provides that a defendant \u201cmay move to dissolve or modify the prejudgment remedy ... in which event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion expeditiously.\u201d An order modifying a prejudgment remedy pursuant to \u00a7 52-278e is an appealable final judgment. General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-2781. </em>Section 52-278k, on the other hand, provides that \u201c[t]he court may . . . upon motion and after hearing, at any time modify or vacate any prejudgment remedy heretofore granted upon the presentation of evidence . . . . \u201d An order modifying a prejudgment remedy pursuant to a motion brought under \u00a7 52-278k is a nonappealable interlocutory order \u201cbecause it is not within those orders listed as \u2018final judgments] for purposes of appeal\u2019 under General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-2781 </em>(a).\u201d <em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford Special, Inc., </em>supra, 390, citing <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In the present case, the trial court\u2019s order which reduced the amount of the attachment of the defendant\u2019s property was issued when it granted the defendant\u2019s motion. That motion, however, does not indicate which section the defendant relied upon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to determine whether the trial court\u2019s action was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>appealable final judgment, therefore, we must first determine which section applies to the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 46, our Supreme Court distinguished the two sections by stating that orders under \u00a7 52-278e \u201coperate in a different time frame than do orders under \u00a7 52-278k.\u201d Section 52-278k permits a motion for the modification of a prejudgment remedy to be brought <em>at any time. </em>Section 52-278e, on the other hand, does not contain any time period within which a defendant is directed to bring a motion to dissolve or modify the prejudgment remedy. The court noted that motions brought under \u00a7 52-278e should be \u201cprompt\u201d because \u201c[i]t is entirely appropriate to allow prompt appeal from <em>promptly contested prejudgment orders </em>but not to afford the same priority to the unsuccessful belated reopening of such claims.\u201d Id. (Emphasis added.) The court did not provide, however, the test by which to determine a \u201cpromptly contested prejudgment order.\u201d In <em>City National Bank, </em>prejudgment remedies of attachment and garnishment were ordered after a probable cause hearing in 1976. The defendants moved, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-278k, to vacate the previously ordered prejudgment remedies two years later in 1978. The defendants thereafter appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The defendant in the present case filed his motion to dissolve or modify the prejudgment order less than three months after the trial court\u2019s original prejudgment order. We find that this prejudgment order was promptly contested, and that the defendant\u2019s motion was brought pursuant to \u00a7 52-278e. The trial court\u2019s order which reduced the attachment, therefore, was an appealable final judgment, and the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is properly before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 principal argument is that, by proving that the defendant had signed a contract in which he had made statements that certain work would be performed on his property which was subsequently not performed, they clearly established probable cause that the defendant had violated the provisions of CUTPA. That statute provides that \u201cno person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b. The plaintiffs claim that the trial court erred when it held that there was probable cause on the breach of contract counts of the complaint, but not on the CUTPA count of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In deciding prejudgment remedy motions, the trial court \u201cmust evaluate the arguments and evidence produced by both parties.\u201d <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>173 Conn. 426, 429, 378 A.2d 538 (1977). The trial court, however, need not make a full and final decision on the factually and legally complex issues as were raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA claim, as the probable cause hearing \u201cis not intended to be a full-scale trial on the merits.\u201d Id. Rather, the trial court, in ruling upon the defendant\u2019s motion, need only weigh the evidence presented and \u201cdetermine probable success by weighing probabilities.\u201d <em>Three S. Development Co. </em>v. <em>Santore, </em>193 Conn. 174, 176, 474 A.2d 795 (1984). The trial court necessarily has broad discretion in reaching this determination, and is not to be overruled in the absence of clear error. Id.; <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Our role in reviewing the decision of the trial court is even more circumscribed than that of the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Babiarz </em>v. <em>Hartford Special, Inc., </em>supra, 393. As such, we are not to duplicate the trial court\u2019s weighing process. Instead, our review is limited to determining whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable. Id. \u201cIn the absence of clear error, this court should not overrule the thoughtful decision of the trial court, which has had an opportunity to assess the legal issues which may be raised and to weigh the credibility of at least some of the witnesses.\u201d <em>Augeri </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Our Supreme Court has recognized that in determining whether a practice violates CUTPA, the trial court must determine: \u201c \u2018 \u201c(1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise\u2014whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers [(competitors or other businessmen)].\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Sportsmen\u2019s Boating Corporation </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>supra, 756, quoting <em>McLaughlin Ford, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>192 Conn. 558, 568, 473 A.2d 1185 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The fact that the trial court found that the plaintiffs had established probable cause that they would prevail on the breach of warranty counts of their complaint does not imply or necessitate an automatic finding by the trial court of a violation of CUTPA. The plaintiffs must also establish that the breach of warranty offended public policy, was immoral or unscrupulous, or had an injurious effect on the consumer. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court noted that after hearing the witnesses, it attributed very little weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to the testimony of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses. The reasonable cost of correction resulting from the defendant\u2019s breach of warranty was assessed to be only $1750. The trial court could reasonably have concluded, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s breach of the contract was not offensive to public policy. We find, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiffs would not prevail in their CUTPA claim was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> Although we are bound to follow the precedent established by our Supreme Court in <em>Giordano Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>182 Conn. 577, 438 A.2d 772 (1980), it is our opinion that it might be appropriate for the Supreme Court to reconsider the per curiam holding of that case. In <em>Giordano, </em>the court held that an \u201cuntimely filing of an appeal is merely an irregularity and not a jurisdictional defect.\u201d Id., 579. In reaching the conclusion that \u201c[t]he fact that the appeal statute specifies a time period in which to take an appeal does not mean that an appeal taken beyond the specified time is void\u201d; id.; the court cited as authority <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>158 Conn. 486, 493, 264 A.2d 576 (1969). That case, however, involved an appeal brought beyond the twenty-day time period prescribed by our rules of practice. Time limitations set forth in our rules of practice are <em>not </em>legislatively created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>conditions precedent to the jurisdiction of this court. Id., 492. In our opinion, however, if a <em>statute, </em>such as General Statutes \u00a7 <em>52-2781, </em>establishes appellate jurisdiction and provides for an unambiguous and specific time period within which to bring an appeal, the existence and extent of such appellate jurisdiction should be strictly limited to that time period. See <em>Basilicato </em>v. <em>Department of Public Utility Control, </em>197 Conn. 320, 322, 497 A.2d 48 (1985); <em>LaReau </em>v. <em>Reincke, </em>supra, 492; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>4 Conn. L. Trib. No. 52, p. 14 (Appellate Session of the Superior Court at Hartford, No. 349) (1978). In our opinion, such requirement <em>cannot </em>be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The granting or denial of a prejudgment remedy is an order issued prior to final judgment. Appeals from such orders presently exist under the statutory authority of General Statutes \u00a7 52-2782. Cf. <em>E. J. Hansen Elevator, Inc., </em>v. <em>Stoll, </em>167 Conn. 623, 630, 356 A.2d 893 (1975). That statute specifically provides that \u201c[n]o such appeal shall be taken except within seven days of the rendering of the order from which the appeal is to be taken.\u201d Our legislature, while permitting appeals from such interlocutory orders, has clearly mandated that such appeals be brought within seven days of the rendering of the trial court\u2019s order. The nature of a prejudgment remedy warrants the <em>prompt </em>resolution by appellate process of disputes arising from the granting or denying of such a remedy. Section 52-2782, therefore, permits the <em>immediate </em>appeal from orders relating to a prejudgment remedy. <em>City National Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>181 Conn. 42, 46, 434 A.2d 310 (1980). To hold that an appeal brought beyond this particular statutorytime limitation is not a jurisdictional defect is, in our opinion, to ignore and disregard a legislative directive. Because the right of appeal is purely statutory, it should be accorded <em>only </em>\u201cif the conditions fixed by statute . . . are met.\u201d <em>DeTeves </em>v. <em>DeTeves, </em>202 Conn. 292, 295, 520 A.2d 608 (1987), citing <em>Prevedini </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corporation, </em>164 Conn. 287, 293, 320 A.2d 797 (1973); see also <em>Viola </em>v. <em>Dial Tone Lounge, Inc., 4 </em>Conn. L. Trib. No. 28, p. 9 (Appellate Session of the Superior Court at Hartford, No. 503) (1978). It is our view that the legislative mandate provided in \u00a7 52-2782 should be followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-7\"> In the first count of his revised complaint, the plaintiff alleged negligence and unworkmanlike construction.
