There being no evidence in the agreed statement of facts, that the plaintiff or those under whom it claims, ever reclaimed or attempted to reclaim any portion of the water-front embraced within the lines of its water-front, if the same had heen protracted in accordance with its rights as riparian proprietor, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this action any portion of its said water-front so unreclaimed as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-12\">3. As it appears from the agreed statement of facts in this cause, that the dock at the foot of Webster street, is at the foot of one of the public streets of the city, as designated on Poppleton\u2019s Plat, and said dock was made by the defendant pursuant to the terms and provisions of Ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>nance No. Ill, of 1853, and the Ordinance supplementary thereto of 119, of 1853, and in compliance with the petition of a majority in interest of the adjacent property owners, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this action any portion of the property or premises embraced within the lines of said dock at the foot of Webster street, so made as aforesaid by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">The Court, (Dobbin, J.,) granted the plaintiff\u2019s prayer, and rejected the prayers of the defendant.

R. Co. vs. Chase, </em>43 <em>Md., </em>36.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The appellants however, without the consent of the appellees, have constructed a dock across the lot of the latter, thus depriving them of a water front, to which they were entitled, of over three hundred feet; and the appellants claim title to the improvement thus made, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>cause of its being at the foot of a public street, and they claim also the land made between the side of the dock and the Port Warden\u2019s line.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b434-9\">(Decided 26th March, 1878.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Now the plain answer to the claim thus set-up by the appellants, is, that Webster street at the foot of which the dock has been excavated, has never been opened as a public street, nor has there been any condemnation or compensation paid to the owners of the bed of said street. Until the street has been opened and compensation paid to the owners, the city has no more right to the bed of the street than any other stranger would have, and the intrusion by the city upon such property is as much a trespass as if committed by an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The appellants having, therefore, entered upon the property of the appellees, and having constructed the dock, and having made other improvements by filling in of the land between the dock and the Port Warden\u2019s line, without the consent of the appellees, it follows according to the repeated decisions of this Court, that such improvements must be declared to belong to the riparian owner, in front of whose lot they are made. <em>Casey\u2019s Lessee vs. Inloes, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>510.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The judgment below must therefore he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
