If the jury believe from the evidence that the alleged slanderous words were uttered by the defendant as alleged, but were so uttered solely in reference to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in writing the letter to Doty, spoken of in the evidence, and were not intended, and were not understood by the bystanders to charge the plaintiff with having committed a felony, then the plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages merely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-13\">2.

If the jury believe that the defendant uttered the words, \u201c confidence man,\u201d in reference 'to the plaintiff, meaning thereby to impute to plaintiff, the commission of no crime or felony, and that said words were meant and understood to charge the plaintiff with being a man who abused one\u2019s confidence after obtaining it, by professing to be a friend, then the plaintiff cannot recover for the utterance of said words in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">5. The jury in order to find for the plaintiff under the third count of the declaration, must not only find that the defendant uttered the words, \u201cyou are a confidence man,\u201d in regard to the plaintiff, but that he was understood by the bystanders thereby to charge that the plaintiff had been, and was guilty of obtaining by false pretence from some other person, some chattel, money or valuable security, with intent to defraud such person of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">The Court, (Dobbin, J.,) granted the plaintiff\u2019s prayer and rejected the first, second, third and fourth prayers of the defendant, the third and fourth being rejected on the ground of want of evidence to sustain them.

Cases, </em>279; <em>Stone vs. Clark, </em>21 <em>Pick., </em>53; <em>Carter vs. Andrews, </em>6 <em>Pick., </em>3; <em>Dexter vs. Taber, </em>12 <em>John., </em>239 : <em>Norton vs. Ludd, </em>5 <em>N.

It covers the third count, in which the words are not actionable in themselves, and therefore, required a colloquium. It was, therefore, for the jury, from the facts of the case, to decide whether the words, \u201cyou are a confidence man,\u201d were used in the sense imported in the colloquium, and were so understood by the hearers, and were, therefore, <em>actionable </em>\u2014 Peterson <em>vs Sentman, </em>37 <em>Md., </em>140; <em>Randall vs. Butler, </em>7 <em>Barb., </em>260 ; <em>Atkinson vs. Scammon, </em>22 <em>N. H., </em>43 \u2014 otherwise it would have been necessary to have averred in the colloquium, that the words confidence man \u201d had, by usage, acquired such a signification as to impute a definite offence, and were so understood by the hearers. <em>Pike vs. Van Warmer, </em>5 <em>How. Pr. R., </em>175.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-8\">There is no pretence that the words have acquired, by usage, such a signification. The plaintiff relied on the use of the words in the sense set out in the third count. The prayer is simply to the effect, that if such sense was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>intended by defendant, then the plaintiff cannot recover for the use of such words, \u201c confidence man.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-5\">The granting of the plaintiff\u2019s prayer was erroneous. It assumed that the plaintiff had a right to recover under the third count. It is submitted that there is no evidence in the cause, under which the plaintiff could recover under this third count. Because there is no proof that the defendant used the words \u201cconfidence man\u201d in the special sense charged in the third count. The plaintiff\u2019s prayer therefore, was erroneous in so far as it assumed the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover under the third count.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\"><em>John 8. </em>Tyson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-7\">The defendant\u2019s first prayer was rightly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-8\">1st. Because if \u201cthe alleged slanderous words were-uttered by the defendant as alleged,\u201d <em>i. e. </em>\u201cfalsely and maliciously,\u201d this constitutes the whole gist of the action for slander, and negatives every defence. 2 <em>Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev., </em>808.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-9\">2nd. There is no evidence that the words were uttered \u201c solely in reference to the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in writing the letter.\u201d Defendant does not use the word \u201c solely.\u201d He says: \u201cthe <em>excitement and letter </em>caused all that was-said.\u201d It is unreasonable to suppose that the defendant intended to testify, that when he called the plaintiff a. \u201c thief,\u201d he merely meant that he was a letter-writer, yet. the language of the prayer would require the jury to find that such was the defendant\u2019s meaning, and that he was so understood by the bystanders. The fact that the-slanders were uttered without any ground for believing them to he true, instead of diminishing the damages, (as. this prayer would have it,) ought rather to increase them. It is certainly immaterial to inquire whether the words, were uttered \u201cin reference to \u201d one thing, or another ; or were caused by one thing or another ; the question is as to how they were intended and understood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>3rd. There is no evidence that the words were intended, or understood, in any but their ordinary sense. Even as to the words <em>11 confidence man\u201d </em>\u2014 the only words which the defendant endeavored to explain \u2014 he merely testified that <em>he </em>understood by those words, \u201c one who claims to be your friend and turns out to be your enemy a definition not at all <em>inconsistent </em>with the common acceptation of the words, as meaning a criminal offence. But the prayer also applies to the word <em>\u201cthief,\u201d </em>as one of \u201cthe alleged slanderous words,\u201d and defendant does not tell us what he understood by that word. <em>Chipman vs. Stansbury, </em>16 <em>Md., </em>154.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">Eor does the defendant say what the bystanders understood by any of the words. There is, in fact, no evidence whatever, in the least degree, tending to prove that the words were intended or understood in any but their ordinary sense. <em>Long vs. Eakle, </em>4 Md., 454.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">A forcible refutation of the doctrine contained in the defendant\u2019s second prayer is found in 1 <em>StarJde on Slander, </em>213, <em>{margin.) \u201c </em>It seems to be clear, as well upon legal principles, as on those of morality and policy, that where the wilful act of publishing defamatory matter derives no excuse or <em>qualification </em>from collateral circumstances, none can arise from a consideration, that the author of the mischief was not actuated by any deliberate and malicious intention to injure, beyond that which is <em>necessarily to be inferred form the very act itself. </em>For if a man wilfully does an act likely to occasion mischief to another, and to subject him to disgrace, obloquy, and temporal damage, he must, in point of law, as well as morals, be presumed to have contemplated the evil consequences which were likely to ensue. * * * It would be highly impolitic and inconvenient as a rule of law to permit every man to destroy the characters of others, provided he was not actuated by motives of <em>express </em>malice, but acted without consideration, heedless of consequences.\u201d See also 2 <em>Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev., </em>808.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The defendant\u2019s third prayer is substantially the same as the first prayer, and liable to the same objections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">The defendant\u2019s fourth prayer was rightly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\">1st. Because it is based upon the mere belief of the jury, and not upon their belief from the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\">2nd. There is no evidence to support it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-8\">3rd. It only leaves to the jury to find that the defendant <em>meant </em>to impute no crime, but, does not require them to find that he was <em>understood </em>by the bystanders to impute no crime ; for although it requires the jury to believe \u201cthat said words were meant and <em>understood </em>to charge the plaintiff with being a man who abused one\u2019s confidence,\u201d &amp;c., the words might have been so understood, and also understood to impute a crime. Eor a \u201c confidence man \u2019 \u2019 is indeed one who abuses confidence, &amp;c., and thereby obtains money or goods under false pretences. Besides, the prayer leaves it to the jury to believe <em>how </em>the words were understood, without saying <em>by whom </em>they were so understood. The words \u201cconfidence man\u201d have acquired a definite meaning ; require no innuendo, nor any evidence to show how they were understood by the bystanders, especially in <em>connection </em>with the word \u201cthief.\u201d <em>Woolnoth vs. Meadows, </em>5 <em>East, </em>463 ; <em>Roberts vs. Camden, </em>9 <em>East, </em>93; <em>Garrett vs. Dickerson, </em>19 <em>Md., </em>441-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s prayer merely instructs the jury that they <em>may </em>(not must) assess ' exemplary damages. This proposition certainly needs no authority to support it. No ground of objection to this prayer was disclosed at the trial. There is no special exception to it. As to exemplary damages, see <em>McWilliams vs. Hoban, </em>42 Md., 57.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b512-10\">Bowie, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Avd\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">The appellee in this case sued the appellant in the Superior Court of Baltimore City, in an action for slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">The <em>nar. </em>contained three counts ; the first, charged the defendant with falsely and maliciously saying of the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>tiff, <em>\u201c You are a thief.\u201d </em>The second count alleged, the defendant falsely and maliciously published of the plaintiff, the words following, viz., <em>\u201c </em>You are no better, than a thief.\u201d And the third count charged, that the defendant intending to injure the plaintiff in his good name, etc., falsely and maliciously spoke and published of the plaintiff, the words following, that is to say, \u201c <em>You are a confidence man,\u201d </em>thereby, and then and there meaning that he, the plaintiff had been and was guilty of obtaining by false pretence from some other person, some chattel, etc., with intent to defraud such person.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The defendant pleaded <em>\u201cnon cul.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">At the trial the plaintiff, to maintain the issue joined on his part, testified in his own behalf that he was a cattle dealer at Calverton Drove Yards; that in the spring of 1875, Messrs. Baugher <em>&amp; </em>Redsecker, proprietors of the Calverton Drove Yards failed, and the plaintiff succeeded them in the fall of 1875 ; that he bought from Baugher with defendant\u2019s approval, a quarter interest in two trotting horses, in which Fawsett had an interest, and had authority from Baugher to settle the earnings of the horses with Fawsett, who had the management of the horses ; Fawsett gave a statement and plaintiff asked for an itemized acJ count which Fawsett gave; which did not contain an item of $100 for cash paid one Doty for driving; he then gave another account containing this item, and exceeding the former account by at least $1000 for the same period ; the plaintiff then wrote to Doty to inquire if the charge- of $100 was correct, and also wrote to others. Doty sent plaintiff\u2019s letter to Fawsett. Witness further testified, that on Tuesday, before the 24th May, 1876, it being market morning, a number of persons about, he was at Calverton Hotel when Fawsett came in, handed witness <em>Doty\u2019s letter </em>and asked witness if he had written it, and why; witness told him, <em>\u201c </em>Because he had a right do it;\u201d Fawsett said, \u2018c that if he had been at home when he received the letter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>he would have cowhided witness \u201csaid I was a liar,\u201d \u201c said I was a confidence man,\u201d \u201c no better than a thief\u201d\u2014 \u201c yes, a thief,\u201d etc. Several other witnesses were called on the part of the plaintiff. John Winyard testified, that he heard, on the occasion in question Eawsett call Clark <em>a liar and a thief, </em>said he would steal and rob.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">On cross-examination he said, Eawsett had a letter, and asked him Clark if he wrote it; Eawsett said, Clark had acted like a thief; he said <em>that in connection </em>with that letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">S. D. Hawkins, in his examination-in-chief by plaintiff, testified \u201c Eawsett walked over to Clark, shewed him the letter ; asked him if he had written it, said no gentleman would have written such a letter ; told him that he was a \u201c confidence man,\u201d \u201c no better than a thief,\u201d said \u201c he was a thief,\u201d or \u201c no better than a thief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Being cross-examined, this witness said, that the whole quarrel had reference to the letter. The substance of what Eawsett said to him was, <em>you have charged me with malting false accounts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">The defendant was examined in his own behalf, and deposed substantially to the same facts, saying \u201cthat the letter caused all that was said, there was no other trouble between them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The appellant offered five prayers, the first four were rejected, and the fifth conceded. The appellee submitted one prayer which was granted. The appeal is taken from these rulings below. Omitting the second of the appellant\u2019s series, (which was not insisted on in this Court,) they all maintain the proposition, that the words spoken, though actionable <em>\u201cper se,\u201d </em>if spoken in relation to a subject as to which no larceny or felony was capable of being committed, or was committed, the charge will not be actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">The first prayer was refused absolutely, the third and fourth upon the ground that there was no evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>sustain them ; from which it might be inferred that if there had been in the judgment of the Court below, evidence tending to show the words were used in relation to the letter, or the matters contained in it, those prayers would have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The doctrine of the elementary writers on slander is, that words should be construed in reference to the subject-matter \u2014 \u201c Words may import a charge of felony, yet if it appear that the fact charged could not have happened, an action cannot be maintained.\u201d <em>Snagg vs. </em>Gee, 4 <em>Co., </em>16 <em>(a,) 2 Bing. N. C., </em>402 ; <em>Stephens\u2019 Nisi Prius, </em>2553.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Lord Hobart says, \u201cthe slander and damage consist in the apprehension of the hearers ; and in <em>Gilbert\u2019s Oases on Law &amp; </em>Equity, the rule laid down is, that the words shall be taken in the sense in which the hearers understood them.\u201d <em>Ibid; vide </em>also, 1 <em>American Leading Cases, Hare &amp; Wallace, </em>118, <em>Notes to Broker vs. Coffin, etc., 3rd Edition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Lord Denman (in the case of <em>Read vs. Ambridge, </em>6 <em>C. &amp; P., </em>308,) after having stated to the jury, that the first question for their consideration was whether they thought the words showed an intention to impute felony, observed \u201c It is said, that the words evidently meant, that the plaintiff had rohbed Mrs. Read, by injuring her in trade.\u201d But if the defendant meant to convey that' meaning, it seems to me he should have used very different words. It is not enough that he had some reservation in his own mind. The question is, <em>what he meant to make other people believe ? </em>whether he meant to have it understood by others, that the plaintiff had committed a felony ?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">. The words used in this case, were, \u201c Do you know that you are extremely wrong for putting that damned thief's name in your window ; he is the most blasted thief in the world, and ought to have been hung with his aunt years ago. You may tell him from me, that he is a bloody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>thief, and I can prove it; and he ought to he hung.\u201d The-jury found a nominal verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Mr. Chitty, in his note to 3 <em>Black. Com., </em>123, upon injuries affecting reputation, after specifying words which are actionable in themselves, says, \u201c The accusation however must he precise, or have such an allusion to some prior transaction, that the hearers of the slander must necessarily have understood that the slanderer meant to impute to the plaintiff, guilt of some punishable offence ; for though'the rule of construing words c <em>in mitiori sensu,\u2019 </em>is now exploded, yet an innuendo or construction cannot be given to words, which they do not necessarily import, either of themselves, independently of any other circumstances, or with necessary reference, or some other circumstances occurring at the time of the accusation. 6 <em>T. R., </em>691 ; 4 <em>Co., </em>17 <em>b. </em>; 11 <em>Mod., </em>99, <em>etc.\u201d </em>In the case of <em>Garret vs. Dickerson, </em>19 <em>Md., </em>418, this Court recognized this principle, and said in case of slander, words take their actionable character from the sense in which they appear to have been used, and that in which they are most likely to he understood by those who hear <em>them </em>\u2014 vide <em>also, </em>2 <em>Greenleaf\u2019s Ev., sec. </em>417, <em>13th </em>Edition, <em>p. </em>378.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The words laid in the several counts, both those which are actionable <em>\u201cper se,\u201d </em>and those which are not, are charged' as being spoken in the second person, addressed to the plaintiff himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The evidence of the plaintiff, testifying for himself is, that these words were part of a violent, verbal remonstrance by the defendant, against the conduct of the plaintiff, in writing a letter to a third person, relating to defendant's transactions with him \u2014 Referring to the letter and its contents, the defendant said the plaintiff was \u201ca liar,\u201d \u201c a confidence man \u201d \u2014 \u201cno better than a thief,\u201d \u2014 a thief\u2014 that the plaintiff \u201chad sued him,\u201d and he had offered to pay more than I, (the plaintiff,) would ever get \u2014 \u201c <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>substance of what Faiosett said in regard to the letter loas, that I, {the plaintiff,) had charged him therein with making false accounts.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">All the witnesses corroborate this view. The circumstances show, that the terms of reproach used were mere abuse, \u2014 the outpouring of passion; \u201cliar,\u201d \u201cthief,\u201d \u201cconfidence man,\u201d were uttered in quick succession, in reference to the contents of the letter, explaining to all who heard them, the sense in which they were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u201cIn an action of slander for words, some of which if spoken and understood in their ordinary sense, would certainly he actionable, the jury may consider whether taking the whole conversation together, the particular words are so qualified by the other parts of the conversation, as to show that they were not intended to convey the idea which their primary and ordinary meaning would give.\u201d <em>Shipley vs. Todhunter, </em>7 <em>C. &amp; P., </em>680 ; 8 <em>Stephens\u2019 N. P., </em>2575.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Measured by the standard of these authorities, we think there was evidence offered by the defendant, tending, to show that the words used by him were not intended to impute to the plaintiff a felony or other infamous crime, and the third and fourth prayers of the defendant, instructing the jury if they found they were not so intended, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The defendant\u2019s first prayer, announcing the same principle, allowed the plaintiff nominal damages, and being inconsistent in that respect, with the third and fourth, was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s prayer prescribing the measure of damages is not obnoxious to the objection urged by the appellant, that it assumed the appellee had a right to recover on the third count. On the contrary, it is put hypothetically, viz., \u201cif the jury shall find for the plaintiff, upon any count in the declaration.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b518-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>(Decided 2nd May, 1878.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The third and fourth prayers of the appellant being improperly rejected, the judgment below will he reversed, and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>and new trial aioarded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
