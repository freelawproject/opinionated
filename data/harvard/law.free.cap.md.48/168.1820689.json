The appellants under a contract with the Mayor and City Council, were about to construct a sewer under the bed of Carey street, between Fayette and Mulberry streets, and gave notice to the appellee of this purpose, the effect of which would be to remove the tracks from the street and stop the operation of the railway during the time required for the completion of the sewer. The appellee thereupon filed a bill for an injunction to prevent the appellants from removing the railway tracks of the complainant from the bed of Carey street between Fayette and Mulberry streets, and from interfering with the use thereof by the complainant., for the passage of its railway cars and the horses propelling the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">The bill averred that said sewer could -be constructed on said street without the removal therefrom of said railway tracks or obstructing tbe same, either by shoring up said tracks in their present position, or by removing them to-one side of said street; that both modes were perfectly feasible; and the complainant was willing that the latter plan should be adopted, provided it be done at the expense of the defendants. The Court, (Gilmor, J.,) granted the injunction. The defendants answered the bill, and took an appeal from the order granting the injunction.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b181-7\">The cause was argued before Bartol, C.

It is apparent from the bill that the sewer could not be constructed without interfering with the railway track of the appellee, and whatever injury may result therefrom, must be regarded in law as <em>41 damnum absque injuria.\u201d</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b183-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>(Decided 8th March, 1878.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The fact that the sewer was being constructed by the appellants under a contract with the City authorities, does not affect the question. The order therefore granting the injunction must be reversed and the hill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\n<em>Order reversed and bill dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
