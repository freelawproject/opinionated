The fund was in a Court of equity for distribution, and the law not only declares that six per cent, shall be the legal interest, but makes it unlawful to charge a higher rate, and if the proceedings show that the objection to the claim of the appellant was on the ground of usurious interest, it was the duty of the Court to disallow it, \u2022 although a special plea of usury was not filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">But it is contended, that the second mortgage is not liable to this objection, because it was executed subsequent to, and in strict conformity with the provisions of, the Act of 1872, ch. 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">In <em>Robertson s Case, </em>10 <em>Md., </em>397, <em>Building Associations </em>incorporated under the Act of 1852, chapter 148, were held to be in the nature of joint stock companies in which the members were entitled to a community of interest, and the borrower being entitled to a proportion of the profits earned hy the corporation, mortgages executed in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>formity with the provisions of that Act, were not liable to objection on the ground of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">In <em>Williar vs. Balto. Butchers\u2019 Loan and Annuity Association, </em>these provisions were held however not to apply to corporations like the appellant, because although the mortgagor becomes in a <em>certain sense a shareholder, </em>that is, he subscribes for a certain number of shares, yet immediately on borrowing the money, he executes a mortgage <em>releasing or transferring to the company his shores of stock, </em>and thereby ceases to have any interest in the profits earned by the corporation. Such a transaction is but a mere device to avoid the law of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Now in order to make that lawful which before was unlawful, and to authorize the appellant to loan money at a higher rate of interest than six per cent., reliance is had upon the Act of 1872, chap. 178, which provides, that the law in regard to Building Associations shall apply to corporations like the appellant for the loan of money. In other words, the Legislature undertakes by a special law to authorize a certain class of corporations to loan money at a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the Constitution and general law of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The Constitution provides that \u201cthe legal rate of interest shall he <em>six per cent, per annum; </em>unless otherwise provided for by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Art. </em>3, <em>sec. </em>57, <em>Consitution of Maryland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">That the Legislature has the power to prescribe a rate of interest for all persons and all corporations either above or below six per cent, is not questioned. That is to pass a general law on the subject, but it has no power to authorize one person to charge six per cent, and another ten per cent, and another twenty-five per cent. The pernicious effects of such special class legislation are so obvious, that in the absence of plain language, showing such to he the intention, we are not to presume that either the framers of the Constitution, or the people who adopted it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>meant to confer a power so extraordinary on the Legislature.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b472-7\">(Decided 27th March, 1878.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The order of the Court helow will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b472-8\">Alvey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">filed the following dissenting opinion, in which Judge Stewart concurred :</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">I do not assent to the opinion of the majority of the Court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">I do not agree that the Legislature transcended its constitutional powers in passing the Act of 1872, ch. 178, and that that Act is consequently void. The Constitution does not declare that the Legislature shall only provide the rate of interest hy a general law- applicable to all contracts and to all parties, without exception, but it has plenary and unrestricted power over the subject. \u201cThe legal rate of interest shall he six per cent, per annum, <em>unless otherwise provided hy the General Assembly.\u201d </em>This provision of the Constitution has been uniformly interpreted hy the Legislature as conferring power, or as not in any manner restricting it in the exercise of the power, to provide for the rate of interest that it may be lawful for parties to contract to pay in a particular class of contracts. And, hence we find on the Statute book several Acts authorizing corporations, engaged in public enterprises, to issue bonds to hear interest at a greater rate than six per cent. ; and I am far from being convinced that the Legislature acted without warrant or authority in passing those Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">I am authorized hy Judge Stewart to say that he agrees with me in the foregoing opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
