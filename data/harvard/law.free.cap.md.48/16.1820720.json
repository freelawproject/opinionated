Shortly thereafter he filed his petition assigning errors which it is not deemed necessary to set out, and praying that a copy of the record in the proceedings might be transmitted to this Court to he examined and reviewed, as upon writ of error.

Gen. Laws, was intended to be visited upon the receiver of any kind of a <em>private </em>bond, private promissory note, &amp;c., or a private bill of exchange \u2014 for by such receiving, the party would only obtain at most a <em>chose in action, </em>unless in the case of a promissory note, or bill of exchange, the same were made payable to bearer. If either of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>were made payable to order, it would not be negotiable except by the endorsement of its payee, or by forging his signature \u2014 and in the latter case, the forger would be guilty of a felony, and would be prosecuted for that offence, rather than for the misdemeanor of r\u00e9ceiving. Looking- at the whole law, and examining the context carefully, it seems to be undeniable, that the receiver must rec\u00e9ive a bond, or note, &amp;c., issued by or under the authority of the State or of the United States, or some one of them \u2014 but the indictment fails to charge the appellant with having received any instrument issued by the authority of either.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">It does not charge the appellant with having received either of the \u201c things \u201d enumerated in the second prohibitory clause, but with having received <em>\u201cfour pieces of printed paper.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-6\">An indictment cannot be sustained for receiving a thing of no intrinsic or artificial value. <em>State vs. Bryant, </em>2 <em>Carolina L.

Ev., (new edition,) </em>969, in which the whole subject is examined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">The statute undertook only^to punish the receiving of any <em>bond </em>issued by, or under some public authority, either of this State, or of the United States, or of some other State. It was therefore incumbent on the pleader to charge that the pieces of paper mentioned in the indictment, were bonds issued in the manner set forth in the law, as \u201cbonds issued by or under the authority of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">But the law does not sanction an indictment for receiving a \u201cpiece of paper.\u201d It enumerates the forbidden things specifically. It is error, therefore, to charge a person with having received <em>anything </em>which the law does not prohibit him from receiving. \u201c <em>A piece of printed paper\u201d </em>is not a bond. The latter is a mixed instrument. It must have a seal, as all public securities have in fact. It must be signed in writing. It js an impression taken from an engraved plate. When the law says one shall not receive a stolen <em>bond </em>of the United States, or issued by their authority, it means that, and if he do receive such a <em>bond, </em>he must be arraigned for doing what the law forbids.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">This offence was created a distinct crime by statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-9\">\u201c It is a well settled general principle of criminal law, that in an indictment for an offence <em>created by statute, </em>the offence must he described in the words of the statute, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>when the words of the statute are descriptive of the offence, it is necessary that the defendant should be brought within all the material words of the statute.\u201d <em>State vs. Elborn, </em>27 <em>Md., </em>488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">The principal rule as to certainty, required in an indictment is this, where the <em>definition </em>of an offence includes generic terms, (as it necessarily must,) either by common law or by statute, it is not sufficient that the indictment should charge the offence in generic terms, but it must state the <em>species </em>\u2014 it must descend to particulars. 1 <em>Archbold\u2019s Cr.

This rule is applicable whether the instrument consists wholly, or in part, of writing, print or figures.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">In the indictment in this case the averment is that the plaintiff in error unlawfully received four pieces of printed paper, commonly called United States five-twenty bonds of the issue of 1865, each of the value of one thousand dollars current money, of the bonds, goods and chattels- of one Ernest Hewrath ; then lately before feloniously stolen, well knowing the said bonds to have been feloniously stolen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">The plaintiff in error insists that there is error in this \u2022indictment, because Art. 30, sec. 163, of the Code, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>not punish the receiving of any piece of printed paper, knowing it to have been stolen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-5\">The objection is not well taken.

C., </em>597. Now the defect which we consider fatal in this indictment, is that it does not charge in distinct and positive terms that the \u201cfour pieces of printed paper \u201d were bonds or certificates of indebtedness issued or \u201c granted by or under the authority of the United States.\u201d That they were so issued can only be made out by inference from the terms \u201c commonly called United States five-twenty bonds of the issue of the year eighteen hundred and sixty-five,\u201d but that is not sufficient. The want of a direct allegation of any thing material in the description of the substance, nature, or manner of the crime, cannot be supplied by intendment, and hence it has always been held, that it is an essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>requisite in every indictment that it should allege all matters material to constitute the particular crime charged, with such positiveness and directness, as not to need the aid of intendment or implication. 2 <em>Hawk. P. C., ch. </em>25, <em>sec. </em>60 ; <em>Deckard vs. The State, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>201. It is also a well settled rule of criminal pleading that in an indictment for an offence created by statute, it is sufficient to describe the offence in the words of the statute, and where the words of the statute are descriptive of the offence, the indictment should follow (in substance at least,) the language of the statute, and expressly charge the described offence on the defendant, or it will he defective; it is necessary that the defendant should he brought within all the material words of the statute and nothing can he taken by intendment. 1 <em>Whart. Amer. Cr. Law, sec. </em>364; 1 <em>Bishop\u2019s Cr. Procedure, sec. </em>360; <em>State vs. Elborn., </em>27 <em>Md., </em>488. Authorities in support of these propositions are too numerous to he cited. We content ourselves with a reference simply to the case of <em>Rex vs. Craven, </em>cited in 2 <em>East\u2019s P. C., </em>601, and reported in 1 <em>Russ. and Ryan, </em>14. That case was relied on in <em>State vs. Price, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>264, to support the objection to the indictment there taken. The objection was not sustained, hut in overruling it the Court said, that in <em>Rex vs. Craven </em>\u201cthe felony created by the statute, was the stealing of a bank-note, or promissory note for the payment of money. The charge in the indictment was the stealing of \u2018a certain note commonly called a bank-note.\u2019 And the Court say \u2018that in the first special description of the property stolen, it being stated only to he a note, was not sufficient, the words of the Act being bank-note or promissory note for the payment of money. And that the addition \u2018 commonly called a bank-note,\u2019 \u2018 did not aid such original wrong description.\u2019 In the case at bar there was no original wrong description which required aid from the words that were added. On the contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the indictment described with technical accuracy in the very language of the Act of Assembly, the offence committed, and such description was neither aided nor impaired by,the additional words unnecessarily used.\u201d But what was thus said in <em>Craven\u2019s Case </em>is exactly applicable to the indictment now before us. The special description of the things received is, \u201cfour pieces of printed paper.\u201d This does not conform to any thing contained in that portion of the statute we have quoted. It is altogether defective in this respect, and is not aided by the addition, \u201c commonly called United States five-twenty .bonds.\u201d In short the statute creates and punishes with great severity the receiving, knowing them to be stolen, certain instruments importing on tbeir face obligations or promises for the payment of money, and among them it specifies and describes such obligations or certificates \u201c granted by or under the authority of the United States.\u201d When the purpose is to charge a party with the offence of thus receiving such instruments, the indictment must charge directly and positively, and not by implication or intendment, that they were so granted or issued. That is not done in the present indictment and it is therefore substantially defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">. This defect being in matter of substance and not of form, and the objection being raised by demurrer, it is plain the case is not affected by any thing contained in section 82 of the same Article of the Code. Nor is it cured by the Act of 1862, ch. 80. That statute dispenses with the necessity of setting out a <em>copy </em>or <em>fac simile </em>of the whole or any part of any printed or written instrument which it becomes necessary to make an averment respecting in an indictment, and allows it to be described by any name or designation by which it may be usually known, pr by its purport. But we are of opinion it was not the design and purpose of this Act to abrogate the well settled rule of pleading in criminal cases which we have already stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>But it has been argued that the words \u201ccommonly called United States five-twenty bonds of the issue of the year eighteen hundred and sixty-five,\u201d maybe rejected as surplusage, so as to make the indictment charge simply the receiving of \u201cfour pieces of printed paper, each of the value of one thousand dollars current money,\u201d and that this would he good as an indictment for receiving stolen <em>goods and chattels </em>under the first part of the section referred to, which prohibits and punishes \u201c the crime of receiving any stolen money, goods or chattels knowing the same to he stolen.\u201d If this could be done, it is clear it would make the indictment a totally different one from what the pleader obviously intended when he framed it. It was said in support of this position, that the Court has no judicial knowledge that there is no \u201c piece of <em>printed </em>paper\u201d of the value of one thousand dollars. This may he true, hut it would he a different and more difficult matter to say the Court has not judicial knowledge, that no <em>piece </em>of paper, <em>as a chattel, </em>and apart from what it becomes or is made to import by the <em>printing </em>upon it, is of that value. It has been sometimes the practice, under statutes similar to this section of our Code, to introduce into the indictments <em>separate counts, </em>charging the larceny or receiving of \u201c one piece of paper of the value of one penny,\u201d and in several cases which have been cited by counsel for the State, such counts have been held sufficient to support a conviction. This practice vras adopted in order to obviate the difficulty in setting out doubtful instruments, or to meet a failure of proof as to instruments duly charged in other counts. If there had been such separate count in the present indictment, it might, under these authorities, have been sustained. But the question here is not whether such a count would have been good standing by itself, hut whether it is allowable for the Court so to deal with the only count in this indictment as to make it a valid charge for receiving \u201cfour pieces of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>paper,\u201d knowing them to have been stolen. In our judgment this cannot be done, and we have not been referred to any authority nor have we found any that would justify it. In England the law seems to be settled that where <em>dioses in action </em>are valid, the \u201cpieces of paper\u201d on which they are written are absorbed in them, and the indictment must be exclusively for stealing the <em>dioses in action, </em>and they cannot be properly described in the indictment as goods and chattels. <em>Regina vs Powell, </em>2 <em>Denn. C. C., </em>403. Here, as we have said, the plain intent was to charge the plaintiff in error with receiving four existing and valid bonds or certificates of indebtedness granted by or under the authority of the United States, knowing them to have been stolen, and it must stand or fall as it is valid or defective for that purpose. We cannot under the license of striking out surplusage, make it an indictment for receiving stolen goods and chattels. <em>Regina vs. Larkin, </em>26 <em>Eng. Law &amp; Eq. Rep., </em>572.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b39-7\">(Decided 20th December, 1877.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The demurrer must therefore be sustained and the judgment reversed. But this reversal does not relieve the party from further liability.
