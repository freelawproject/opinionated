To support this count in the declaration, the plaintiffs offered in evidence a by-law of the Association, which provided that \u201ceach member shall pay an entrance fee of fifty cents per share, on each share of stock he subscribes for, and a weekly instalment of one dollar per share.\u201d The defendant contended that the by-law relied on by the plaintiffs was never ratified or confirmed, at a general meeting of the'Association duly called for that purpose. It appeared that the by-laws were drawn up by a committee appointed by the subscribers to the stock of the proposed Association before its incorporation; that these by-laws were adopted at a meeting of said subscribers, held 16th of March, 1869, and were printed; that the certificate of incorporation was duly acknowledged and recorded on the 6th of April following; that from the time of its incorporation to the time when the plaintiffs were appointed receivers, a period of over five years, the Association was actively engaged in the prosecution of its business, making contracts for land, and leasing, and otherwise disposing of the same; that during all this time it acted under these, and in fact had no other by-laws; that in September, <em>'iSH, </em>amendments making important changes in the laws of the corporation were proposed, and afterwards adopted by the directors, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>these amendments were submitted to the stockholders at a general meeting, and were by them ratified and approved. It also appeared that the name of the defendant was entered by the secretary of the Association in the stock-ledger for five shares of stock upon which the defendant paid the weekly instalments of one dollar per share, and also the entrance fee of fifty cents per share. That at the time of such payment, a book containing the by-laws was delivered to the defendant, which being lost, another was substituted in its place, and this one being produced at the trial contained the receipts for the weekly instalments paid by the defendant, and that in 1874, the defendant subscribed his name to the by-laws after being told they were the bylaws of the corporation. It also appeared that from the time of his subscription up to the time the plaintiffs were appointed receivers, he not only paid the weekly instalments due on his subscription, but also shared the profits earned by the Association.

By a subsequent order of that Court, the receivers were directed to institute such suits as they might be advised, to recover from the stockholders of said association all instalments of the capital stock then owing.

It also appears, from the time of his subscription up to the time when the appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>were appointed receivers, he not only paid the weekly instalments due on his subscription, but also shared the profits earned by the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Under such facts as these, the question is not whether the by-laws were adopted in strict conformity with sec. 50, of the Act of 1868, but whether in a suit by the appellants as receivers, representing the Association and its creditors, to recover the balance due on his subscription, the appellee can rely on such a defence. And we think it is clear both on principle and on authority that he cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">He has in every mode and manner recognized and admitted the validity of the by-laws under which the Association acted ; and when upon the faith of such admissions, others have been induced to act, the plainest principles of justice demand that he at least shall not be permitted to question the mode by which they were adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Nor is the second ground of defence relied on in this suit, more tenable. We have said, it is true, that in corporations of this kind, where the amount of the capital stock is fixed, and the number of shares ascertained by the charter, a subscriber is not obliged to pay his subscription unless the whole capital stock has been taken. And for the obvious reason, that it is to be presumed the entire amount thus fixed by the charter is necessary for the successful prosecution of the business for which the company is incorporated, and subscriptions are made upon this implied understanding. And this well settled rule applies to subscriptions before and after the company is chartered.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">But we have also said, that this is a condition which a subscriber may waive, and that the waiver may be either express or implied. Thus for instance, where one knowing the whole stock has not been taken, attends the meetings of the company, votes for the expenditure of money, and the purchase of .property, or does other acts from which it may be fairly inferred that he intends to waive the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>to insist upon the whole capital stock being taken, he will be estopped from setting up such a defence. <em>Hager vs. Cleaveland &amp; Bassett, </em>36 <em>Md., </em>491.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Here is a case in which the appellee knew at the time he subscribed for the stock, that the Association was engaged in the prosecution of the business for which it was organized, buying property, and incurring debts and liabilities, and with this knowledge he pays for a period of nearly five years, the weekly instalments on his subscription, and during all this time as a member of the Association, he receives his proportion of the profits earned ; and now when the corporation becomes embarrassed or proves perhaps a failure, he seeks to avoid the payment of his subscription, on the ground that the whole capital stock had not been taken, and this too, in a suit brought by receivers representing the creditors of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The defence thus relied on, was intended to protect subscribers who in good faith objected to the organization of a company when its capital stock which was necessary to the enterprise, had not in fact been taken, but it was never intended and Courts-will never permit it to be used as an instrument of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The Court erred therefore in granting defendant\u2019s eleventh prayer and refusing to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 second, fourth and fifth prayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">The notice prescribed by sec. 65 of the Act of 1868, ch. 471, in reference to assessments or calls on subscriptions, does not apply in this cause, because the by-laws under which the corporation acted, provided that the subscribers should pay a weekly instalment of one dollar on each share.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The question presented by the first bill of exceptions is whether the book containing the proceedings of meetings of members of the proposed Association, prior to its incorporation, was admissible in evidence. The liability of the appellee on his subscription in no manner depended on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>nor was it in any way affected by these preliminary proceedings, and the evidence was therefore wholly irrelevant and properly rejected. From what we have said it follows that the judgment below must be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b486-7\">(Decided 27th March, 1878.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><em>Judgment </em>reversed, <em>and neto trial awarded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
