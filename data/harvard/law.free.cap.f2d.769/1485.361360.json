After reviewing the record, we agree with the defendant that Mrs. Starr\u2019s estimation of the value of the business in January, 1980, was based in part on the value of the property and improvements covered under the insurance policy. The special compensatory damages award is accordingly reduced to $125,000 to reflect the plaintiffs\u2019 recovery on the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1549-20\">Except as noted above, the Petition for Rehearing addressed to the panel is denied. No member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Eleventh Circuit Rule 26), the Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
