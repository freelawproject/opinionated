Acosta\u2019s sole ground on appeal is his claim that the trial court erred in excluding from evidence a transcript of previous testimony by an allegedly \u201cunavailable\u201d witness. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion; therefore we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Acosta and three others were arrested by customs officers early in the morning in a house containing a large amount of marijuana. At trial, Acosta explained his presence as the result of having been a guest who, with his wife, had been invited to the house by a business acquaintance to attend a party the night before. According to Acosta, shortly after their arrival, he and his wife had had an argument and she had departed in their automobile. He then consumed a large quantity of alcohol and fell asleep, to be awakened by the arrival of the officers. As corroborating evidence of Acosta\u2019s alibi, the defense sought to introduce the testimony Mrs. Acosta had given at the pre-trial suppression hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defense stated that Mrs. Acosta was presently unavailable as a witness due to her child\u2019s illness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court refused to admit the evidence. Acosta was convicted by a jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b786-17\">On appeal, Acosta claims that the prior testimony should have been admitted pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-18\">Rule 804 of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides an exception to the rule against hearsay in certain situations where the potential witness is unavailable. As we explained in <em>United States v. King, </em>713 F.2d 627 (11th Cir.1983), \u201cRule 804 establishes a two-step inquiry. First, a witness must be \u2018unavailable\u2019 as that term is defined in section 804(a)____ Second, the testimony of the unavailable witness must fall within one of the categories of admissible evidence enumerated in section 804(b).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Determinations of the admissibility of evidence are in the discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed by an appellate court unless it finds an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>703 F.2d 1243 (11th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the determination as to the \u201cunavailability\u201d of a witness whose prior testimony is sought to be introduced into evidence is also the responsibility of the trial judge, <em>Howard v. Sigler, </em>454 F.2d 115 (8th Cir.1972), subject to the same standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The question confronting the court below was two-fold: (1) whether Mrs. Acosta was \u201cunavailable\u201d as contemplated by 804(a) and, (2) if so, whether her testimony was admissible as defined in 804(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The burden of proving the unavailability of a witness under Rule 804(a) rests with the proponent of the hearsay evidence, in this case, the appellant. <em>United States v. Amaya, </em>533 F.2d 188 (5th Cir.1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1101, 97 S.Ct. 1125, 51 L.Ed.2d 551 (1977),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Fernandez-Roque, 703 </em>F.2d 808 (5th Cir.1983); <em>United States v. Pelton, </em>578 F.2d 701 (8th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 964, 99 S.Ct. 451, 58 L.Ed.2d 422 (1978). We conclude that here the appellant failed to carry this burden. He offered no evidence that he had requested the witness to testify or that she had refused to do so. Nor was there medical testimony as to the nature or severity of the child\u2019s illness or that the child\u2019s health would be jeopardized by the mother\u2019s absence. Moreover, there was no pre-trial motion for a continuance in order to produce the witness at a later trial. <em>Peterson v. United States, </em>344 F.2d 419 (5th Cir. 1965) (temporary illness or disability of a witness is not sufficient to justify admission of prior testimony without a showing that a continuance would not resolve the problem). The sole support for Acosta\u2019s claim was his counsel\u2019s uncorroborated statement that Mrs. Acosta was unavailable due to her child\u2019s illness. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this statement, in and of itself, was not sufficient to satisfy the proponent\u2019s burden of demonstrating that the witness was unavailable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Having determined that appellant failed to satisfy the first prong of Rule 804, unavailability of the witness, we need not address the second prong, whether the government had a sufficient opportunity for cross-examination so as to make the prior testimony admissible pursuant to 804(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the prior testimony of Mrs. Acosta. The conviction, therefore, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">We note that Acosta\u2019s indictment charged him with conspiring to distribute marijuana, and possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute. The judgment and commitment order, however, erroneously stated that he had been convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. This case, therefore, is remanded for correction of the judgment and commitment order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\">. Acosta\u2019s motion to suppress a statement made to the customs officer was granted by the trial judge. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for trial. <em>U.S. v. Castro, </em>723 F.2d 1527 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\">. In support of his assertion that the witness was unavailable, Acosta\u2019s counsel stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-11\">She\u2019s got a baby and when the baby was born, it had an operation and the baby is not well and I don\u2019t think that Mr. Acosta and Mrs. Acosta are getting along too well. And I think the rules provide for nonavailability of the witness, that prior testimony, judicial testimony can be utilized.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b786-12\">. Fed.R.Evid. 804(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-13\">(a) Definition of unavailability. \"Unavailability as a witness\u201d includes situations in which the declarant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-14\">(1) is exempted by ruling of the court on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the subject matter of his statement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-15\">(2) persists in refusing to testify concerning the subject matter of his statement despite an order of the court to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-20\">(3) testifies to a lack of memory of the subject matter of his statement; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An5\">(4) is unable to be present or to testify at the hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or infirmity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZb\">(5) is absent from the hearing and the proponent of his statement has been unable to procure his attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under subdivision (b)(2),</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqZF\">(3), or (4), his attendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means. A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if his exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence is due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of his statement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASgt\">The former testimony exception in Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIS\">Former testimony.

In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b787-15\">. We need not consider whether the illness of a child could ever make a witness \"unavailable\u201d under the definition set forth in rule 804(a). Rule 804(a) states that unavailability \u201cincludes\u201d five different situations. The illness of a child fits within none of the five defined situations. Because Acosta has failed to meet his burden of proof we need not consider whether the five situations \u201cincluded\u201d in rule 804(a) are exclusive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
