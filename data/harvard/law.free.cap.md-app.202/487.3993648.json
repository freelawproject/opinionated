When they arrived at the campsite, at approximately 11:00 p.m., it was raining. The girls stayed in the car, and Andrew and Josh started setting up the tent. While Andrew and Josh were setting up the tent, three men, appellant, Nicholas Cann, and Zachary Lee, entered their campsite. Andrew testified that he \u201cthought there would be trouble\u201d because the men were holding machetes and a baseball bat. The encounter remained friendly, however, and the men invited Andrew and Josh to their campsite to drink with them. Andrew and Josh appeared receptive to the offer because the men had machetes, and they did not want to make the men mad. Appellant, Mr. Cann, and Mr. Lee left, and Andrew and Josh finished setting up the tent. Lauren and Jessica then joined them in the tent.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes later, the three men returned to the teenagers\u2019 campsite. The men put more wood on the fire and began swinging the machetes against the sides of the tent. They told the teenagers to \u201c[g]et the fuck out of the tent and give us everything you have.\u201d Andrew and Josh exited the tent. Jessica and Lauren stayed inside the tent, and Jessica dialed 911. When the boys exited the tent, appellant held a machete to the boys\u2019 ankles. The other two men were holding a baseball bat and a machete. Mr. Cann reached into the tent, held a machete to Jessica\u2019s throat, and pulled her out of the tent. Mr. Cann ordered Lauren out of the tent. Appellant told the teenagers to put their cell phones in a pile and to give them any money that they had. Andrew had $100 with him and $100 in the center console of his car. The men took Andrew\u2019s license, and they told the teenagers that, if they involved the police, the men would come find them and kill them.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Andrew testified that the men \u201cgot rowdy, and started yelling at each other and wanted more\u201d money. Andrew wanted to \u201cget back to civilization [and] out of the woods,\u201d so he suggested that they go to an ATM to get more money. The three men discussed the idea, and they ultimately agreed that Mr. Cann would go with all of the teenagers to the ATM.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Andrew then drove his ear out of the woods, with Mr. Cann in the passenger seat and the three other teenagers in the back seat. Mr. Cann told them that he had a gun, and he kept his hand under his shirt on the waistband. As they were driving, police cars passed them. Andrew pulled the car to the side of the road and turned it off. As vehicles passed the car, Andrew flashed his high beams repeatedly. An officer approached the car, and Andrew mouthed the word \u201chelp.\u201d Andrew got out of the car and ran toward the officer shouting that Mr. Cann had a gun. The other teenagers got out of the car, and the police took Mr. Cann into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">As the police were speaking with the teenagers, appellant approached from the woods. The two females screamed, and the officers arrested appellant. Mr. Lee was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>found kneeling next to a tree. Close to where Mr. Lee had been hiding, officers recovered a driver\u2019s license belonging to Andrew, a machete, a machete holder, a belt, a flashlight and an empty case that could hold a machete. A second machete was recovered at the teenagers\u2019 campsite, and a baseball bat was recovered from the men\u2019s campsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">After appellant\u2019s arrest, he was interviewed by police. At trial, the State introduced into evidence a recording of the interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Appellant initially told police that he did not have any knowledge of what happened, and he denied going to any campsite other than his own. Eventually, after the police told him that the victims had described him, including a tattoo on his arm, he admitted that he did go to the teenagers\u2019 campsite. He maintained, however, that he did not do anything wrong. Appellant suggested that the other two men may have had a plan, stating that they were winking at each other and looking at each other \u201ca little funny,\u201d in a way that his \u201cgut [told him] was bad.\u201d He denied, however, that he was in on any plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Ultimately, appellant admitted that he was there when Mr. Cann dragged a \u201cstick\u201d along the side of the tent and that he discussed whether to go to the bank to get money. He said that he told the other men that it was not a good idea to get in the car and go to the bank. Appellant indicated, however, that Mr. Cann was \u201cthe mouth,\u201d the ringleader.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As indicated, the jury found appellant guilty of four counts of attempted armed robbery, four counts of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, four counts of second degree assault, four counts of reckless endangerment, and four counts of false imprisonment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Appellant\u2019s first contention involves the court\u2019s instructions regarding the State\u2019s burden to prove his guilt beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>reasonable doubt. He argues that the court erred \u201cby refusing to instruct the jury that the State had the burden of proving each element of every charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The State asserts that the court\u2019s instructions were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction (\u201cMPJICR\u201d) 2:02, addressing the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt, provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">The defendant is presumed to be innocent of the charges. This presumption remains with the defendant throughout every stage of the trial and is not overcome unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">The State has the burden of proving the guilt of the defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden remains on the State throughout the trial. The defendant is not required to prove [his] [her] innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Appellant requested that the court modify the pattern instruction to add that the State had the burden to prove each element of a charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, he asked that the pattern instructions for each substantive offense be modified to add, after the listing of elements, the following: \u201cIn order for the person to be convicted, the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of these [number of] elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The State objected to the modifications, arguing that \u201cit\u2019s not in the Pattern anywhere and its sufficiently covered\u201d by the instructions as a whole. The prosecutor asserted that it would be \u201can unfair focus to put on each of the charge[s], the beyond the reasonable doubt standard,\u201d and that if the court did so, then \u201cto be fair Your Honor should include the whole reasonable doubt instruction ... where it\u2019s mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">The court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The reasonable doubt, in some of the Patterns, although not in any of the ones here, they add each element beyond a reasonable doubt as the nature of the instruction. But there is a separate instruction and quite frankly I instructed the jury at the ... initiation of this case as to ... presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s necessary that that be repeated for each ... offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Ultimately, the court instructed the jury pursuant to MPJICR 2:02, modifying the instruction by adding that the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty \u201cof each charge.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">Mr. Carroll is presumed to be innocent of the charges. This presumption remains on Mr. Carroll throughout every stage of the trial and is not overcome unless you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant is guilty of each charge. The State has the burden of proving the guilt of the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden remains on the State throughout the trial. The Defendant is not required to prove his innocence. However the State is not required to prove guilt beyond all possible doubt or to a mathematical certainty. Nor is the State required to negate every conceivable circumstance of innocence. A reasonable doubt is a doubt founded upon reason. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires such proof as would convince you of the truth of a fact to the extent that you would be willing to act upon such belief without reservation in an important matter in your own business or personal affairs. However if you are not satisfied of the Defendant\u2019s guilt to that extent than [sic] reasonable doubts exists [sic] and your verdict must be not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The court then instructed the jury as to each of the charged offenses. In doing so, the court stated, for each charge, with the exception of conspiracy, as follows: \u201cIn order to convict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the Defendant of [name of offense] the State must prove.... \u201d The court then listed each element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">For example, when instructing the jury on robbery, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Robbery is the taking and carrying away the property from someone by force or threat of force with the intent to deprive the victim of the property. In order to convict the Defendant of robbery the State must prove that the Defendant took the property from [the victim] and from his presence and control, that he took the property by force or threat of force, and that he intended to deprive the victim of that property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">With respect to conspiracy, the court did not give the pattern instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">[A] conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. And a conspiracy is in itself a separate crime. It exists when two or more persons enter into an agreement to accomplish a criminal or unlawful purpose. In order for a person to be guilty of this offense the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant or one or more other persons entered into an agreement, that the object of the agreement was criminal or unlawful, and that there was a joint intent to enter into this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Explicit Instruction on Burden to Prove Every Element Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Appellant contends that the court\u2019s instructions, apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the instructions on the conspiracy charges, were erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues that, although the court instructed the jury that the State had the burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and it instructed pursuant to MPJI-CR 2:02, as required by <em>Ruffin v. State, </em>394 Md. 355, 357, 373, 906 A.2d 360 (2006), \u201cthe Constitution and Maryland law require more,\u201d specifically an instruction that each element of every charged offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant asserts that Due Process requires such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The State contends that the court did not \u201cerr when it instructed the jury pursuant to the pattern instruction on reasonable doubt rather than adopting the non-pattern instruction proposed by [appellant].\u201d It argues that \u201c[t]he reasonable doubt instruction, considered in conjunction with the instructions given to the jury as to each criminal offense, sufficiently instructed the jury that they must find each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The State asserts that the court was not required to give appellant\u2019s requested instruction because the matter was fairly covered by the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Maryland Rule 4-325(c) provides that, at the request of any party, the court \u201cshall\u201d instruct the jury regarding the applicable law. Pursuant to this rule, however, \u201c[t]he court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s refusal to give a requested instruction, an appellate court looks to three factors. We must determine whether the requested instruction: (1) constitutes a correct statement of the law; (2) is applicable under the facts of the case; and (3) has been fairly covered by the instructions given. <em>Cost v. State, </em>417 Md. 360, 368-69, 10 A.3d 184 (2010); <em>Evans v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 549, 567, 922 A.2d 620, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 Md. 648, 929 A.2d 890 (2007). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>we review a trial court\u2019s decision not to give a proposed jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standard, the court\u2019s decision will be reversed if the defendant\u2019s rights were not adequately protected. <em>Cost, </em>417 Md. at 369, 10 A.3d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Both parties agree that the requested instruction was a correct statement of the law. It is well established that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of a charged offense. <em>See Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 277-78, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993) (\u201cThe prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the offense charged, and must persuade the factfinder \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Savoy v. State, </em>420 Md. 232, 246, 22 A.3d 845 (2011) (\u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the State to prove every element of an offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Similarly, there is no dispute that the beyond a reasonable doubt standard was applicable here, as it is in every criminal trial. As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Ruffin, </em>394 Md. at 372, 906 A.2d 360, \u201cthe presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt principles do not change from case to case. The identical principles are applicable in every criminal jury trial, regardless of the issues in that particular trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that no \u201cparticular form of words\u201d must be used in advising the jury regarding the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Victor v. Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 5, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994). The issue in this case, therefore, is whether appellant\u2019s requested instruction was fairly covered by the instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The court\u2019s instruction on the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he State has the burden of proving the guilt of the Defendant beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The instruction on the specific charges then stated: \u201cIn order to convict the defendant of_, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>State must prove ...,\u201d followed by a list of the elements of each offense. Read together, the instructions advised the jury that the State must prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Other courts similarly have upheld instructions that did not contain the explicit advice requested here. <em>See People v. Orchard, </em>17 Cal.App.3d 568, 95 Cal.Rptr. 66, 71 (1971) (instruction regarding State\u2019s burden to prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt was not required where the court instructed on the State\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and then defined the essential elements of the crime charged); <em>City of Billings v. Briner, </em>228 Mont. 518, 744 P.2d 877, 878 (1987) (where the court instructed that the government had the burden to prove defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and then instructed as to the elements of the crime, no error in failing to specifically instruct that the prosecutor must prove each and every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Moreover, we note that appellant is asking us to hold that MPJI-CR 2:02 does not meet constitutional requirements. In <em>Ruffin, </em>however, the Court of Appeals not only approved of this pattern instruction, it held that, \u201cin every criminal jury trial, the trial court is required to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence and the reasonable doubt standard of proof which closely adheres to MPJI-CR 2:02. Deviations in substance will not be tolerated.\u201d 394 Md. at 373, 906 A.2d 360. <em>Accord Merzbacher v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 404, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) (\u201c[W]e strongly recommend that trial courts closely adhere to the reasonable doubt instruction ... articulated in [MPJIJ-CR 2:02.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">In light of the Court of Appeals\u2019 admonition to trial courts to instruct on reasonable doubt in accordance with MPJI-CR 2:02, and because the instructions as a whole made clear that the State had the burden of proving each element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in declining to give appellant\u2019s requested instruction. We hold that the failure to instruct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>jury explicitly that the State\u2019s burden of proof applies to each element of each offense is not error, as long as this burden of proof is clear from the instructions as a whole. Appellant is not entitled to a new trial on this ground.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Appellant next contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his four convictions for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. He argues that \u201cthe State presented absolutely no direct evidence that could support a finding that he entered into an agreement to commit an armed robbery,\u201d and that the circumstantial evidence presented by the State \u201cbelies any suggestion that the three had a pre-existing agreement to commit armed robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The State contends that there was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions. It argues that appellant and the other men \u201cacted in concert,\u201d and a conspiracy to rob can be implied from their actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In reviewing a claim regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine \u201c \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number><em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 184, 999 A.2d 986 (2010) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). In reviewing the evidence, \u201c \u2018[i]t is not our role to retry the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mayers, </em>417 Md. 449, 466, 10 A.3d 782 (2010) (quoting <em>Smith, </em>415 Md. at 185, 999 A.2d 986). <em>Accord State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336 (1994) (\u201c[I]t is not the function or duty of the appellate court to undertake a review of the record that would amount to, in essence, a retrial of the case.\u201d). Rather, \u201c \u2018[bjecause the fact-finder possesses the unique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony, we do not re-weigh the credibility of witnesses or attempt to resolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayers, </em>417 Md. at 466, 10 A.3d 782 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>415 Md. at 185, 999 A.2d 986). \u201cWe defer to any possible reasonable inferences the jury could have drawn from the admitted evidence and need not decide whether the jury could have drawn other inferences from the evidence, refused to draw inferences, or whether we would have drawn different inferences from the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The Court of Appeals has summarized the elements of a conspiracy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">A criminal conspiracy consists of the combination of two or more persons to accomplish some unlawful purpose, or to accomplish a lawful purpose by unlawful means. The essence of a criminal conspiracy is an unlawful agreement. The agreement need not be formal or spoken, provided there is a meeting of the minds reflecting a unity of purpose and design. In Maryland, the crime is complete when the unlawful agreement is reached, and no overt act in furtherance of the agreement need be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\"><em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 436, 855 A.2d 1175 (2004) (quoting <em>Townes v. State, </em>314 Md. 71, 75, 548 A.2d 832 (1988)). \u201c \u2018[I]t is sufficient if the parties tacitly come to an understanding regarding the unlawful purpose.... [T]he State [is] only required to present facts that would allow the jury to infer that the parties entered into an unlawful agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Arm-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>stead v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 599, <em>646, 7 </em>A.3d 169 (2010) (quoting <em>Acquah v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 29, 50, 686 A.2d 690 (1996)), <em>cert. denied, </em>418 Md. 191, 13 A.3d 798 (2011). A conspiracy may be shown by \u201c \u2018circumstantial evidence from which an inference of common design may be drawn.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McMillian v. State, </em>325 Md. 272, 292, 600 A.2d 430 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Here, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that appellant engaged in a conspiracy to rob the victims. Appellant went to the victims\u2019 campsite, carrying a machete, with the other two men who were carrying a machete and a bat. The victims interpreted the visit as indicating that \u201cthere would be trouble.\u201d The men left and then returned to the campsite, together, approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, still brandishing the weapons. The men immediately told the teenagers to \u201cget the fuck out of the tent and give us everything you have.\u201d Appellant then held his machete to the ankles of the two boys as they exited the tent, which was interpreted by the boys as a way to stop them from running.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">These actions show that the men were acting in concert. Indeed, during the encounter, appellant, Mr. Cann, and Mr. Lee discussed together whether to take the victims to the ATM, illustrating that the men were acting in agreement and pursuant to a collective decision. Moreover, the victims testified that appellant appeared to be the man in charge of the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">This evidence was sufficient for the jury to reject appellant\u2019s statement to the police that he was a passive bystander and to imply from appellant\u2019s actions a conspiracy with the other men to rob. There was sufficient evidence to support appellant\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to commit armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">III. Post-Arrest Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Appellant next argues that the court erred in admitting a recording of his interview with the police after he was arrested. He contends that his post-arrest interrogation violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), because the police continued to question him after he \u201cunambiguously invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The State contends that this issue is not properly before this Court for review. It argues that, \u201cnot only did [appellant] fail to preserve his <em>Miranda </em>challenge, but he affirmatively waived that challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-131(a), an appellate court ordinarily will not decide an issue \u201cunless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court.\u201d This rule \u201cserves to prevent the unfairness that could arise when a party raises an issue for the first time on appeal, thus depriving the opposing party from admitting evidence relating to that issue at trial.\u201d <em>Wilkerson v. State, </em>420 Md. 573, 597, 24 A.3d 703 (2011). <em>Accord Robinson v. State, </em>410 Md. 91, 103, 976 A.2d 1072 (2009) (\u201cFairness and the orderly administration of justice is advanced \u2018by \u201crequiring counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct[,] any errors in the proceedings.\u201d \u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Here, counsel for appellant initially filed a motion to suppress his statements to the police. At the beginning of trial, however, appellant\u2019s counsel withdrew the motion. In this regard, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: ... I will note that there is a statement given, an extensive statement that was given, however I have viewed that statement ... it was videotaped and recorded so I viewed that, and other than a headlamp, um, that fits on the head, uh, I don\u2019t know that there was anything else taken from my client. And based on my view of the videotape, Your Honor, there\u2019s certainly, he gave the statement, there\u2019s certainly nothing there that I think in, in my opinion was improper, uh, worthy of a motion. So I would withdraw.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>THE COURT: Formally note the motion to suppress is withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">At trial, defense counsel objected to the admission of the first part of the statement on the ground that it was not relevant. He argued that the only purpose in introducing that part of the statement, in which appellant denied that he was present at the victims\u2019 campsite, was to show that appellant was a liar, which counsel asserted was not appropriate because appellant was not going to testify. In response, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">Defendant\u2019s statement surrounding the accusations at issue is relevant and is admissible so long as it is not involuntary under the Fifth Amendment or is taken in violation of the Defendant\u2019s rights under Miranda____What has been pre-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">sented to me is the Defendant made a statement that evening surrounding the accusations and that that statement in its entirety, including changes in his story, would be relevant on numerous issues and that the only justification for excluding the statement of the Defendant would be if, again if it was involuntary in the constitutional sense, or it was taken in violation of Miranda. Neither of those matters has been raised and quite honestly we did not have a suppression hearing, the Court has not reviewed the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Appellant acknowledges that his claim that his statements should have been suppressed pursuant to <em>Miranda </em>is not preserved, noting that \u201ctrial counsel withdrew a motion to exclude the recording prior to trial.\u201d He argues, however, that \u201cthis Court should review the admission of this evidence for plain error.\u201d In support, appellant argues that the admission of his statement was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d because it \u201cundermined his strategic decision\u2014and his constitutional right\u2014not to testify at trial.\u201d He further argues that plain error review is warranted \u201cto clarify the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>[Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010) ] on interrogations by Maryland law enforcement officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The State contends that plain error review is not available to appellant because he affirmatively waived his <em>Miranda </em>challenge. It argues that \u201ccounsel made the intentional decision not to raise any constitutional challenges to the statement,\u201d which affirmatively waived the right to have the issue considered on appeal. The State further argues that, given the lack of a suppression hearing, \u201cthis Court simply cannot conduct the review requested by [appellant] because the record is incomplete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Both parties refer to cases addressing plain error review in the context of jury instructions. In that context, and in the context of other trial errors, the Court of Appeals has discussed the interplay between waiver and plain error review, and it has made clear that issues that a party has affirmatively waived are not subject to plain error review. <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 578-80, 3 A.3d 1210 (2010). The Court explained the difference between forfeiture, which is \u201cthe failure to make a timely assertion of a right,\u201d and waiver, which is the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 3 A.3d 1210 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). It held that \u201c \u2018[forfeited rights are reviewable for plain error, while waived rights are not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840, 845 (9th Cir.1997)) (emphasis omitted).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In the present case, the claim of error does not involve a jury instruction or other trial errors. Rather, the claim involves an argument that an alleged unlawfully obtained statement should have been suppressed, an issue that is required to be raised pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 4-252(a), a claim regarding \u201c[a]n unlawfully obtained admission, statement, or confession,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u201cshall be raised by motion\u201d prior to trial, and if not so raised, it is waived, absent a showing of good cause.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court has explained that a failure to raise a suppression issue below constitutes a waiver in several contexts: (1) if the defendant fails to comply with the time requirements for filing a motion under the rule; (2) if the defendant files a notice but fails to pursue it; and (3) if there is a hearing on the motion, but the defendant fails to present any grounds to support the motion. <em>Jackson v. State, 52 </em>Md.App. 327, 331-32, 449 A.2d 438, <em>cert. denied, </em>294 Md. 652 (1982). <em>Accord Perry v. State, </em>344 Md. 204, 227, 686 A.2d 274 (1996) (defendant waived suppression issue by failing to raise it prior to trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1146, 117 S.Ct 1318, 137 L.Ed.2d 480 (1997). Neither party cites a case addressing whether plain error review applies in the context of the failure to raise a suppression issue subject to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In <em>Kohr v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 92, 98, 388 A.2d 1242, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 735 (1978), this Court stated that the Court of Appeals decided, \u201cas a matter of judicial policy,\u201d to make Rule 736, the predecessor to Rule 4-252, parallel to Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (\u201cFed. R.CrimP.\u201d). We stated: \u201cBoth rules are identical in that they require that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>motions to suppress be filed pre-trial and both consider a failure to raise timely objections to the admissibility of unlawfully seized evidence to constitute a waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Because the Maryland rule is parallel to the federal rule, we look to federal decisions addressing the effect of a failure to raise a suppression issue pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 12. Several courts have analyzed in detail whether such a failure constitutes: (1) a forfeiture subject to plain error review; or (2) a waiver that cannot be reviewed absent good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In <em>United States v. Rose, </em>538 F.3d 175, 177-84 (3d Cir.2008), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated that \u201c \u2018the prevailing rule is that the failure to assert a particular ground [for suppression] operates as a waiver of the right to challenge the admissibility of the evidence on that ground.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180 (quoting 6 Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 11.2(a) (4th ed. 2004)). The court noted, however, that \u201ccourts have not always applied this rule consistently.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In <em>Rose, </em>the Court held that, pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 12, \u201ca suppression argument raised for the first time on appeal is waived <em>(ie., </em>completely barred) absent good cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182. The Court explained that its holding applied \u201cnot only where the defendant failed to file a suppression motion at all in the district court, but also where he filed one but did not include the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The court explained that the specific waiver provision of Fed.R.CrimP. 12 prevailed over the general provision of Fed. R.CrimP. 52(b) providing for plain error review. <em>Id. </em>at 183.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It noted that Fed.R.CrimP. 12(e) \u201csingles out motions to suppress, stating that a \u2018party <em>waives </em>any [suppression] defense, objection, or request not raised by the [pretrial] deadline the court sets,\u2019 \u201d and it cited to the \u201c \u2018well-settled maxim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that specific statutory provisions prevail over more general provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chavarria v. Gonzalez, </em>446 F.3d 508, 517 (3d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Other courts similarly have rejected plain error review of a suppression issue that was not raised below, holding that the failure to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 12 constitutes a waiver of the issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Burke, </em>633 F.3d 984, 991 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2130, 179 L.Ed.2d 919 (2011); <em>United States v. Chavez-Valencia, </em>116 F.3d 127, 129-32 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 926, 118 S.Ct. 325, 139 L.Ed.2d 252 (1997); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>215 F.3d 1020, 1026 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 969, 121 S.Ct. 406, 148 L.Ed.2d 313 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In <em>Burke, </em>633 F.3d at 989-90, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit explained the policy rationale behind the rule providing that an issue not raised below is waived, absent a showing of good cause for the failure to raise the issue. It stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">[I]n most circumstances \u201cfairness concerns\u201d militate in favor of a waiver rule because \u201c \u2018although the government can appeal an adverse ruling on a suppression motion prior to trial, it cannot do so once jeopardy has attached.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>[United States v.] Brooks, </em>438 F.3d [1231] at 1240 [ (10th Cir.2006) ]); <em>see also Rose, </em>538 F.3d at 183 (citing <em>Chavez-Valencia, </em>116 F.3d at 132). Moreover, if \u201ca defendant has not raised a suppression issue before the district court, the Government (under an assumption that its proffered evidence was admissible) may plausibly conclude during trial that it does not need to accumulate and introduce additional evidence to prevail.\u201d <em>Rose, </em>538 F.3d at 183. Finally, allowing a defendant to challenge the inclusion of evidence on appeal places the government in the difficult position of \u201cdefending itself based on a potentially meager record.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>438 F.3d at 1240.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The Court explained that the good cause exception protects against a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 991. It explained, however, that relief under this exception would be rare. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>988. Where there was sufficient information available to allow counsel to raise the issue, good cause would not be found. <em>Id. </em>In that circumstance, the issue would be deemed waived, and plain error review was precluded. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We believe that this analysis is appropriate when addressing the failure to file a motion to suppress pursuant to Md. Rule 4-252. As indicated, Rule 4-252 was drafted, \u201cas a matter of judicial policy,\u201d to be parallel to Fed.R.CrimP. 12. <em>Kohr, </em>40 Md.App. at 98, 388 A.2d 1242. Rule 4-252(a) specifically provides, as does the federal rule, that a failure to raise a suppression issue in the trial court in a timely manner waives the issue, absent good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth by the federal courts, listed <em>supra, </em>we hold that, if a defendant fails to raise a ground seeking suppression of evidence, which is required to be raised pre-trial by Rule 4-252, the defendant has waived his or her right to appellate review of that issue. Plain error review generally is not applicable, and an appellant seeking review must show good cause for the failure to raise the issue in the circuit court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Moreover, we note that, in this case, there was more than the mere failure to argue below that appellant\u2019s statement to the police should have been suppressed. There was an affirmative waiver of the issue. As indicated, appellant initially filed a motion to suppress the statements. At the beginning of the trial, however, counsel affirmatively withdrew the motion, stating that, based on his view of the videotape, \u201cthere\u2019s certainly nothing there that ... in my opinion was improper, uh, worthy of a motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>This Court specifically has stated that withdrawing a motion, an affirmative act of commission as opposed to an act of omission, constitutes a waiver rather than a forfeiture. <em>Green v. State, </em>81 Md.App. 747, 759, 569 A.2d 741, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 16, 575 A.2d 743 (1990). At least one other court has agreed that the withdrawal of a motion to suppress constitutes a waiver precluding appellate review. <em>See United States v. Sheppard, </em>149 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.1998) (defendant waived his suppression argument by withdrawing his motion to suppress prior to trial, and therefore, the court was without jurisdiction to consider the argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u2022Under the circumstances here, appellant\u2019s claim is waived. It is not subject to plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Even when a claim is waived, however, there are circumstances where appellate review is available. As indicated, a court may review a claim based upon a showing of good cause for failing to raise the issue. One circumstance in which this Court has reviewed a suppression issue that was not raised below is where there has been a change in the law after trial. <em>McCain v. State, </em>194 Md.App. 252, 277-78, 4 A.3d 53 (2010). <em>Accord Hays v. State, </em>240 Md. 482, 485, 214 A.2d 573 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Appellant\u2019s only suggestion of good cause, albeit presented on appeal as a ground for plain error review, is that his argument on appeal is based on the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Berghuis. </em>He appears to be arguing that <em>Berghuis </em>made new law, asserting that it \u201cbroke new ground and called this Court\u2019s prior <em>Miranda </em>caselaw into question.\u201d As appellant notes, however, <em>Berghuis </em>was decided \u201cseveral months prior to [appellant\u2019s] trial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that <em>Berghuis </em>constituted a change in the law relevant to the issue he raises on appeal, it was not a change subsequent to his trial that would justify review pursuant to <em>McCain, </em>194 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>App. at 277-78, 4 A.3d 53, and <em>Hays, </em>240 Md. at 485, 214 A.2d 573. There has been no showing of good cause for the failure to move to suppress appellant\u2019s statement to the police based on a violation of <em>Miranda.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Appellant waived his right to challenge the admissibility of his statement to the police. We will not address his claim in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">IV. Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the circuit court erred in failing to merge or vacate various convictions. He makes three arguments in this regard. First, appellant argues that the court erred in refusing to merge his conspiracy convictions with his convictions for attempted armed robbery pursuant to the doctrine of fundamental fairness. Second, appellant contends that \u201cthe court improperly imposed four conspiracy sentences, despite the fact that all agreed that the evidence established only a single conspiracy.\u201d Third, appellant argues that his conviction on count 24, second degree assault, should be vacated because the \u201cjury neglected to read a verdict on this count in open court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The State agrees with appellant\u2019s latter two arguments. It concedes that the four conspiracy counts should have been merged for sentencing purposes. The State also agrees that \u201c[t]he jury did not read the verdict on count 24 [second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>assault] in open court, and therefore, pursuant to <em>Jones v. State, </em>384 Md. 669, 866 A.2d 151 (2005), that conviction should in fact be vacated.\u201d The State disagrees, however, with appellant\u2019s argument that the convictions for attempted armed robbery and conspiracy merge pursuant to the doctrine of fundamental fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Merger of Convictions for Conspiracy to Commit Armed Robbery and Attempted Armed Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Maryland courts recognize three grounds for merging a defendant\u2019s convictions: (1) the required evidence test; (2) the rule of lenity; and (3) principles of fundamental fairness. <em>Kelly v. State, </em>195 Md.App. 403, 440-42, 6 A.3d 396 (2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 Md. 502, 10 A.3d 1181, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2119, 179 L.Ed.2d 912 (2011); <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 219, 222-23, 582 A.2d 525 (1990). Appellant concedes, appropriately, that his conspiracy and attempted armed robbery convictions would not merge under either the required evidence test or the rule of lenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">As this Court recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akn\">The Maryland appellate courts have consistently declined to merge a conviction for conspiracy with a conviction for the substantive offense under the required evidence test or the rule of lenity. <em>See, e.g., Khalifa, </em>382 Md. [400,] 437 [855 A.2d 1175 (2004) ] (conspiracy to detain a child and accessory to detain a child); <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 759, 506 A.2d 580 (1986) (conspiracy to murder and murder), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996); <em>Wooten-Bey v. State, </em>76 Md.App. 603, 628-30, 547 A.2d 1086 (1988) (conspiracy to rob and attempted robbery), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>318 Md. 301, 568 A.2d 16 (1990); <em>Murray v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 626, 634-35, 599 A.2d 465 (1991) (conspiracy to distribute cocaine and distribution). The rationale behind these decisions is that \u201ca substantive offense is generally distinct from the act of conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>commit the offense.\u201d <em>Khalifa, </em>382 Md. at 436 [855 A.2d 1175].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>Kelly, </em>195 Md.App. at 441, 6 A.3d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In <em>Wootenr-Bey, </em>this Court explained that the Maryland General Assembly clearly intended to punish the crimes of attempted armed robbery and conspiracy separately:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">We thus have two separate criminal acts for which the Legislature has provided distinct punishments. Appellant presents us with no case law or legislative history suggesting that the Legislature did not intend to punish both of these criminal acts, nor can it be seriously argued that an ambiguity exists when the statutes are applied in tandem. It makes sense that, because the two crimes and penalties address different criminal behavior, separate sentences be imposed. In the instant case, appellant received the first 10-year sentence for <em>planning </em>the robbery. The second sentence imposed for the attempt was for the steps appellant took toward <em>consummating </em>that plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">76 Md.App. at 629-30, 547 A.2d 1086.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Appellant argues, nevertheless, that the convictions should merge under the doctrine of fundamental fairness. The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c[o]ne of the most basic considerations in all our decisions is the principle of fundamental fairness in meting out punishment for a crime.\u201d <em>Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 223, 582 A.2d 525. The cases in which fundamental fairness warranted merger, however, involved situations where one crime was \u201can integral component of\u2019 or \u201cincidental to\u201d the other crime. <em>See id. </em>at 223-24, 582 A.2d 525 (solicitation was \u201cpart and parcel of the ultimate conspiracy and thereby an integral component of it\u201d); <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 153, 882 A.2d 900 (\u201cthe malicious destruction of property was clearly incidental to the breaking and entering of [the dwelling]\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 Md. 91, 887 A.2d 656 (2005). This Court has made clear, however, that \u201cconspiracy is not \u2018part and parcel\u2019 of or \u2018incidental to\u2019 the substantive offense; it is a separate offense.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>195 Md.App. at 442, 6 A.3d 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>\u00edn <em>Kelly, </em>we held that principles of fundamental fairness do not prevent separate sentences for the separate offenses of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. <em>Id. </em>The crimes address different criminal behavior and warrant separate sentences. <em>Id. </em>The same rationale applies to the crimes of conspiracy to commit armed robbery and attempted armed robbery. The circuit court properly refused to merge appellant\u2019s conspiracy convictions with his convictions for attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Merger of Conspiracy Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">With respect to the argument that the four conspiracy counts should have merged for sentencing purposes, the parties agree that the sentences should merge, and so do we. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>148 Md.App. 601, 640-41, 814 A.2d 1 (2002) (merging conspiracy counts in regard to multiple victims), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 Md. 84, 821 A.2d 371 (2003); <em>Tracy v. State, </em>319 Md. 452, 459, 573 A.2d 38 (1990) (\u201cIt is well settled in Maryland that only one sentence can be imposed for a single common law conspiracy no matter how many criminal acts the conspirators have agreed to commit. The unit of prosecution is the agreement or combination rather than each of its criminal objectives.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Appellant argues, however, that rather than vacating the sentences for three of the conspiracy convictions, we must remand for a new sentencing hearing, where appellant <em>\u201cmust </em>be allowed to present mitigating evidence and argument at resentencing.\u201d In support, he cites <em>Jones v. State, </em>414 Md. 686, 703, 997 A.2d 131 (2010). In that case, where this Court remanded \u201cfor imposition of a new sentence,\u201d the Court of Appeals held that the defendant was entitled to present mitigating evidence and argument at the resentencing. <em>Id. </em>Typically, however, where merger is deemed to be appropriate, this Court merely vacates the sentence that should be merged without ordering a new sentencing hearing. <em>See, e.g., Washington v.

In that case, the Court concluded that, \u201cbecause the jury was not polled and hearkened to that Count in absence of its oral announcement, the verdict of guilt cannot stand and any sentence apportioned thereto must be vacated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686, 866 A.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Here, the verdict sheet indicates that the jury found appellant guilty of count 24. However, the jury did not read that verdict in open court. Therefore, the conviction should be vacated under <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">CONVICTION ON COUNT 24 IS VACATED; THREE OF THE FOUR SENTENCES FOR CONSPIRACY ARE VACATED; JUDGMENTS OTHERWISE AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>COSTS TO BE PAID 75% BY APPELLANT AND 25% BY FREDERICK COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-14\">.

Although we find no error by the court here, that is not to say that it would not be reasonable for trial courts to give the instruction requested and explicitly state that the prosecution has the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each element of each charge. Other jurisdictions include such language in their pattern jury instructions on the presumption of innocence and/or the burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., </em>Alaska Crim.
