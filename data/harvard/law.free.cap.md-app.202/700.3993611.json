The sentencing court imposed consecutive sentences totaling 95 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">On appeal, appellant raises four questions for review, which we have rephrased and reordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">1. Did the circuit court err in admitting hearsay evidence as a prior inconsistent statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">2. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction of felony murder where the conduct resulting in the victim\u2019s death did not occur during the commission of the underlying felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">3. Did the circuit court plainly err in failing to instruct the jury that, in order to convict Mr. Yates of felony murder, the State had to prove that the conduct resulting in the victim\u2019s death occurred during the commission of the underlying felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-9\">4. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s use of a handgun convictions in the absence of evidence that the gun used was a handgun?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">On January 7, 2009, Ms. Worcester was shot and killed outside of her home in Middle River, Maryland. She had gone outside to remove the trash and was talking with relatives when the group heard gunshots. Ms. Worcester said: \u201cI\u2019ve been hit.\u201d She died of a single gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-13\">On October 6, 2009, trial commenced against appellant and his co-defendant, Donald Kohler. The State presented testimony from nineteen witnesses. Four of these witnesses, Stephanie Foltz, William Griffin, Chris Jagd, and Justin Wimbush, testified that they were present at a home in Middle River, Maryland on January 7, 2009, when Mr. Kohler pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>chased four pounds of marijuana. Although details of the transaction varied, the testimony was consistent that the drugs ultimately were given to Mr. Kohler in exchange for money, which was wrapped in a bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Mr. Jagd testified that, after Mr. Kohler took the drugs and left the house, appellant \u201copened the bag and noticed that the money was fake.\u201d Appellant ran out of the house after Mr. Kohler.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Three witnesses testified regarding the events that took place after the fake money was discovered. Mr. Wimbush testified that he saw appellant run after Mr. Kohler into an alley. He heard gunshots, and then he saw appellant running back toward the house from the top of the alley. Mr. Wimbush saw appellant get into a car with Mr. Griffin and leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Mr. Jagd also saw appellant chase Mr. Kohler. Mr. Jagd initially testified that he did not see appellant shoot a gun, but he saw a gun in appellant\u2019s hand when appellant ran out the front door after Mr. Kohler. Counsel for Mr. Kohler then questioned Mr. Jagd about his statement to Detective Sekou Hinton that he saw appellant \u201caim the pistol, pause, aim like he was trying to hit him, pause, and then move the gun to the side and then fire.\u201d Mr. Jagd then stated that he \u201cjust remembered\u201d that he did see Mr. Yates fire six shots with a \u201crevolver.\u201d When questioned about his statement to the police that the gun was a \u201csemi-automatic\u201d handgun, he admitted that he did not \u201cknow the difference between an automatic and a revolver.\u201d Mr. Jagd testified that he spoke with appellant after the shooting. As discussed in more detail <em>infra, </em>he could not recall exactly what appellant said, but he testified that he thought appellant said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I got him\u201d or \u201cI think I got him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Mr. Griffin testified that he saw appellant run out the front door, and he then heard two gunshots. He met appellant at appellant\u2019s car, and as they were leaving, he asked appellant: \u201c[Wjhat happened with the gunshots.\u201d Appellant replied that \u201che fired the gun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, counsel for both appellant and Mr. Kohler moved for judgment of acquittal on all counts. The court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Appellant then rested without introducing any evidence. Mr. Kohler introduced some evidence on his behalf, but he did not testify.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants renewed their motions for judgment of acquittal, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">As indicated, the jury convicted appellant of second degree felony murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, drug trafficking with a firearm, distribution of marijuana, and other offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">Hearsay</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention involves Detective Hinton\u2019s testimony regarding his interview with Mr. Jagd after the murder. Detective Hinton testified, over objection, about a statement Mr. Jagd made to him after the murder. Mr. Jagd advised that, as appellant was leaving' the scene, appellant stated: \u201cI popped that [N...].\u201d Appellant argues that this testimony was inadmissible hearsay, which severely prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">The State does not argue that the evidence was properly admitted. Rather, it asserts that, \u201c[e]ven assuming that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>trial court erred, reversal is not warranted because the essential content of Jagd\u2019s statement,\u201d that appellant admitted that he shot the gun, \u201cwas elsewhere properly admitted without objection, thereby obviating any unfair prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The testimony at issue was elicited by counsel for Mr. Kohler, appellant\u2019s co-defendant. During the State\u2019s direct examination of Mr. Jagd, he testified that he could not remember what appellant said to him after the shooting. On cross-examination, Mr. Kohler\u2019s attorney followed up on this questioning, asking again if Mr. Jagd remembered what appellant said to him when appellant was running back to the house after the shooting. Mr. Jagd replied: \u201cNah. I said something to him. I said, did you shoot him? I don\u2019t remember exactly what he said. I think he said, I don\u2019t know if I got him, or something around that, or I think I got him. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d Mr. Jagd testified that he could not remember appellant\u2019s exact words. When counsel for Mr. Kohler questioned Mr. Jagd about his statement to Detective Hinton, Mr. Jagd denied that appellant made the above-referenced statement, reiterating that he asked appellant, \u201cdid you shoot him,\u201d and appellant said: \u201cI think so, or something around that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Counsel for Mr. Kohler subsequently revisited the issue with Detective Hinton. Detective Hinton testified that Mr. Jagd told him, during an interview shortly after the shooting, that appellant, while running back to the house, said: \u201cI popped that [N... ].\u201d The court permitted the testimony as a \u201cprior inconsistent statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">A prior statement by a witness that is inconsistent with the witness\u2019s testimony in court generally is admissible to impeach the credibility of the witness. <em>Stewart v. State, </em>342 Md. 230, 236, 674 A.2d 944 (1996). Here, however, counsel for Mr. Kohler did not use the statement to show that Mr. Jagd was an incredible witness, but rather, he used the evidence as substantive evidence. Counsel for Mr. Kohler stated in closing argument that this statement showed that Mr. Kohler, who is white, was not the purported buyer in the drug deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>When prior inconsistent statements are offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, the statements are hearsay. <em>Stewart, </em>342 Md. at 236, 674 A.2d 944. Generally, hearsay is inadmissible. Md. Rule 5-802.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Pursuant to Md. Rule 5-802.1(a), however, prior inconsistent statements are admissible as substantive evidence if certain requirements are met. The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-7\">(a) A statement that is inconsistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement was (1) given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition; (2) reduced to writing and was signed by the declarant; or (3) recorded in substantially verbatim fashion by stenographic or electronic means contemporaneously with the making of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Md. Rule 5-802.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">Here, as appellant notes, there was no evidence that Mr. Jagd\u2019s statement to Det. Hinton was given under oath, reduced to writing and signed by the declarant, or recorded in a substantially verbatim fashion. Thus, the prior inconsistent statement was not admissible as substantive evidence. The trial court, however, never limited its use to impeachment, either at the time the statement was admitted or during jury instructions, and counsel for Mr. Kohler used the statement as substantive evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">As indicated, however, the State asserts that, even if the admission of the statement was error, it was not reversible error because there was no unfair prejudice. The Maryland appellate courts have set forth the standard for assessing harmless error as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of\u2014whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asv\"><em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 66, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011) (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976)).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">This Court and the Court of Appeals have found the erroneous admission of evidence to be harmless if evidence to the same effect was introduced, without objection, at another time during the trial. <em>See Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 507, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979) (\u201cThe law in this State is settled that where a witness later gives testimony, <em>without objection, </em>which is to the same effect as earlier testimony to which an objection was overruled, any error in the earlier ruling is harmless.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1021, 100 S.Ct. 680, 62 L.Ed.2d 654 (1980); <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 145, 202 A.2d 585 (1964) (any error in the admission of testimony \u201cwas rendered harmless\u201d by the admission of competent \u201cevidence to the same effect\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 1001, 85 S.Ct. 721, 13 L.Ed.2d 702 (1965); <em>Berry v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 144, 170, 843 A.2d 93 (\u201cWe shall not find reversible error when objectionable testimony is admitted if the essential contents of that objectionable testimony have already been established and presented to the jury without objection through the testimony of other witnesses.\u201d), cer<em>t. denied, </em>381 Md. 674, 851 A.2d 594 (2004); <em>Williams v. State, </em>131 Md.App. 1, 27, 748 A.2d 1 (where evidence to the same effect as the objected to evidence was admitted, any error in the admission of the objectionable evidence was harmless), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 Md. 335, 753 A.2d 1032 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In the present case, the critical content of the objectionable statement, that appellant fired the gun that killed the victim, was admitted without objection on three other occasions. Mr. Jagd testified that, when appellant was walking back toward the house, he asked appellant \u201cdid you shoot him?\u201d Mr. Jagd testified that appellant replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I got him, or something around that, or I think I got him.\u201d He reiterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>that, when he asked appellant if he shot the buyer, appellant stated: \u201cI think so.\u201d Similarly, Mr. Griffin testified that, after the shooting, he asked appellant \u201cwhat happened with the gunshots,\u201d and appellant replied that he \u201cfired the gun.\u201d All of these statements, which were admitted without objection, evidenced appellant\u2019s admission that he fired the gun. Accordingly, the admission of Detective Hinton\u2019s testimony, which also constituted an admission that appellant believed he shot the drug purchaser, was cumulative to the other evidence that appellant shot at the drug purchaser, and therefore, it was harmless error that does not require reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Appellant argues that the error was not harmless because the statement was \u201cinflammatory\u201d and \u201cprovocative.\u201d When asked to expound on that contention in oral argument, counsel stressed that the testimony: (1) involved a \u201cboastful\u201d confession, with appellant happy about killing the drug purchaser; and (2) it was testimony from a police officer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant asserts that Detective Hinton\u2019s testimony, that appellant \u201cbrazenly confessed to committing the crimes,\u201d was prejudicial because it was \u201cfar more compelling than the halfhearted accounts\u201d given by the other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We disagree. A central issue in this case was whether appellant shot Ms. Worcester.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two witnesses testified that appellant admitted that he fired the gun. Detective Hinton\u2019s testimony, although characterizing appellant\u2019s admission of the shooting in a more provocative manner, was merely relaying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>what another witness told him, and it was cumulative to the prior testimony on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">One factor that an appellate court considers in determining whether the admission of inadmissible evidence was harmless error is \u201c \u2018the use the State made\u2019 of the inadmissible [evidence].\u201d <em>Harrod v. State, </em>423 Md. 24, 40, 31 A.3d 173 (2011) (quoting <em>Anderson v. State, </em>420 Md. 554, 569, 24 A.3d 692 (2011)). In both <em>Harrod </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>the State emphasized the inadmissible evidence in closing argument, which illustrated the importance of the evidence and precluded a finding of harmless error. <em>Harrod, </em>at 41-42, 31 A.3d at 183-84; <em>Anderson, </em>420 Md. at 569, 24 A.3d 692. Here, by contrast, the State did not mention the objected to testimony of Detective Hinton in its closing argument. Rather, as indicated, the only reference to the statement was by counsel for Mr. Kohler, who relied on the statement to suggest that Mr. Kohler, who is white, was not the purchaser of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Given that the State did not rely on the evidence in closing argument, and that it was cumulative to other evidence that appellant fired the gun he was holding after he ran after Mr. Kohler, we hold that the admission of Detective Hinton\u2019s testimony was harmless error. Appellant is entitled to no relief in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Felony Murder</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for second degree murder because the State failed to prove all of the elements of felony murder. Specifically, appellant argues that \u201cthe underlying felony of distribution was complete prior to the shooting,\u201d and therefore, the State failed to prove that the murder occurred during the commission of the felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The State argues that appellant\u2019s argument takes too narrow a view of the felony murder doctrine. It argues that \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>evidence was legally sufficient to convict [appellant] of second degree felony murder because [appellant] killed [Ms.] Worcester during the \u2018res gestae\u2019 of the drug deal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions, we must determine, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, if \u201c \u2018any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Burlas v. State, </em>185 Md.App. 559, 568, 971 A.2d 937 (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 Md. 166, 978 A.2d 245 (2009). If the evidence \u201c \u2018showed directly, or circumstantially, or supported a rational inference of facts which could fairly convince a trier of fact of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt[,]\u2019 then we will affirm the conviction.\u201d <em>Bible v. State, </em>411 Md. 138, 156, 982 A.2d 348 (2009) (quoting <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 750, 720 A.2d 323 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In <em>Fisher v. State, </em>367 Md. 218, 262-63, 786 A.2d 706 (2001), the Court of Appeals held that felony murder in the second degree is a cognizable offense under the common law of this State. The Court explained: \u201cIf the felonious conduct, under all of the circumstances, made death a foreseeable consequence, it is reasonable for the law to infer from the commission of the felony under those circumstances the malice that qualifies the homicide as murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 786 A.2d 706. The underlying felony must involve danger to life, which is determined by looking to the nature of the crime or \u201cthe manner in which it was perpetrated in a given set of circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263, 786 A.2d 706. In <em>Fisher, </em>the Court upheld a second degree felony murder conviction based upon child abuse. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">In the present case, the underlying felony was distribution of marijuana. Appellant does not argue that this crime is not a sufficient predicate felony to support a second degree felony murder charge. His challenge focuses on the timing of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>The Court of Appeals has explained that, under Maryland common law, a felony-murder conviction is appropriate only if the State proves \u201cthat the defendant committed the underlying felony and that the death occurred \u2018in the perpetration of [that] felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metheny v. State, </em>359 Md. 576, 623, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000) (quoting <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 269, 373 A.2d 262 (1977)). <em>Accord Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 227, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005) (\u201cTo obtain a conviction for felony-murder, the State is required to prove the underlying felony and that the death occurred during the perpetration of the felony.\u201d); <em>Deese v. State, </em>367 Md. 293, 305, 786 A.2d 751 (2001) (to \u201cqualify as a basis for second degree murder,\u201d the \u201cvictim\u2019s death, of course, must be \u2018caused during the commission of, or attempt to commit,\u2019 the underlying felony\u201d) (quoting <em>Lindsay v. State, 8 </em>Md.App. 100, 104-05 n. 6, 258 A.2d 760 (1969)); <em>State v. Stouffer, </em>352 Md. 97, 116, 721 A.2d 207 (1998) (killing must be \u201c \u2018in furtherance of the felonious undertaking\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Campbell v. State, </em>293 Md. 438, 446, 444 A.2d 1034 (1982)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Appellant argues that the murder here did not occur during the commission of the felony. He contends that the crime of distribution requires the State to \u201cprove that the Defendant sold, exchanged, transferred or gave away\u201d marijuana, and that, \u201c[g]iven the evidence presented at trial, the jury could not have concluded anything but that the events surrounding Ms. Worcester\u2019s death occurred <em>after </em>the predicate felony of distribution had been completed.\u201d Appellant asserts that \u201call three testifying eyewitnesses confirmed that the drugs were \u2018transferred\u2019 from Messrs. Griffin and Yates to Mr, Kohler before Mr. Kohler left the house and Mr. Yates followed with the others.\u201d Thus, appellant argues, the State failed to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>that the death of Ms. Worcester occurred during the perpetration of the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Several courts have rejected the argument advanced by appellant, that a felony is \u201ccomplete\u201d when the definitional elements of an offense have been satisfied. In <em>Bissot v. State, </em>53 Ind. 408, 413-19 (1876), the Supreme Court of Indiana engaged in a detailed discussion of the problem with this argument. In that case, the defendant broke into a drug store intending to rob it, and when he was confronted by the owner with a gun, the defendant shot and killed the owner. <em>Id. </em>at 410-11. The court rejected the argument that the homicide was not committed \u201cin the perpetration\u2019 of the burglary\u201d because it did not occur \u201cas soon as the burglarious entry was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412. The court noted: \u201cIf this construction were to be given to the statute, it would be quite impracticable to ever convict for a murder committed in the perpetration of any of the felonies\u201d set forth by statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">If the charge was murder committed \u201cin the perpetration\u201d of a robbery, as soon as the accused had forcibly and feloniously, or by violence or putting in fear, taken from the person of another any article of value, the robbery would be consummated; yet, if immediately afterwards, in the struggle to release himself and escape, he had killed his victim, the degree of the homicide, unconnected with the robbery, would be no higher than manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">A similar problem would arise, the court stated, if the charge was murder committed in the perpetration of arson. <em>Id. </em>at 413. As the court explained, accepting appellant\u2019s view would mean that, \u201cas soon as the criminal had wilfully and maliciously set fire to a dwelling-house, the arson would be accomplished, and he could flee; yet it might be that some human being was in the building at the time, and hours afterwards was consumed in the flames.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>The Court held that, \u201cwhere the homicide is committed within the <em>res gest[a]e </em>of the felony charged, it is committed in the perpetration of\u2019 the felony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">More recently, the Michigan Supreme Court cited <em>Bissot </em>for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201cperpetration\u201d includes not only the definitional elements of the predicate felony, but also includes those acts that are required to complete the felony\u2014such as those that occur after the commission of the predicate felony while the felon is attempting to escape. To hold otherwise would make it \u201cquite impracticable to ever convict for a murder committed in the perpetration of any of the [enumerated felonies].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4d\"><em>People v. Gillis, </em>474 Mich. 105, 712 N.W.2d 419, 426 (2006) (quoting <em>Eddy v. State, </em>496 N.E.2d 24, 28 (Ind.1986), quoting in turn <em>Bissot, </em>53 Ind. at 412), <em>cert. denied, </em>550 U.S. 920, 127 S.Ct. 2132, 167 L.Ed.2d 868 (2007). The court explained that it adopted \u201cthe <em>res gestae </em>principle, which holds that a murder committed during the unbroken chain of events surrounding the predicate felony is committed \u2018in the perpetration of that felony.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">In <em>People v. Taylor, </em>112 Cal.App.3d 348, 169 Cal.Rptr. 290 (1980), the Court of Appeal of California for the Fifth Appellate District considered this argument in the context of the felony of drug distribution. Mr. Taylor had been drinking with the victim and others, and he gave the victim heroin. <em>Id. </em>at 293. The victim died several hours later. <em>Id. </em>at 294. Mr. Taylor was convicted of second degree felony murder, with furnishing heroin as the underlying felony. <em>Id. </em>at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Mr. Taylor argued, as appellant does here, that he could not \u201cbe convicted of second degree felony murder because the act of furnishing heroin was completed when he handed the heroin to [the victim] and thus the homicide was not committed in the perpetration of the felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295. The court rejected that argument, holding that \u201c[i]t is sufficient under the felony-murder rule that the felony and the homicide are part of one continuous transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court continued: \u201cThere is no requirement that the homicide occur while committing or while engaged in the felony, or that the killing be part of the felony. It is sufficient that the homicide be related to the felony and have resulted as a natural and probable consequence thereof.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We agree that a killing committed after the definitional elements of the predicate felony have been completed can qualify as felony murder. That appellant had distributed the drugs to Mr. Kohler does not automatically preclude a finding of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The question then is what test should be applied to determine when a killing that follows a felony constitutes felony murder. This Court has recognized the requirement of a causal connection between the homicide and the felony, stating: \u201c \u2018The killing must have had an intimate relation and close connection with the felony, and not be separate, distinct, and independent from it.... The death must have occurred as a result or outcome of the attempt to commit the felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 475, 488, 590 A.2d 177 (1991) (quoting Wharton, Homicide \u00a7 126 at 184 (3d ed. 1907)).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">In <em>Metheny, </em>359 Md. at 624, 755 A.2d 1088, the Court of Appeals noted that other jurisdictions determine whether a killing qualifies as a felony murder by looking to whether the felony and the homicide were parts of a continuous transaction. <em>See State v. Buggs, </em>995 S.W.2d 102, 106 (Tenn.1999) (\u201ckilling may precede, coincide with, or follow the felony and still be considered as occurring \u2018in the perpetration of the felony offense, so long as there is a connection in time, place, and continuity of action\u201d); <em>Montague v. Commonwealth, </em>31 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Va.App. 187, 522 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1999) (\u201cUnder the <em>res gestae </em>theory, the felony murder doctrine applies when the \u2018initial felony and the homicide [are] parts of one continuous transaction, and [are] closely related in point of time, place, and causal connection.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>260 Va. 697, 536 S.E.2d 910 (2000).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Other courts also look to whether there is a connection of time, place, and continuity of action, as well as causal connection, in determining whether a killing falls within the felony murder doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Bizup v. People, </em>150 Colo. 214, 371 P.2d 786, 788 (affirming a conviction for felony murder because the killing and underlying robbery \u201cwere so closely connected in point of time, place and continuity of action as to be one continuous transaction.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>371 U.S. 873, 83 S.Ct. 144, 9 L.Ed.2d 112 (1962); <em>State v.

Trull, </em>349 N.C. 428, 509 S.E.2d 178, 192 (1998)), <em>review denied, </em>361 N.C. 433, 649 S.E.2d 395 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We agree with this line of cases. We hold that a killing that follows a felony constitutes felony murder if the homicide and the felony were parts of one continuous transaction, and they were closely related in time, place, and causal relation.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Application of these factors here support appellant\u2019s conviction of second degree felony murder. The shooting occurred immediately after the drug deal, as the buyer fled after giving fake money in exchange for the drugs. The close relation in time and place between the two events was clear. The factors of continuity of action and causal connection also were established. In considering these factors, courts look to whether the killing was \u201cpart of an unbroken chain of events surrounding\u201d the felony, <em>ie., </em>whether it occurred as part of the <em>res gestae </em>of the felony. <em>Gillis, </em>712 N.W.2d at 437. Here, where the evidence showed that appellant ran after Mr. Kohler because Mr. Kohler did not provide the money agreed upon for the drugs, the shooting was a continued part of the drug deal, and it was causally related to the felony. The evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for second degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">B. Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Appellant next argues that the court erred in its jury instruction regarding second degree felony murder, arguing that it failed to instruct the jury regarding an essential element of felony murder. Specifically, appellant argues that the court failed to instruct the jury that \u201cthe act resulting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>the death occurred during the commission or attempted commission or escape from the immediate scene of the distribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The State responds in several ways. Initially, it argues that appellant affirmatively waived his appellate complaint by declaring that he was satisfied with the jury instructions, and therefore, plain error review is not available to him. The State further argues that, \u201c[e]ven were it available, plain-error review would be unwarranted because there was no error, much less the requisite \u2018blockbuster error\u2019 material to the verdict.\u201d It notes that the court used the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction for second degree felony murder, and the use of a pattern jury instruction is favored. Finally, the State contends that the instruction was proper, asserting that \u201cthe relative timing of the felony and the killing is but a means to analyzing the deeper legal issue of causation,\u201d which the instruction properly addressed by advising that the jury must find that Ms. Worcester was killed \u201cas a result of the way in which the distribution of marijuana was committed or attempted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The trial court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">In order to convict [appellant] of second degree felony murder, the State must prove that the [appellant] or another participating in the crime with the [appellant] committed or attempted to commit the crime of distribution of marijuana, which is a felony. That the way in which the distribution of marijuana was committed or attempted under all of the circumstances created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or a serious physical injury likely to result in death, and that as a result of the way in which the distribution of marijuana was committed or attempted, Shirley Elizabeth Worcester was killed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">After the court instructed the jury, it asked appellant\u2019s counsel if he had any objections to the instructions, and counsel replied: \u201cNone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Maryland Rule 4-325(e) states: \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection.\u201d <em>Accord Alston v. State, </em>414 Md. 92, 111, 994 A.2d 896 (2010) (\u201cCountless opinions of this Court have held that, when no timely objection to the jury instructions is made in the trial court, this Court ordinarily will not review a claim of error based on those instructions.\u201d). The \u201c \u2018rules for preservation of issues have a salutary purpose of preventing unfairness and requiring that all issues be raised in and decided by the trial court, and these rules must be followed in all cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rich, </em>415 Md. 567, 574 (2010) (quoting <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 150, 729 A.2d 910 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">To be sure, we have discretion under Md. Rule 4-325(e) to address an unpreserved issue. That Rule states: \u201cAn appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The Maryland appellate courts have made clear, however, that plain error review rarely should be exercised. As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">It is a discretion that appellate courts should rarely exercise, as considerations of both fairness and judicial efficiency ordinarily require that all challenges that a party desires to make to a trial court\u2019s ruling, action, or conduct be presented in the first instance to the trial court so that (1) a proper record can be made with respect to the challenge, and (2) the other parties and the trial judge are given an opportunity to consider and respond to the challenge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\"><em>Chaney v.

Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute. Third, the error must have affected the appellant\u2019s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it \u201caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the discretion to remedy the error\u2014discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Meeting all four prongs is difficult, \u201cas it should be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-8\"><em>Rich, </em>415 Md. at 578, 3 A.3d 1210 (quoting <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Before addressing whether to exercise our discretion to engage in plain error review of appellant\u2019s claim, we must address the State\u2019s claim that appellant cannot seek such review. The State argues that appellant, by stating that he had no objections to the instructions, \u201caffirmatively waived\u201d review of his jury instruction complaint. The State asserts that, \u201c[ujnlike a claim beset by mere forfeiture, which this Court may choose to review for plain error, a claim beset by waiver cannot be reviewed at all.\u201d Thus, the State argues that plain error review is not available to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Appellant counters that \u201cthe State misconstrues the concept of waiver.\u201d He argues that, when considering \u201cwhether a defendant has waived his right to review, as opposed to having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>forfeited it by failing to object,\u201d the inquiry is whether the defendant was aware of the abandoned right. Appellant argues that, \u201c[tjhere is no evidence that [appellant] was aware of the absence of a required element in the court\u2019s felony murder instruction but decided nonetheless to forgo an objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The Court of Appeals has explained the difference between a waiver and a forfeiture. A forfeiture involves a party\u2019s \u201cfailure to make a timely assertion of a right,\u201d whereas waiver is the \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 3 A.3d 1210 (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). Forfeited rights are reviewable for plain error, whereas waived rights are not. <em>Id. Accord Carroll v. State, </em>202 Md.App. 487, 509-10, 32 A.3d 1090, 1102-03 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In <em>Rich, </em>415 Md. at 581, 3 A.3d 1210, the Court held that, where defense counsel made a specific request for an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, there was an intentional waiver of the right to argue on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to submit the issue of voluntary manslaughter to the jury. In the present case, counsel for appellant did not request specifically the instruction that the court gave on felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">There was, however, acquiescence to the instruction. When the court inquired, at the conclusion of the instructions, whether counsel had any objections, counsel said: \u201cNone.\u201d We do not view this as an affirmative waiver of his right to challenge the jury instruction. Rather, his failure to object constituted a forfeiture of his right to raise the issue on appeal, but it did not preclude this court from deciding whether to exercise its discretion to engage in plain error review. <em>See United States v. Broadnax, </em>601 F.3d 336, 347 (5th Cir.) (no cases found stating that agreement to jury instructions constitutes waiver of error in the instructions, but rather, such an agreement generally found to constitute a forfeiture subject to plain error review), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 207, 178 L.Ed.2d 124 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Thus, plain error review is available to appellant if this Court chooses to exercise its discretion to undertake such review. We decline, however, to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We note that the instruction that the court gave was MPJICR 4.17.7.2(B). Although the use of a pattern jury instruction does not insulate a conviction against review, it is a factor in our analysis. This Court has recommended that trial judges use the pattern instructions. <em>See Minger v. State, </em>157 Md. App. 157, 161 n. 1, 849 A.2d 1058 (2004) (\u201cAppellate courts in Maryland strongly favor the use of pattern jury instructions\u201d); <em>Green v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 758, 771, 736 A.2d 450 (1999) (recommending that trial judges give pattern jury instructions). Appellant has not cited any case in which a Maryland appellate court has held that a trial court committed plain error in following this recommendation and giving, without objection, a pattern jury instruction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Other courts have listed the use of a pattern jury instruction as a factor weighing against plain error review. <em>United States v.

Specifically, he argues that the \u201cState failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm used in the shooting was a handgun,\u201d as opposed to a firearm not covered by the statute. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">No gun or bullets were recovered during the investigation, and there was no evidence presented at trial regarding the recovery of any weapon. The sum total of the evidence regarding the firearm consisted of two shell casings collected at the scene and the testimony of witnesses Ronald Long and Christopher Jagd.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">The State contends that this contention is not preserved for appellate review. Even if preserved, it asserts, the contention is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">It is illegal in Maryland for a person to use \u201cany handgun in the commission of a crime of violence ... or any felony.\u201d Md.Code (2002 Repl. Vol., 2008 Supp.) \u00a7 4r-204(a) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d). A \u201chandgun\u201d \u201cmeans a pistol, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person,\u201d including any rifle or shotgun as long as it is short-barreled. C.L. \u00a7 4-201(c), \u201cShort-barreled\u201d means, in the case of a rifle, less than 16\" long in barrel or 26\" in total length, and, in the case of a shotgun, less than 18\" long in barrel or 26\" in total length. C.L. \u00a7 4-201(f)-(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">We address first the State\u2019s argument that appellant\u2019s contention is not preserved for our review. As the State notes, \u201c[i]t is well settled that \u2018appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case tried by a jury is predicated on the refusal of the trial court to grant a motion for judgment of acquittal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Starr v. State, </em>405 Md. 293, 302, 951 A.2d 87 (2008) (quoting <em>Lotharp v. State, </em>231 Md. 239, 240, 189 A.2d 652 (1963)). When making a motion for judgment of acquittal on one or more counts, a defendant must \u201cstate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted.\u201d Md. Rule 4-324(a). The \u201cfailure to particularize the reasons for granting a motion for judgment of acquittal in accordance with the rule\u2019s requirements necessarily would result in a failure to preserve the issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>Muir v. State, </em>308 Md. 208, 219, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In appellant\u2019s initial motion for judgment of acquittal, counsel made specific arguments regarding the charges of second degree felony murder, first degree murder, and first degree assault. With respect to the remaining counts, counsel stated that he \u201cwould just submit generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, counsel adopted his earlier arguments and stated that the evidence was insufficient to submit the case to the jury because the State\u2019s main witnesses were lying. He reiterated his argument that there was not sufficient evidence of felony murder because the drug distribution had concluded prior to the killing. Counsel then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">In reference to the other charges, there again, I would submit that there\u2019s insufficient evidence to send this case to the jury. There\u2019s been-there\u2019s certainly insufficient evidence to show first degree murder, the deliberately premed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>itated malice aforethought, even assuming the argument is transferred intent....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">Under the State\u2019s direct evidence direct case, there\u2019s no evidence at all, because Mr. Jagd indicated he didn\u2019t see the shooter. No one else that the State produced as a witness indicated that they saw my client shoot Mr. Kohler or anyone else. It was only under cross examination by [Mr. Kohler\u2019s counsel] that the evidence came out and, therefore, I\u2019d submit that that is insufficient for the jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">There is no scientific evidence produced by the State to show that Mr. Yates fired any weapon at all period and, therefore, I would submit that there is insufficient evidence to send that to the jury, and I\u2019d move for judgment of acquittal on all the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">We agree with the State that appellant\u2019s argument was insufficient to put the trial court on notice that he was arguing, as he does on appeal, that there was insufficient evidence to find that the weapon fired was a handgun, \u201cas opposed to a rifle or other firearm not covered by [the statute].\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention regarding the sufficiency of the evidence that the gun used was a handgun is not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.

Mr. Kohler called the victim\u2019s sister-in-law as a witness, questioning her regarding potential inconsistent statements she made regarding the appearance of a man she saw immediately before the shooting, including her statement to the police that the man was between 17 and 20 years old. Counsel for Mr. Kohler then advised the jury that the parties stipulated that Mr. Kohler was bom in 1980, which meant that Mr. Kohler was 29 years old at the time of the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-13\">.

A significant portion of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument to the jury was that the State failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the shooter. Counsel argued that no guns or bullets were found in appellant\u2019s house, in his vehicle, or on his person, and he emphasized inconsistencies in Mr. Jagd\u2019s and Mr. Griffin\u2019s testimony that appellant was the shooter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b735-6\">.

State, </em>359 Md. 576, 615-33, 755 A.2d 1088 (2000), the Court addressed, in the context of a death penalty case, whether a killing that occurred prior to a robbery was committed while in commission of the robbery, in the context of whether a statutory aggravating circumstance existed that made the defendant eligible for the death penalty. The Court undertook a survey of the law in other jurisdictions regarding the scope of the felony murder rule where the felony occurs as an afterthought following the killing. <em>Id. </em>at 623-24, 755 A.2d 1088. The Court noted that the majority of the states addressing the issue required that the intent to commit the felony must exist prior to the commission of the act causing the death, and it adopted this view for the determination of whether an aggravating circumstance existed to qualify for the death penalty. <em>Id. </em>at 630-31, 755 A.2d 1088. The Court of Appeals subsequently held that, for the felony murder rule to apply, the intent to commit the felony must precede the killing. <em>State v.
