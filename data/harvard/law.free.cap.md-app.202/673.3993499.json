Appellant Brenda Rupli (\u201cRupli\u201d) appeals the grant by the Circuit Court for Frederick County of a motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>judgment in favor of appellee, the Southern Mountain Heritage Society, Inc. (\u201cSMHS\u201d), and the denial of summary judgment in her favor. She presents four questions which we have rephrased and consolidated as follows: did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment in favor of SMHS?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">For the reasons that follow, we answer the question in the negative, and shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">STATEMENT OF FACTS<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In 1965, Moran Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cMoran Inc.\u201d) purchased the property at 1 E. Main Street, Burkittsville, MD (\u201cthe Rupli Property\u201d). The property adjacent to the Rupli Property, 3 E. Main Street (\u201cthe Church Property\u201d), was at that time owned by Resurrection Reformed Church of Burkittsville (\u201cRRCB\u201d). Some time prior to 1973, because the well on the Rupli Property was contaminated, RRCB granted Mr. Moran permission to use a well on the Church Property and to run <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>piping between that well and the house on the Rupli Property. This well provided water to the Rupli property throughout Moran Inc.\u2019s ownership of the Rupli Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Rupli and her former husband, Mr. Rupli, purchased the Rupli Property from Moran in 1973.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At that time, Mr. Moran advised <em>Mr. </em>Rupli<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the well was used with permission from RRCB.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In 1979, SMHS, a not-for-profit corporation, purchased the Church Property. At this time, SMHS knew of Rupli\u2019s use of the well, which continued after SMHS purchased the Church Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In 1998, Rupli approached SMHS with a deed of easement to the well on the Church Property, which she later described as an attempt to document \u201csomething she already had.\u201d SMHS did not sign the deed of easement and, on November 16, 2005, SMHS directed Rupli to disconnect from the well because it had decided to hold events at the church which would require indoor plumbing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rupli refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On September 14, 2009, SMHS filed an amended complaint in the Circuit Court for Frederick County seeking declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>relief with respect to use of the well (Count I), and to quiet title to the well (Count II). In each count SMHS requested that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-4\">A. Determine and adjudicate the rights of the parties with respect to their legal right to access and use the Well located on the Church Property,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">B. Declare that SMHS is entitled to the exclusive use of the Well on the Church Property,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">C. Enjoin ... Rupli from any further use of the Well and \u2022 from any further trespass onto the Church Property, including use of the Well and removal of water from the Well,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-7\">D. Require ... Rupli to remove all equipment from the Well that is designed to serve the Rupli Property,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-8\">E. Declare that ... Rupli is obligated to cooperate with SMHS and provide access to such portions of the Rupli Property from the Well on the Church Property,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-9\">F. Issue an award to SMHS of the costs of these proceedings, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">G. Grant SMHS such other relief as the nature of this cause and justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">On November 18, 2009, the court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment, and on December 8, 2009, the court issued its \u201copinion and order\u201d on the motions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Harmonizing <em>Banks v. Pusey, </em>393 Md. 688, 904 A.2d 448 (2006), with <em>Rau v. Collins, </em>167 Md.App. 176, 891 A.2d 1175 (2006), the court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>[wjhile <em>Rau </em>clearly demonstrates that the grant of permission between RRCB and Moran terminated upon the disposition of the property, it does not demand that that transfer raised a presumption of adversity as a matter of law____ Thus, where initial permission has been proven the burden remains on the claimant to show via affirmative evidence how and when the license was repudiated____Absent unequivocal conduct giving the owner of the servient property notice of adversity, this Court will not conclude that a use initiated with permission could transform into one defined by hostility. Such a conclusion would damage the public interest of encouraging amicable relationships between neighbors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">According to the circuit court, because the use of the well was \u201cinitiated with permission\u201d to her predecessor in title, Rupli had the burden of proving adverse use with \u201caffirmative evidence,\u201d which she did not satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">In conclusion, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of SMHS, and further</p>\n<blockquote id=\"App\">ORDERED that [SMHS] is the sole owner of the Well and is entitled to the exclusive use of the Well on the Church Property, and further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">ORDERED that [Rupli] is enjoined from any further use of the Well and from any further trespass onto the Church <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Property, including use of the Well and removal of water from the Well, and further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-4\">ORDERED that [Rupli] is required to remove all equipment from the Well that is designed to serve the Rupli property, and further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">ORDERED that [Rupli] shall cooperate with SMHS by providing access to such portions of the Rupli Property, and take such other steps as may be necessary, to facilitate the disconnection of the Rupli Property from the Well on the Church Property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Maryland Rule 2-501 authorizes summary judgment where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d \u201cAlthough a summary judgment in a declaratory judgment action is the exception rather than the rule, circumstances may warrant the entry of a full or partial summary judgment.\u201d <em>Loewenthal v.

Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 88, 712 A.2d 24 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">\u201cWhen both sides file cross-motions for summary judgment ... the judge must assess each party\u2019s motion on its merits, drawing all reasonable factual inferences against the moving party,\u201d <em>MAMSI Life &amp; Health Ins. Co. v. Callaway, </em>375 Md. 261, 278, 825 A.2d 995 (2003) (citation omitted), but \u201cit does not follow that the circuit court must grant one of the motions,\u201d <em>Callaway v. MAMSI Life &amp; Health Ins.

But where the litigants file cross-motions for summary judgment <em>and there are no disputes of material fact, </em>\u201cit is clear that one of these motions should be granted.\u201d <em>Cook v. Alexandria Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>263 Md. 147, 149, 282 A.2d 97 (1971). In this case, both parties agreed that there were no disputes of material fact.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>Did the Circuit Court Make Impermissible Factual Determinations?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Rupli contends that \u201cthe Circuit Court improperly acted as the trier of fact, inappropriately decided [SMHS\u2019s] intent and motives in relation to permission, and incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>resolved inferences and factual disputes against [Rupli], the non-moving party.\u201d In support of these contentions, Rupli offers the circuit court\u2019s statement that SMHS \u201ctolerated\u201d Rupli\u2019s use of the church well:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANqq\">[t]he Circuit Court\u2019s fact finding\u2014that is, that ... Rupli\u2019s use of the Well since 1973 was permissive because [SMHS] subjectively tolerated her use\u2014has poisoned its entire ruling. The Circuit Court accepted [SMHS\u2019s] allegations that it tolerated ... Rupli\u2019s usage of the Well as true (in the face of powerful, contrary inferences), and substituted its judgment for that of the jury. Indeed, the Circuit Court usurped the jury\u2019s preliminary function\u2014to weigh the evidence and to make factual findings. The Circuit Court, in essence, transformed the summary judgment procedure into a bench trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">We are not persuaded that the circuit court\u2019s statements that SMHS \u201ctolerated\u201d Rupli\u2019s use of the well constituted an impermissible finding of fact. <em>See Eng\u2019g Mgmt. Servs. v. Md. State Highway Admin., </em>375 Md. 211, 226, 825 A.2d 966 (2003). Rather, looking at the opinion as a whole, the court\u2019s use of this term arose out of its <em>legal </em>conclusion that Rupli\u2019s use of the well was presumptively permissive, and Rupli failed to proffer facts that would be legally sufficient to rebut this presumption. <em>See Zimmerman v. Summers, </em>24 Md.App. 100, 106, 330 A.2d 722 (1975) (quoting <em>Cox v. Forrest, </em>60 Md. 74, 80 (1883)) (\u201c[A]n adverse right of an easement cannot grow out of a mere permissive enjoyment, the real point of distinction being between a <em>permissive or tolerated </em>user, and one which is claimed as a matter of right.\u201d) (emphasis added). The court did not, so to speak, \u201cput the cart before the horse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\n<em>Prescriptive Easement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">\u201cA prescriptive easement arises when a party makes an adverse, exclusive, and uninterrupted use of another\u2019s real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>property for twenty years.\u201d <em>Kirby v. Hook, </em>347 Md. 380, 392, 701 A.2d 397 (1997) (citations omitted). In her motion for summary judgment, Rupli states that \u201c[tjhere is no genuine dispute that [she]\u201d has: (1) used the Church Property for at least twenty years, (2) used the Church Property \u201cexclusively\u201d during this period;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (3) used the Church Property \u201cuninterrupted\u201d during this period;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (4) used the property \u201cadversely\u201d during this period. SMHS did not dispute Rupli\u2019s claims of actual exclusive and uninterrupted use, but, regarding Rupli\u2019s fulfillment of the twenty year period, it states that \u201c[Rupli] failed to put [SMHS] on notice prior to November 1998 that her use was adverse____ [Therefore, her adverse use began as early as 1998, but has not continued for 20 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\"><em>Adverse </em>Use<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Rupli asserts that the circuit court erred in not finding her use of the well to be adverse as a matter of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>and not awarding her an easement by prescription. As stated in <em>Kirby, </em>347 Md. at 392, 701 A.2d 397,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\">[a]n easement is a nonpossessory interest in the real property of another. An easement can be created expressly or by implication. One form of implied easement is an easement by prescription. A prescriptive easement arises when a party makes an adverse, exclusive, and uninterrupted use of another\u2019s real property for twenty years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">(Internal citations omitted). In the absence of an express grant, the burden is on the party seeking the easement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>establish the elements of prescriptive use. <em>Cox, </em>60 Md. at 79. But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">[w]here one ... has used a right of way for twenty years unexplained, it is but fair to presume the user is under a claim of right.... In other words, the use of a way over the lands of another whenever one sees fit, and without asking leave, is an adverse use, and the burden is upon the owner of the land, to show that the use of the way was by license or contract inconsistent with a claim of right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 79-80. <em>See also Kirby, </em>347 Md. at 392, 701 A.2d 397 (citing <em>Condry v. Laurie, </em>184 Md. 317, 321, 41 A.2d 66 (1945)) (\u201cWhen a person has used a right of way openly, continuously, and without explanation for twenty years, it is presumed that the use has been adverse under a claim of right. The burden then shifts to the landowner to show that the use was [not adverse, but rather] permissive.\u201d). In a situation where \u201cuse begins adversely,\u201d the servient owner\u2019s \u201c[m]ere failure to protest is not permission but acquiescence.\u201d <em>Mavromoustakos v. Padussis, </em>112 Md.App. 59, 73-74, 684 A.2d 51 (1996) (quoting <em>Dalton v. Real Estate &amp; Improvement Co., </em>201 Md. 34, 50, 92 A.2d 585 (1952)). To establish permission, failure to protest must be combined \u201cwith other indications of permission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 684 A.2d 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">But a presumption of adversity \u201cwill not arise if the use ... <em>appears to have been by permission,\u201d Banks v. Pusey, </em>393 Md. 688, 700, 904 A.2d 448 (2006) (citing <em>Cox, </em>60 Md. at 79) (emphasis in original), <em>i.e., </em>where any \u201cappearance of permission permeates the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 701, 904 A.2d 448. \u201cIn the absence of ... a presumption of adverse use, the burden of establishing such use is on the party claiming it. This logically follows the general rule that the creation of an easement by prescription is not favored by the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 3 Herbert T. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property, \u00a7 796 (3d ed.1939, 2006 Supp.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The <em>Banks </em>Court stated that the character of the initial use, whether \u201coriginally permissive or of right is presumed to continue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709, 904 A.2d 448 (quoting <em>Feldstein v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number><em>Segall, </em>198 Md. 285, 295, 81 A.2d 610 (1951)). That the character of the initial use is presumed to continue is consistent with the long-held principle \u201cthat where the original entry and subsequent occupancy of land was ... with the consent or permission of the owner, the possession would not be hostile or adverse and could not evolve into a subsisting title on which recovery could be had____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710, 904 A.2d 448 (quoting <em>Hungerford v. Hungerford, </em>284 Md. 338, 341, 199 A.2d 209 (1964)). For use which is permissive in its inception to become adverse, \u201cthere must be affirmative evidence of change\u201d offered by the party seeking the prescriptive easement. <em>Feldstein, </em>198 Md. at 295, 81 A.2d 610. <em>See also </em>1931 Herbert T. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property, \u00a7 503 (enlarged ed. 1920) (\u201c[I]f the possession was originally not adverse to the true owner, the statute cannot be set in motion against him until the possessor has changed the <em>character of the possession </em>by a denial of the title of such owner, and such change has been brought to the knowledge of the latter.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">SMHS observes that \u201c[t]his case turns entirely on the legal questions of which party is entitled to a presumption and whether the other party can offer sufficient evidence to rebut the countervailing presumption.\u201d Because we essentially agree, we wiH first address who had the benefit of the controlling presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">According to Rupli, \u201c[t]he legal underpinnings of SMHS\u2019s motion\u2014that[, under <em>Banks,] </em>originally permissive use of land is presumed to continue until there is affirmative evidence of change to adverse <em>use\u2014only holds true when dealing with the original parties to the permissive use agreement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). In Rupli\u2019s view, the presumption of permissive use would terminate upon the sale of <em>either the dominant or servient estate. </em>In this case, both estates were sold\u2014the dominant estate in 1973 and the servient estate in 1979\u2014 subsequent to the permissive use agreement between Moran Inc. and RRCB. Therefore, according to Rupli, SMHS had the burden of rebutting the presumption of her adverse use of the Church Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>SMHS counters that <em>Banks, </em>which cited heavily from <em>Hungerford, </em>and <em>Feldstein,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-4\">did not make any distinction between whether the actual claimant or the claimant\u2019s predecessor initiated the use, nor did it impose any requirement that the original user of the servient estate be the ultimate claimant. Rupli\u2019s attempt to differentiate her use \u2018as the claimant\u2019 from her predecessor\u2019s use is a distinction without difference and is not supported by Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In other words, according to SMHS, the character of the use is determined when the use is initiated and the presumption of permissive use does not change with the sale of either estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In <em>Banks, </em>beginning in 1939, the Pusey family, including father and son, lived on a large property consisting of two parcels. In 1954, the father deeded one parcel to his son, but kept the other, which included a farm lane connecting the two. In 1979, the father died, and the father\u2019s parcel passed by deed to his wife, and, upon her death in 1995, to his grandchildren. In 1998, the Banks family purchased the father\u2019s parcel from the grandchildren. Despite owning his own parcel since 1954, the son had continued to live with his family on his father\u2019s parcel until 1995, and had continued to use the farm lane over that parcel until at least 1998. The son filed a complaint alleging that he held a prescriptive easement across the father\u2019s parcel, including the farm lane to access a public road. Reversing the circuit court\u2019s finding that the son \u201chas the right to use the farm lane in question under the theory of easement by prescription,\u201d 393 Md. at 698, 904 A.2d 448, the Court of Appeals observed that \u201cthe parties do not dispute that the [son] made exclusive and uninterrupted use of the farm lane for a period in excess of twenty years,\u201d for the son \u201clived on what is now the Banks\u2019 property from approximately 1939 when he was a minor until 1998 and from 1954 [ ] on he ... used the farm lane to access his 127 acre-parcel of land,\u201d both dates being more than 20 years <em>before </em>the 1998 conveyance of the father\u2019s parcel to the Banks family. <em>Id. </em>at 699, 904 A.2d 448. The court also stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>[w]hat is primarily disputed ... is whether [the son\u2019s] use of the farm lane was adverse during the period of time that he resided with his parents on what is now the Banks\u2019 property. If [the son\u2019s] use of the farm lane was not adverse during the relevant period of time that he resided on his parents\u2019 property then, even if <em>arguendo </em>the use became adverse once the Banks obtained the property, it would not satisfy the required twenty-year time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 699-700, 904 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In <em>Hungerford, </em>in 1899 a farm was conveyed to Nathaniel Hungerford, Sr. for life with remainder to two of his sons, Nathaniel Jr. and Henry. In 1922, Henry \u201cstaked out a lot on the farm, which Henry orally agreed to convey to\u201d a third son, William, \u201cin exchange for William\u2019s promise to perform certain labor or work for the life tenant.\u201d 234 Md. at 339, 199 A.2d 209. William took possession of the lot, constructed a dwelling, and lived there without disturbance. Nathaniel Sr. died in 1935, and Nathaniel Jr. and Henry held the farm as tenants in common until 1944, when they partitioned it by deed into two twenty-five acre parcels. Henry died in 1957, at which time his parcel passed to his wife, Susie. Henry had refused to convey the parcel to William, \u201cbefore Henry\u2019s interest became possessory ... after the death of [Nathaniel Sr.] and before the death of Henry in 1957----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 341, 199 A.2d 209. Susie also refused to convey the parcel to William after her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">William filed a bill of equity to quiet and confirm title based on adverse possession. The circuit court found in favor of William, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Observing that \u201can original permissive possession is presumed to continue,\u201d the court reasoned that William\u2019s \u201crepeated demands clearly indicate the [he], instead of claiming title as a matter of right by adverse possession, never ceased to recognize the continuance of the legal title in Henry and [Susie].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In <em>Feldstein, </em>the Millers, in 1918 purchased from the trustee of Henry Lammers\u2019s estate two parcels identified as 3904 and 3906 Eastern Avenue, which were burdened with a ten foot wide easement. That same year, the Habersacks pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>chased from the trustee two parcels identified as 3908 and 3910 Eastern Avenue, which were benefited by the easement. The Habersacks leased 3910 Eastern Avenue to the Crouchers. With permission of the Millers, the Habersacks and the Crouchers used more than the ten foot easement area. The Millers, in 1944, conveyed 3904 and 3906 Eastern Avenue to the Segalls, and, in 1946, the Habersacks conveyed 3908 and 3910 Eastern Avenue to the Feldsteins. The Feldsteins claimed a prescriptive easement based on the Habersacks\u2019 and the Crouchers\u2019 use of land outside of the designated easement, and argued \u201cthat in determining whether or not they have established a widened right of way by prescription, their own use since 1946 may be tacked to the use by their predecessors in title, Habersack and Croucher----\u201d 198 Md. at 294, 81 A.2d 610. The Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">[w]e <em>do not find it necessary to pass upon this contention. </em>If Habersack and Croucher, at the time of their deed to plaintiffs, had by prescription acquired a consummate right of way, their deed, and the appurtenance clause in it, is sufficient to convey such a right of way. If at the time of their deed, they had not acquired a prescriptive right of way, tacking plaintiffs\u2019 use from January, 1946 to September, 1947 would not establish such a right of way. If the evidence does not show adverse, exclusive and continuous use for twenty years before January, 1946, then there is no evidence to show such use for twenty years before September, 1947.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 294-95, 81 A.2d 610 (emphasis added). The Court held that the Habersacks and the Crouchers\u2014and thus the Feldsteins\u2014had not acquired a prescriptive easement because the original use of the expanded area was permissive, and thus the subsequent use by the Feldsteins was presumed to be permissive as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Banks,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Hungerford, </em>and <em>Feldstein </em>did not expressly address whether the transfer of the dominant or servient estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>or both, would convert a permissive use into an adverse use.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Banks </em>and <em>Feldstein </em>the original licensees and licensors did not transfer their properties <em>during the relevant twenty year period, </em>and in <em>Hungerford </em>there was no transfer at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\u201cThe distinction between an easement and a mere license to use land is clear. While an easement implies an interest in land, a license is merely a personal privilege to do some particular act or series of acts on land without possessing any estate or interest therein.\u201d <em>Condry v. Laurie, </em>184 Md. 317, 320, 41 A.2d 66 (1945) (citations omitted). A license may be revoked expressly, \u201cat the pleasure of the party making it,\u201d <em>Rau v.

Even if, as SMHS contends, these statements are dicta in <em>Rau </em>and <em>Zimmerman, </em>the implicit revocation of a license upon the sale of the servient or dominant property, or both, is a well-established rule in Maryland. <em>See Shipley v.

Of these, some have found that the conveyance of the <em>servient </em>property triggers a presumption. <em>See First Nat\u2019l Bank v.

On the other hand there is no great hardship in a rule that requires a purchaser of land to take notice of any possession or use of it by a stranger. He is put upon inquiry as to the character and extent of the use, and if he fails to make it and act if necessary, he cannot complain if the user, after a period of years, acquires permanent rights in his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>In Pennsylvania, conveyance of <em>either </em>estate will trigger the presumption of adverse use. <em>See Orth v.

While recognizing an implicit revocation of a license upon the sale of either estate as a well-established rule, <em>see </em>1219-20 Herbert T. Tiffany, The Law of Real Property, \u00a7 349 (enlarged ed.1920), these states hold that the presumption of <em>permissive </em>use continues so long as the servient estate is used as it was before by the original licensee, sometimes referring to it as an implicit continuation of the license. <em>See, e.g., Cooper v.

We do not believe that an owner who gives his neighbor permission to use his land should be required to monitor any and all transfers of his neighbor\u2019s estate to insure that his permission is not extinguished. Many kinds of transfers will give no notice to the world. For example, if the neighbor transfers title but remains in residence, even a vigilant owner of the servient estate may have no knowledge of the transfer. One who grants permission to his neighbor should not be required to question the status of his neighbor\u2019s title in order to make sure that his permission has not been terminated and a potentially adverse use created by operation of law.... [T]he rule should protect and encourage the person granting the permission. He is not well served by a rule that may effectively withdraw the permission without his knowledge, and cause him to lose his property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>Miller v. Anderson, </em>91 Wash.App. 822, 830-31, 964 P.2d 365 (1998). Similarly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">[t]he law encourages acts of neighborly courtesy. An adverse claimant must provide notice of hostility sufficient to warn the servient owner that the latter\u2019s property rights are at risk. A new [dominant estate] owner may not simply assume that an appurtenant easement has been acquired with the property, but must determine the state of his title. This policy favors amicable relations between neighbors by requiring that the claimant establish repudiation of permission. Anything less would either discourage generosity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>between neighbors or force the owner of the servient estate to repeatedly reaffirm the permission at any hint of hostility or an adverse claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><em>Branson v.
