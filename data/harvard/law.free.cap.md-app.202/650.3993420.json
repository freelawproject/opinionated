Campbell &amp; Company, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cthe Campbell Company\u201d) buildings, became frustrated with the Campbell Company\u2019s lack of responsiveness to his concerns and sought to mediate those issues with the Campbell Company. The mediation was unsuccessful. Based on events arising from the mediation, Scarlett filed a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Human Relations (\u201cthe Commission\u201d), alleging that the Campbell Company had discriminated against Scarlett by holding the mediation at a wheelchair inaccessible location.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">After an eventful history before an Administrative Law Judge and the Commission\u2019s appeal board, this matter was heard by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on the Campbell Company\u2019s petition for judicial review. On April 6, 2010, the circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s final decision, which ordered the Campbell Company to pay $7,500 in damages and $5,000 as a civil penalty. On July 27, 2010, the circuit court granted the Commission\u2019s petition for judicial enforcement and entered judgment against the Campbell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Company for $7,500 in damages and $5,000 as a civil penalty. The Campbell Company timely appealed both circuit court decisions, and we ordered that the appeals be consolidated. The Campbell Company presents the following questions for our review, which we quote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">1. Does 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9)[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>J require that a reasonable accommodation be made where none has been requested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">2. Was the Campbell Company\u2019s participation\u2014as one of the two disputants\u2014a \u201cpractice\u201d or \u201cservice\u201d within the ambit of 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) requires a request before there can be a refusal to provide a reasonable accommodation, and, therefore, we do not reach the Campbell Company\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">FACTUAL AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Austin Scarlett lived in Greenhill Housing, a federally subsidized apartment complex in Baltimore City. He suffered from several maladies, including hypertension, depression, morbid obesity, and diabetes, the last of which necessitated the amputation of his left leg above the knee. As a result, Scarlett used a motorized wheelchair for mobility, and the facilities at Greenhill Housing were fully accessible to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">The Campbell Company managed Greenhill Housing, in addition to approximately 110 other apartment and condominium complexes. R. Bruce Campbell was the president, chair, and chief executive officer of the Campbell Company. Frank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Stromyer was a vice president of the Campbell Company and local site manager of Greenhill Housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Scarlett had several conflicts with his neighbors in Greenhill Housing, including an 80-year-old woman who lived directly above his apartment. Scarlett complained that the woman\u2019s doors squeaked loudly, yet nothing was done to address the issue. Eventually, the issues with the woman upstairs escalated, and she refused to address the squeaky doors or allow Greenhill Housing into her apartment to repair them. She even resorted to slamming the doors in her apartment at night, knowing that it would disturb Scarlett. Scarlett believed he was being discriminated against because he was in a wheelchair.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Scarlett met with Stromyer on at least three occasions at Greenhill Housing to discuss Scarlett\u2019s complaints. Stromyer met with the woman upstairs and sent her several letters, but the issues remained unresolved. Scarlett then contacted the Baltimore City Community Relations Commission (\u201cBCCRC\u201d) to mediate and resolve the dispute between Scarlett and Greenhill Housing. BCCRC referred Scarlett\u2019s case to Wanda M. Belle, who was a graduate student in negotiation and conflict management at the University of Baltimore and was interning at BCCRC as a volunteer mediator. Scarlett advised Belle that he preferred to conduct the mediation at Greenhill Housing because it was convenient for him. Belle sent a letter to Campbell, inviting him to mediate Scarlett\u2019s complaints through BCCRC. Belle sent the letter to the Campbell Company\u2019s office on Meridene Road, which was fully handicapped accessible. The Campbell Company advised that Stromyer, but not Campbell, would mediate with Scarlett. Scarlett only wanted to mediate with Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Campbell later agreed to attend the mediation if it were held at the Campbell Company\u2019s new office at 6212 York Road (\u201cthe Campbell Building\u201d) because the paperwork concerning Scarlett\u2019s complaints was there and it was a more neutral location than Greenhill Housing. Belle informed Scarlett that Campbell agreed to mediate Scarlett\u2019s noise and discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>tion complaints, and a meeting was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. on January 23, 2003 at the Campbell Building. At no time during Belle\u2019s communications with Campbell did she ascertain whether Campbell was aware that Scarlett used a wheelchair or that he wanted the mediation to take place at a handicapped accessible location.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Several months before the mediation, Scarlett was among twenty-five to thirty Greenhill Housing tenants who attended a meeting held by Campbell at Greenhill Housing. Scarlett asked Campbell a question from several feet away, and Campbell responded to what he characterized to be a \u201cgood question.\u201d In the month before the scheduled mediation, Scarlett sent Campbell between thirty and fifty e-mails, most of which were copies of e-mails Scarlett previously sent to Stromyer. Campbell received the e-mails and relayed them to Stromyer. Scarlett had never been to the Campbell Building before the mediation, but based on his communications with Belle and Stromyer, he assumed that the building was wheelchair accessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The Campbell Company moved into the Campbell Building about a month and a half before the scheduled mediation. The building had one wheelchair accessible restroom, but not a wheelchair accessible entrance. A few days before the mediation, Stromyer advised Campbell that Scarlett used a wheelchair, and Campbell decided that it was better to proceed with the mediation at the Campbell Building rather than postpone it. Campbell thought that he, his son, and Stromyer would be able to help Scarlett into and out of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Scarlett arrived at the Campbell Building around 5:30 p.m. on January 23, 2003 by Maryland Transit Administration Mobility van. The driver advised that the building was not wheelchair accessible and offered to take Scarlett home after making a stop in nearby Towson. Scarlett had the driver drop him off and approached the steps to the building in his wheelchair. Campbell, his son, and Stromyer hurried out of the building to assist Scarlett enter the building through the rear entrance, which had a three-inch step and a six-inch step. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Scarlett stood up, not asking for assistance, but when Campbell, his son, and Stromyer offered help, Scarlett did not object and hopped up the two steps to the entrance. Scarlett entered the building and stood against the wall with his arms outstretched to keep his balance. Campbell stood nearby. Campbell\u2019s son and Stromyer carried the wheelchair up the steps, and Scarlett got back into it. At the time, Scarlett weighed 335 pounds, and the motorized wheelchair weighed at least 100 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Scarlett, Stromyer, Campbell, Belle, and the co-mediator went to the meeting room and participated in the mediation. The meeting lasted about two hours, but no agreement was reached. After the meeting, Scarlett asked to use the restroom. Stromyer led Scarlett to the nearest restroom, but it was not wheelchair accessible. Scarlett\u2019s wheelchair could not fit through the door, so he got out of his wheelchair and hopped into the restroom. Scarlett used the restroom while Stromyer held the door open. Stromyer was unaware of the existence of a wheelchair accessible restroom in the Campbell Building, and Scarlett did not ask whether there was a wheelchair accessible restroom in the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">After using the restroom, Scarlett maneuvered his wheelchair to the exit, stood up, and was assisted by Campbell and Stromyer so they could bring the wheelchair down the steps. Scarlett hopped down the steps and held on to a car in the parking lot until Stromyer and Campbell brought the wheelchair to him. Scarlett did not complain about the means of entering and exiting the building, nor did he request special accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Scarlett continued to express his concerns to the Campbell Company regarding noise and harassment at Greenhill Housing. Scarlett communicated with representatives from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) and the Commission regarding his complaints with Greenhill Housing and the Campbell Company. On April 11, 2003, Scarlett filed a complaint with the Commission, alleging that the Campbell Company, Campbell, and Stromyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>had discriminated against him and required Mm to mediate at a wheelchair inaccessible location.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">Gregory Logan investigated the matter for the Commission. He visited the Campbell Building on September 30, 2003, at wMch time the entire building, including the entrances and the restrooms, was now wheelchair accessible. The Campbell Company apparently modified the Campbell Building following the mediation. Campbell advised Logan that it was Belle\u2019s idea to hold the mediation at the Campbell Building. Logan prepared a Written Finding of Probable Cause, concluding that the Campbell Company had discriminated against Scarlett on the basis of his disability, in violation of Article 49B. The Written Finding was issued on November 19, 2003 and sent to the parties. Conciliation between the parties failed, and the Commission certified the matter for a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">On August 1, 2005, the Commission filed a Statement of Charges with the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d), naming the Campbell Company, Campbell, and Stromyer as respondents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commission alleged that the respondents engaged in discriminatory housing practices in violation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a) by failing to accommodate Scarlett\u2019s disability and by discriminating against him because of his disability. The Commission sought compensatory damages for Scarlett in an unspecified amount. The Commission also requested that the respondents be ordered to pay a civil penalty of at least $10,000, in addition to costs and attorney\u2019s fees, and be enjoined from any future discrimination against Scarlett based on his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Administrative Law Judge James T. Murray (\u201cALJ Murray\u201d) dismissed Scarlett\u2019s claim for damages in a prehearing ruling concerning the respondents\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. On March 1,2006, ALJ Murray held a public hearing on the remaining claims. On December 14, 2006, ALJ Murray issued a \u201cRecommended Decision,\u201d in which he pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>posed that the charges be dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission appealed ALJ Murray\u2019s decisions to the Commission\u2019s appeal board.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On May 8, 2007, the appeal board heard oral argument at a hearing where the Commission and the respondents were represented by counsel. In its August 23, 2007 order, the appeal board reversed both of ALJ Murray\u2019s decisions and remanded to OAH for further proceedings. The appeal board found that the respondents violated Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) by failing to make reasonable accommodations to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">On October 12, 2007, ALJ Murray held a second hearing and heard testimony concerning Scarlett\u2019s visit to the Campbell Building on January 23, 2003. On February 11, 2008, ALJ Murray issued a \u201cRecommended Decision on Remand,\u201d in which he made findings of fact and concluded that the Campbell Company discriminated against Scarlett at the Campbell Building on January 23, 2003. ALJ Murray recommended that the Commission order the Campbell Company to pay $3,500 to Scarlett for his embarrassment and humiliation as a result of the discrimination. ALJ Murray found that the violation warranted a civil penalty, but did not order a penalty because he applied an erroneous regulation rather than the governing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">On March 10, 2008, the Commission noted an appeal of ALJ Murray\u2019s most recent recommendation. The appeal board heard oral argument and issued a \u201cDecision and Order\u201d dated August 27, 2009. In its order, the appeal board increased the damages amount from $3,500 to $7,500 because the original amount was \u201cinsufficient to compensate Mr. Scarlett for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>significant humiliation and embarrassment he experienced as a result of [the Campbell Company\u2019s] discriminatory conduct.\u201d The appeal board also held that the Campbell Company\u2019s \u201cactions placed Mr. Scarlett\u2019s well-being at risk,\u201d so it ordered the Campbell Company to pay a civil penalty of $5,000 to \u201cfurther a primary goal of civil penalties: to deter others from engaging in discriminatory practices.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">On September 28, 2009, the Campbell Company filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, appealing the finding of liability and damages award in the Commission\u2019s August 27, 2009 order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On April 6, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing, after which it dismissed the Campbell Company\u2019s petition and affirmed the Commission\u2019s order. On February 24, 2010, while the Campbell Company\u2019s petition was still pending, the Commission filed a petition for enforcement of the judgment in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, and on July 27, 2010, the circuit court held a hearing on the Commission\u2019s petition. The court granted the Commission\u2019s petition and entered judgment against the Campbell Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The Campbell Company timely appealed both circuit court decisions, and this Court consolidated the two appeals for review. We will provide additional facts as needed for our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u201cWhen reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, ... we review the agency\u2019s decision directly, not the decision of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>Sci. Applications Int\u2019l Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 192, 950 A.2d 766 (2008). Therefore, our evaluation \u201cis not whether the circuit court erred, but rather whether the administrative agency erred.\u201d <em>Classics Chi, Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>189 Md.App. 695, 705, 985 A.2d 593 (2010) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Our \u201crole in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow\u201d and \u201c \u2018is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005) (quoting <em>United Parcel v.

A court \u201creviewing administrative decisions ... \u2018shall apply the substantial evidence test to the final decisions of an administrative agency, but it must not itself make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Anderson, </em>395 Md. 172, 180-81, 909 A.2d 694 (2006) (quoting <em>Balt. Lutheran High Sch. Ass\u2019n v. Emp\u2019t Sec. Admin., </em>302 Md. 649, 662, 490 A.2d 701 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\u201cWe must also review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to the agency since decisions of administrative agencies are <em>prima facie </em>correct[ ] ... and carry with them the presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Moreover, \u201cnot only is it the province of the agency to resolve conflicting evidence, but where inconsistent inferences from the same evidence can be drawn, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>N.L.R.B. v.

We review questions of fact and mixed questions of law and fact with deference to the agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>decision and presume the decision to be valid. <em>Charles Cnty.

Md. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 534, 554, 870 A.2d 168 (2005)). \u201cDetermining whether an agency\u2019s \u2018conclusions of law\u2019 are correct is always, on judicial review, the court\u2019s prerogative, although we ordinarily respect the agency\u2019s expertise and give weight to its interpretation of a statute that it administers.\u201d <em>Christopher v. Montgomery Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>381 Md. 188, 198, 849 A.2d 46 (2004) (citations omitted); <em>see also Md.

Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)) (\u201c \u2018Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u2019 \u201d),</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Nevertheless, \u201c[[Interpretation of a statute is a question of law,\u201d so we review the agency\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>395 Md. at 181, 909 A.2d 694 (citing <em>Salamon v. Progressive Classic Ins. Co., </em>379 Md. 301, 307, 841 A.2d 858 (2004)). Accordingly, even though the circuit court did not review the Commission\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>as to potential errors of law, we will do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">The record reflects that Scarlett never asked the Campbell Company for any special accommodation. Neither Scarlett nor Belle requested a reasonable accommodation for Scarlett\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>wheelchair prior to the meeting at the Campbell Building. Scarlett never requested a special accommodation when he arrived at the Campbell Building and saw the lack of a handicapped accessible entrance. He did not ask whether there was a wheelchair accessible restroom, even after Stromyer, who was unaware of the existence of a handicapped accessible restroom in the Campbell Building, showed Scarlett to an inaccessible one. Finally, Scarlett did not ask for an accommodation when he exited the Campbell Building.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">To establish that the Campbell Company was aware of Scarlett\u2019s use of a wheelchair, the Commission points to the question-and-answer forum at Greenhill Housing, during which Campbell interacted with Scarlett, and Stromyer advising Campbell a few days prior to the meeting that Scarlett used a wheelchair. Although Campbell may have been aware that Scarlett used a wheelchair, it appears that neither Scarlett nor Belle asked Campbell, Stromyer, or the Campbell Company for any special accommodation for the January 23,2003 meeting. Thus, the issue posed by the Campbell Company, which is an issue of first impression for Maryland courts, is whether there must be a prior request for an accommodation before there can be a refusal in violation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9). According to the Campbell Company, because Scarlett never requested an accommodation, it could not refuse to provide the same in violation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">To determine whether the Campbell Company violated Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9), we must first determine what it prohibits. Article 49B \u00a7 22(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-7\">(a) <em>Unlawful practice concerning sale or rental of dwell</em>ing.\u2014Except as provided in \u00a7 21 of this subtitle, it is unlawful:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">(9) To refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services when the accommodations may be necessary to afford an individual with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>disability equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Our analysis centers on the statutory interpretation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9), specifically the word \u201crefuse.\u201d Our goal when undertaking to interpret a statute is \u201cto ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Mayor of Balt. City, </em>387 Md. 1, 11, 874 A.2d 439 (2005); <em>O\u2019Connor v. Balt. Cnty., </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191 (2004). The Court of Appeals has explained that \u201c \u2018[t]o determine that purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>395 Md. at 182, 909 A.2d 694 (quoting <em>State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 13, 702 A.2d 690 (1997); <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994)).

This is because \u201c[w]hen the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Marriott Emp. Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997). A court must not \u201cadd or delete language so as to \u2018reflect an intent not evidenced in that language\u2019 or construe the statute with \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin, v.

The legislature enacted Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) with the \u201cpurpose of altering the laws prohibiting discriminatory housing practices to include the provisions of the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988\u201d and \u201cto prohibit[] discriminatory housing practices in a manner substantially equivalent or similar to the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988.\u201d Chapter 571 of the 1991 Acts. \u201c \u2018[W]here the purpose and language of a federal statute are substantially the same as that of a later state statute, interpretations of the federal statute are ordinarily persuasive.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montgomery v.

Moreover, when \u201cthe provisions are so similar and ... the common intent behind them is so clear, we may and should be guided by the case law interpretation of the Federal statute when we examine the State analog.... \u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>77 Md.App. 237, 247, 549 A.2d 1171 (1988).

The First Circuit summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIk\">To establish a prima facie case of failure to accommodate under the FHAA, a claimant must show that he is handicapped within the purview of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602(h)[,] ... that the party charged knew or should reasonably have known of his handicap ...[,] [and] <em>that he requested a particular accommodation </em>that is both reasonable and necessary to allow him an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the housing in question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-6\"><em>Astralis Condo.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized the requirements for a FHA violation and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Under the Fair Housing Act, a landlord \u201cis only obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation\u201d to a tenant <em>\u201cif a request for the accommodation ha,s been made.\u201d </em>A tenant who requests a \u201creasonable accommodation,\u201d moreover, should \u201cmake clear[ ]\u201d to the landlord that \u201cshe is requesting an exception, change, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service because of her disability.\u201d And \u201cshe should explain what type of accommodation she is requesting.\u201d On the other hand, the Fair Housing Act \u201cdoes not require that a request be made in a particular manner.\u201d Even more importantly, the tenant\u2019s failure to make clear in her initial request \u201cwhat type of accommodation she is requesting\u201d is not fatal. According to applicable case law, including an administrative adjudication by HUD itself, once the tenant requests a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d (or, without using those exact words, requests an accommodation for a disability) the landlord is obliged under the Fair Housing Act to respond promptly. If the request is not sufficiently detailed to reveal the nature of that request, the Act\u2014as properly interpreted\u2014requires the landlord to \u201copen a dialogue\u201d with the tenant, eliciting more information as needed, to determine what specifics the tenant has in mind and whether such accommodation would, in fact, be reasonable under the circumstances. Any delay from the landlord\u2019s failure to respond promptly to the tenant\u2019s request may become the landlord\u2019s responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><em>Douglas, </em>884 A.2d at 1122-23 (quoting HUD &amp; Department of Justice Joint Statement on Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act, May 17, 2004, <em>available at </em>http:// www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/library/huddojstatement.pdf, at 10-11) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">HUD and the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) are both authorized to enforce the FHA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3612, 3614. HUD and DOJ issued a Joint Statement \u201cregarding the rights and obligations of persons with disabilities and housing providers under the [Fair Housing] Act relating to reasonable accommodations.\u201d The Joint Statement asks and answers a series of questions to guide persons with disabilities. Ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tion 14 poses: \u201cIs a housing provider obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation to a resident or applicant if an accommodation has not been requested?\u201d HUD and DOJ answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><em>No. A housing provider is only obligated to provide a reasonable accommodation to a resident or applicant if a request for an accommodation has been made. </em>A provider has notice that a reasonable accommodation request has been made if a person, her family member, or someone acting on her behalf requests a change, exception, or adjustment to a rule, policy, practice, or service because of a disability, even if the words \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d are not used as part of the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">HUD &amp; DOJ Joint Statement on Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act, May 17, 2004, at 11 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The Commission cites no case law in support of its contention that mere knowledge of a handicap satisfies the requirements of the FHAA or the Maryland equivalent in Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9). Instead, it cites its own administrative decisions in this very matter and urges this Court to limit our review. Even though an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute the agency is charged with enforcing is entitled to deference, that deference is not limitless. <em>See Classics Chi., </em>189 Md.App. at 706-07, 985 A.2d 593. Therefore, we hold that the Campbell Company could not violate Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) in the absence of an underlying request for a reasonable accommodation. <em>See Schwarz, </em>544 F.3d at 1219 (\u201c[A] plaintiff must actually request an accommodation and be refused in order to bring a reasonable accommodation claim under the FHA,\u201d and a lack of a underlying request is \u201cfatal to the claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The Commission argues that the plain meaning of \u201crefuse\u201d contravenes the purpose of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9)\u2014to ensure access for disabled individuals. While this is certainly a worthwhile purpose, the statute also states that it is to be \u201csubstantially equivalent or similar to the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,\u201d which requires a request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>there to be a refusal. Chapter 571 of the 1991 Acts. The use of the word \u201crefuse\u201d and not \u201cfail,\u201d \u201cwithhold,\u201d \u201cdeny,\u201d or a similar word in Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) is controlling because \u201cno matter how much expertise [an agency] had, it could not trump ... [t]he plain meaning of the statute\u201d when the language is not ambiguous. <em>Adventist Health Care Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 125, 896 A.2d 320 (2006). We hold that \u201crefuse\u201d is not ambiguous, even though the Commission used \u201crefuse\u201d and \u201cfail\u201d interchangeably in its decisions and arguments. As such, because neither Scarlett nor anyone on his behalf ever requested a reasonable accommodation from the Campbell Company, the Campbell Company could not have refused to make a reasonable accommodation in violation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Even if we found the language to be ambiguous and the legislative intent unclear, we would not find the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) to be convincing. \u201cThe weight given an agency\u2019s construction ... depends on several factors,\u201d including \u201cthe duration and consistency of the administrative practice\u201d and \u201cthe degree to which the agency\u2019s construction was made known to the public.\u201d <em>Marriott Emps. Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 445, 697 A.2d 455 (1997); <em>see also INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 446 n. 30, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (quoting <em>Watt v. Alaska, </em>451 U.S. 259, 273, 101 S.Ct. 1673, 68 L.Ed.2d 80 (1981)) (\u201cAn agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency\u2019s earlier interpretation is \u2018entitled to considerably less deference\u2019 than a consistently held agency view.\u201d). This case presents the Commission\u2019s first opportunity to construe Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) to prohibit the failure to make an unrequested accommodation, and the public has not been apprised of the statute\u2019s implications. As such, we give little deference to the Commission\u2019s broadening of the scope of the definition of \u201crefuse.\u201d Moreover, in light of the legislative intent to conform to the federal FHAA and the overwhelming persuasive authority based on the federal FHAA and similar state laws, we hold that \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>refuse to make reasonable accommodations\u201d requires an underlying request.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Commission argues that a request would have been \u201cpointless,\u201d but based on the facts presented, the Campbell Company appeared willing to work with Scarlett to resolve his concerns and help him access the building. Accordingly, we cannot say that had Scarlett made a request for an accommodation, that the request would have been \u201cpointless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">While we certainly do not condone certain actions on the part of the Campbell Company or find favor with the Campbell Building\u2019s lack of accessibility at the time of the mediation, we are limited to the statutory language of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9), under which the Commission brought a violation against the Campbell Company. The statutory language of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9) requires a \u201crefusal.\u201d Since there was no request made of the Campbell Company, it could not refuse in violation of Article 49B \u00a7 22(a)(9). Based on this conclusion, we need not reach the Campbell Company\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.
