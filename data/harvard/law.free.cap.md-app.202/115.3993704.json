After a jury found in favor of Tinsley and awarded her damages, WMATA noted this appeal, presenting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>three issues,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one of which is whether Tinsley\u2019s suit was barred by governmental immunity. Because we hold that it was so barred, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court. As that decision, in effect, concludes this litigation, we do not reach either of the other two issues raised by WMATA.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">At about 4:45 p.m. on December 19, 2007, Tinsley lost her footing on a train platform at the Metrorail stop in Cheverly, Maryland, and fractured her right ankle. At trial, Tinsley testified that, when she arrived by train at the station, the entire floor of the platform was wet. Upon leaving the train, she did not see any warning cones, but, nonetheless, walked carefully toward the elevator. As she neared the elevator, she saw a \u201cwet floor sign that was tucked back by the side of the elevator.\u201d Then, finding the elevator out of service, she walked towards the escalator. As she did, her left foot slipped out from under her and she fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Tinsley introduced into evidence the redacted videotaped deposition of Francis Mullen, an architect accepted by the court \u201cas an expert in the area of architecture and safety.\u201d Mullen deponed that, based on \u201cdeposition testimony\u201d\u2014whose testimony he did not specify\u2014\u201cthe platforms are supposed to be cleaned after 7 o\u2019clock when the peak period is over for the day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Then, relying on climatological records from the United States Department of Commerce for Dulles International Airport, Mullen noted that the weather on the day of the accident was cloudy, with a dewpoint around 23 degrees Fahrenheit, air temperature ranging from 30 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, an average relative humidity of 70 per cent, and with no precip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>itation. The platform could not have therefore been wet, he opined, as the result of condensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Mullen then described a test he conducted at the train platform in Cheverly, using the cleaning agent \u201cSuper Shine-All,\u201d a product WMATA used to clean its train platforms. He began by measuring the floor\u2019s slip resistance at three different locations in proximity to where Tinsley fell. At each location, he measured slip resistance on a part of the floor which was dry, on a part of the floor which was wet with water only, and on a part of the floor which was wet with a mixture of water and Super Shine-All. After explaining that the greater the coefficient of friction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the more slip-resistant the surface is, he said that the test revealed a coefficient of friction ranging from 0.25 to 0.3, where the floor \u201cwas wet with the solution of Super Shine-All diluted as the manufacturer says to dilute it\u201d; to \u201cclose ... to .5,\u201d where the floor was wet with only water; and to \u201cslightly below. 8,\u201d where the floor was dry. Mullen said that a coefficient of friction of 0.5 was a minimum safe standard for floors where people were expected to walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Before applying the Super Shine-All for that test, Mullen diluted it with water, as directed by the manufacturer. He then applied it to the floor with a damp mop so as to \u201ccreate a thin film of liquid on the floor.\u201d While the floor was still wet, he measured the floor\u2019s slip resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Although he applied the mixture of Super Shine-All and water with a mop and not a cleaning machine, as WMATA routinely does, he maintained that it was \u201cnot necessary\u201d to do so. When pressed with the fact that the cleaning machine applies suction to the floor to remove much or most of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>water from the floor as it is being cleaned, Mullen countered that it \u201capparently doesn\u2019t vacuum all of the liquid off of the floor because all of the accounts say that it was entirely wet\u201d when Tinsley fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In addition to Mullen, Tinsley called several WMATA employees to testify during the presentation of her case-in-chief; among them were Michael Myrick, Linwood Vaughn, and Barbara London. Michael Myrick, a custodian, testified that, while working the 3:00 to 11:30 p.m. shift, he would spot clean the floor, including the floor at Cheverly, using a mop and bucket. He said that there were no time restrictions on when he was allowed to mop the floor and that Super Shine-All is \u201cone of the products that [he] use[s] in a mop and bucket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Linwood Vaughn, a cleaning machine operator, testified that, during his training, he was told that he was supposed to clean the platforms \u201cafter rush hour.\u201d His practice was to clean the platform, including the one at Cheverly, using the machine and Super Shine-All. He used a mop and bucket only to \u201ccut corners,\u201d that is, to clean floor areas that are inaccessible to the cleaning machine. If, however, there was \u201ca water problem or something, you could run [the machine] any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Barbara London, the Station Manager, testified regarding periodic inspections she made to monitor for any safety problems. Her checklist for the day of the accident indicated that she had performed inspections at 1:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. At no time did she observe any problems such as water leaks or broken pipes.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">At the close of Tinsley\u2019s case, WMATA moved for judgment, contending, among other things, that \u201chow it cleans its platforms and with what products or mechanisms it cleans its platforms, is something for which it\u2019s immune from suit.\u201d The circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">After reading the deposition of its medical expert into the record, WMATA called two witnesses: Freddie Ross, Assistant Superintendent and Cleaning Manager for WMATA, who supervises the Blue and Orange Lines, which includes the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Tinsley was riding the day of her injury; and Barbara London, who had previously been called to testify by Tinsley.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Ross testified that machine operators and custodians, in using a mop and bucket, are not restricted only to certain areas, but, rather, may use a mop and bucket anywhere on a train platform. He further stated that there was no time limitation as to when they could run the cleaning machine. London testified that, on the day of the accident, the weather was \u201csort of misty\u201d and that there was condensation on the platform but conceded that she did not know why the platform was wet. At the conclusion of her testimony, WMATA renewed its motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">After denying that motion, too, the trial court permitted the case to go to the jury, which found in favor of Tinsley, awarding $64,213.78 in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">WMATA contends that Tinsley\u2019s claim was barred by sovereign immunity because the actions of its employees and agents, in maintaining its station, are shielded by that immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We begin our analysis with the observation that, because the signatories to the WMATA Compact\u2014Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia\u2014conferred their respective sovereign immunities upon WMATA, <em>Morris v. WMATA </em>781 F.2d 218, 219 (D.C.Cir.1986), this \u201cinter-jurisdictional compact agenc[y]\u201d is cloaked in sovereign immunity. <em>Proctor v. WMATA </em>412 Md. 691, 708, 990 A.2d 1048 (2010). To determine the extent of that immunity, we look to section 80 of the WMATA Compact, a provision enacted to provide a \u201cuniform treatment of WMATA\u201d as \u201cthe signatories had differing rules on governmental immunity.\u201d <em>Martin v. WMATA </em>667 F.2d 435, 436 (4th Cir.1981) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">Section 80 of the WMATA Compact limns the extent to which WMATA has waived its sovereign immunity, Proctor; 412 Md. at 725, 990 A.2d 1048, by drawing a distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>between what it calls a \u201cgovernmental function\u201d and what it labels a \u201cproprietary function.\u201d Actions committed in the service of the former are protected by sovereign immunity, but those performed in the service of the latter are not.</p>\n<p id=\"A9Y\">Specifically, section 80 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">The Authority shall be liable for its contracts and for its torts and those of its directors, officers, employees and agents committed in the conduct of any <em>proprietary function, </em>in accordance with the law of the applicable signatory (including rules on conflict of laws), <em>but shall not be liable for any torts occurring in the performance of a governmental junction. </em>The exclusive remedy for such breach of contracts and torts for which the Authority shall be liable, as herein provided, shall be by suit against the Authority. Nothing contained in this title shall be construed as a waiver by the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and the counties and cities within the zone of any immunity from suit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Because Congress consented to the creation of WMA-TA by statutory enactment, Pub.L. No. 89-774, 80 Stat. 1324 (1966), and \u201ccongressional consent transforms an interstate compact within [the Compact] Clause into a law of the United States,\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Adams, </em>449 U.S. 433, 438, 101 S.Ct. 703, 66 L.Ed.2d 641 (1981),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> interpretation of the WMATA Compact and, of course, this provision, is a question of federal law. <em>Sanders v. WMATA </em>819 F.2d 1151, 1154 (D.C.Cir.1987); <em>accord Proctor, </em>412 Md. at 707, 990 A.2d 1048. That is, it is federal, not state, law which governs our determination of \u201cwhether the function in question is \u2018governmental\u2019 or \u2018proprietary\u2019 under\u201d section 80. <em>Sanders, </em>819 F.2d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">As there are no Supreme Court decisions interpreting either section 80 or, for that matter, any other provision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>WMATA Compact, for guidance, we look to decisions of the \u201cfederal circuits most likely to hear cases in which WMATA is a party,\u201d that is, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. <em>Lizzi v. Alexander, </em>255 F.3d 128, 134 (4th Cir.2001), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Nev. Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs, </em>538 U.S. 721, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">To deal with the difficulty in determining whether a particular act occurs in the performance of a governmental or proprietary function, a difficulty which the Supreme Court has characterized as a \u201cquagmire,\u201d <em>Indian Towing Co. v. United States, </em>350 U.S. 61, 65, 76 S.Ct. 122, 100 L.Ed. 48 (1955), those federal circuits have sidestepped the problem by crafting a two-part test. <em>Smith v. WMATA </em>290 F.3d 201, 206 (4th Cir.2002); <em>Dant v. District of Columbia, </em>829 F.2d 69, 74 (D.C.Cir.1987). Under this judicially created test, which is not to be found in any federal or state statute, a court first determines whether the challenged activity occurs in the performance of a \u201cquintessential governmental function,\u201d in other words, functions that involve \u201cobviously public activities,\u201d <em>Beebe v. WMATA </em>129 F.3d 1283, 1287 (D.C.Cir.1997), such as law enforcement, <em>Dant, </em>829 F.2d at 74; <em>Morris, </em>781 F.2d at 220, or the creation of a public transportation system. <em>McKethean v. WMATA </em>588 A.2d 708, 714 (D.C.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">If so, then governmental immunity applies; if not, the court must decide whether the governmental activity at issue is discretionary. If it is not discretionary, as where a \u201cstatute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,\u201d <em>Berkovitz v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988), the activity is \u201cministerial\u201d and not protected by governmental immunity. If, on the other hand, the activity is \u201cdiscretionary,\u201d the court must decide whether it falls within what the Supreme Court has termed the \u201cexception for discretionary governmental functions,\u201d <em>United States v. Varig Airlines, </em>467 U.S. 797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660 (1984), commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>referred to, by the federal appellate courts, as the \u201cdiscretionary function exception.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the discretionary function exception applies to the challenged activity, then that activity, like activity falling within a quintessential governmental function, \u201cconstitute^ [a] \u2018governmental\u2019 activity] within the meaning of the \u2018governmental/proprietary\u2019 test\u201d of section 80 of the WMATA Compact, <em>Smith, </em>290 F.3d at 207, and is thus shielded from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The term \u201cdiscretionary function exception\u201d may prove puzzling as it quite naturally invokes the question: \u201cException to what?\u201d To answer that question, we need to explain that this category of immunity was first articulated, by federal courts, in an entirely different statutory context, that is, in the setting of the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). While, under section 1346(b) of the FTCA, the federal government waives its sovereign immunity as to \u201ccivil actions ... for money damages ... for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant,\u201d it retains its sovereign immunity for what it designates as \u201cExceptions\u201d under section 2680(a) of that Act. Those \u201cExceptions\u201d are, among other things, \u201cacts of <em>discretion </em>in the performance of <em>governmental functions </em>or duty \u2018whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dalehite v. United States, </em>346 U.S. 15, 33, 73 S.Ct. 956, 97 L.Ed. 1427 (1953) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) of the FTCA) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Because section 2680(a) is entitled \u201cExceptions,\u201d that is, instances not affected by the general waiver of tort liability set forth in section 1346(b) of the FTCA, the federal courts, limning the boundaries of sovereign immunity under the FTCA, have universally used the term \u201cdiscretionary function exception,\u201d a reference to section 2680(a), when a governmental function is immune from tort liability under the FTCA. Later, the federal courts adopted the same term in defining the contours of immunity under the WMATA Compact, even though it has no comparable section labeled \u201cExceptions.\u201d In other words, the federal appellate courts have incorporated the discretionary function exception of the FTCA into section 80 of the WMATA Compact for purposes of defining the boundaries of governmental immunity. <em>Dant, </em>829 F.2d at 74; <em>accord Smith, </em>290 F.3d at 207. Because they use this term, so shall we to avoid inconsistent language in federal and state caselaw, which would no doubt create more confusion than the phrase itself already has. <em>See, e.g., Smith, </em>290 F.3d at 207 &amp; n. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">A governmental act falls within the discretionary function exception if it \u201cregularly requires judgment as to which of a range of permissible courses is the wisest.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991). As to such acts, WMATA \u201cis immune from any claim, \u2018however negligently caused, that affect[s] the governmental functions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>290 F.3d at 207 (quoting <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 32, 73 S.Ct. 956).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In further determining the contours of the discretionary function exception, the Supreme Court has said that \u201cit is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>nature of the conduct, rather than the status of the actor, that governs ... in a given case.\u201d <em>Varig Airlines, </em>467 U.S. at 813, 104 S.Ct. 2755. And, \u201c[i]n examining the nature of the challenged conduct, a court must first consider whether the action is a matter of choice for the acting employee,\u201d as \u201cconduct cannot be discretionary unless it involves an element of judgment or choice.\u201d <em>Berkovitz, </em>486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954. Indeed, if a \u201cfederal statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow,\u201d then that conduct is not discretionary, because \u201cthe employee has no rightful option but to adhere to the directive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If, on the other hand, \u201cthe challenged conduct involves an element of judgment, a court must determine whether that judgment is of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d that is, \u201cgovernmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536-37, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">But the discretionary function exception, as expounded by the Supreme Court, encompasses \u201cmore than the initiation of programs and activities.\u201d <em>Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 35, 73 S.Ct. 956. \u201cIt also includes determinations made by executives or administrators in establishing plans, specifications or schedules of operations,\u201d as well as the \u201cacts of subordinates in carrying out the operations of government in accordance with official directions\u201d because, otherwise, \u201cthe protection of \u00a7 2680(a) [of the FTCA] would fail at the time it would be needed, that is, when a subordinate performs or fails to perform a causal step, each action or nonaction being directed by the superior, exercising, perhaps abusing, discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 73 S.Ct. 956.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>There are, however, \u201cdiscretionary acts performed by a Government agent that are within the scope of his employment but not within the discretionary function exception.... \u201d <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 325 n. 7, 111 S.Ct. 1267. Those acts are not immune to tort liability because, as the Supreme Court explained, they \u201ccannot be said to be based on the purposes that the regulatory regime seeks to accomplish.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">To illustrate that point, the Supreme Court later gave the following example of such a discretionary act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">If one of the officials involved in this case drove an automobile on a mission connected with his official duties and negligently collided with another car, the [discretionary function] exception would not apply. Although driving requires the constant exercise of discretion, the official\u2019s decisions in exercising that discretion can hardly be said to be grounded in regulatory policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\"><em>Id. See also Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 28, 73 S.Ct. 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Thus, not all discretionary acts performed by governmental actors fall within the discretionary function exception and are thereby shielded from tort liability. <em>Berkovitz, </em>486 U.S. at 537, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Although, as previously noted, there are no Supreme Court decisions interpreting the WMATA Compact, several of its decisions interpreting the FTCA are relevant to our analysis, given that federal case law has engrafted the discretionary function exception of the FTCA onto the WMATA Compact. Two such cases are <em>United States v. Gaubert, supra, </em>499 U.S. 315, 111 S.Ct. 1267, 113 L.Ed.2d 335, which discusses where the discretionary function exception applies, and <em>Berkovitz v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>United States, supra, </em>486 U.S. 531, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531, which discusses where it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">In <em>Gaubert, </em>the Supreme Court held that Federal Home Loan Bank regulators, accused of negligently supervising a savings and loan association that subsequently became insolvent, enjoyed governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In so holding, the Supreme Court examined the governing federal regulatory scheme and determined that the \u201cagencies ... were not bound to act in a particular way.\u201d 499 U.S. at 329, 111 S.Ct. 1267. Rather, \u201cthe exercise of their authority,\u201d observed the Court, \u201cinvolved a great \u2018element of judgment or choice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Berkovitz, </em>486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954.). In fact, because \u201cthere [was] no statutory or regulatory mandate which compelled the regulators to act in a particular way,\u201d nor was there any \u201cprohibition against the use of supervisory mechanisms not specifically set forth in statute or regulation,\u201d <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 330, 111 S.Ct. 1267, the Court was \u201cconvinced that each of the regulatory actions in question involved the kind of policy judgment that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 332, 111 S.Ct. 1267, that is, \u201cthe exercise of discretion in furtherance of public policy goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334, 111 S.Ct. 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">On the other hand, in <em>Berkovitz, </em>the Supreme Court reached a contrary conclusion, though one not inconsistent with <em>Gaubert. </em>In that case, a two-month-old child contracted a severe case of polio, after ingesting an oral vaccine that had been approved by Federal agencies. The child and his parents brought suit, under the FTC A, alleging that the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Division of Biologic Standards had wrongfully licensed the vaccine manufacturer to produce the vaccine at issue and that the Bureau of Biologies of the Food and Drug Administration had acted wrongfully in approving for release to the public the particular lot of vaccine from which the defective dose had been obtained. Both agencies, the plaintiffs claimed, \u201cviolated federal law ... regarding the inspection and approval of polio vaccines.\u201d 486 U.S. at 533, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In rejecting the Government\u2019s claim that the suit should be dismissed because the actions taken by the two agencies fell within the discretionary function exception, the Supreme Court first noted: \u201cThe discretionary function exception applies only to conduct that involves the permissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 108 S.Ct. 1954. As a result, \u201c[w'jhen a suit,\u201d as in that case, \u201ccharges an agency with failing to act in accord with a specific mandatory directive, the discretionary function exception does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">As for the claim alleging wrongdoing in releasing the vaccine lots, the Supreme Court examined the regulatory scheme and determined that it may have left \u201cno room for implementing officials to exercise independent policy judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547, 108 S.Ct. 1954. If that characterization of the regulatory scheme were true, the claim would not be barred by the discretionary function exception, the Court pointed out, because it was \u201cdirected at a governmental action that allegedly involved no policy discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the plaintiffs had not proved their factual allegations concerning the regulatory scheme, they were not, the Court observed, required to do so at that stage of the litigation. As further discovery might assist them in doing so, dismissal of their claim, said the Court, was inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 547-48, 108 S.Ct. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Keeping the precepts of <em>Gaubert </em>and <em>Berkovitz </em>in mind, we turn to two recent <em>post-Gaubert </em>appellate decisions involving WMATA and exhibiting fact patterns very similar to the one presented by the instant case. The two cases are: <em>Smith v. WMATA supra, </em>290 F.3d 201, and <em>WMATA v. Barksdale-Showell, </em>965 A.2d 16 (D.C.2009). Both cases applied <em>Gaubert </em>in holding that the discretionary function exception shielded WMATA from tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>Smith, </em>the earlier of the two cases, involved the Bethesda Metrorail station, which had three escalators. At the time of the injury, two of the escalators were inoperable because of unanticipated equipment malfunctions. One of the two escalators had been declared, by safety inspectors, to be unsafe for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>use, even as a staircase. 290 F.3d at 203-04. During routine maintenance conducted the night before the injury, mechanics discovered a problem involving a second escalator which rendered it \u201cpotentially unsafe ... to operate,\u201d and it, too, was inoperable, as it \u201cwas in a state of disassembly awaiting a replacement part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204. Consequently, the third escalator was placed in a \u201cstationary mode,\u201d to be used as a staircase.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Smith, a Metrorail patron, was climbing that escalator, on a sweltering summer day, when he suffered a fatal heart attack. His estate later brought an action for wrongful death against WMATA. The estate contended, among other things, that WMATA was negligent in its decision to use the only available escalator in \u201cstationary mode\u201d and in choosing not to reassemble, on an emergency basis, one of the two inoperable escalators so that it could be used as a staircase. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The Fourth Circuit held that WMATA was immune from liability under the discretionary function exception in deciding to use the only functioning escalator as a staircase. It observed that, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory mandate specifically governing the situation, \u201c[WMATA] personnel at the Bethesda station were forced to make difficult choices\u201d and that their choice implicated WMATA\u2019s \u201cmission\u2014public transportation\u2014and its ability to fulfill that mission in a safe and efficient manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The Fourth Circuit further held that the discretionary function exception shielded WMATA\u2019s decision not to reassemble the other escalator. Observing that the latter decision was \u201c \u2018susceptible to policy analysis,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Gaubert, supra, </em>499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267), that it was also not governed by any \u201cspecific statutory or regulatory mandate,\u201d and that \u201cthe potential choices implicated the economic policy of [WMATA],\u201d that is, whether it was more cost effective to re-assemble the escalator pending repair, or to leave it disassembled and wait for the replacement parts to arrive, the appellate court declared that, \u201c[e]ven if this decision had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>incorrect, and even if it had constituted an abuse of discretion, it [was], under the circumstances, deserving of immunity protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210 (citing <em>Dalehite, supra, </em>346 U.S. at 33, 73 S.Ct. 956).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The second <em>post-Gaubert </em>decision we regard as instructive is <em>Barksdale-Showell, supra, </em>965 A.2d 16. That case, though decided by a different appellate court, follows the same course and reaches the same destination as the Fourth Circuit did in <em>Smith. </em>In <em>Barksdale-Showell, </em>the plaintiff slipped and fell down a wet escalator at the Anacostia Metrorail station, after which she brought suit against WMATA, on the grounds that WMATA had failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that its floors and escalators remained dry on a wet, snowy day and, furthermore, to warn customers of the hazardous conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s rulings that governmental immunity barred the negligent maintenance and operation claim but not the failure to warn claim. <em>Id. </em>at 18. The District of Columbia appellate court avowed that, under WMATA\u2019s standard operating procedure, \u201cupon encountering a hazard, the employee is vested with a decision of whether the hazard can be rendered safe, how it may be rendered safe, and whether the employee will actually render it safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. It further asserted that the discretion contemplated under the standard operating procedure was \u201c \u2018subject to policy analysis\u2019 and thus discretionary,\u201d because WMATA employees implementing their standard procedure had to balance the operational necessity of ensuring efficient passenger flow through its facilities against the cost and probable ineffectiveness of continual mopping of floors and escalators. <em>Id. </em>at 23 (quoting <em>Gaubert, supra, </em>499 U.S. at 323, 111 S.Ct. 1267).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">As to the negligent failure to warn claim, the District of Columbia court determined that \u201cWMATA\u2019s lack of a policy underlying its decision not to warn [of the potentially slippery conditions] is certainly not the kind of \u2018social, economic, or political\u2019 decision that Congress intended to immunize from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>suit,\u201d and, consequently, it held that the claim was not barred. 965 A.2d at 21 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">We turn now to the instant case. Since it is undisputed that WMATA\u2019s platform cleaning and maintenance is not a \u201cquintessential governmental function,\u201d we proceed directly to the second stage of the analysis and determine whether the actions at issue fall within the discretionary function exception and, therefore, are immune to suit, or whether they fall without that exception and, therefore, are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">As <em>Gaubert </em>instructs, it is immaterial that the WMATA employees alleged to have acted negligently in the case at bar included cleaning and maintenance workers in addition to management. 499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267. As previously noted, \u201c[i]t is the nature of the conduct, rather than the status of the actor, that governs whether the discretionary function exception applies in a given case.\u201d <em>Varig Airlines, supra, </em>467 U.S. at 813, 104 S.Ct. 2755. The nature of the decisions at issue here\u2014whether to clean an entire platform or to spot clean it; whether to clean during rush hour, late at night, or otherwise; whether to use a cleaning machine or a mop and bucket; and finally, which cleaning agent to use\u2014\u201cregularly requires judgment as to which of a range of permissible courses is the wisest.\u201d <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Moreover, this case presents an altogether different fact pattern than <em>Berkovitz. </em>In <em>Berkovitz, </em>the Supreme Court held, as previously discussed, that dismissal of the complaint was improper where it was alleged that government employees, who were duty-bound to follow federal law and regulations, failed to act in conformance with those mandates, and those failures, if proven, would not fall within the discretionary function exception. Here, in contrast, there was no law or directive defining when or how WMATA could clean. Rather, the instant case is similar to <em>Smith, </em>where the Fourth Circuit observed that no statutory or regulatory mandate specifically governed WMATA\u2019s decision as to how most appropriately to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>operate its only functioning escalator and that, consequently, that decision was discretionary. 290 F.3d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Given the absence of an applicable statute or specific mandatory directive, we conclude that WMATA\u2019s employees were performing discretionary acts in deciding at what time the train platforms were to be cleaned, as well as the manner and means used in so doing. Consequently, Tinsley\u2019s challenge is, in effect, to the discretionary acts of WMATA personnel. But, as we have previously explained, those discretionary acts are \u201cof the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield,\u201d <em>Berkovitz, </em>486 U.S. at 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, that is, \u201cconduct that involves the permissible exercise of policy judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539, 108 S.Ct. 1954. And, as in <em>Smith, </em>the exercise of discretion by WMATA\u2019s employees in determining when and how to clean and maintain its facilities is directly related to WMATA\u2019s \u201cmission\u2014public transportation\u2014and its ability to fulfill that mission in a safe and efficient manner.\u201d 290 F.3d at 209. Consequently, the discretionary function exception bars Tinsley\u2019s claim, and it was error to deny WMATA\u2019s motion for judgment. Furthermore, as the <em>Smith </em>Court observed, even if the decision to clean the platforms during business hours was \u201cincorrect\u201d or \u201cconstituted an abuse of discretion,\u201d it still fell within the discretionary function exception. <em>Id. </em>at 210; <em>accord Dalehite, </em>346 U.S. at 33, 73 S.Ct. 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">We now turn to Tinsley\u2019s specific arguments in support of her contention that her claim is not barred by governmental immunity. Framing the matter as \u201ca simple negligence case,\u201d Tinsley insists that there was testimony that WMATA had a policy not to use cleaning machines on its platforms during peak travel times; that the wet platform could not have been caused by weather conditions or water leaks and that, under the circumstances, the only plausible explanation for the wet floor was that a WMATA employee had used a cleaning machine the afternoon of the accident, in violation of its policy, which \u201cdid not give the employees any discretion regarding the timing of cleaning the entire platform area before 7:00 at night.\u201d Hence, under <em>Berkovitz, </em>governmental immunity, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>serts Tinsley, does not shield the behavior of this unknown WMATA maintenance man, who acted in direct violation of WMATA\u2019s policy and proximately caused her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Tinsley claims, in the alternative, that, even if WMATA\u2019s employees were not required to adhere to a rigid maintenance policy, \u201cWMATA presented absolutely no evidence at trial\u201d to support its assertion that \u201cits cleaning decisions were grounded in political, social or economic judgments.\u201d Thus, governmental immunity, asserts Tinsley, does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Finally, Tinsley maintains that WMATA should clean its platforms during the early morning hours when the stations are closed. She contrasts the instant case with <em>WMATA v. Barksdale-Showell, supra, 965 A.2d </em>16, where, as noted previously, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the plaintiffs claim of negligent maintenance and operation was barred by governmental immunity. According to Tinsley, <em>Barksdale-Showell </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the hazardous condition in that case resulted from inclement weather, whereas the hazard, here, \u201carose because WMATA caused the floor to become wet and slippery by its own actions.\u201d Thus, in her view, the particular actions taken by the (unknown) WMATA employee in cleaning the floor of the Cheverly station were avoidable, did not involve the exercise of discretion within a range of permissible choices, and were more akin to negligent driving, as explicated in <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 325 n. 7, 111 S.Ct. 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that, at trial, Tinsley introduced sufficient circumstantial evidence that the platform was wet as a result of efforts to clean it by WMATA employees, she offered no evidence that any WMATA employee operated a cleaning machine or applied a mop negligently. Rather, Tinsley has consistently argued, both here and below, that WMA-TA should be required to clean its platforms during the early morning hours when the stations are closed and suggested that cleaning the platform during afternoon rush hour \u201cactively\u201d created a hazard. In effect, Tinsley asserts that we should recognize an \u201cactive/passive\u201d distinction and that the discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>tionary function exception should only apply where WMATA is passively responding to an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Tinsley further relies on <em>O\u2019Toole v. United States, </em>295 F.3d 1029 (9th Cir.2002), to buttress her argument that the discretionary function exception \u201cshould not cover hazardous conditions <em>created </em>by WMATA itself\u2019 and that WMATA\u2019s employees\u2019 failure to properly maintain the platform is not barred from tort liability. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>a case brought under the FTCA, presented the issue of whether a federal agency, specifically, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, enjoyed immunity when, for budgetary reasons, it had neglected to maintain an irrigation ditch on its property, resulting eventually in flood damage to the property of neighboring landowners. After exhausting their administrative remedies, the land owners filed a negligence action against the United States in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. The district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that the failure to repair and maintain the irrigation ditch \u201cwas the result of a policy decision involving allocation of scarce [Bureau of Indian Affairs] resources\u201d and, as such, was barred by the discretionary function exception. <em>Id. </em>at 1032.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected the Government\u2019s argument that budgetary decisions and maintenance scheduling were policy matters and were thus covered by governmental immunity, explaining that to \u201callow[ ] the irrigation system to fall into disrepair is no more a conscious regulatory choice than failing to maintain the brakes on a car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1036. It warned that \u201c[t]he danger that the discretionary function exception will swallow the FTCA is especially great where the government takes on the role of a private landowner.... Every slip and fall, every failure to warn, every inspection and maintenance decision can be couched in terms of policy choices based on allocation of limited resources.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1037 (citation omitted). The Ninth Circuit therefore held that the Bureau of Indian Affairs\u2019s decision to allow the irrigation system to fall into disrepair was not shielded from liability under the FTCA and reversed the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Citing the just-quoted language from <em>O\u2019Toole </em>warning against the danger that the discretionary function exception will swallow the FTCA, Tinsley contends that the discretionary function exception \u201cshould be read narrowly.\u201d This argument, in effect, urges us to ignore the well-settled rule that \u201c \u2018a waiver of sovereign immunity is to be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lizzi v. WMATA, </em>156 Md.App. 1, 9, 845 A.2d 60 (2003) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of the Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., </em>525 U.S. 255, 261, 119 S.Ct. 687, 142 L.Ed.2d 718 (1999)). Consequently, we decline to construe the discretionary function exception so narrowly. It is not, in our view, restricted only to actions taken in response to external events, as in <em>Barksdale-Showell, </em>965 A.2d at 23 (holding that decisions of WMATA employees regarding \u201cthe maintenance, repair, inspection, and operation of the escalators,\u201d made in response to weather emergency, fell within discretionary function exception), and <em>Smith v. WMATA, supra, </em>290 F.3d 201 (holding that WMATA\u2019s decision to operate escalator in \u201cstationary mode,\u201d where all other escalators were unexpectedly out of service, fell within discretionary function exception).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Hence, we do not find Tinsley\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Barksdale-Showell </em>from the case at bar persuasive. Like its standard operating procedure for dealing with weather-related hazards, a procedure which <em>Barksdale-Showell </em>held was shielded by governmental immunity, WMATA\u2019s cleaning and maintenance policies were flexible enough to allow its maintenance personnel to respond to potential hazards. Whether to operate a cleaning machine or use a mop and bucket, and when to do so, are decisions \u201c \u2018subject to policy analysis\u2019 and thus discretionary.\u201d 965 A.2d at 23 (quoting <em>Gaubert, supra, </em>499 U.S. at 323, 111 S.Ct. 1267).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Contrary to Tinsley\u2019s claim, there are no easy choices in deciding the appropriate time for cleaning train platforms. As WMATA points out, <em>not </em>cleaning the platforms during business hours may also create hazardous conditions. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of patrons pass through any given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Metrorail station in a single day,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and it is inevitable that they will leave behind trash, clothing, debris, food, cups, bottles, and other items too numerous to mention.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Moreover, Tinsley\u2019s reliance on <em>O\u2019Toole </em>is misplaced. The crux of <em>O\u2019Toole </em>was the government\u2019s <em>failure </em>to maintain its facilities. The Ninth Circuit held \u201cthat an agency\u2019s decision to forego, for fiscal reasons, the routine maintenance of its property\u2014maintenance that would be expected of any other landowner\u2014is not the kind of policy decision\u201d that is shielded from tort liability. <em>Id. </em>at 1036. Relying on <em>Gaubert, </em>it concluded that the agency\u2019s decision to neglect its property was more akin to \u201ca government employee\u2019s negligent driving,\u201d <em>see Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 325 n. 7, 111 S.Ct. 1267, than to \u201can FDA decision not to approve a drug for sale, or a National Park Service decision not to put up a guardrail that will block visitors\u2019 views,\u201d and, consequently, \u201cwas not a decision \u2018susceptible to policy analysis.\u2019 \u201d 295 F.3d at 1037 (quoting <em>Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. at 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">But it is Tinsley\u2019s contention, not that WMATA has failed to perform a duty, but that it has negligently failed to select a specific time for performance, leaving it to its maintenance personnel to make that decision, depending on the circumstances. While choosing to forego a duty may cross the line demarcating those acts which are not shielded by sovereign immunity from those which are, the reasonable exercise of discretion as to when and how to perform maintenance at a facility does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLANT.
