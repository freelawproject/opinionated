The hydra has no less than three heads: 1) constitutional double jeopardy; 2) the rule of lenity as an aid to statutory construction; and 3) the essentially tetherless notion of fundamental fairness. These are no mere variations on a common theme. They are the subjects for widely differing inquiries. Fundamental fairness, especially, remains very much an enigma. All three are now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The appellant, Daniel Joseph Pair, filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on July 2, 2010, a Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule of Procedure 4-345(a). The posited illegality was that three sentences had not been merged. On July 14, 2010, Judge Dana M. Levitz denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The Original Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The appellant was originally convicted by a Baltimore County jury, presided over by Judge Levitz, of 1) first-degree assault, 2) robbery, 3) false imprisonment, and 4) the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle. The victim of all of the crimes was the appellant\u2019s former fianc\u00e9, Allison Gilbert. Judge Levitz sentenced the appellant to a term of 25 years imprisonment for the first-degree assault, a consecutive term of 10 years for the robbery, a consecutive term of 5 years for the false imprisonment, and a concurrent term of 5 years for the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The First Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The appellant appealed his convictions to this Court, raising four separate contentions including the sufficiency of the evidence to support the convictions. One of the appellant\u2019s other contentions was that the conviction for the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle should have merged into the conviction for robbery, because the motor vehicle was one of several items of property taken in the course of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">In the case of <em>Pair v. State, </em>No. 2119, September Term, 2006, filed on July 28, 2009, this Court agreed with the appellant as to the merger of the conviction for the unauthorized taking of a motor vehicle. In all other respects, the 41-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>page unpublished opinion by Judge Meredith affirmed the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Because the issue of merger is again being raised by the appellant, it is important to note precisely why this Court ruled as it did with respect to the merger of the motor vehicle theft charge. The rationale for merging theft into robbery has no bearing on the new merger issues now before us. After noting that \u201c[t]he legislature set forth its intent regarding the merger of motor vehicle theft into theft,\u201d Judge Meredith\u2019s opinion went on to explain why theft generally is deemed to merge into the greater inclusive robbery, which is, by definition, a compound theft.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">Appellant is correct that the appellate courts of this State have held that under the rule of lenity, theft and robbery merge. <em>See Spitzinger v. State, </em>340 Md. 114, 124-25 [665 A.2d 685] (1995) (\u201cWe ... have some doubts, in light of our prior cases and the history of common law robbery and common law larceny, as to whether the legislature intended to authorize successive or cumulative punishment for felony theft and robbery. Those doubts must be resolved in favor of the defendant, so that under the rule of lenity the sentences for robbery and felony theft should merge.\u201d); <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 296, 307 [705 A.2d 10] (1998) (relying on <em>Spitzinger </em>to conclude that convictions of felony theft and robbery with a deadly weapon arising out of a single event or incident should merge under the rule of lenity).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The Motion to Correct an Illegal Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In his Rule 4-345(a) motion before Judge Levitz, the appellant pushed for additional mergers. Having failed before Judge Levitz, the appellant now pushes the same contentions before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">1. The first-degree assault conviction merges into the robbery conviction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">2. Alternatively, the first-degree assault conviction merges into the false imprisonment conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>3. False imprisonment and robbery merge under the Rule of Lenity and the principle of fundamental fairness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Rule 4-345 and Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We are chagrined that the appellant, who successfully brought one merger issue before this Court in his first appeal, now raises three additional merger issues for the first time, thus necessitating a second trip to the circuit court and a second trip to this Court when a single trip would fully have served the same purpose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Notwithstanding our chagrin, however, Maryland Rule 4r-345 expressly permits such fragmentation under certain circumstances. A failure to merge a sentence is considered to be an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d -within the contemplation of the rule. <em>Britton v. State, </em>201 Md.App. 589, 30 A.3d 236 (2011); <em>Ingram v. State, </em>179 Md.App. 485, 508-09, 947 A.2d 74 (2008); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 498, 510-11, 501 A.2d 111 (1985); <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 319-22, 558 A.2d 715 (1989). The coverage of Rule 4-345, however, is not totally free of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Rule 4-345\u2019s exemption from the normal preservation requirements and the normal filing deadline is based upon the inherent \u201cillegality\u201d of the sentence enjoying open-ended and timeless review. In <em>Britton v. State, supra, </em>Chief Judge Krauser highlighted the significance of actual \u201cillegality:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuL\">[W]hen the trial court is required to merge convictions for sentencing purposes but, instead, imposes a separate sentence for each unmerged conviction, it commits reversible error. ... <em>[S]uch an error implicates the illegality of imposing \u201cmultiple sentences ... for the same offense.\u201d ... [T]he result is the imposition of a sentence \u201cnot permitted by law.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">We are dealing in this case not with one merger issue but with three distinct merger issues. It is conceivable that Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>4-345(a) might confer its special dispensation upon two of those merger issues but not upon the third. When a sentencing judge fails to merge multiple convictions for the \u201csame offense\u201d pursuant to the required evidence test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>the unmerged sentence is unconstitutional, as a matter of law. That constitutes an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d within the contemplation of Rule 4-345(a). When a sentencing judge imposes multiple sentences where it is established, as a matter of law, that the Legislature intended that multiple sentences not be imposed, that legislatively prohibited sentence is also an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d within the contemplation of Rule 4-345(a). Both a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause and a violation of the rule of lenity are matters that are decided as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">By contrast, the newest and thus far little explored addition to the ranks of merger issues, to wit merger pursuant to fundamental fairness, may be a phenomenon with a critical difference. Such a merger decision would appear to be something that might frequently be heavily fact-driven and dependent on the particular circumstances of the particular case. This would seem to be the type of thing requiring a judgment call by the trial judge, the umpire on the field, with an immediate sense of the pulse of a trial. By its very nature, this could be a discretionary call and not something that can be reduced to legal algebra and decided as a matter of law. Could a failure to merge in such a discretionary context be said to be an inherently \u201cillegal sentence?\u201d If not, it would not qualify for Rule 4-345(a)\u2019s procedural dispensations.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">We are already far enough along in our present discussion, however, to assume, purely <em>arguendo, </em>that Rule 4-345(a) covers the merger arguments presently before us. At least we will make that assumption with respect to the first two merger issues. Whether merger by virtue of fundamental fairness enjoys Rule 4-345(a)\u2019s procedural dispensation is far more problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The Many Faces of Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Assault is a protean crime. It frequently is a significant and autonomous crime in its own right. In this case, the first-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>degree assault charge was the flagship count of this entire prosecution. The first-degree assault charge, for instance, carried the greatest maximum penalty of the three crimes for which the appellant was convicted. It was for the first-degree assault that Judge Levitz imposed the harshest penalty. Assault, on the other hand, can sometimes be simply nothing more than a constituent element in a crime such as robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The question of whether a particular crime, such as the first-degree assault in the present case, is the centerpiece of the prosecution or a mere incident of some other crime is intensely fact-specific. There is no automatic or mechanistic answer as a matter of law. The answer, rather, depends upon the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case and can readily go in either direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\"><em>Lamb v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 422, 613 A.2d 402 (1992) is illustrative. The issue in <em>Lamb </em>was whether the conviction for assault should have merged into the conviction for false imprisonment. Assault, of course, is one of the elements of false imprisonment. An assault that serves that instrumental function and nothing more is, therefore, a lesser included offense within the greater inclusive offense of false imprisonment. The two are the \u201csame offense.\u201d In the <em>Lamb </em>case, however, the assault did not serve that merely ancillary function and do nothing more. It did a great deal more. It was, indeed, the flagship or centerpiece of the entire prosecution, as it is in the case now before us. This Court explained the various characteristics that may give a particular crime on a particular occasion such celebrity status:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\"><em>Every aspect of this </em>trial\u2014the evidence, the jury arguments, the judge\u2019s instructions, the presentence arguments, the judge\u2019s explanation of the sentences, the sentences <em>themselves\u2014combine to make it indisputably clear that the major crime for which the appellant was convicted was his deliberate placing of Sharon Herz in fear of losing her life. </em>The jury instructions focused upon and highlighted the assault charge----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>The assault received the ten-year sentence, beside which the breaking and entering, the actual battery and the false imprisonment all paled into relative insignificance, </em>as was apparent throughout the trial. <em>The assault </em>under the fifth count <em>was obviously no mere instrumentality in bringing about an unlawful confinement. It was rather the case that the false imprisonment was a mere incident of it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">93 Md.App. at 473-74, 613 A.2d 402 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Under certain circumstances, a particular assault might be nothing more than a lesser included offense with the greater inclusive offense of kidnapping. In <em>Hunt v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 286, 310, 278 A.2d 637 (1971), however, Judge Orth explained how the assault in that case enjoyed an autonomous and non-merging status of its own:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">But here <em>there was evidence from which the jury could have found that Hunt assaulted Barbara independent of any assault incident to the kidnapping itself. </em>Barbara testified that while in Hunt\u2019s apartment he was importuning her to have sexual relations with him. \u201cI told him to leave me alone, to get away from me and I was pushing him and he was pushing me and he struck me.\u201d He grabbed her arm and pulled her in the bedroom and threw her down on the bed. <em>These acts of assault and battery were not an element of the kidnapping but a separate and distinct offense. </em>We hold that there was no merger of the [assault] into the convictions under the [kidnapping] counts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">In <em>Britton v. State, </em>201 Md.App. 589, 30 A.3d 236 (2011), the appellant argued that, for sentencing purposes, his assault conviction should have merged into his conviction for resisting arrest. Chief Judge Krauser, albeit recognizing that sometimes an assault is simply an element of resisting arrest, explained why the more significant assault in that case enjoyed a non-merging vitality of its own:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYg\">\n<em>fAfppellant assaulted Officer Moreau with his car in an act that was completely separate from his a,cts of assaulting the officers with his fists and feet in the brawl that ensued </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\n<em>several minutes later. Moreover, it appears that the ramming of Officer Moreau\u2019s car was a gratuitous act and not part of appellant\u2019s resisting arrest, as the officer was not in active pursuit of appellant when that act occurred.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">Thus, the <em>offense of assaulting </em>Officer Moreau <em>and the offense of resisting arrest were based on distinct acts, </em>separated by time and geography, and <em>merger of the convictions is not required.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Whether the assault in this case is the star performer of our drama or a mere supporting actor is a fact-driven inquiry. That is why all the lurid circumstances of this case are so vitally important. Judge Meredith\u2019s opinion sets them out meticulously.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The Prior Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">For merger purposes, it is critical that we determine whether the assault was a mere incident of robbery or whether it had a life and an energizing purpose of its own. It is necessary, therefore, that we understand the turbulent relationship between the assailant and the assault victim. In that regard, Judge Meredith\u2019s opinion explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">Allison Gilbert testified that <em>appellant had been her fianc\u00e9 </em>and that she had met him during the summer of 2004 at The Harem, an entertainment club located on The Block in Baltimore City. Gilbert stated that she \u201c[djanced\u201d at the club under the stage name of S\u2019more, and appellant was \u201ca doorman/floorman.\u201d She stated that their relationship began as a friendship, but that two or three weeks later, they began a romantic relationship and stopped seeing others. During that time, Gilbert was renting an apartment in Essex, which she leased in her name. Gilbert recalled that about six to eight months into their relationship, <em>appellant asked her to marry him, and they became engaged. </em>Gilbert stated that eventually, their relationship began to change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>with appellant becoming \u201cmore irritable\u201d; they fought more, and began \u201carguing about stupid stuff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">On August 22, 2005, Gilbert found out that she was three months pregnant with twins. Also on August 22, appellant took Gilbert\u2019s Dodge Neon 2000, but returned to the apartment sometime during the night. When Gilbert got up that morning, however, appellant was not in the apartment. Gilbert testified that she called appellant, and he told her \u201cto take a cab to work to pick up [her] car.\u201d Appellant had twice before taken the car without her knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The Relationship Deteriorated</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The opinion went on to describe the early evening of August 22, 2005, and how the ill-feeling between the appellant and Allison Gilbert reached critical mass as Ms. Gilbert arrived home.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">By this date, Gilbert and appellant had begun working at another \u201cclub\u201d owned by the owners of The Harem. This club was called The Golden Nugget. <em>Gilbert </em>took a cab to the club that evening and <em>\u201cfound some girl\u2019s stuffed animal and panties in the back of the car\u201d so she told appellant that their relationship was over. </em>She also told appellant that she was returning to the apartment and would pack up appellant\u2019s belongings. Gilbert informed appellant that she \u201cwas putting his stuff outside.\u201d Gilbert recalled that <em>appellant became \u201cmad\u201d and that they had a physical altercation at the club. </em>They were in the locker room and two girls ran out to get Steve, the club\u2019s owner, who came into the locker room and \u201cpulled [appellant] off and held him[.]\u201d Gilbert believed that Steve was taking appellant to the office, and she asked Steve to delay appellant so that she \u201ccould put his stuff out before he got to the house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-9\"><em>Gilbert </em>stated that she <em>went to her car and drove home. </em>On the way, she called her father and told him what had happened. She called the police \u201cso that they could be there in case he [appellant] was there already.\u201d She also called maintenance to change the locks to her apartment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>It took her approximately half an hour to drive to her apartment. She arrived there at about 9:00 p.m., and she began packing appellant\u2019s belongings. The maintenance workers soon showed up to change the locks. The police were also there, but about ten minutes after Gilbert began packing, the police informed her that unless she knew that she was \u201cin grave danger\u201d they could not remain, and they left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">After the locks were changed, Gilbert started to clean her apartment and moved her car to a different part of the parking lot. She then noticed that there was something wrong with the door to her apartment and again called maintenance. She was told that the maintenance worker could be paged and come out to her apartment again that evening. <em>Shortly thereafter, Gilbert heard a knock on her door. </em>By this point, Gilbert was done cleaning and she \u201chad turned out all the lights so nobody would think [she] was home.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Attack Began</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The arrival of the appellant at Ms. Gilbert\u2019s apartment and the triggering of the assault occurred in the neighborhood of ten P.M. Our opinion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">Gilbert testified that the person at the door identified himself as \u201cmaintenance\u201d so <em>she opened the door. Appellant was there, </em>and although Gilbert tried to brace her foot against the door, <em>appellant pushed the door open. </em>Appellant broke Gilbert\u2019s cell phone when he walked in the door. Gilbert stated that appellant looked through the apartment. Gilbert testified that she told him that he did not need to look through the apartment because all his possessions were \u201cright there[]\u201d and \u201call packed up in bags[,]\u201d that is, in luggage and garbage bags. The items were located right inside the door to the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\"><em>After appellant looked through the apartment, he began hitting Gilbert with his fists. Gilbert stated that appellant hit her in her \u201c[fjace and everywhere[,]\u201d but that he struck </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>her \u201c[mjostly\u201d on her head. </em>Gilbert attempted to fight back and ended up on the floor. She recalled that <em>appellant then had his arm around, her neck. </em>She heard knocking on her door, and appellant lifted her up, went toward the door, opened the door, and \u201cthis girl\u201d that Gilbert knew from work was there. (Courtney Jones later testified, pursuant to a plea bargain, that she was the girl who joined appellant at Gilbert\u2019s apartment.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-4\">Gilbert testified that, as soon <em>as the door was opened, the person at the door punched her. The girl entered the apartment, and she and appellant took turns holding and beating Gilbert </em>Appellant and the girl were also verbally abusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">Gilbert testified: <em>\u201cThey started hitting me more and then he [appellant] pulled out a knife and started chopping off all my hair, calling me a bald, dumb bitch.\u201d </em>The girl continued to hold Gilbert. <em>Appellant also tried to cut Gilbert\u2019s face and throat, but the knife was too dull. </em>Gilbert stated that appellant gave the knife to the girl.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The Attack Escalated</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">At a certain point, the two assailants tied a cord around Ms. Gilbert\u2019s neck. The tying-up of the victim may have engaged the gears of the false imprisonment charge, but it is transparently clear that the continuing assault was no mere incident of false imprisonment. It was a perverse, deliberate, and vengeful infliction of humiliation and degradation. Judge Meredith recounted this aspect of the unrelenting punishment, in its multiple manifestations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">The girl cut the cord to the vacuum cleaner and <em>they then used that cord to tie Gilbert up. </em>Gilbert stated that they used the cord to \u201chogtie\u201d her \u201cwith a noose around [her] neck.\u201d She stated that they looped the cord around her neck three times and that if she moved her head too much, she would choke herself because the cord would tighten. Gilbert tried to free herself, but was unable to do so. In addition, she \u201cwas having a panic attack and couldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>breathe the whole time.\u201d <em>They also put a dirty sock in her mouth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">Gilbert stated that after she was tied up, <em>appellant and the girl discussed having sex on top of Gilbert before jumping on her stomach to kill the baby. At some point, they jumped on Gilbert\u2019s stomach </em>and appellant \u201cwas asking me why wouldn\u2019t I die yet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">Gilbert stated that <em>the girl gave appellant oral sex and then \u201cspit it in my face.\u201d </em>Gilbert was still on the couch. She testified: <em>\u201cThen they started having sex on top of me. \u201d While they had intercourse, the cord pulled on Gilbert\u2019s neck.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">(Emphasis supplied). We note now for later reference that the tying-up of the victim occurred long before the last minute thought of a robbery popped into anyone\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Gilbert testified to what occurred after appellant and the accomplice got off her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\"><em>He </em>[appellant] went into the kitchen and <em>started pouring all the juice and water and everything that was cold on me, then poured Tide in my eyes and took the dirty cat litter box, put that on me, </em>started throwing random objects, like vases and stuff that was on, around the living room on me. <em>Then they were talking about either killing me or leaving without killing me.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Robbery As An Afterthought</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">As the fury of the assault wound down and the assailants prepared to call it a night, the \u201c11th hour\u201d robbery was little more than an opportunistic afterthought. Our opinion went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-12\"><em>Gilbert told appellant where her rent money was and the keys to her car, and he took Gilbert\u2019s laptop computer. </em>Gilbert did not give appellant permission to take these items. She only told him where certain items were because they had been beating her, and she was tied up. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>appellant and the girl took Gilbert\u2019s possessions, they looked through her purse then left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">(Emphasis supplied). As the totality of the evidence made very apparent, the assault was the dog wagging the tail of robbery and not vice-versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">An Assaultive Marathon</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Our opinion described how Ms. Gilbert freed herself and also recounted her testimony about the duration of the assault.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">After appellant and the girl left, <em>Gilbert was able to free one foot from the cord, which she estimated took her twenty minutes to accomplish. </em>She was then able to get to the door, open the door, then screamed and knocked on doors until one of her neighbor\u2019s heard her and called the police. The neighbor then looked for scissors to free her from the cord. <em>Gilbert, estimated that the entire incident with appellant and the girl lasted \u201ctwo or three hours.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">(Emphasis supplied). A three-hour assault was self-evidently no mere incident of a ten-minute robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">The Impact on the Victim</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Both a neighbor and a responding police officer described the state of the victim in the immediate aftermath of her ordeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">Travis Williams testified that he lived in the same apartment building as Gilbert. He was asleep in his apartment during the early morning hours of August 23, 2005, when his girlfriend woke him after she had heard a knock on the door.

She also had like chunks of her hair coming out, very, very upset, very hysterical.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">(Emphasis supplied). The false imprisonment and the robbery were the least of Allison Gilbert\u2019s woes. She did not lose the baby.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">The Flagship Offense of First-Degree Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The dominant criminal offense perpetrated on Allison Gilbert by the appellant and his accomplice was a vicious and sadistic assault (actually, a continuing series of varied assaults) over a period of almost three hours. It was an assault, moreover, aggravated for sentencing purposes up to the first degree. In one of his contentions, the appellant argues that the sentence for first-degree assault should have merged into the sentence for robbery. In a second contention, the appellant argues that, alternatively, the sentence for first-degree assault should have merged into that for false imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Because first-degree assault is at the core of the appellant\u2019s arguments, it behooves us to look closely at its elements and its dimensions. The legislative recognition of an aggravated variety of common law assault, thereafter labeled as first-degree assault, was first made by Section 3 of Ch. 632 of the Acts of 1996. It is now codified in Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3-202 and it reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">(a) Prohibited.\u2014...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">(1) A person may not intentionally cause or attempt to cause serious physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>(2) A person may not commit an assault with a firearm, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">(i) a handgun, antique firearm, rifle, shotgun, short-barreled shotgun, or short-barreled rifle, as those terms are defined in \u00a7 4-201 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">(ii) an assault pistol, as defined in \u00a7 4-301 of this article;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">(iii) a machine gun, as defined in \u00a7 4-401 of this article; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">(iv) a regulated firearm, as defined in \u00a7 5-101 of the Public Safety Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">(b) Penalty.\u2014A person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of assault in the first degree and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 25 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">In <em>Manigault v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 271, 284 n. 2, 486 A.2d 240 (1985), when dealing with the at-times troubled relationship between the misdemeanor of common law assault and what was then the statutory felony of assault with intent to murder, rape, or rob (then codified as Art. 27, \u00a7 12), this Court actually anticipated the 1996 splitting of assault into degrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">It might facilitate our ability to conceptualize the relationship if we thought of common law assault as \u201cassault in the second degree\u201d and of the various aggravated assaults as forms of \u201cassault in the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">As is readily apparent, there are two alternative modalities for aggravating an ordinary second-degree assault upward to the first degree. The first is when the assailant \u201cintentionally cause[s] or attempt[s] to cause serious physical injury to another.\u201d It is a specific-intent crime. The second aggravating modality is concerned exclusively with the <em>actus reus </em>of the assault having been committed \u201cwith a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-13\">Simply to clear away some of the clutter, we are dealing in this case only with the first variety of aggravation and not with the second. No firearm was involved. We are concerned only with the aggravating element of intentionally inflicting \u201cserious physical injury\u201d on the victim. What Judge William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Adkins said in <em>Nightingale v. State, </em>312 Md. 699, 705, 542 A.2d 373 (1988), with respect to a multi-purpose criminal statute is equally apposite to a criminal statute that sets out alternative modalities of aggravating a crime upward to a higher degree of blameworthiness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">When a multi-purpose criminal statute is involved, we refine it by looking at the alternative elements relevant to the case at hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Double Jeopardy and Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">One of the twin evils traditionally guarded against by the prohibition against double jeopardy, pursuant to either the Double Jeopardy Clause of the federal Fifth Amendment or to the common law of Maryland, is that of multiple punishment for the \u201csame offense.\u201d The necessary inquiry is that of whether separate punishments are being imposed for the \u201csame offense.\u201d In <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 219-20, 582 A.2d 525 (1990), Judge Cole set out the required examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\"><em>The required evidence test focuses on the elements of each crime in an effort to determine whether all the elements of one crime are necessarily in evidence to support a finding of the other, such that the first is subsumed as a lesser included offense of the second. </em>We summarized the test as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">The required evidence is that which is minimally necessary to secure a conviction for each ... offense. <em>If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, </em>or in other words, <em>if each offense contains an element which the other does not, the offenses are not the same for double jeopardy purposes, </em>even though arising from the same conduct or episode. But, <em>where </em>only one offense requires proof of an additional fact, so <em>that all elements of one offense are present in the other, the offenses are deemed to be the same for double jeopardy purposes. </em>And of course if both [offenses] have exactly the same elements, the offenses are also the same within the meaning of the prohibition against double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>(Emphasis supplied). <em>See also Brooks v.

The other two crimes do not. Robbery requires the theft of property. The other two crimes do not. False imprisonment requires the actual detention of the victim. The other two crimes do not. In this case, no merger was required by virtue of double jeopardy law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Rule of Lenity and Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Merger based on the rule of lenity, by contrast, is a different creature entirely. Even when the merger of sentences is not compelled by the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), it may nonetheless be compelled by the rule of lenity. As Judge Eldridge explained in <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>307 Md. 501, 518, 515 A.2d 465 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">Nevertheless, we have recognized on several occasions <em>that the required evidence test, while the normal standard, is not the exclusive standard for determining 'merger of offenses. </em>As stated in <em>Brooks v. State, supra, </em>284 Md. at 423-424 [397 A.2d 596],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\u201ceven though offenses may be separate and distinct under the required evidence test, <em>courts occasionally find as a matter of statutory interpretation that the Legislature did not intend, </em>under the circumstances involved, <em>that a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>person could be convicted of two particular offenses growing out of the same act or transaction.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>See also Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 397, 354 A.2d 825 (1976); <em>Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. at 142-45, 416 A.2d 265; <em>State v. Boozer, </em>304 Md. 98, 104, 497 A.2d 1129 (1985); <em>White v.

State, </em>53 Md.App. 171, 201, 452 A.2d 1234 (1982), this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">If the Legislature intended two crimes arising out of a single act to be punished separately, we defer to that legislated choice---- If the Legislature intended but a single punishment, we defer to that legislated choice. If we are uncertain as to what the Legislature intended, we turn to the so-called \u2018Rule of Lenity\u2019 by which we give the defendant the benefit of the doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The rule of lenity, however, deals only with legislative intent and, therefore, only with the situation wherein at least one of the two crimes subject to merger analysis is a statutory offense. <em>Khalifa v. State, </em>382 Md. 400, 434, 855 A.2d 1175 (2004) (\u201cAs it is a principle of statutory construction, the rule of lenity applies where both offenses are statutory in nature or where one offense is statutory and the other is a derivative of common law.\u201d). As Judge Smith pointed out for the Court of Appeals in <em>Dillsworth v. State, </em>308 Md. 354, 364, 519 A.2d 1269 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">The doctrine of merger by legislative intent operates as <em>a rule of statutory construction </em>and is not constitutionally mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>See White v. State, </em>318 Md. at 746, 569 A.2d 1271 (\u201cObviously a rule of statutory construction has little relevance to an offense not created by Maryland statute.\u201d); <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. at 150, 882 A.2d 900 (\u201cAs it is a principle of statutory construction, the rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>lenity applies where both offenses are statutory in nature or where one offense is statutory and the other is derivative of common law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In <em>Monoker, </em>321 Md. at 223, 582 A.2d 525, Judge Cole was very emphatic about the limited utility of the rule of lenity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9m\"><em>The rule of </em>lenity, formulated as an aid to statutory construction, <em>applies to statutory offenses. </em>In <em>White, </em>we applied the rule where one offense was statutory and the other common law. Solicitation and conspiracy are both common law offenses. <em>We have never applied the rule of lenity to two common law crimes, nor do we so extend the scope of that rule here.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Far and away, the most probing examination of the rule of lenity was that engaged in for this Court by Judge William Adkins in <em>Johnson v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 205, 212-16, 467 A.2d 544 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 136, 472 A.2d 999 (1984). Judge Adkins very perspicaciously pointed out that an inquiry into legislative intent is not only meaningless when at least one statute is not involved but is also meaningless when two statutes were enacted years apart and were not focused on the same subject matter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">A common thread connects all the cases we have just discussed. It is the assumption (often not articulated) that <em>under the circumstances of a given case, it is reasonable to believe that the legislature that enacted a, particular statute or statutes would express some intent as to multiple punishment. </em>That assumption is appropriate when a single act is charged as multiple offenses under a single statute <em>(Lad</em>ner,; <em>Bell </em>and Prince), where the subject of two statutes is of necessity closely intertwined <em>(Loscomb </em>and Fields), where one offense is necessarily the overt act of a statutory offense (Walker), and where one statute, by its very nature, affects other offenses because it is designed to effect multiple punishment <em>(Whack). Under those circumstances, it is not unreasonable to assume that the legislative body contemplated the possibility of multiple punishment and to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>conclude that unless the intention in favor of multiple punishment is clear, as in Whack, the Rule of Lenity or its equivalent should be applied against the imposition of multiple punishment. But that thread is not present in the case at bar.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\"><em>What is now Art. 27, \u00a7 12 (assault with intent to murder) was enacted </em>by Ch. 138, <em>Laws of 1809, </em>as part of an early codification of Maryland criminal law. <em>That codification did not include the offense of attempted robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon </em>(now Art. 27, \u00a7 488) <em>which did not become part of our statutory law until </em>enacted by Ch. 457, Acts of <em>1927. Not only were these two statutory offenses created 118 years apart but there is no evidence that the legislature ever considered one when amending the other, nor was there reason for it to do so. </em>An assault with intent to murder may be and often is committed under circumstances showing no intent to rob; attempted armed robbery may be and often is committed under circumstances not involving the intent to kill. One offense is not necessarily the overt act of the other. And the punishment provided for each offense implicates no necessary likelihood of multiple punishment with respect to the other offense, since, unlike the handgun use law, the commission of one of these two offenses is not an essential predicate to the commission of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">56 Md.App. at 215-16, 467 A.2d 544 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Speaking through Judge Smith, the Court of Appeals placed its express imprimatur on the <em>Johnson </em>analysis in <em>Dillsworth v. State, </em>308 Md. 354, 366-67, 519 A.2d 1269 (1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\"><em>If the analytical framework enunciated in Johnson is applied to the case at bar, it quickly becomes apparent that this is not a proper case for invoking the doctrine of merger by legislative intent. </em>The prohibition against an <em>assault with intent to maim, </em>disfigure or disable was <em>enacted </em>by ch. 99 of the <em>Acts of 1853. </em>Code (1957, 1982 RephVol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 386. Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 461 et seq., <em>the sexual offense legislation, was enacted in 1976, 123 years later ... there is no indication that the General Assembly considered the ques</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>tion of multiple punishment </em>in those instances where a consummated sexual offense embodies an assault with intent to maim, disfigure or disable. Furthermore, assault \"with intent to maim, disfigure or disable and third degree sexual offense do not fall within any of the categories set forth in <em>Johnson.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Self evidently, even when dealing with Maryland statutes, it is absurd to look for legislative intent or for the lack thereof in circumstances wherein there would be no occasion for the Legislature to have an intent, one way or the other. One does not look for legislative intent where there was none. We are not unmindful of more permissive dicta in <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. 740, 745, 569 A.2d 1271 (1990), but without the intellectual discipline of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Dillsworth, </em>the rule of lenity would be reduced to nothing but a convenient cover for a court to do whatever it felt like doing on a particular occasion. We are persuaded to abide by the solid wisdom of <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Dillsworth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Three Common Law Crimes</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Turning to the present case, the rule of lenity clearly does not apply. Robbery is a common law crime. It is not an offense created by the Maryland General Assembly. <em>Phenious v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 385, 391, 274 A.2d 658, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 748 (1971) (\u201cAlthough neither robbery nor robbery with a deadly weapon are defined by the Md.Code, they are both punishable in Maryland since robbery was a crime at common law.\u201d); <em>Darby v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 407, 413, 239 A.2d 584 (1968) (\u201cRobbery is a crime in Maryland under the common law. It is not defined by statute but the penalty is fixed by statute. It thus retains its common law definition.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">False imprisonment is also a common law crime. It was not created by the Maryland General Assembly. <em>Street v. State, </em>307 Md. 262, 265-66, 513 A.2d 870 (1986); <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 39, 139 A.2d 209 (1958) ([\u201cFalse imprisonment] is a common law offense, and, in the absence of a statute, is punishable as such, as it is in this State.\u201d); <em>Watkins v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>59 Md.App. 705, 723, 478 A.2d 326 (1984); <em>Hunt v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 286, 311, 278 A.2d 637 (1971) (\u201cThe crime of false imprisonment remains punishable at common law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Assault, whatever its degree or statutorily prescribed punishment, remains a common law crime. It is not an offense created by the Maryland General Assembly. <em>White v. State, </em>318 Md. at 746, 569 A.2d 1271, made it very clear that neither the legislative establishment of punishment for a crime nor the dividing of a crime into degrees (such as with murder, rape, or assault) amounts to the legislative creation of the crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACE\"><em>The rule of lenity is simply a rule of statutory construction. </em>It originated in Supreme Court federal criminal cases. In the field of federal criminal law, offenses are created by acts of Congress. <em>Under Maryland law, </em>however, <em>there are a multitude of criminal offenses which were not created by Maryland statutes. They include both common law offenses and offenses based on pre-1776 English statutes. As to some of these, there simply is no Maryland legislation. </em>As <em>to others, the role of the General Assembly has largely been confined to prescribing the range of penalties and, in a few instances, dividing the offenses into degrees. Obviously a rale of statutory construction has little relevance to an offense not created by Maryland statute.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">(Emphasis supplied). As \u00a7 3-201(b) provides: \u201c \u2018Assault\u2019 means the crime of assault, battery, and assault and battery, <em>which retain their judicially determined meanings.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">By close analogy, <em>Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 140-41, 416 A.2d 265 (1980), makes it clear that simply providing a statutory sentence for the felony of robbery and creating, by statute, the aggravated form of robbery with a deadly weapon did not alter the fundamental common law character of the crime of robbery itself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">In Maryland, <em>robbery is a single common law offense: </em>Art. 27, <em>\u00a7\u00a7 186 and 188 do not create separate statutory offenses but merely fix the penalties for the one crime of robbery, </em>\u00a7 486 provides for not less than three and not more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ten years\u2019 imprisonment. If the robbery, however, is committed \u2018with a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u2019 \u00a7 488 prescribes twenty years\u2019 imprisonment as the maximum penalty for robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">(Emphasis supplied). <em>Whack </em>went on, 288 Md. at 148, 416 A.2d 265:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">[B]oth basic robbery under \u00a7 486 and robbery with a deadly weapon under \u00a7 488 constitute the same common law felony of \u2018robbery.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Thus it is for the common law crime of assault as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The rule of lenity is, from start to finish, a rule of statutory construction. With respect to the three common law crimes before us in this case, there are no statutes to construe. The rule of lenity is not remotely pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Fundamental Fairness and Merger</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Although fully 99% of the merger cases have been decided by the application of either the constitutionally mandated \u201crequired evidence\u201d test of <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>or statutory construction augmented by the rule of lenity, there has been \u201cMowin\u2019 in the wind\u201d in recent years a largely undefined third entry into the world of compulsory merger. It is labeled \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d In terms of not being pinned down, it is as elusive as Justice Potter Stewart\u2019s definition of \u201cobscenity\u201d in <em>Jacobellis v. Ohio, </em>378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964): \u201cI could never succeed in intelligibly [defining obscenity], but I know it when I see it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Although there had been passing allusions to the notion of fundamental fairness, the phrase was generally invoked simply to buttress a decision that was actually based on the rule of lenity. <em>Williams v. State, </em>323 Md. 312, 324, 593 A.2d 671 (1991) (\u201cConsiderations of fairness and reasonableness reinforce our conclusion.\u201d); <em>Claggett v. State, </em>108 Md.App. 32, 54, 670 A.2d 1002 (1996) (\u201cThe fairness of multiple punishments in a particular situation is obviously important.\u201d). Fundamental fairness was not a dispositive criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>We have found only two cases wherein a merger was actually dictated by \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d as an autonomous criterion. In <em>Monoker v. State, </em>321 Md. 214, 582 A.2d 525 (1990), the Court of Appeals held that the merger of two convictions was not compelled by either double jeopardy law or the rule of lenity. It held that merger was nonetheless required by \u201cthe principle of fundamental fairness.\u201d Judge Cole\u2019s opinion reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\"><em>One of the most basic considerations in all our decisions is the principle of fundamental fairness in meting out punishment for a crime. While solicitation and conspiracy do not merge under the required evidence test, </em>we find it unfair to uphold convictions and sentences for both crimes. <em>Although solicitation is not always a lesser included offense of conspiracy, in Monoker\u2019s case the conspiracy </em>to burglarize the Dublin home certainly <em>did ripen from the solicitation </em>of Almony to commit that same crime. [W]e conclude that <em>because the solicitation was part and parcel of the ultimate conspiracy and thereby an integral component of it, it would be fundamentally unfair to Monoker </em>for us <em>to require him to suffer twice, </em>once for the greater crime and once for a lesser included offense of that crime. <em>For that reason his sentences should merge.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In <em>Marquardt v. State, </em>164 Md.App. 95, 882 A.2d 900 (2005), neither the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test nor the rule of lenity was an effective instrumentality to cause a conviction for the malicious destruction of property to merge into a conviction for fourth degree burglary. Invoking <em>Monoker\u2019s </em>\u201cprinciple of fundamental fairness,\u201d however, this Court held, 164 Md.App. at 152-53, 882 A.2d 900:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">Under the facts of the present case, <em>the malicious destruction </em>of property <em>was clearly incidental to the breaking and entering </em>of 13 and 17 Bay Street. Thus, we are persuaded that Count 13, <em>malicious destruction of property </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>at 17 Bay Street <em>should have been merged into </em>Count 12, <em>the burglary conviction </em>at that address[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">It is immediately apparent that a merger dictated by fundamental fairness is a very different doctrinal phenomenon. Merger pursuant to the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test and merger pursuant to the rule of lenity can both be decided as a matter of law, virtually on the basis of examination confined within the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the charges. Merger by virtue of the fundamental fairness test, by dramatic contrast, is heavily and intensely fact-driven.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\"><em>Monoker </em>and <em>Marquardt </em>inevitably raise fundamental questions about the very nature of the appellate function. Both <em>Monoker </em>and <em>Marquardt </em>involved their respective appellate courts in the <em>de novo </em>evaluation of the particular evidence in a particular case. The trial judges had made no antecedent evaluations nor were they required to under the special dispensation of Rule 4-345(a), exempting the review of an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d from the preservation requirement. <em>Monoker </em>decided, <em>de novo, </em>that \u201calthough solicitation is not always a lesser included offense of conspiracy,\u201d it was in fact \u201cpart and parcel of the ultimate conspiracy\u201d under the particular facts of that case. 321 Md. at 223, 582 A.2d 525. <em>Marquardt </em>decided, <em>de novo, </em>that although the malicious destruction of property is not necessarily or even ordinarily incidental to a breaking and entering, it \u201cwas clearly incidental to the breaking and entering\u201d under the particular facts of that particular case. 164 Md.App. at 152-53, 882 A.2d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Those determinations may have been easy and uncontroversial under the facts of <em>Monoker </em>and <em>Marquardt, </em>but there will be other cases, cases in which fundamental fairness may be invoked, wherein the evidence calling for evaluation is more evenly balanced and perhaps even dependant on an assessment of credibilities. Should such evaluations of evidence be made in the first instance by an appellate court? Should cases calling for such evaluations enjoy the procedural dispensation of Rule 4-325(a)? When the evaluation process is necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>a flexible one, for instance, does Rule 4-325(a) \u201cillegality\u201d inhere in the non-merged sentence itself? Has the extension of merger law from the rule of lenity to fundamental fairness conceivably been \u201ca bridge too far?\u201d This is not just idle musing.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u201cA Rose By Any Other Name ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">We will focus our analysis on <em>Monoker, </em>for <em>Marquardt </em>simply followed <em>Monoker. </em>The promulgation of fundamental fairness as a third and independent test for merger came about in a single long paragraph at the tail end of a longer opinion dealing more fully and formally with other subjects.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ironically, what <em>Monoker </em>did was to bring Maryland merger law full circle and to resurrect the \u201cactual evidence\u201d test that had been expressly rejected by the Court of Appeals in <em>Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. 416, 397 A.2d 596 (1979). In the repackaging process, <em>Monoker </em>simply put a new label on the \u201cactual evidence\u201d test, that of \u201cfundamental fairness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">As early as 1968, in <em>Watts v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 454, 240 A.2d 317, this Court had held that a merger of two convictions was compelled under the \u201cactual evidence\u201d test. We did so on a set of facts that today would call for precisely the same result under the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d test. In repudiating <em>Watts v. State </em>ten years later, <em>Brooks v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 550, 553, 381 A.2d 718 (1978), summed up the basis for the earlier decision in <em>Watts:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">In <em>Watts v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 454, 240 A.2d 317 (1968), we held, <em>under the circumstances </em>in that case, that the offenses of carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon openly with intent to injure a named person merged into the offense of assault with intent to murder that particular person. <em>Because the same weapon, </em>a sawed-off shotgun, <em>was used in each offense, and because the victims were the same persons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>described in each offense, <em>and because there was identity of time, place and circumstances of each offense, we held that \u2018The elements of the two crimes are the same.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Under the facts in <em>Brooks, </em>moreover, the conviction for carrying a weapon openly with the intent to injure was clearly incidental to the conviction for assault with intent to murder. Merger would have been compelled under the \u201cactual evidence\u201d test, as it would be compelled today under the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d test. Recognizing that the Court of Appeals had, in <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md. 260, 373 A.2d 262 (1977), rejected the \u201cactual evidence\u201d test, however, not only for double jeopardy purposes but for Maryland merger law as well, we abandoned our earlier position in <em>Watts.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">It is clear that <em>Watts </em>was decided under what the Court of Appeals has termed the <em>\u201cactual evidence\u201d test, </em>i.e., <em>whether the evidence actually produced at trial on both offenses is substantially the same. This test was specifically rejected by the Court of Appeals in Newton </em>in favor of the \u201crequired evidence\u201d test quoted above. In light of <em>Newton, we now overrule our holding in Watts </em>that the offenses of carrying a dangerous and deadly weapon openly with intent to injure a named person and assault with intent to murder that person merge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">38 Md.App. at 553, 381 A.2d 718 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In <em>Newton, </em>280 Md. at 268, 373 A.2d 262, Judge Eldridge had held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Thus, <em>under </em>both federal double jeopardy principles and <em>Maryland merger law, the test </em>for determining the identity of offenses <em>is the required evidence </em>test. If each offense requires proof of a fact which the other does not, <em>the offenses </em>are not the same and <em>do not merge.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">In affirming this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brooks, </em>the Court of Appeals in its <em>Brooks v. State, </em>284 Md. at 417, 397 A.2d 596, was emphatic that it was dealing not with double jeopardy law primarily but with Maryland merger law generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The issue in this case is whether the \u201crequired evidence test\u201d or the \u201cactual evidence test\u201d is <em>the general standard under Maryland law for determining whether one criminal offense merges into another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Brooks himself was arguing that the Maryland merger test is broader than the double jeopardy test and should apply to convictions that \u201crest upon substantially identical \u2018actual evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">Brooks also appears to concede that this is the appropriate standard for deciding whether separate offenses should be treated as a single offense for double jeopardy purposes. <em>He argues, </em>however, <em>that the standard for determining merger of offenses is somewhat broader, and that if two convictions rest upon substantially identical \u2018actual evidence, \u2019 there should be a merger.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">284 Md. at 419, 397 A.2d 596 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">Citing a long line of Maryland cases stretching back to 1921, the Court of Appeals, 284 Md. at 420-21, 397 A.2d 596, pointed out that the actual evidence not only was not \u201cthe Maryland test for merger\u201d but never had been.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">To the extent that there may be a suggestion in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion in the instant case that, prior to our opinion last year in <em>Newton v. State, supra, </em>the \u2018actual evidence test\u2019 rather than the required evidence test was the general standard for determining merger of offenses in Maryland, such suggestion is erroneous. Moreover, <em>the cases do not support the defendant\u2019s contention that the actual evidence test is presently the Maryland test for merger. </em>On the contrary, <em>the cases in this Court have consistently taken the position that the general test for determining merger of offenses, as well as for deciding whether two offenses should be deemed the same for double jeopardy purposes, is the required evidence test.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">(Emphasis supplied). The \u201cactual evidence\u201d test and the \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d test are indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>It is inconceivable that <em>Newton </em>and <em>Brooks </em>have been overruled <em>sub silentio </em>by the stealth tactic of simply substituting \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d as a pseudonym for the long-rejected \u201cactual evidence\u201d test. In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \u201cIt\u2019s <em>deja vu </em>all over again.\u201d <em>Monoker, </em>of course, mentioned neither of those cases in that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">Cutting the Gordian Knot</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">We have reviewed merger pursuant to double jeopardy law and we hold that merger is not required. We have reviewed merger pursuant to the rule of lenity and we hold that merger is not required. We decline, however, to review the issue of merger pursuant to the so-called \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d test because we do not believe that it enjoys the procedural dispensation of Rule 4-345(a). We do not believe that a non-merged sentence pursuant to such a fluid test dependant upon a subjective evaluation of the particular evidence in a particular case is an inherently \u201cillegal sentence\u201d within the tightly limited contemplation of the rule. Neither <em>Monoker </em>nor <em>Marquardt </em>suggest otherwise, for in both of those cases the merger issue was raised on direct appeal and not via Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Alternatively, even if, <em>arguendo, </em>there is such a thing as the fundamental fairness test and even if the merits of this merger issue were, <em>arguendo, </em>before us, we believe it eminently clear that the two-to-three hour first-degree assault in this particular case was no mere incident of either the robbery or the false imprisonment. We hold that it does not merge into either of those convictions. By the same token, we hold that the false imprisonment that began long before the robbery was no mere incident of it, and, accordingly, would not merge into it. We affirm Judge Levitz in his denial of the appellant\u2019s Rule 4-345(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-10\">. The appellant similarly failed to raise these merger issues in his Motion for a New Trial before Judge Levitz on November 22, 2006, and at his subsequent hearing before a Sentence Review Panel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\">. As an appellate phenomenon, we note that it is frequently in the tail ends of opinions dealing more formally with something else that there first appear, for better or for worse, the creative sparks that will not fit within the standard definition of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
