These decisions, beginning with the case of Lawrence v. Fast, 20 Ill. 338, and repeated in Lane v. Bommelmann, 21 id. 143, Dukes v. Rowley, 24 id. 210, and four or five other cases, have established a rule of property in this State under which titles have been settled, and they should not now be disturbed. The question presented cannot be considered an open one in this court.</p> <p id=\"b367-10\" pgmap=\"367\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
