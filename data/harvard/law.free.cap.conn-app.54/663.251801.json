On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) concluded that the information sought by the defendant, Jonathan Benedict,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not protected by our statutory psychiatrist-patient privilege, (2) failed to apply the federal administrative regulations that were in effect at the time he received treatment for alcohol abuse and (3) determined that the state\u2019s delay in asserting its alleged right to information concerning his treatment for alcohol abuse did not violate his right to due process under the federal constitution. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to that court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. Sometime prior to March, 1978, the plaintiff was charged with driving while intoxicated in New York. To resolve that pending criminal charge, he was required to complete an alcohol treatment program at Elan, a treatment facility located in Poland Spring, Maine. The plaintiff was a resident at Elan from March 10,1978, until February 18,1980. At the time the plaintiff was admitted to Elan, it was licensed by the state of Maine, Bureau of Rehabilitation, Office of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, as a residential treatment facility. On August 1, 1979, the Maine department of mental health and corrections issued Elan a conditional license as a mental health facility, which remained effective through February 28, 1980. During the period in question, Elan received federal funding for its therapeutic program.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Elan was founded in 1970 by Gerald E. Davidson, a licensed psychiatrist, and Joseph Ricci. Davidson is now deceased. After Ricci had completed an addiction treatment program at Daytop, a treatment facility located in New Haven, he worked at Daytop and later joined Davidson in founding Elan. Davidson was the medical director at Elan and Ricci was the executive director and therapeutic director. The trial court found that during the period in question, except for Davidson, none of the staff members at Elan had any formal training, degrees or licenses in psychiatry, psychology or social work. Moreover, the trial court found that, aside from Davidson, few, if any, of the staff members were college graduates.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Davidson spent approximately one hour with each new student<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> upon admission and would meet with each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>student and the student\u2019s parents approximately six to nine months later. The scope of diagnosis or treatment at these meetings is unknown. Davidson visited Elan\u2019s campus for relatively limited periods since he maintained a practice and resided in Boston, Massachusetts. The trial court found that Davidson visited Elan \u201cat most two or three times a week, sometimes less, and not usually any more . . . [and that] he was very rarely an active participant in the therapeutic program.\u201d The staff, under the guidance of Ricci, handled the day-today operations at Elan.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The trial court found that \u201cElan and Daytop are known as therapeutic communities based on behavior modification by self-help with other residents by methods similar to those of Alcoholics Anonymous but with a full-time residential setting.\u201d In describing the therapeutic program at Elan, the trial court stated that a new student began by performing menial housekeeping duties under the supervision of a more senior student and staff member. Each weekday, approximately eight to ten students of varying degrees of seniority, with staff supervision, participated in group discussions. \u201cThe object of these meetings [was] to share problems and answers to problems based on the experiences of the participants. The shared experiences were to be treated as confidential between the participants.\u201d Davidson rarely participated and Ricci occasionally took part in these sessions. On some occasions, students and staff members participated in disciplinary rather than therapeutic sessions called \u201cgeneral meetings\u201d or \u201chaircuts.\u201d There was no indication that the plaintiffs therapeutic treatment differed from that of the other students at Elan.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">The state has appointed a grand jury to investigate the 1975 death of Martha Moxley, which occurred in Greenwich. In connection with this proceeding, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>state subpoenaed Ricci and Peter McCann, a staff member at Elan, to testify before the grand jury. On or about October 16, 1998, the plaintiff filed an application for injunctive relief seeking permanently to enjoin the state from compelling Ricci and McCann to testify or produce any records relating to his treatment at Elan. The plaintiff claimed that all of the foregoing information was privileged and that it could not be disclosed absent his consent. He also petitioned the trial court to order that all communications, both written and oral, between him and anyone else at Elan should not be disclosed to the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Ricci refused to testify before the grand jury, claiming that the information requested by the state was privileged. Thereafter, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a, the state filed a motion to compel Ricci to testify. The trial court consolidated the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief and the state\u2019s motion to compel. By an oral memorandum of decision, dated December 10,1998, the trial court denied the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief, but granted the state\u2019s motion to compel. The trial court ordered Ricci to testify before the grand jury concerning any statements made by the plaintiff in his presence or that were reported to him, excluding any statements the plaintiff made to Davidson, that related to the plaintiffs knowledge, if any, concerning the circumstances surrounding the death of Moxley. On December 29, 1998, the plaintiff timely filed this appeal. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary to a resolution of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that his communications at Elan, both written and oral, could be disclosed to the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>because this information was not protected by our statutory psychiatrist-patient privilege. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d through 52-146j.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his application for injunctive relief, filed pursuant to \u00a7 52-146j, the plaintiff claimed that the information sought by the state was privileged under our psychiatrist-patient privilege. In determining whether the law of this state or the state of Maine governed the plaintiffs claim of privilege, the trial court concluded, and neither party disputes, that the law of this state controls. Accordingly, we will assume without deciding that Connecticut law governs this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The trial court denied the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief, in part, because the information sought by the state was not protected by the psychiatrist-patient privilege. The trial court stated that in order for the plaintiff to invoke the protections afforded by General Statutes \u00a7 52-146e, he must satisfy two conditions. First, he must establish that Elan was a \u201cmental health facility\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (5). Second, he must demonstrate that the communications and records related to the diagnosis or treatment of a \u201cmental condition\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (2). The trial court concluded that the plaintiff satisfied neither of these statutory prerequisites to the invocation of the privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that Elan was not a mental health facility within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (5). We need not reach this issue because we conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision was improperly predicated on the conclusion that, as a condition precedent to the invocation of the psychiatrist-patient privilege, \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d and 52-146e required the plaintiff to establish that Elan was a mental health facility within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated: \u201cWhat occurred here, in the court\u2019s opinion, was residential treatment in a therapeutic community for substance abuse; and ... I find that [the plaintiff has] not sustained [his] burden of proving that Elan\u2014as I have found the facts: that [the] staff being all laypersons except for Dr. Davidson\u2014was a mental hospital or, I am sorry, a mental health facility. \u201d The trial court denied the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief, in part, because the plaintiff \u201cfailed to satisfy the court that the organization of Elan at the time was to the degree of meeting, shall we say, a threshold of being a mental health facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In reaching this conclusion, the trial court decided that, as a condition precedent to the invocation of the psychiatrist-patient privilege, \u00a7\u00a7 52-146d and 52-146e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>required the plaintiff to establish that Elan was a mental health facility within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (5). \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 458, 704 A.2d 222 (1997); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). When interpreting a statute, we are guided by well established tenets of statutory construction. \u201cOur fundamental objective when construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 295, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997); <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 663-64, 680 A.2d 242 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">We begin our analysis with an examination of the text of the relevant statutes. <em>Herbert S. Newman &amp; Partners, P. C. </em>v. <em>CFC Construction Ltd. Partnership, </em>236 Conn. 750, 756, 674 A.2d 1313 (1996). Section 52-146e (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAll communications and records as defined in section 52-146d shall be confidential and shall be subject to the provisions of sections 52-146d to 52-146j, inclusive. . . Section 52-146d (2) provides: \u201c \u2018Communications and records\u2019 means all oral and written communications and records thereof relating to diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s mental condition between the patient and a psychiatrist, or between a member of the patient\u2019s family and a psychiatrist, or between any of such persons and a person participating under the supervision of a psychiatrist in the accomplishment of the objectives of diagnosis and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>treatment, <em>wherever made, including communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 52-146d (5) defines mental health facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The trial court properly concluded that \u00a7 52-146e (a) extends the privilege to \u201ccommunications and records\u201d as defined in \u00a7 52-146d (2). Several factors establish, however, that the trial court improperly construed \u00a7 52-146d (2) as extending the privilege only to communications and records that occur in or axe prepared at a mental health facility as defined in \u00a7 52-146d (5). First, the text of \u00a7 52-146d (2) explicitly provides that the privilege covers communications and records relating to the diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s mental condition, between certain designated parties, \u201cwherever made.\u201d Because \u201cwherever\u201d is not defined either in \u00a7 52-146d or in chapter 899 of the General Statutes, it is appropriate to look to the commonly approved meaning of this word. \u201cThe words used in a statute must be given their commonly approved meaning, unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of America, </em>225 Conn. 566, 570, 624 A.2d 892 (1993); <em>Dubaldo </em>v. <em>Dept. of Consumer Protection, </em>209 Conn. 719, 722, 522 A.2d 813 (1989). \u201cWherever\u201d is defined as \u201cat, in, or to any or all places that: in any circumstance in which.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. In the absence of any indication that the legislature intended to give \u201cwherever\u201d a different meaning, we will utilize the commonly approved meaning of this word. The legislature\u2019s use of the expansive words \u201cwherever made\u201d reflects that it did not intend the privilege to govern only those oral and written communications that occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Second, \u201cwherever made\u201d is immediately followed by the phrase \u201cincluding communications and records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2). Although our Supreme Court has \u201crecognized in the past that the words include and including can be considered as words of limitation as well as enlargement\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 435, 668 A.2d 348 (1995); <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 147, 480 A.2d 519 (1984); application of a well established tenet of statutory construction suggests that the legislature used \u201cincluding communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility\u201d as an illustrative application of \u201cwherever made\u201d and not to limit its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">\u201cWe presume that the legislature had a purpose for each sentence, clause or phrase in a legislative enactment, and that it did not intend to enact meaningless provisions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg.

Accordingly, care must be taken to effectuate all provisions of the statute.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v.

If we interpreted \u00a7 52-146d (2) as extending the psychiatrist-patient privilege only to communications and records between designated parties that occurred in or were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>prepared at a mental health facility, we would render meaningless the phrase \u201cwherever made.\u201d To avoid this result, we interpret \u201cincluding communications and records which occur in or are prepared at a mental health facility\u201d as an illustrative application of \u201cwherever made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">We conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that the plaintiff was required to establish that Elan was a mental health facility as defined in \u00a7 52-146d (5) as a condition precedent to the invocation of the psychiatrist-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Although we decided in part IA of this opinion that the trial court improperly concluded that the psychiatrist-patient privilege extends only to communications and records that occur in or were prepared at a mental health facility, we need not reverse the judgment of the trial court if we conclude that it properly determined that the plaintiff failed to establish that the information sought by the state constituted \u201coral and written communications and records . . . relating to diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s <em>mental condition </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2). We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiff failed to satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court stated: \u201c[F]or the petitioner to prevail under \u00a7 52-146d, it is [his] burden of proof to show that . . . these records were in relationship to a patient\u2019s mental condition . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded: \u201cI find that [the plaintiff] has not sustained [his] burden of proving . . . that the communications were related to a patient\u2019s mental condition.\u201d The trial court concluded that the plaintiff attended Elan not for the diagnosis or treatment of a mental condition within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (2), but rather solely for the diagnosis or treatment of alcohol abuse. In reaching this decision, the trial court inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>preted the statute to mean that an alcohol related disorder did not constitute a mental condition within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (2). As such, because the state was not seeking disclosure of information that related to the diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s mental condition, the trial court concluded that the information sought by the state did not fall within the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">As we have already demonstrated, \u00a7 52-146e (a) extends the psychiatrist-patient privilege to \u201ccommunications and records\u201d as defined in \u00a7 52-146d (2). \u201c \u2018Communications and records\u2019 means all oral and written communications and records thereof relating to diagnosis or treatment of a patient\u2019s <em>mental condition . </em>. . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2). The plaintiff claims that several factors establish that alcohol related disorders constitute a mental condition within the meaning of \u00a7 52-146d (2). On August 1, 1979, the state of Maine issued Elan a conditional license as a mental health facility and this license remained effective through February 28,1980. He also claims that the psychiatric community recognizes alcohol related disorders as a mental condition. The state contends that, despite the views of the state of Maine and the psychiatric community, our legislature did not intend to include alcohol related disorders within the meaning of \u201cmental condition\u201d in \u00a7 52-146d (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The determination as to whether communications and records relating to the diagnosis or treatment of an alcohol related disorder fall within the ambit of a \u201cmental condition\u201d in \u00a7 52-146d (2) presents a question of statutory inteipretation. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 458. As we already have stated, our interpretation is guided by well established tenets of statutory construction. See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 295; <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>supra, 238 Conn. 663-64. We begin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>our analysis with the words of the statute itself. Neither \u00a7 52-146d nor chapter 899 of the General Statutes defines mental condition. Nor is the meaning of this term readily apparent from its context. Although our examination of the legislative history to \u00a7 52-146d (2) did not disclose any information useful in resolving this issue, application of several tenets of statutory construction provide us with guidance in ascertaining the meaning the legislature attributed to this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">First, \u201c[t]he legislature is quite aware of how to use language when it wants to express its intent to qualify or limit the operation of a statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>43 Conn. App. 801, 825, 687 A.2d 1279 (1996), cert. denied, 240 Conn. 908, 689 A.2d 472 (1997). If the legislature had wanted to exclude alcohol related disorders from the category of mental conditions protected by our state\u2019s psychiatrist-patient privilege, it could easily have done so. Neither the text or legislative history of \u00a7 52-146d (2), nor chapter 899 of the General Statutes excludes alcohol related disorders or places any limitation on the scope of the term mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Second, the doctrine of <em>pari materia </em>provides that \u201cstatutes relating to the same subject matter may be looked to for guidance in reaching an understanding of the meaning of a statutory term.\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 58, 392 A.2d 491 (1978); <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Dept. of Correction, </em>221 Conn. 41, 45, 601 A.2d 539 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 515, 523 A.2d 1252 (1986). Chapter 319j of the General Statutes, which is entitled \u201cAddiction Services,\u201d is contained in title 17a, which is entitled \u201cSocial and Human Services.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 17a-688 (c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which is contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>chapter 319j, requires persons, hospitals, treatment facilities and the department of mental health and addiction services to comply with federal confidentiality laws and regulations concerning alcohol and drug patient records. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-680, which is also contained in chapter 319j and governs General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17a-680 through 17a-690, sets forth several definitions. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-680 (1) provides that \u201c \u2018[a]lcohol-dependent person\u2019 means a person who has a psychoactive substance dependence on alcohol as that condition is defined in the most recent edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s \u2018Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The text of \u00a7 17a-688 (c) manifests our legislature\u2019s intention to afford confidentiality to the records of individuals who seek diagnosis or treatment for alcohol related disorders by mandating compliance with \u201cfederal statutes concerning confidentiality of alcohol . . . patient records and any regulations pursuant thereto . . . .\u201d Of greater significance, \u00a7 17a-680(l) reflects our legislature\u2019s awareness of the mental or psychological aspect of many alcohol related disorders and its recognition that the psychiatric community regards many of such disorders as mental disorders.

See <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>supra, 241 Conn. 295. \u201c[W]e interpret statutory language in light of the purpose and policy behind the enactment.\u201d <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., 245 </em>Conn. 1, 26, 717 A.2d 77 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pieger, </em>240 Conn. 639, 646, 692 A.2d 1273 (1997). \u201c[T]he purpose of the privilege is to give the patient an incentive to make full disclosure to a physician in order to obtain effective treatment free from the embarrassment and invasion of privacy which could result from a doctor\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 234-35, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S. Ct. 469, 46 L. Ed. 2d 399 (1975); see <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>190 Conn. 813, 819, 462 A.2d 1060 (1983). This statutory privilege ensures the patient that confidential communications that are necessary for effective treatment or diagnosis may be safely disclosed to a psychiatrist. See <em>Bieluch </em>v. <em>Bieluch, </em>supra, 819. Interpreting mental condition in \u00a7 52-146d (2) to include alcohol related disorders would effectuate the legislature\u2019s objective by providing individuals who suffer from such disorders with an incentive to seek treatment and to make a full disclosure to a psychiatrist. In contrast, the trial court\u2019s interpretation frustrates that objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Lastly, although the following information does not provide any insight into the legislative intent underlying \u00a7 52-146d (2), we note for illustrative purposes only that our interpretation of this statute is consistent with dictum from this court and our Supreme Court. An examination of our case law discloses that individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>who suffer from alcohol related disorders often seek psychiatric treatment and we have referred in dictum to communications and records made in the course of seeking such treatment as \u201cpsychiatric communications and records.\u201d \u201cThe people of this state enjoy a broad privilege in the confidentiality of their psychiatric communications and records, <em>including those pertaining to their diagnosis, prognosis or treatment for alcohol abuse or alcoholism. </em>See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-155bb (b), <em>52-146d, 52-146e.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 55, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 478, 625 A.2d 791 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>33 Conn. App. 647, 654, 637 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 910, 642 A.2d 1206 (1994). Moreover, our interpretation of \u00a7 52-146d (2) is consistent with decisions from other jurisdictions that have, under different circumstances, viewed alcohol abuse or alcoholism as a disease. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>548 F.2d 239, 244 (8th Cir. 1977) (\u201c[w]e are not so Victorian as to be indifferent to the expanding theoiy of alcoholism being a disease\u201d); <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Industry, Labor &amp; Human Relations, </em>86 Wis. 2d 393, 407, 273 N.W.2d 206 (1979) (\u201c[ajlcoholism is a disease [and] [i]ts diagnosis is a matter of expert medical opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The state claims that our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>203 Conn. 641, 652-58, 526 A.2d 1283 (1987), establishes that the psychiatrist-patient privilege does not protect any communications or records relating to the diagnosis or treatment of alcohol related disorders. The state\u2019s reliance on <em>Rollinson </em>is misplaced. In <em>Rollinson, </em>the defendant claimed that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress several statements he made to the staff and patients of a hospital\u2019s detoxification unit. Id., 652. The Supreme Court did not determine whether this statutory privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>extended to communications and records relating to the diagnosis or treatment of alcohol related disorders because the defendant \u201c[c]onced[ed] that none of these statements [fell] expressly within the statutory privilege of confidential communications with a psychiatrist or a psychologist . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. We decline to transform the defendant\u2019s concession in <em>Rollinson </em>into a legal conclusion that all records and communications relating to the diagnosis or treatment of alcohol related disorders do not fall within the psychiatrist-patient privilege. On the basis of all of the foregoing factors, we conclude that the trial court improperly concluded that an alcohol related disorder did not fall within the meaning of \u201cmental condition\u201d in \u00a7 52-146d (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We conclude, therefore, that both of the factors the trial court relied on in rejecting the plaintiffs claim of privilege were improper. Because the trial court disposed of this claim on both of those grounds, it did not determine whether the plaintiff satisfied the remaining criteria necessary to invoke the psychiatrist-patient privilege. For example, the trial court did not determine whether any of the communications and records sought by the state were related \u201cto diagnosis or treatment\u201d of the plaintiffs alcohol related condition. General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2). Nor did the trial court determine whether any of the communications and records sought by the state were made \u201cbetween the patient and a psychiatrist, or between a member of the patient\u2019s family and a psychiatrist, <em>or between any of such persons and a person participating under the supervision of a psychiatrist in the accomplishment of the objectives of diagnosis and treatment </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 52-146d (2). We, therefore, reverse so much of the trial court's decision as pertains to this issue and remand the case to the trial court with the direction that it determine whether the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>satisfied the remaining criteria necessary to invoke the statutory psychiatrist-patient privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly failed to apply the federal administrative regulations, which afford confidentiality to alcohol patient records, that were in effect at the time he received treatment at Elan. See 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.1 et seq. Those regulations were enacted pursuant to the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970, now codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290dd-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">As a threshold matter, the state claims that we cannot review this claim because the plaintiff cited neither the federal act and regulations nor \u00a7 17a-688 (c), which requires the state to comply with the federal act and regulations, in his application for injunctive relief. We do not agree and conclude that, after a careful examination of the record in light of relevant precedent, the plaintiffs noncompliance with Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) does not preclude us from reviewing this claim in the context of deciding his appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his application for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to a resolution of this issue. In his application for injunctive relief, dated October 16, 1998, the plaintiff did not cite the federal act and regulations or \u00a7 17a-688 (c). In paragraph 5 (c) of the \u201cstate\u2019s brief in opposition to [the plaintiffs] motion for injunctive relief,\u201d dated November 5, 1998, the state conceded that the disclosure of records relating to the diagnosis or treatment of substance abuse is controlled by the federal act and regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>tions, but claimed that for several reasons the plaintiff was not entitled to relief under this body of law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In paragraph 5 (c) of the \u201caddendum to the state\u2019s brief in opposition to the [the plaintiffs] motion for injunctive relief,\u201d filed December 1, 1998, the state claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>the information it sought fell within an exception to the protections afforded by the federal act and regulations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On December 9, 1998, each of the parties presented arguments to the trial court. The record discloses that Benedict represented the state, John Campbell represented Ricci and Elan, and both Linda Kenney and Michael Sherman represented the plaintiff. Benedict neither claimed, nor does the record disclose, that his arguments concerning the federal act and regulations related solely to the trial court\u2019s disposition of the state\u2019s motion to compel. Kenney, who represented only the plaintiff, claimed that the plaintiff was entitled to relief under the federal act and regulations, and the record discloses that the state did not claim that the plaintiffs failure to cite the federal act and regulations or \u00a7 17a-688 (c) in his application for injunctive relief precluded him from relying on this body of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In its memorandum of decision, dated December 10, 1998, the trial court addressed both the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief and the state\u2019s motion to compel. Several excerpts from the memorandum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>decision reflect that the trial court addressed both the statutory psychiatrist-patient privilege and federal law in its disposition of the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">The following principles govern our review. Practice Book \u00a7 10-3 (a) provides that \u201c[w]hen any claim made in a complaint, cross complaint, special defense, or other pleading is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number.\u201d Our Supreme Court has repeatedly stated, however, that \u00a7 10-3 (a) is merely directory and not mandatory. <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Stonington, </em>225 Conn. 217, 221 n.7, 622 A.2d 551 (1993); <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>217 Conn. 340, 345, 586 A.2d 567 (1991); <em>Rowe v. Godou, </em>209 Conn. 273, 275, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988). We have excused noncompliance with \u00a7 10-3 (a) where the record discloses that neither the opposing party nor the trial court were confused or misled as to the statutory basis of the party\u2019s claim. See <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>supra, 345 (\u201c[i]n the absence of any showing that either Hanover or the trial court was misled by the failure to cite [General Statutes] \u00a7 38-100 in addition to [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 38-97 and 38-98, we conclude that the issue raised by Fireman\u2019s special defense was properly before the court\u201d); <em>Goodrich </em>v. <em>Diodato, </em>48 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>App. 436, 443, 710 A.2d 818 (1998) (\u201c [although the defendant did not specifically refer to [General Statutes] \u00a7 47-21 in her special defense, the defendant sufficiently apprised the trial court of her special defense of ouster\u201d); <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>13 Conn. App. 101, 104, 535 A.2d 364 (1987) (\u201cthere can be no confusion about the basis for the plaintiffs cause of action, and there can be no doubt that General Statutes \u00a7 47-31 served as the basis for the plaintiffs action to quiet title\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In the present case, the foregoing precedent establishes that the plaintiffs noncompliance with \u00a7 10-3 (a) does not preclude our review of this claim because the record discloses that neither the state nor the trial court were confused or misled as to the basis for the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief. The state cannot claim that it was confused or misled by the plaintiffs noncompliance with \u00a7 10-3 (a) because, as evidenced by the state\u2019s responsory memoranda, the plaintiffs allegations were sufficient to apprise the state of his reliance on federal law. In both its memorandum of law in opposition to the application for injunctive relief and its addendum to that memorandum, the state argued that the federal act and regulations did not protect the information in question from disclosure. Moreover, during arguments before the trial court, Kenney, who represented only the plaintiff, apprised both the state and the trial court of her client\u2019s reliance on federal law. Our review of this claim is therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The state next claims that, even if the plaintiffs noncompliance with \u00a7 10-3 (a) does not preclude our review of this claim, the plaintiff cannot file an application for injunctive relief seeking to enforce the protections afforded by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290dd-2 and the corresponding federal regulations. We disagree and conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>\u00a7 17a-688 (c),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which mandates that the state comply with this federal act and these federal regulations, impliedly authorizes the plaintiff to maintain a private right of action for injunctive relief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The text of \u00a7 17a-688 (c) does not explicitly authorize a private right of action for injunctive relief. \u201cIn determining whether a private remedy is implicit in a statute not expressly providing one, several factors are relevant. First, is the plaintiff one of the class for whose . . . benefit the statute was enacted . . . ? Second, is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create such a remedy or to deny one? . . . Third, is it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy for the plaintiff? . . . <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1975).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 249-50, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>First, the plaintiff, who sought treatment for alcohol abuse, is a member of the class for whose benefit the legislature enacted \u00a7 17a-688 (c). \u201c[0]ur legislature has expressly addressed the issue of confidentiality of records by protecting records whose disclosure \u2018would constitute a violation of federal statutes concerning confidentiality of alcohol or drug patient records and any regulations pursuant thereto . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 17a-688 (c).\u201d <em>In re Marvin M., </em>48 Conn. App. 563, 576, 711 A.2d 756, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 916, 719 A.2d 900 (1998). In \u00a7 17a-688 (c), our legislature afforded protection to the class of individuals who seek diagnosis or treatment for alcohol related disorders by mandating that all persons, hospitals, treatment facilities and the department of mental health and addiction services must comply with federal law and regulations concerning the confidentiality of alcohol patient records.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Second, we do not find any indication, explicit or implicit, in the legislative history that the legislature intended either to deny or to create a private right of action for injunctive relief. The legislative histoiy is silent in this respect. Third, providing a private right of action to the plaintiff is consistent with the underlying purposes of \u00a7 17a-688 (c). Authorizing this right of action would enable those for whose benefit the statute was enacted to protect the rights our legislature has afforded them. Additionally, the existence of a private enforcement mechanism would encourage and promote compliance with the statute\u2019s directives. We are persuaded that, under the criteria set forth in <em>Cart </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 78, a private right of action for injunctive relief exists under \u00a7 17a-688 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Moreover, our conclusion derives additional support from our legislature\u2019s failure to allocate the responsibility of enforcing \u00a7 17a-688 (c) to an administrative agency or other governmental entity. \u201c[W]here the legislature wishes to limit enforcement of a statute to an administrative body, it has expressly done so.\u201d <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 251. In the present case, the legislature neither explicitly nor implicitly vested enforcement power with an administrative body. Nor did it explicitly or implicitly vest enforcement power in the criminal justice system. The legislature has not stated that a violation of \u00a7 17a-688 (c) may result in a fine or incarceration or both. The absence of any enforcement mechanism militates in favor of authorizing a private right of action, thereby enabling those for whose benefit this statute was enacted to protect the rights conferred upon them by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The state next claims that we cannot review the plaintiffs claim because he did not appeal from a final judgment of the trial court. Specifically, the state contends that the portion of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, which addresses the federal act and regulations, relates solely to the trial court\u2019s disposition of its motion to compel. It therefore characterizes the plaintiffs claim as an appeal from the denial of the state\u2019s motion to compel. Although the state conceded at oral argument that the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiffs application for permanent injunctive relief constitutes an appealable final judgment, it claims that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the state\u2019s motion to compel is not an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The state\u2019s argument presupposes, however, that the plaintiffs failure to cite the federal act and regulations or \u00a7 17a-688 (c) in his application for injunctive relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>precludes this court from construing that portion of the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, which addresses the federal act and regulations, as relating to the disposition of both the plaintiffs application for injunctive relief and the state\u2019s motion to compel. As we have already demonstrated, a careful examination of the entire record in light of \u00a7 10-3 (a) and relevant precedent establishes that the plaintiffs failure to cite the federal act and regulations or \u00a7 17a-688 (c) in his application for injunctive relief does not preclude this court from reviewing this issue in the context of deciding his appeal from the denial of that application. Because we review this issue in the context of deciding the plaintiffs appeal from the denial of his application for injunctive relief and the trial court\u2019s denial of that application constitutes an appealable final judgment, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the state\u2019s motion to compel constitutes an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Having determined that the plaintiffs federal law claim is properly before us, we now reach its merits. The plaintiff contends that the trial court improperly applied the current federal regulations instead of those regulations that were in effect at the time he received treatment at Elan between 1978 and 1980. Although the plaintiff claims that the trial court should have applied the regulations that were in effect when he received treatment, he briefed and analyzed only 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.63 and 2.65. We therefore limit our review to these two regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Section 2.65 governs any application by an investigative or prosecutorial agency for an order to permit disclosure or use of patient records for the purpose of conducting an investigation or prosecution of an individual who is a present or former patient in a program. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65 (a). Section 2.65 (d), formerly \u00a7 2.65 (c), sets forth several criteria that the applicant must satisfy in order to obtain use or disclosure of a patient\u2019s records. The plaintiff concedes that \u201c[o]n appeal, [he] does not challenge the trial court\u2019s application of the balancing test\u201d under \u00a7 2.65 (d) and that the criteria in \u00a7 2.65 (c) are \u201csimilar to those applied by the trial court\u201d under \u00a7 2.65 (d). Moreover, he concedes that \u201c[t]he current regulations are very similar, and in some cases identical, to the older regulations, with the exception of the more restrictive rule [\u00a7 2.63] . . . forbidding disclosure of anything except objective data, even where \u2018good cause\u2019 for disclosure is found.\u201d In the absence of any showing by the plaintiff that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s application of the current version of \u00a7 2.65, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s reliance on this regulation was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The plaintiff next contends that the \u201ckey provision of the 1978 regulations\u201d is \u00a7 2.63. Section 2.63 was promulgated in 1975; 40 Fed. Reg. 27802 (1975); <em>Whyte </em>v. <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>818 F.2d 1005, 1010 n.14 (1st Cir. 1987); and it imposed certain limitations on the scope of disclosure. \u201cCongress recognized that . . . confidentiality is necessary to ensure successful alcoholism treatment. Without guarantees of confidentiality, many individuals with alcohol problems would be reluctant to participate fully in alcoholism programs. The regulations, especially \u00a7 2.63, were specifically drafted with these considerations in mind.\u201d <em>Whyte </em>v. <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 1010. In 1987, the Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service amended \u00a7 2.63. See 52 Fed. Reg., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, pp. 21,801-21,802 (June 9, 1987) (discussing substantive changes brought about by 1987 amendment to \u00a7 2.63). This amendment established several exceptions to the pre-1987 version of \u00a7 2.63, which had limited court-ordered disclosure to objective data.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>The plaintiff contends that there is no authority to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the current version of \u00a7 2.63, which was amended in 1987, must be applied retroactively. \u201c[T]he presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence, and embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic. Elementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly; settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted. For that reason, the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 265, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994). \u201cRetroactivity is not favored in the law. Thus, congressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.\u201d <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Georgetown University Hospital, </em>488 U.S. 204, 208, 109 S. Ct. 468, 102 L.

App. 31, 41, 645 A.2d 549 (1994) (\u201cas rule of construction, legislation to be applied prospectively absent clear intent to contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The state neither cites in its appellate brief, nor does our review of the relevant portions of the Federal Register disclose, any clear indication that the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service intended the 1987 amendment of \u00a7 2.63, which effectuated substantive changes, to be applied retroactively. See 52 Fed. Reg., Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, pp. 21,796-21,814,41,996-97, 42,061 (1987). In the absence of any clear evidence that this administrative agency intended the 1987 amendment to be applied retroactively, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s reliance on the current version of \u00a7 2.63 was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We, therefore, reverse so much of the trial court\u2019s decision as pertains to this claim and remand the case to the trial court with the direction that it apply the appropriate version of \u00a7 2.63 in determining whether disclosure of the information sought by the state is warranted.

Substance Abuse Therapy Privilege</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">\u201cWhile apparently not all residents at Elan even attended for the purpose of substance abuse therapy, the institution was licensed to render that type of service during the [plaintiffs] stay. If the court were to conclude that substance abuse therapy was the purpose of the peer encounter meetings, communications made therein are not protected by either jurisdiction\u2019s psychiatrist-patient privilege. <em>State v.

In Connecticut confidentiality is only given to [a] treatment center\u2019s records and is not extended to \u2018personal observations\u2019 made without recourse to records. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, [169 Conn.] 236.

The applicable federal regulation has defined good cause to include an extremely serious crime such as homicide. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.65. Most importantly, this exception has been specifically recognized in such a situation on a local level. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>supra, [203 Conn.] 654-56; see also <em>In re Marvin M., </em>48 Conn.

The trial court stated: \u201cIt is the burden of the person seeking the privilege to prove the applicability of the statutory privilege, and we actually have two statutes that we have to concern ourselves with, or two bodies of law we have to concern ourselves with; and that is the laws of the State of Connecticut which may relate to privileged communications, and also the laws of this United States concerning the privilege [d] communications that may occur in certain therapeutic settings. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">\u201cThus, we must address the laws of the State of Connecticut and applicable federal law to determine if any of those verbal communications of [the plaintiff] at Elan are privileged based on applicable statutes, since without a statutory privilege they would be discoverable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b708-6\"> See footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> In reaching this conclusion, it is necessary to emphasize that we determine only whether our legislature, by mandating in \u00a7 17a-688 (c) that all persons, hospitals, treatment facilities and the department of mental health and addiction services shall not violate \u201cfederal statutes concerning confidentiality of alcohol or drug patient records and any regulations pursuant thereto,\u201d impliedly authorized a private right of action for injunctive relief. Because we conclude that \u00a7 17a-688 (c) confers a private right of action affording injunctive relief, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290dd-2 or the corresponding federal regulations authorize aprivate right of action. Additionally, our holding is limited to the conclusion that \u00a7 17a-688 (c) authorizes the plaintiff to maintain a right of action for injunctive relief. We express no opinion concerning whether this statute affords a private right of action for monetary damages or other remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> The United States Supreme Court lists a fourth factor in <em>Cort v. Ash, </em>supra, 422 U.S. 78, namely, whether \u201cthe cause of action [is] one traditionally relegated to state law, in an area basically the concern of the States, so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based solely on federal law?\u201d In <em>Napoletano </em>v. <em>CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 238 Conn. 250 n.32, our Supreme Court held that it was unnecessary to apply this fourth factor in determining whether a state statute impliedly authorized a private remedy. Because our analysis is limited to the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>whether \u00a7 17a-688 (c) authorizes a private right of action for injunctive relief, and we do not determine whether 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 290dd-2 and the corresponding federal regulations authorize this remedy, the fourth <em>Cort </em>factor does not apply to our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\"> \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an. inadequate brief.\u201d <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Giacomi, </em>242 Conn. 17, 44-45, 699 A.2d 101 (1997). \u201cWhere a claim is asserted in the statement of issues but thereafter receives only cursory attention in the brief without substantive discussion or citation of authorities, it is deemed to be abandoned.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Twin Tool Mfg.

We properly reserve tire determination of this issue for the trial court on remand. We also decline the state\u2019s invital ion to render an advisory opinion concerning the scope of the protection, if any, afforded by this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The state also maintains that the pre-1987 version of \u00a7 2.63 is void because it conflicts with its enabling legislation. Specifically, it claims that \u201cif \u00a7 2.63 of the 1978 regulations is broadly read as prohibiting the disclosure of [the plaintiffs] statements, and, contrary to the contention of the state, those to whom he spoke are considered program personnel, the trial court order should nevertheless be upheld. Interpreting' this regulation so as to prohibit disclosure of any part of a patient\u2019s record, despite the requisite findings regarding \u2018cause,\u2019 would fatally conflict with the plain language of the [enabling] statute.\u201d The state\u2019s contention that the pre-1987 version of \u00a7 2.63 conflicts with the enabling statute is predicated on its assumption that either this court or the trial court have interpreted or will interpret \u00a7 2.63 \u201cas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>prohibiting the disclosure of [the plaintiffs] statements and . . .

Because the conditions that undergird the state\u2019s claim have not yet occurred, or may never occur, this claim is premature. Therefore, we will not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
