Reider, Jr., insurance commissioner of the state of Connecticut (commissioner), appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment reversing his decision ordering the plaintiff, Reliance Insurance Company (Reliance), to pay a loss under a manufacturer\u2019s output insurance policy issued by Reliance to Mariano Brothers, Inc. (Mariano). The commissioner claims that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) the coverages under the policy were severable and (2) Reliance\u2019s failure to file timely notice of cancellation with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state department of transportation did not extend the cancellation date of the entire policy. We agree and reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">The facts as set out in the memorandum of findings and recommendation issued by the insurance department hearing officer, on which the commissioner relied, are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows. In August, 1994, Reliance renewed and issued to Mariano, an interstate motor carrier, three insurance policies effective July 27, 1994, to July 27, 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of these policies, the manufacturer\u2019s output policy, contained various coverage provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Mariano financed that policy and the other two policies through a premium financing agreement with A.I. Credit Corporation (finance company). Pursuant to that agreement, the finance company was appointed as Mariano\u2019s attomey-in-fact, with authority to cancel the policies for nonpayment of premiums. In the event of nonpayment, the agreement required the finance company to mail notice of its intent to cancel a policy to Mariano, after which Mariano would have ten days to cure the overdue premiums to prevent cancellation of a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On November 2, 1994, the finance company mailed Mariano notice of its intent to cancel all three insurance policies because of Mariano\u2019s failure to pay premiums. A notice of cancellation was subsequently mailed to Mariano and Reliance on November 16, 1994, with an effective date of November 17, 1994, unless the unpaid premiums were paid in full on or before that date. Mariano did not pay the overdue premiums, and the policies were canceled on November 17, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">On January 3, 1995, the finance company directed Reliance to reinstate all three of the policies previously canceled because Mariano had then paid the overdue premiums. Reliance refused to reinstate the manufacturer\u2019s output policy. Reliance notified Mariano\u2019s insurance broker on January 12, 1995, that that policy remained canceled as of November 17, 1994, and that coverage would not be reinstated until Reliance received deductible reimbursements from Mariano.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reliance indicated that once the reimbursements were received, a thirty day binder would be issued to allow the broker time to obtain other insurance for Mariano.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>After Mariano paid the outstanding deductible amounts to Reliance, Reliance issued the thirty day binder, which provided coverage under the manufacturer\u2019s output policy through February 26, 1995. That coverage was then extended to March 12, 1995. On March 31, 1995, the finance company issued to Mariano and Rebanee another notice of cancebation for ab three pobcies for nonpayment of premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On April 4,1995, Mariano\u2019s warehouse sustained damage from a windstorm. On April 11, 1995, the finance company requested that Rebanee reinstate the pobcies because the finance company had received the delinquent premiums from Mariano. On that same date, Rebanee notified the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state department of transportation of its cancebation of the motor carrier portion of Mariano\u2019s manufacturer\u2019s output pobey. On April 21, 1995, the Interstate Commerce Commission notified Mariano that effective May 13, 1995, Mariano\u2019s certificate of insurance for cargo coverage would be canceled. Rebanee informed the finance company in a letter dated May 9, 1995, that the manufacturer\u2019s output pobey had not been reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Rebanee ultimately denied coverage for Mariano\u2019s claim regarding the windstorm damage to his warehouse. On May 17, 1995, Mariano filed a letter of complaint with the state department of insurance. Fobowing an investigation, the commissioner issued a cease and desist order against Reliance on November 7, 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rebanee then requested a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-19, which was held on January 22, 1997. The department hearing officer issued a decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>February 20, 1997, concluding that the finance company\u2019s November 16, 1994 notice of cancellation failed to effect cancellation because timely notice had not been sent to the Interstate Commerce Commission, as required by 49 C.F.R. 1043.7 (d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 38a-170 (a) and (d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is undisputed that Reliance did not notify either the state department of transportation or the Interstate Commerce Commission of the cancellation until April 11, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In an order issued February 21, 1997, the commissioner adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings and recommendations, modified his November 7, 1996 order and directed Reliance to \u201chonor all of its contractual obligations under [the manufacturer\u2019s output policy] through May 13,1995, due to Reliance\u2019s failure to strictly comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>with [General Statutes] \u00a7 38a-170 (d).\u201d Reliance appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the trial court, and the trial court reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">As a threshold matter, it is well established that \u201c[t]he standard of review in appeals from the decisions of administrative agencies is clearly delineated. Judicial review of [an administrative agency\u2019s] action is . . . very restricted. . . . With regard to questions of fact, it is neither the function of the trial court nor of this court to retry the case or to substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. . . . Judicial review of the conclusions of law reached administratively is also limited. The court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Although the interpretation of statutes is ultimately a question of law . . . it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information </em>Commission, 244 Conn. 487, 493-94, 709 A.2d 1129 (1998). With this standard in mind, we now address the commissioner\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The commissioner first claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the warehouse liability portion of the manufacturer\u2019s output policy was severable from the truck cargo provisions of that policy with the result that the insurer\u2019s failure to give notice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Interstate Commerce Commission, as required under federal law with regard to the cancellation of truck cargo liability coverage, saved only the truck cargo provisions of that policy from cancellation. The commissioner contends that the trial court improperly reversed the decision of the commissioner by concluding that the manufacturer\u2019s output policy coverages were severable when, in fact, the manufacturer\u2019s output policy was not severable as a matter of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">When interpreting a statute, courts \u201cshould accord a statutory enactment its plain meaning. . . . Moreover, the meaning of statutory language must be determined from a reading of the statute as a whole.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>228 Conn. 335, 341, 636 A.2d 782 (1994). We may not, by construction, \u201cread a provision into legislation that is not clearly stated therein.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Fiasconardo, </em>25 Conn. App. 643, 645, 595 A.2d 945 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Our review of the record persuades us that the manufacturer\u2019s output policy was not severable. First, it was entitled \u201cRenewal Policy,\u201d which by definition suggests a single contract. Second, Mariano paid <em>one </em>annual premium for the manufacturer\u2019s output policy. Third, there was no allocation of the annual premium between the various coverages under the manufacturer\u2019s output policy. Fourth, the premium finance agreement between Mariano and the finance company lists the manufacturer\u2019s output policy as a single policy, separate from the automobile and general liability policies. Fifth, the finance company\u2019s March 31, 1995 notice of cancellation purportedly canceled the manufacturer\u2019s output policy as a whole, not a particular- coverage provision within that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The statutory language of \u00a7 38a-170 clearly refers to the cancellation of an \u201cinsurance contract or contracts,\u201d not specific coverage provisions within those contracts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>According the statute its plain meaning, we thus conclude that the finance company could and purported to cancel the entire manufacturer\u2019s output policy, and not just the warehouse liability provision within that policy. We further conclude that the finance company\u2019s cancellation of the manufacturer\u2019s output policy could not become effective until Reliance notified the state department of transportation and the Interstate Commerce Commission as required by \u00a7 38a-170 (d), because the manufacturer\u2019s output policy contained a nonseverable truck cargo liability provision.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Our review of the record reveals that on February 21, 1997, the commissioner modified his November 7, 1996 cease and desist order by directing Reliance to \u201chonor all of its contractual obligations under [the manufacturer\u2019s output policy] through May 13, 1995 . . . .\u201d On the basis of the undisputed facts in the record, we conclude that the commissioner acted reasonably and legally and did not abuse his discretion in ordering Reliance to honor its contractual obligations under the manufacturer\u2019s output policy through May 13,1995. The trial court, therefore, improperly reversed the decision of the commissioner on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The commissioner\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly concluded that Reliance\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of cancellation with the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state department of transportation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-170 (d) did not extend the cancellation date of the entire manufacturer\u2019s output policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">To effect cancellation of the manufacturer\u2019s output policy, Reliance first had to give notice to the Interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Commerce Commission and the state department of transportation pursuant to \u00a7 38a-170.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 38a-170 (d), Reliance was required to provide notice to those regulatory agencies \u201con or before the second business day after the day [the insurer] receives the notice of cancellation from the insurance premium finance company . . . .\u201d Additionally, as we discussed in part I of this opinion, \u00a7 38a-170 (a) provides that insurance contracts listed in a premium finance agreement that grants a power of attorney to the finance company <em>\u201cshall </em>not be canceled\u201d by the finance company \u201cunless such cancellation is effectuated in accordance with the provisions of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Here, the finance company issued notice to Reliance and Mariano on March 31,1995, that the manufacturer\u2019s output policy was canceled. Reliance, however, did not notify the Interstate Commerce Commission or the state department of transportation of the cancellation until April 11,1995, well after the statutory mandate of \u00a7 38a-170, i.e., the second business day from the date it received the notice of cancellation from the finance company. Accordingly, Mariano\u2019s April 4,1995 loss was covered under the manufacturer\u2019s output policy because the cancellation was not effective without the appropriate notice mandated by \u00a7 38a-170.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgement dismissing the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-11\"> These three policies were the manufacturer\u2019s output policy, an automobile liability policy and a general liability policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-12\"> The record reveals that the manufacturer\u2019s output policy was a commercial, multiperil policy that insured Mariano against a number of different types of risks. These included coverage against warehouse legal liability, which covered damage to certain properties owned by Mariano, and truck cargo liability. Mariano paid a single premium of $42,325 for this coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\"> The commissioner\u2019s orders of November 7,1996, and February 21,1997, directed Reliance to stop its illegal practice of canceling policies for nonpayment of deductible reimbursements. The commissioner determined that such a practice was illegal because it was based on the occurrence of an event not specified by General Statutes \u00a7 38a-324.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\"> The November 7, 1996 cease and desist order directed Reliance (1) to discontinue the illegal practice of canceling policies for nonpayment of deductible reimbursements, (2) to reinstate the manufacturer\u2019s outputpolicy and (3) to pay the losses that Mariano incurred on April 4, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> At the time of the trial court\u2019s decision, this section was recodified to 49 C.F.R. 387.313 (d), which provides in relevant part: \u201cCancellation notice. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section . . . certificates of insurance ... or agreements shall not be canceled or withdrawn until 30 days after written notice has been submitted to the [Interstate Commerce] Commission at its offices ... by the insurance company . . . motor carrier, broker, or other party thereto . . . which period of thirty (30) days shall commence to run from the date such notice ... is actually received by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 38a-170 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) When an insurance premium finance agreement contains a power of attorney enabling the insurance premium finance company to cancel any insurance contract or contracts listed in the agreement on account of any default on the part of the insured, the insurance contract or contracts shall not be cancelled by the insurance premium finance company unless such cancellation is effectuated in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u201c(d) All statutory, regulatory, and contractual provisions or restrictions providing that the insurance contract may not be cancelled unless notice is given to a governmental agency ... or other third parly shall apply where cancellation is effected under the provisions of this section. The insurer shall give the prescribed notice in behalf of itself or the insured to any such governmental agency ... or other third party on or before the second business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the insurance premium finance company and shall determine the effective date of cancellation taking into consideration the number of days notice required to complete the cancellation. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b106-10\"> The department of transportation and the Interstate Commerce Commission are authorized to regulate motor contract carriers pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 13b-410 and 13b-410a, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b107-9\"> See footnote 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
