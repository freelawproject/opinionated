The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied the jury\u2019s request to distinguish between the two charges and permitted convictions under both charges even though the charges required contrary findings of fact, (2) violated his right against double jeopardy by merging the two convictions and (3) permitted the state to introduce similar transaction evidence and engaged in an oral colloquy with the jury. The defendant\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On May 30, 1995, Officer Mark Pisciotti of the New Haven police department arrived at the comer of Putnam and Liberty Streets. Upon arriving, Pisciotti observed a group of men, including the defendant, disperse. Pisciotti saw the defendant reach into his pocket and discard a small plastic bag containing cocaine. Thereafter, Pisciotti apprehended the defendant, searched him and found $459 on him. The defendant was subsequently arrested and convicted. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly denied the jury\u2019s request to distinguish between the two charges and permitted convictions under both charges even though the charges required contrary findings of fact. Specifically, the defendant claims that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>trial court failed to clarify the difference between the two charges pursuant to the jury\u2019s request and violated his right against double jeopardy by permitting the jury to convict him under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), which requires the accused not to be drug-dependent, and \u00a7 2 la-277 (a), which he contends requires the accused to be drug-dependent. The defendant\u2019s claims are wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied the jury\u2019s request for the court to clarify the two charges. Additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The trial court, during its charge, instructed the jury on the elements of each count. The trial court first instructed the jury on the elements of \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) and then explained that as a defense to that charge the defendant had to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was drug-dependent. The trial court then instructed the jury on the elements of \u00a7 2 la-277 (a). Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of each charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The jury, during deliberations, sent the trial court a note asking for \u201cclarification of charges.\u201d The trial court responded by explaining to the jury that a violation under \u00a7 2 la-277 (a) is not controlled by whether the accused is drug-dependent. The defendant did not object to the trial court\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">We conclude that the trial court properly instructed the jury. It is well settled that when reviewing a claimed instructional error, this court must determine \u201cwhether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions .... The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>664 A.2d 743 (1995). \u201cWhile the instructions need not be exhaustive, perfect or technically accurate, they must be correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for the guidance of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Panella, </em>43 Conn. App. 76, 80, 682 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 937, 684 A.2d 710 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">That the defendant was not a drug-dependent person is not an element of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>221 Conn. 595, 608, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). \u201c[A] person charged with sale of narcotics pursuant to \u00a7 21a-278 (b) is presumed not to have been drug-dependent, but may avoid liability under \u00a7 21a-278 (b) by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was drug-dependent at the time of the offense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>41 Conn. App. 604, 609, 679 A.2d 3 (1996). Furthermore, \u00a7 2 la-277 (a) simply does not consider drug dependency. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>53 Conn. App. 661, 666, 733 A.2d 856 (1999). After reviewing the charge as a whole, we conclude that the trial court did not mislead the jury but accurately presented the law to them because its instructions, when read as a whole, were clearly correct in law, adapted to the issues and sufficient for guiding the jury. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly allowed a factually inconsistent verdict to stand. The defendant argues that the verdict cannot stand since he could not be both drug-dependent and not drug-dependent at the same time. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">To obtain a conviction under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), the state must prove that the defendant possessed narcotics with the intent to sell them. \u201c[T]he absence of drug dependency is not an element of the offense .... Rather, [proof of drug dependency provides] an exemption from liability\u201d that must be proved by the defendant. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>v. Hart, 221 Conn. 595, 608, 605 A.2d 1366 (1992). Likewise, to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 2 la-277 (a), the state must prove that the defendant possessed narcotics with the intent to sell them. Those elements of the statutes, therefore, are identical. The difference between these statutes is not in their elements but in the potential mandatory minimum sentence provision of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). If the defendant does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is drug-dependent, he is subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), whereas, if he proves that he is drug-dependent, the mandatory minimum sentence does not apply. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>supra, 53 Conn. App. 666. Therefore, because drug dependency is not an element of either crime and merely provides a potential exemption from liability under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), and because the defendant failed to present evidence regarding his drug dependency, the trial court properly permitted the jury to find the defendant guilty under both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court improperly permitted the jury\u2019s verdict to stand. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly merged the two counts because the \u201ccounts include elements contrary to the other, such that a conviction on both counts here amounts to a violation of this defendant\u2019s constitutional right against double jeopardy.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. The defendant, during his sentencing hearing, moved for a new trial, arguing that the jury convicted him of two separate counts, one of which was a lesser included offense of the other. In support of his motion, the defendant argued that the two convictions were factually inconsistent and that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that one count was a lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>offense of the other. The trial court denied the motion. The trial court noted, however, that because the jury convicted the defendant under two separate statutes containing the same elements, the defendant could not be sentenced under both statutes. The trial court, therefore, merged the second count into the first and sentenced the defendant under only the first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 723, 584 A.2d 425 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1254, 111 S. Ct. 2898, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1062 (1991), our Supreme Court held that when a defendant is convicted of both greater and lesser offenses arising from a single transaction, the trial court is to combine the conviction on the lesser offense with the conviction on the greater offense and to vacate only the sentence of the lesser offense. \u201c[T]his way, the conviction on the lesser offense is unaffected and may be resuscitated if the conviction on the greater offense is later vacated for some reason. A conviction on a lesser offense will, in effect, not exist separately as long as the conviction on the greater offense remains intact. This method ensures that there is no danger of double jeopardy or punishment beyond the legislature\u2019s intent. [Id.], <em>723-25.\" State v. Cecarelli, </em>32 Conn. App. 811, 827, 631 A.2d 862 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavanaugh, </em>23 Conn. App. 667, 680, 583 A.2d 1311 (1990), cert. denied, 220 Conn. 930, 598 A.2d 1100 (1991), the trial court found the defendant guilty of violating \u00a7\u00a7 21a-277 (a) and 21a-278 (b) and sentenced the defendant on each of those counts to fifteen years incarceration, the sentences to run concurrently. This court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment, holding that double jeopardy precludes the defendant from being sentenced under both \u00a7 21a-277 (a) and \u00a7 21a-278 (b), because \u00a7 2 la-277 (a) is a lesser offense included in the offense of violating \u00a7 21a-278 (b). Id. We allowed both convictions to stand, however, and remanded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>direction to combine the defendant\u2019s convictions and to vacate his sentence under \u00a7 21a-277 (a). Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The trial court here properly merged the defendant\u2019s sentences and, therefore, did not violate the defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that \u00a7 21a-277 (a) merged into \u00a7 21a-278 (b) for sentencing purposes. Moreover, the trial court indicated that the defendant\u2019s five year sentence was the minimum mandatory sentence set by \u00a7 21a-278 (b). Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly permitted the state to introduce similar transaction evidence and engaged in an oral colloquy with the jury. The defendant\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Prior to Pisciotti\u2019s testimony, the state filed a motion to introduce similar transaction evidence, through Pisciotti, of the defendant\u2019s prior arrest for selling narcotics. The state planned to use Pisciotti\u2019s testimony solely as evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent. The court concluded that Pisciotti\u2019s testimony would be more probative than prejudicial and granted the state\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">Pisciotti testified that in 1993 he and his partner observed the defendant selling narcotics and the defendant, upon seeing the officers, fled and attempted to hide the narcotics under a cardboard box. Pisciotti further testified that, upon arresting the defendant, he and his partner found packets of cocaine and $113. Following Pisciotti\u2019s testimony, the trial court instructed the jury that Pisciotti\u2019s testimony could be used only to show intent and not as evidence proving that the defendant was guilty of the crimes with which he was charged. The trial court, in its charge, reiterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>its instruction to the jury that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct was to be used solely to show his intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We find that the defendant\u2019s claim is without merit. \u201cAs a general proposition, evidence of guilt of other crimes, because of its prejudicial nature, is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crimes with which he is charged. . . . Such evidence is admissible for other purposes, however, such as when it is particularly probative in showing such things as intent .... The trial judge, however, must determine in the exercise of judicial discretion that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial tendency. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Baldwin, 224 Conn. 347, 354-55, <em>618 </em>A.2d 513 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In <em>Baldwin, </em>the defendant was charged with possession with intent to sell pursuant to \u00a7 21a-277 (a). The trial court admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior sales of narcotics. Our Supreme Court held that the trial court properly admitted the prior misconduct evidence because \u201cevidence that the defendant had been a seller of narcotics in the past is relevant to the nature of his possession of the drug at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 355. Moreover, the court concluded that because the evidence of the prior sales was so similar to the offense charged, the evidence was that much more probative. Id. Finally, the court balanced the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effects and concluded that any prejudice did not outweigh the probative value, especially in light of the court\u2019s hmiting instructions. Id., 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Similarly, in the present case, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior narcotics sale is both relevant to and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>probative on the issue of what the defendant intended to do with the drugs in his possession. The misconduct evidence was similar to the evidence before the jury. Further, because intent is an essential element of the crimes charged and was not directly and explicitly admitted before the jury, it was at issue at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 550, 461 A.2d 981 (1983). Therefore, the trial court reasonably could have determined that the evidence had significant probative value to prove intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Moreover, the record reflects that the trial court balanced the probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effects and reasonably determined that any possible prejudice did not outweigh the probative value. Indeed, the trial court, to cure any possible prejudice, provided limiting instructions both after Pisciotti\u2019s testimony and in its jury charge. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the similar transaction evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">The defendant also claims that the trial court engaged in an improper colloquy with the jury. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court violated Practice Book \u00a7 845<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by having direct oral communications with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The juiy, while deliberating, gave the trial court anote asking for \u201cclarification of charges.\u201d The trial court, on the record, informed the parties of the note\u2019s contents. Thereafter, the trial court and the parties agreed that the trial court would ask the jury to specify its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The jury then entered the courtroom, at which point the trial court requested the jury to specify its request in writing. One juror asked whether the note could be written in the courtroom, to which the trial court responded that the jury could \u201chuddle right there without us listening to you.\u201d The jury, however, did not write a note, but orally repeated its request. The trial court proceeded to answer the jury\u2019s question in open court. Neither party objected to the trial court\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the defendant neither raised his claim in the trial court nor requests <em>Golding </em>review. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We decline, therefore, to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">In this opinion SPEAR, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-11\"> General Statutes 8 21a-278 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance . . . and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years ....
