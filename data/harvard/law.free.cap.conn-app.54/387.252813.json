Specifically, this court must determine whether the portion of the sentence to be executed constitutes a \u201cdefinite sentence of three years or less,\u201d bringing the defendant within the authority of \u00a7 53a-39 (a), or whether the full sentence of nine years, consisting of the executed and unexecuted portions, constitutes a \u201cdefinite sentence,\u201d thereby making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>permission of the state\u2019s attorney a prerequisite to sentence modification pursuant to \u00a7 53a-39 (b). The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for modification, ruling that the executed portion by itself does not constitute a definite sentence within the meaning of the statute. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The relevant facts and procedural history are as follows. On March 21,1996, the defendant was adjudicated a youthful offender as defined by General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-76b<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and pleaded guilty to a charge of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 12,1996, the trial court sentenced the defendant to nine years imprisonment, execution suspended after three years, with five years of probation. On June 17, 1997, the defendant filed a motion for modification of his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 53a-39. The state\u2019s attorney did not agree to seek review of the defendant\u2019s sentence. Because the trial court determined that under \u00a7 53a-39 the defendant\u2019s sentence was a \u201cdefinite sentence of more than three years,\u201d it concluded that without the agreement of the state\u2019s attorney it lacked jurisdiction to modify the sentence and denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The defendant claims that the definite sentence referred to in \u00a7 53a-39 is comprised solely of the executed portion of his sentence. Specifically, the defendant argues that (1) case law supports his claim, (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-35a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 54-125a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> establishes that a definite sentence is limited to the three year portion of his sentence, (3) the purpose and legislative history of \u00a7 53a-39 also compel the result he urges and (4) if we find, after exhausting all sources relevant to the determination of the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the meaning of definite sentence as used in \u00a7 53a-39, that there remains an ambiguity, we should invoke the rule of lenity and decide in his favor. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 331 n.12, 692 A.2d 713 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The state argues that a definite sentence is the entire term to which the defendant was sentenced and not merely the executed portion thereof. The state relies on the plain language and legislative history of \u00a7 53a-39 in conjunction with the plain language of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-28<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to support its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>The defendant argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>200 Conn. 664, 513 A.2d 646 (1986), supports his claim. In that case, the defendant argued for the first time on appeal that his sentence of five years imprisonment suspended after eighteen months was excessive. Our Supreme Court declined to consider the defendant\u2019s claim for lack of preseivation. Because, in so doing, the court cited \u00a7 53a-39 as a possible vehicle for preservation, the defendant in the present case argues that that court concluded that a motion to review a five year sentence suspended after eighteen months fell within the authority of \u00a7 53a-39 and that we should determine that his sentence similarly qualifies. We are not persuaded. First, we note that the court referred to \u00a7 53a-39 in dictum, as the issue there was the defendant\u2019s lack of preservation. Also, subsequent to its reference to \u00a7 53a-39, the court cited General Statutes \u00a7 51-195<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as a possible means of preseivation; id., 675 n.11; which demonstrates that it did not say definitively which was the appropriate vehicle for the modification of the defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The defendant next argues that <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuszynski, </em>23 Conn. App. 201, 579 A.2d 1100 (1990), supports his position. His reliance on that case, however, is misplaced. The defendant in <em>Tuszynski </em>was sentenced to a total effective sentence of five years, suspended after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>forty-two months with two years of probation. We clearly stated that sentence modification under \u00a7 53a-39 was not appropriate for such a sentence. Id., 205. Having determined that the cases relied on by the defendant have not resolved the issue raised in this appeal, we turn to our interpretation of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law; <em>North Haven </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 556, 561, 600 A.2d 1004 (1991); and, therefore, our review is plenary. . When interpreting statutes, we rely on well established principles of statutory construction. \u201c[0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Castagno </em>v. <em>Wholean, </em>239 Conn. 336, 339, 684 A.2d 1181 (1996). We conclude that, on its face, the phrase at issue here is equally capable of either of the interpretations advocated by the parties in this case and is, therefore, ambiguous. Accordingly, we look to legislative history as we proceed to construe the statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Upon examination of the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of \u00a7 53a-39, as well as its relationship to existing legislation governing the same general subject matter, we hold that the legislature intended a definite sentence to include both the executed and suspended portions of a sentence. The defendant, therefore, cannot use \u00a7 53a-39 to petition for sentence reduction without the permission of the state\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Prior to 1981, defendants were subjected to an \u201cindeterminate\u201d sentencing scheme. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35. \u201cThe indeterminate sentencing scheme used . . . allowed the court to set both the minimum and maximum portion of the sentence . . . parole eligibility [was] established at the minimum less any good time used to reduce that minimum term. . . . The minimum and maximum portions of the sentence [were] a fixed number of years except for a class A felony where the maximum [was] life imprisonment, unless for a capital felony where a sentence of death [could] be imposed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>24 Conn. App. 612, 618, 590 A.2d 984, cert. denied, 219 Conn. 913, 593 A.2d 138 (1991). This scheme was subsequently abolished and replaced by the current scheme of definite sentencing applicable to crimes committed on or after July 1, 1981. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a. Under this system, sentencing courts \u201cimpose a flat or exact term of years of imprisonment without a minimum or maximum; that term could be reduced by various statutory credits.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>supra, 618. The legislature\u2019s purpose, therefore, in using the label definite sentence is to differentiate the type of sentence it denotes from the historical, indeterminate sentence, and not to indicate any \u201cdefinite\u201d amount of time that a defendant will be incarcerated. Furthermore, because of the availability of statutory credits as well as the operation of probation, the precise time that a defendant will serve in prison cannot be predicted with exact certainty. Accordingly, the most logical interpretation of definite sentence is the flat maximum to which a defendant is sentenced, in this case, nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Finally, we note that pursuant to No. 87-538 of the 1987 Public Acts, \u00a7 53a-39 formerly provided in relevant part: <em>\u201cIf a definite sentence includes suspension of incarceration </em>after a period of at least two years but not more than five years, followed by a period of probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-39. Although that language was subsequently eliminated from the statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we conclude that the language reinforces our interpretation that the legislature intended a definite sentence to include both the executed and suspended portions of a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) At any time during the period of a definite sentence of three years or less, the sentencing court or judge may, after hearing and for good cause shown, reduce the sentence, order the defendant discharged, or order the defendant discharged on probation or conditional discharge for a period not to exceed that to which the defendant could have been originally sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">\u201c(b) At any time during the period of a definite sentence of more than three years, upon agreement by the defendant and the state\u2019s attorney to seek review of the sentence, the sentencing court or judge may, after hearing and for good cause shown, reduce the sentence, order the defendant discharged, or order the defendant discharged on probation or conditional discharge for a period not to exceed that to which the defendant could have been originally sentenced. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 54-76b provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018[Y]outhful offender\u2019 means a youth who is charged with the commission of a crime which is not a violation of section 53a-70a or a class A felony, who has not previously been convicted of a felony or been previously adjudged a youthful offender, or been afforded a pretrial program for accelerated rehabilitation under section 54-56e, and who is adjudged a youthful offender pursuant to the provisions of said sections. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person (1) compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or a third person, or by the threat of use of force against such other person or against a third person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such other person or a third person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35a provides in relevant part: \u201cPor any felony committed on or after July 1, 1981, the sentence of imprisonment shall be a definite sentence and the term shall be fixed by the court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person convicted of one or more crimes who is incarcerated on or after October 1, 1990, who received a definite sentence or aggregate sentence of more than two years, and who has been confined under such sentence or sentences for not less than one-half of the aggregate sentence or one-half of the most recent sentence imposed by the court, whichever is greater, may be allowed to go at large on parole in the discretion of the panel of the Board of Parole for the institution in which the person is confined</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b412-9\"> See footnote 4 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b412-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 53a-28 (b) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in section 53a-46a, when a person is convicted of an offense, the court shall impose one of the following sentences: (1) A term of imprisonment;
