On appeal, the defendants claim that the board acted improperly in (1) determining that the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 was applicable to settlements by stipulation, (2) determining that the penalty sought by Davis was not barred by the express terms of the stipulation and (3) applying the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 retroactively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. Davis filed a notice of claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, dated June 18,1991, claiming injuries arising from and in the course of her employment with Forman School. Davis\u2019 claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>before the commissioner was defended against by both Royal and Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s Fund). After numerous informal hearings, the parties executed a stipulation dated April 15, 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 20, 1994, the commissioner approved this stipulation. Royal did not comply with the stipulation in a timely manner, failing to issue its check until May 3, 1994. It did not make payment until May 6, 1994, when the check was delivered to Davis\u2019 counsel. At the request of Davis\u2019 counsel, the commissioner scheduled a formal hearing to address the issues of payment, late payment and whether a penalty should be assessed. Thereafter, he ordered Royal to pay a 20 percent penalty pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-303, as amended by Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">Both Royal and Forman School appealed to the board, which affirmed the commissioner in a split decision. The board\u2019s majority concluded that (1) the penalty imposed was not \u201cbarred\u201d by the language of the stipulation, (2) the 1993 amendment did not apply only to injuries sustained after July 1, 1993, the effective date of the amendment, because it was procedural, not substantive, and, therefore, retroactive application was not improper, and (3) the 1993 amendment applied to \u201cstipulations\u201d as that term is included within the meaning of the term \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d in \u00a7 31-303. This appeal by the defendants followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The defendants first claim that the board improperly determined that \u00a7 31-303, as amended, applies to workers\u2019 compensation cases that are resolved by stipulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In support of their position, the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>discuss the legislative intent of the statute. They also attempt to distinguish between the terms \u201cstipulation\u201d and \u201cvoluntary agreement.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u201c \u2018In construing any statute, we seek to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u2019 <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>220 Conn. 749, 755, 601 A.2d 1005 (1992). \u2018[W]hen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178, 193, 530 A.2d 171 (1987).\u201d <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>223 Conn. 336, 340-41, 612 A.2d 1203 (1992). \u201cIn order to determine the meaning of a statute, [the court] must consider the statute as a whole when reconciling its separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation.\u201d <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 26-27, 717 A.2d 77 (1998); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Hartford Technical Institute, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 454, 461, 704 A.2d 222 (1997). \u201cWe have acknowledged, however, in the context of workers\u2019 compensation legislation, that [s]uch guidance is often of little help . . . since words seldom have precise and unvarying meanings. <em>Jacques </em>v. <em>H.O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>166 Conn. 352, 359 n.3, 349 A.2d 847 (1974).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Weinberg </em>v. <em>ARA Vending Co., </em>supra, 341; see <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 390-91, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). Our Supreme Court, nevertheless, often has acknowledged that \u201cthe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act [General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 etseq. (act)] is remedial and must be interpreted liberally to achieve its humanitarian purposes. . . . \u2018Because the [act] is a remedial statute, this court should not impose limitations on the benefits provided for a disabled worker that the statute itself does not clearly specify.\u2019 <em>Misenti </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>215 Conn. 206, 210, 575 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>690 (1990).\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Gil </em>v. <em>Courthouse One, </em>239 Conn. 676, 682-83, 687 A.2d 146 (1997). Moreover, in construing the act, our Supreme Court \u201c \u2018makes every part operative and harmonious with every other part insofar as is possible . . . .\u2019 <em>Bahre </em>v. <em>Hogbloom, </em>162 Conn. 549, 554, 295 <em>A.2d 547 (1972).\u201dMingachos v. CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 103-104, 491 A.2d 368 (1985). \u201cIn applying these principles we are mindful that the legislature is presumed to have intended a just and rational result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F. D. Rich Construction Co., </em>233 Conn. 14, 21, 658 A.2d 83 (1995); <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>supra, 391. We also recognize that \u201c[i]t is the province of the legislative department to define rights and prescribe remedies; of the judicial to construe legislative enactments, determine the rights secured thereby, and apply the remedies prescribed.\u201d <em>Atwood </em>v. <em>Buckingham, 78 </em>Conn. 423, 428, 62 A. 616 (1905); see <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, 199 Conn. 618, 628, </em>509 A.2d 467 (1986); <em>Second Injury Fund </em>v. <em>Lupachino, </em>45 Conn. App. 324, 341-42, 695 A.2d 1072 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In addressing the defendants\u2019 claim that the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 is not applicable to stipulations, we begin with their concession that the language of Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, \u201cis plain and unambiguous and, accordingly, there is no need to look further than its words themselves to construe the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d The defendants go on to argue that \u201c[s]imply stated, stipulations for settlement are not included in the language of [Public Act] 93-228, \u00a7 14, because it was not intended that they be subject to it.\u201d We do not agree with this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">It is presumed that the legislature is mindful of judicial construction relevant to legislation it has enacted. <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>209 Conn. 219, 222, 550 A.2d 640 (1988); <em>DeAlmeida </em>v. <em>M.C.M. Stamping Corp., </em>29 Conn. App. 441, 451, 615 A.2d 1066 (1992). \u201cIt is further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>presumed that when the legislature subsequently acts with respect to a statute, it does so with full awareness of relevant judicial interpretations. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U.S. 522, 525, 107 S. Ct. 1391, 94 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1987).\u201d <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>243 Conn. 255, 263, 701 A.2d 650 (1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1136, 118 S. Ct. 1838, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1089 (1998). Indeed, in the context of a workers\u2019 compensation case, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[a] stipulation is a compromise and release type of settlement similar to settlements in civil personal injury cases where a claim is settled with a lump sum payment accompanied by a release of the adverse party from further liability. J. Asselin, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice Manual (1985) pp. 207-208.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Muldoon </em>v. <em>Homestead Insulation Co., </em>231 Conn. 469, 479-80, 650 A.2d 1240 (1994); <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 30-31, 682 A.2d 99 (1996). Our Supreme Court has, on a number of occasions, also stated that the term \u201cstipulation\u201d is included within the term \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d in the act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Muldoon </em>v. <em>Homestead Insulation Co., </em>supra, 479-80, citing <em>Sugrue </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>128 Conn. 574, 578-79, 24 A.2d 890 (1942); see also <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Arthur A. Fogarty, Inc., </em>157 Conn. 538, 255 A.2d 627 (1969); <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lux Clock Co., </em>120 Conn. 280, 284, 180 A. 466 (1935). It is interesting to note that in <em>Wallace, </em>the court, in discussing the precursor to General Statutes \u00a7 31-296, which governs voluntary agreements in workers\u2019 compensation cases, stated that the statute was broad enough not only to include the circumstance when a compensable injury is admitted, \u201cbut also where there is a dispute as to the existence of such a claim. An agreement such as the latter is as much within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>beneficent purpose of the [act] as the former.\u201d <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Lux Clock Co., </em>supra, 284.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Recently, in <em>Muldoon </em>v. <em>Homestead Insulation Co., </em>supra, 231 Conn. 480, our Supreme Court stated that it has \u201cconsistently upheld the ability to compromise a compensation claim as inherent in the power to make a voluntary agreement regarding compensation. <em>Sugrue </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>[supra, 128 Conn. 578-79].\u201d When the legislature enacted Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, <em>Sugrue, Wallace </em>and <em>Welch </em>already had been decided. Thus, when \u00a7 31-303 was amended by Public Act 93-228 to include the 20 percent penalty language, our courts already had construed the term \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d to include the term \u201cstipulation.\u201d Moreover, Public Act 93-228, of which \u00a7 14 was one section, was titled \u201cAn Act Reforming the Workers\u2019 Compensation System\u201d and, as such, the legislature revisited the act as it then was constituted. In so doing, the legislature did not change the language of \u00a7 31-303 except to add what is now the last sentence of that section containing the penalty provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">\u201cIn determining whether to overrule precedent, particularly precedent that is a product of statutory interpretation . . . subsequent legislative action or inaction is a key consideration. [T]he legislature is presumed to be aware of the interpretation of a statute and ... its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation. . . . This presumption is strengthened when the legislature has affirmatively reenacted the statute after the interpretation in question. . . . <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Heggelund, </em>219 Conn. 620, 627, 594 A.2d 464 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jolly, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Conn. 184, 200-201, 676 A.2d 831 (1996). This rationale supports our conclusion that the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 is applicable to settlements by stipulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Aware of the prior judicial interpretation, the legislature, had it intended to indicate that the term \u201cstipulation\u201d was not to be included within the term \u201cvoluntary agreement,\u201d could have specifically so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The defendants next claim that the board improperly determined that the penalty sought by Davis was not barred by the express terms of the stipulation. In making this claim, the defendants refer specifically to certain portions of the written stipulation, which, they argue, clearly and unambiguously demonstrate the intent of the parties to settle any arid all claims under the act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In further support of their claim, the defendants refer to the order portion of the stipulation that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>executed by the commissioner, which states in part that \u201cit is ordered, adjudged and concluded that compliance with this agreement shall constitute a full and final settlement, accord and satisfaction of all claims.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The defendants claim that the common-law doctrine of accord and satisfaction is \u201cwell-suited\u201d to this case and that it is clear that when the terms of the settlement agreement are interfaced with the law that they have cited on that doctrine, it becomes evident that Davis\u2019 request for the penalty is barred by the express terms of the agreement. The defendants also claim that despite the prohibitory language of the settlement agreement, a \u201cclaim was made [by Davis] for additional benefits alleged to be due under the terms of the [act].\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">\u201cWhen there is a good faith dispute about the existence of a debt or about the amount that is owed, the common law [doctrine of accord and satisfaction] authorizes the debtor and the creditor to negotiate a contract of accord to settle the outstanding claim.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>211 Conn. 485, 491, 560 A.2d 396 (1989); <em>County Fire Door Corp. </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>202 Conn. 277, 281-82, 520 A.2d 1028 (1987); <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kowalsky, </em>186 Conn. 618, 621, 442 A.2d 1355 (1982). \u201cA contract of accord and satisfaction is sufficiently supported by consideration if it settles a monetary claim that is unliquidated in amount.\u201d <em>County Fire Door Corp. </em>v. <em>C. F. Wooding Co., </em>supra, 282. The settlement agreement between the parties is called an accord and the execution or performance of that agreement is called the satisfaction. 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (2d Ed. 1998) \u00a7 4.24, pp. 522-23; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>see J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, Contracts (3d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 21-4, p. 868; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990); 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Accord and Satisfaction \u00a7 1 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Our Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]f there is a breach of the accord, the obligee has the option of either seeking enforcement of the original duty or seeking enforcement of any obligation under the accord. 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 281 (1982) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Audubon Parking Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Barclay &amp; Stubbs, Inc., </em>225 Conn. 804, 809, 626 A.2d 729 (1993); see <em>Tolland Enterprises </em>v. <em>Scan-Code, Inc., </em>239 Conn. 326, 333, 684 A.2d 1150 (1996). \u201c \u2018[Statutes existing at the time a contract is made become a part of it and must be read into it just as if an express provision to that effect were inserted therein, except where the contract discloses a contrary intention.\u2019 <em>Ciarleglio </em>v. <em>Benedict &amp; Co., </em>127 Conn. 291, 293, 16 A.2d 593 (1940); <em>Hatcho Corporation </em>v. <em>Della Pietra, </em>195 Conn. 18, 21, 485 A.2d 1285 (1985).\u201d <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 199, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). The United States Supreme Court has held that \u201c [i]t is also settled that the laws which subsist at the time and place of the making of a contract and when it is to be performed, enter into and form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms. This principle embraces alike those which affect its validity, construction, discharge and enforcement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Von Hoffman </em>v. <em>Quincy, </em>71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 535, 550, 71 S. Ct. 403, 18 L. Ed. 403 (1866); <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>supra, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In the present case, the commissioner approved the stipulation on April 20, 1994, and ordered that \u201ccompliance\u201d with the agreement \u201cshall constitute a full, final and complete settlement, accord and satisfaction of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>claims of [Davis] against the [defendants].\u201d That order constituted the accord between the parties. The compliance with the accord would constitute the satisfaction, i.e., payment pursuant to the April 20, 1994 stipulation order on or before the tenth day from the date of such order. If the defendants had timely complied with that order, there would have been an accord <em>and </em>satisfaction that would have operated to discharge the defendants from their obligation to Davis. Because the amendment to \u00a7 31-303 became law on July 1, 1993, prior to the date of the agreement, that statute became a part of the agreement. The amendment containing the penalty was denominated by the legislature as a \u201cpenalty\u201d and was clearly intended to be imposed for a delay in payment beyond the time period provided therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a \u201cpenalty\u201d as \u201ca sum of money [for] which the law exacts payment by way of punishment for . . . not doing some act which is required to be done.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). The wrong in this case sought to be redressed by the penalty provision is the violation of Davis\u2019 legal right to receive timely payment pursuant to \u00a7 31-303. The wrong here is not, as the defendants argue, a \u201cclaim . . . for additional benefits alleged to be due under the . . . act.\u201d Although the term \u201cclaim\u201d is not defined in the act, it is evident from the provisions of the act itself that the term \u201cclaim\u201d applies to the underlying relief that the act was intended to afford. It is <em>not </em>intended to apply to the penalty provision for failure to make timely payment of the agreed sum. In any event, a \u201cclaim\u201d is instituted under the act by invoking General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-294b<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>31-294C<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by notifying the employer and filing a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The triggering of the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303, however, is quite different. It does not involve revisiting the underlying claim but, rather, involves compliance, as the commissioner ordered, with the April 15, 1994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>agreement between the parties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Unlike the institution of a claim under the act, a request for a penalty is brought directly to and decided by the commissioner. The penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 can fairly be said to be ancillary to the earlier agreement of the parties. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>National Bank of Commerce of El Dorado, </em>157 F.2d 214, 215 (8th Cir. 1946); <em>In re Lawson, </em>156 B.R. 43, 46 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1993) (stating \u201c[ajctions are said to be ancillary to the original [proceeding] when brought in aid of an execution or to effectuate a judgment entered in the original [proceeding] . . . [and are] dependent upon a judgment or decree in the original [proceeding] which is complete and determines the rights of the parties\u201d). It follows from our determination that Davis\u2019 request for a penalty was not a \u201cclaim . . . made for additional benefits alleged to be due under the [act]\u201d and that the moneys awarded her by way of the penalty provision are not \u201cbenefits\u201d required to be paid pursuant to a \u201cclaim\u201d within the purview of the act. We, thus, reject the defendants\u2019 claim that the board acted improperly in determining that the penalty sought by Davis was not barred by the express terms of the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the board acted improperly in applying the penalty provision of \u00a7 31-303 retroactively. In making this claim, the defendants maintain that Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, \u201cdoes not show that the legislature intended to depart from the date of injury rule and, thus, it is to be applied only to cases arising after its effective date of July 1, 1993.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">\u201cWhether to apply a statute retroactively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>enacting the statute. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnano, </em>204 Conn. 259, 284, 528 A.2d 760 (1987). In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which states: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, we have uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of <em>presumed </em>legislative intent that statutes affecting <em>substantive </em>rights shall apply prospectively only. <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 316, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). This presumption in favor of prospective applicability, however, may be rebutted when the legislature clearly and unequivocally expresses its intent that the legislation shall apply retrospectively. <em>In re Daniel H., </em>237 Conn. 364, 372, 678 A.2d 462 (1996); accord <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 483-84, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995); <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175, 588 A.2d 189 (1991).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Colonial Penn Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>245 Conn. 710, 718-19, 714 A.2d 1209 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">The rule of presumed legislative intent is not, however, applied to legislation that is general in its terms, affects only matters of procedure and does not impose new obligations or affect the substantive rights of the parties. <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Regional School District Number 13, </em>42 Conn. App. 542, 547, 682 A.2d 118, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 939, 684 A.2d 710 (1996); <em>Schurgast v. Schumann, </em>156 Conn. 471, 487, 242 A.2d 695 (1968); <em>Toletti </em>v. <em>Bidiziki, </em>118 Conn. 531, 536, 173 A. 223 (1934). \u201cWhile there is no precise definition of either [substantive or procedural law], it is generally agreed that a substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>law creates, defines and regulates rights while a procedural law prescribes the methods of enforcing such rights or obtaining redress.\u201d <em>Romano </em>v. <em>B.B. Ginsberg, </em>108 R.I. 132, 136, 273 A.2d 315 (1971); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Honda Motor Co., Ltd., </em>686 F. Sup. 303, 304 (M.D. Fla. 1988);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990). Where the amendment is not substantive, i.e., not directed to the right itself, but rather to the remedy, it is generally considered a distinctly procedural matter. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Kirshner, </em>225 Conn. 185, 204, 621 A.2d 1326 (1993). To prevent the exaltation of form over substance, we refer to Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, as an amendment to the act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Initially, we must determine whether Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, effects a change in the substantive rights of the parties. We think not. Prior to July 1, 1993, the effective date of this amendment, payments by an employer to an employee provided for under \u00a7 31-303 were required to commence on or before the tenth day from the date of the agreement or award. Those provisions remained the same after Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, became effective. What did change after July 1, 1993, was that any employer who \u201cfails to pay within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the prescribed time limitations of [\u00a7 31-303] shall pay a penalty for each late payment, in the amount of twenty percent of such payment.\u201d The 1993 amendment to \u00a7 31-303 did not create an employee\u2019s right to receive the payment due ten days after the agreement involved; that provision already existed in \u00a7 31-303. Nor did it create an employer\u2019s duty to pay the amount agreed on ten days after the agreement involved; that, too, already was provided for in \u00a7 31-303. It did, however, introduce the penalty provision for late payment. That 1993 amendment providing for the penalty was directed not to the right itself, but rather to the remedy. It did not impose a new \u201cobligation\u201d as that term is employed in \u00a7 55-3. Rather, the penalty provision in \u00a7 31-303 provides Davis with the <em>procedural mechanism for enforcing her preexisting right </em>to receive payment within ten days of the commissioner\u2019s approval. In so doing, the provision clearly embodies the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the penalty provision, which is that the provision is of a procedural and not a substantive nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">\u201cProcedural statutes have been traditionally viewed as affecting remedies, not substantive rights, and therefore leaving the preexisting scheme intact.\u201d <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 22, 513 A.2d 660 (1986). \u201cProcedural statutes generally will be applied retroactively absent contrary legislative intent. . . . This rule, however, is not purely mechanical in its application. . . . Absent an express legislative intent, a statute will not be applied retroactively, even if it is procedural, when considerations of good sense and justice dictate that it not be so applied. . . . These aids to legislative interpretation apply with equal force to amendatory acts which effectuate changes in existing statutes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeAlmeida </em>v. <em>M.C.M. Stamping Corp., </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 450-51. Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, of course, had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>express legislative intent referring to the matter of retro-activity. Moreover, considerations of good sense and justice hardly dictate that this statute not be applied retroactively. Indeed, such considerations counsel in favor of such application. We conclude, therefore, that Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, is procedural.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">We turn now to the defendants\u2019 argument that Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, does not indicate that the legislature intended to depart from the date of injury rule in the application of this amendment, but, rather, that the legislature intended to have it operate only prospectively. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The date of injury rule simply states that \u201c[w]e look to the statute in effect at the date of injury to determine the rights and obligations between the parties. See <em>Civardi </em>v. Norwich, 231 Conn. 287, 293 n.8, 649 A.2d 523 (1994); <em>Iacomacci </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>[supra, 209 Conn. 222].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rana </em>v. <em>Ritacco, </em>236 Conn. 330, 332-33 n.1, 672 A.2d 946 (1996); <em>Dos Santos </em>v. <em>F. D. Rich Construction Co., </em>supra, 233 Conn. 15-16 n.1; <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>O. K. Baking Co., </em>90 Conn. 217, 220-21, 96 A. 963 (1916). We have already noted, however, that, in the absence of any expressed intent to the contrary, procedural statutes ordinarily apply retroactively to all actions, whether pending or not, at the time the statute became effective. See <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 318-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">Here, there is no contrary intent expressed in Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, which we have found to be procedural in nature. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cif a workers\u2019 compensation statute is procedural in nature, the date of injury rule and its presumption against retroactivity are inapplicable.\u201d <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 243 Conn. 317. The focus of this procedural amendment is to enforce the employee\u2019s preexisting <em>right </em>to receive and the employer\u2019s preexisting <em>duty </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>make timely payment. The redress made available by this amendment bears directly on the rational and sensible result that was its purpose. This procedural amendment accomplishes this result without imposing, increasing or decreasing any substantive right or obligation of the employer or employee. Its procedural nature thus renders the date of injury rule inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">\u201cA statute declares public policy.\u201d <em>Laurel Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Mark Ford, Inc., </em>182 Conn. 437, 442, 438 A.2d 705 (1980). \u201cA statute should be interpreted according to the policy which the legislation seeks to serve. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 538, 441 A.2d 30 (1981); see 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 56.01 through 56.02. <em>Frito-Lay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>206 Conn. 554, 574, 538 A.2d 1039 (1988).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 592, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989). It is not seriously in doubt that the matter of prompt payments by employers to employees merited legislative attention. That objective resulted in Public Act 93-228, \u00a7 14, amending the act, which is in accord with the remedial character of the act. The defendants suggest that the severity of the penalty here sends an adverse message to the business community. This concern is more properly directed to the legislative branch and not to the judicial branch of government. We are sensitive to our role in the scheme of government. We recognize that \u201c[i]t is up to the legislatures, not courts, to decide on the wisdom and utility of legislation. . . .
