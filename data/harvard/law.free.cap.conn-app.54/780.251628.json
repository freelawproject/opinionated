We affirm the judgments of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The following facts are necessary to a proper resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. On August 16, 1996, at approximately 9:15 a.m., the victim, Sheldon Taubman, was walking on a sidewalk in downtown New Haven. The defendant ran into the victim, pinned him against an iron fence and held a knife pointed downward at him. The victim then felt a tugging on a backpack that he was carrying on his left shoulder. The defendant, however, was unable to take the victim\u2019s backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The victim escaped from the defendant and ran toward Olive Street. Before reaching Olive Street, the victim looked behind him and saw the defendant walking quickly in the opposite direction. The victim yelled for help from some nearby people. After the victim began yelling for help, the defendant started running. The victim then chased the defendant. During the chase, the victim saw a police officer, told him about the incident and gave him a description of the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Approximately one hour later, some officers brought the victim back to the scene of the incident. The officer who brought the victim back then asked him to observe the defendant as some officers removed him from the police car across the street. The victim told the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>that everything about the defendant was consistent with the appearance of the perpetrator, even though he had not been able to observe the perpetrator\u2019s face clearly during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. Specifically, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that (1) he intended to commit larceny in the second degree and robbery in the first degree and (2) the blade of his knife was four inches or longer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">\u201cWhen reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims, we impose a two part analysis. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. . . . Second, we determine whether, from that evidence and all reasonable inferences that it yields, a trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scales, </em>38 Conn. App. 225, 228, 660 A.2d 860 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had the mental state required for the commission of attempt to commit larceny and robbery. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . . (2) intentionally does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) provides in relevant part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>\u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the second degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and ... (3) the property ... is taken from the person of another . . . .\u201d \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">\u201cIt is well established that [t]he question of intent is purely a question of fact. . . . The state of mind of one accused of a crime is often the most significant and, at the same time, the most elusive element of the crime charged. . . . Because it is practically impossible to know what someone is thinking or intending at any given moment, absent an outright declaration of intent, a person\u2019s state of mind is usually proven by circumstantial evidence. . . . Intent may be and usually is inferred from conduct. . . . [W]hether such an inference should be drawn is properly a question for the [finder of fact] to decide.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>50 Conn. App. 591, 605, 718 A.2d 497, cert. denied, 247 Conn. 939, 723 A.2d 319 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1058, 119 S. Ct. 1373, 143 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">From the evidence presented and all of the reasonable inferences that it yields, the trial court reasonably could have found that the defendant had the requisite intent to commit larceny in the second degree and rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>bery in the first degree. The victim\u2019s testimony supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant intentionally and forcibly stopped the victim, pinned him against a fence while holding a large knife and attempted to pull the defendant\u2019s backpack from his left shoulder before the victim could escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The defendant claims that \u201cit would be pure speculation to conclude that the peipetrator pinned him against the fence as compared to merely bumping into him, especially since the peipetrator said nothing that constituted an intent to take any property.\u201d We disagree, however, because the trial court reasonably could have found that the defendant, by threatening the victim with a knife as he forced the defendant against the fence was not merely bumping into him. \u201cIn evaluating evidence that could yield contrary inferences, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence.\u201d St<em>ate </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 195, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). Moreover, \u201cthe absence of a specific demand for property, in and of itself, does not prevent a finding by the trier of fact [on] the element of intent . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>193 Conn. 602, 609, 478 A.2d 994 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The defendant also claims that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of carrying a dangerous weapon and attempt to commit robbery in the first degree. Specifically, the defendant claims that because the victim described the length of the defendant\u2019s knife as \u201cprobably in the five to six inch range,\u201d the evidence was insufficient to prove that the defendant either carried a dangerous weapon without a permit in violation of \u00a7 53-206 or threatened the use of a dangerous instrument as required for a conviction of attempt to commit robbery in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>Additional facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. The victim testified that the defendant, as he pinned the victim against the fence, was holding a \u201cfairly long\u201d knife. The victim then testified that even though he could not say exactly how long the knife\u2019s blade was, he thought \u201cit was probably in the five to six inch range.\u201d The knife was never introduced into evidence. Moreover, the defendant did not have apermit to carry a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">\u201cAny person who carries upon his person any . . . knife the edged portion of the blade of which is four inches or over in length . . . unless such person has been granted a written permit issued and signed by the first selectman of a town, the mayor or chief of police of a city or the warden of a borough, authorizing such person to carry such weapon or instrument within such town, city or borough, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than three years or both. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53-206 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">After construing the evidence in a light most favorable to sustaining the conviction, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the defendant was carrying a dangerous weapon without a permit in violation of \u00a7 53-206. Even though neither party introduced the knife into evidence, the victim testified that the length of the blade was probably five or six inches. We conclude that the victim\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was carrying a dangerous weapon without a permit in violation of \u00a7 53-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the knife was a dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>instrument as required by \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) is without merit. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (7) defines a dangerous instrument as \u201cany instrument, article or substance which, under the circumstances in which it is used or attempted or threatened to be used, is capable of causing death or serious physical injury . . . .\u201d The trial court could reasonably conclude that the knife used in this case was capable of causing death or serious physical injury. Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to find that the defendant attempted to commit robbery in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the course of his closing argument. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument \u201cimpermissibly burdened the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to require the state to meet its burden of proving him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this claim. During the trial, the defendant requested that he be permitted to leave the courtroom during the testimony of the arresting officers so that the officers could not identify him. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request. After the state rested, the defendant rested without presenting any evidence. During the state\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he defendant has no burden, obviously, to prove anything. And counsel has made that abundantly clear. The defendant put the state to its proof, including the proof that the man seated in the courtroom was the man who was arrested, including the proof that the man in the courtroom was the person who was convicted back in 1990. That\u2019s his prerogative. He\u2019s done it. In my humble opinion, it would not have been done in front of a jury for the very reason that the jury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>hearing a litany of wild defense claims being posed, a defendant trying a case to a jury would have realized what the backlash of that would be because what a juror would conclude is that with no defense to the charges, whether they\u2019re in the criminal file or in the [violation of probation] file, the defense embarked through a series of obstacles in front of the state in an effort to see if they could trip them up, there being no true defense to the charges that we\u2019re here on, either on the [violation of probation] or in the criminal offense. That\u2019s how I saw it. I think the defense looks to Your Honor not to draw the same negative inference from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The defendant failed to raise this claim at trial and now seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[T]o deprive a defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial. . . the prosecutor\u2019s conduct must have so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. . . . We do not focus alone, however, on the conduct of the prosecutor. The fairness of the trial and not the culpability of the prosecutor is the standard for analyzing the constitutional due process claims of criminal defendants alleging prosecutorial misconduct. . . . [M]oreover . . . <em>[Golding] </em>review of such a claim is unavailable where the claimed misconduct was not blatantly egregious and merely consisted of isolated and brief episodes that did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 769, 670 A.2d 276 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>(1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Correa, </em>241 Conn. 322, 356-57, 696 A.2d 944 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">We will review the defendant\u2019s second claim because the record is adequate for review and because the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right. The record in this case, however, does not support a claim that the defendant was clearly deprived of a fair trial and, therefore, fails under the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Here, the challenged statements merely described the defendant\u2019s trial strategy. The prosecutor clearly stated that the defendant had the right to proceed as he did. Further, the defendant does not raise any other claims of prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cWe will not afford <em>Golding </em>review to [unpreserved] claims of prosecutorial misconduct where the record does not disclose a pattern of misconduct pervasive throughout the trial or conduct that was so blatantly egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>44 Conn. App. 457, 461, 689 A.2d 1141, cert. denied, 240 Conn. 930, 693 A.2d 302 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Further, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were directed to the court, not to a jury. \u201cWhile this fact alone would not excuse an egregious violation of the rule, it is properly taken into consideration as part of the context in which it is made. An indirect comment in argument to the court on a point of law is less serious than a comment in jury summation that asks the jury to infer that the defendant\u2019s silence is evidence of guilt. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 108 S. Ct. 864, 99 L. Ed. 2d 23 (1989).\u201d <em>State v. Cobb, </em>27 Conn. App. 601, 607, 605 A.2d 1385 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly failed to recuse itself. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>defendant claims that because the trial court referred to him as a \u201cmarauder\u201d shortly after sentencing, it exhibited a personal bias against the defendant and should have recused itself from the case. The defendant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The following facts are necessary to our resolution of this claim. During the sentencing hearing, the state remarked to the trial court that the defendant, in 1990, committed four armed robberies for which he received a six year sentence. The state then stated that as soon as the defendant finished serving those six years, he committed the crimes against the victim here in violation of the terms of his probation. The trial court then sentenced the defendant to a term of twelve years to be served consecutively with a six year sentence for violating his probation. The trial court explained that \u201c [t]he reason the sentences were imposed to that magnitude . . . [is] that it is time that the citizens of New Haven and society in general are protected from marauders like [the defendant]. That\u2019s what he is.\u201d The defendant immediately objected, moving the trial court to disqualify itself because it had \u201calready imposed sentence and then to add a dig on him that he\u2019s a marauder . . . shows a bias and prejudice . . . and we should reopen the sentencing and have it heard by some other judge.\u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Practice Book \u00a7 1-22, formerly \u00a7 996, provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] judicial authority shall, upon motion of either party or upon its own motion, be disqualified from acting in a matter if such judicial authority is disqualified from acting therein pursuant to Canon 3 (c) of the Code of Judicial Conduct or because the judicial authority previously tried the same matter and a new trial was granted therein or because the judgment was reversed on appeal. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">\u201cAccusations of judicial bias or misconduct implicate the basic concepts of a fair trial. . . . The appearance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>as well as the actuality of [partiality] on the part of the trier will suffice to constitute proof of bias sufficient to warrant disqualification. . . . Canon 3 (c) (1) provides in relevant part: A judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (A) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montini, </em>52 Conn. App. 682, 694, 730 A.2d 76, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 909, 733 A.2d 227 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">\u201cTo prevail on [his] claim of a violation of this canon, the [defendant] need not show actual bias. The [defendant] has met [his] burden if [he] can prove that the conduct in question gave rise to a reasonable appearance of impropriety. We use an objective rather than a subjective standard in deciding whether there has been a violation of canon 3 (c) (1). Any conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge\u2019s disqualification. Thus, an impropriety or the appearance of impropriety . . . that would reasonably lead one to question the judge\u2019s impartiality in a given proceeding clearly falls within the scope of the general standard .... The question is not whether the judge is impartial in fact. It is simply whether another, not knowing whether or not the judge is actually impartial, might reasonably question his . . . impartiality, on the basis of all of the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Abington Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Heublein, </em>246 Conn. 815, 819-20, 717 A.2d 1232 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s use of the word \u201cmarauder\u201d to describe the defendant could not lead a reasonable person to question the court\u2019s impartiality. The trial court merely used the term marauder to describe the defendant as a person who was involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>with small scale attacks. The defendant does not provide any evidence in support of his bare assertions of bias. \u201cIt is a fundamental principle that to demonstrate bias sufficient to support a claim of judicial disqualification, the due administration of justice requires that such a demonstration be based on more than opinion or conclusion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Montini, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 695-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Finally, the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court demonstrated its bias toward him \u201cbecause he was treated unfairly throughout the trial as shown by the questionable adverse rulings by the judge\u201d is without merit. \u201c[T]he alleged bias and prejudice, to be disqualifying, must stem from an extrajudicial source and result in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the judge learned from his participation in the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 696. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The defendant\u2019s fourth claim is that the trial court improperly granted the state\u2019s motion for a fingerprint examination of the defendant while at the same time denying the defendant\u2019s motion for an eye examination of the victim. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">The following additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this claim. On the first day of trial, the state called Officer Brian Donnelly to prove, inter alia, that the defendant was the person that he had arrested after the crimes were reported. Before Donnelly took the stand to testify, however, the defendant requested that the trial court permit him to leave the courtroom so that Donnelly could not identify him as the person that he arrested. In response, the state filed a motion to obtain nontestimonial evidence pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>to Practice Book \u00a7 776, now \u00a7 40-32, to take the defendant\u2019s fingerprints. The defendant objected to the state\u2019s motion and further argued that the victim should submit to an eye examination. The defendant argued that if the trial court were to grant the state\u2019s motion then it would have a duty to grant the defendant\u2019s motion \u201cin order to avoid a double standard.\u201d The defendant, during his cross-examination of the victim, however, never asked him any questions regarding his eyesight. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion and denied the defendant\u2019s motion. In granting the state\u2019s motion, the trial court stated that there was good cause to grant it because the issue of whether the defendant was the person arrested was unforeseen, and the fingerprint evidence was therefore material in determining whether the defendant committed the offenses. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court concluded that there was no evidence presented that the victim had a vision problem and, therefore, an eye examination was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court should have denied the state\u2019s motion because it was a pretrial discovery request under Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 40-34 and 41-3, formerly \u00a7\u00a7 778 and 809, that was not made within ten days after the first pretrial conference. See Practice Book \u00a7 41-5, formerly \u00a7 811. We conclude, however, that the state sufficiently showed that there was good cause to grant its untimely motion because the defendant was attempting to prevent the state from identifying him. See Practice Book \u00a7 41-4, formerly \u00a7 810; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Synakorn, </em>239 Conn. 427, 434, 685 A.2d 1123 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">\u201c[Practice Book \u00a7] 776 [now \u00a7 40-32] authorizes a reasonably conducted procedure to obtain nontestimonial evidence if the judicial authority finds probable cause to believe that the evidence may be of material aid in determining whether the defendant committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the offense charged and that the evidence cannot practicably be obtained from other sources. Practice Book \u00a7 778 (7) [now \u00a7 40-34 (7)] specifically authorizes \u2018reasonable body surface examinations\u2019 as part of a procedure to obtain nontestimonial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Skipper, 228 Conn. 610, 628, 673 A.2d 1101 (1994). The trial court concluded that the fingerprint evidence would be a material aid in determining whether the defendant committed the charged offense and that such evidence could not practicably be obtained from other sources. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 40-32 et seq., that the defendant have his fingerprints taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The defendant also claims that because \u201cthe defendant\u2019s motion and the state\u2019s motion were similar, and since the defendant\u2019s motion stated that both motions should be treated evenhandedly, the court by granting the state\u2019s motion and denying the defendant\u2019s motion,\u201d violated a number of his constitutional rights. The defendant fails to provide any authority to support his claim. \u201cWhere a claim is asserted in the statement of issues but thereafter receives only cursory attention in the brief without substantive discussion or citation of authorities, it is deemed to be abandoned. . . . Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Twin Tool Mfg. Co., </em>40 Conn. App. 36, 45, 668 A.2d 1346 (1996). We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly ruled on each motion individually and was not under any duty to grant the defendant\u2019s motion merely because the court granted the state\u2019s motion. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by forcing him \u201cto sit at the defense table and be subjected to suggestive one-on-one identifications.\u201d This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">During it\u2019s case-in-chief, the state called two police officers to identify the defendant as the man they arrested after the crimes were committed. Before each officer testified, however, the defendant requested that he either be permitted to (1) leave the courtroom when the officers were called to testify, (2) face backward when they testified, (3) wear a bag over his head when they testified or (4) sit elsewhere in the courtroom when they testified. The trial court denied each of these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">\u201c[T]he manner in which in-court identifications are conducted is not of constitutional magnitude but rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. ... In such cases, the defendant\u2019s protection against the obvious suggestiveness in any courtroom identification confrontation is his right to cross-examination ... or other practical procedures designed to lessen the degree of suggestiveness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>224 Conn. 445, 470, 619 A.2d 453 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s requests. Requiring the defendant to sit at the defense table was not suggestive in any way. Further, the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine each of the officers regarding their identifications of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly admitted hearsay. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>under the business records exception to the hearsay rule (1) a computer printout and (2) a photograph of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\u201cOur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. ... In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>38 Conn. App. 777, 796, 664 A.2d 291, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 918, 665 A.2d 610 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1084, 116 S. Ct. 799, 133 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">\u201cAn out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted is hearsay and is generally inadmissible unless an exception to the general rule applies.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 803, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-180 requires that evidence proffered under the business records exception to the hearsay rule satisfy three requirements: (1) that the record was made in the regular course of business; (2) that it was the regular course of the business to make the writing; and (3) that the writing was made at the time of the transaction or occurrence or within a reasonable time thereafter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>31 Conn. App. 660, 665, 626 A.2d 817 (1993). \u201cThe trial court is given discretion under General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (a) to determine whether the criteria of the statute have been satisfied and, in reviewing the decision of the trial court to admit the evidence, an appellate court should construe the statute liberally.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly admitted a computer printout under the business records exception to the hearsay rule because the witness could not identify the person who entered the data to produce the printout and could not identify the time when the entries were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The state introduced the clothes that the defendant was wearing at the time of the incident through Aaron Hazelwood, a correction officer at the New Haven Correctional Center. Hazelwood testified that as soon as an inmate is brought to the prison, he is issued prison clothes. The inmate\u2019s original clothing is inventoried, put into a garment bag and is locked up in a \u201cproperty room.\u201d Hazelwood then testified that he researched the prison records to determine that the defendant was admitted to the prison on August 19, 1996. The state presented Hazelwood with a computer printout indicating that the defendant was admitted to the prison on August 19, 1996. Hazelwood testified that the printout was made in the regular course of business, that it was the regular course of business to make the writing and that the writing was made at the time of the occurrence. Hazelwood then testified that an intake counselor is responsible for making the entries to create the computer printout indicating when the inmates are admitted. Hazelwood stated that he could not identify which intake counselor entered the defendant\u2019s information, but that it was an everyday practice for an intake counselor to make the entries. Hazelwood, however, did not have actual knowledge that the entries here were made by an intake counselor. Further, Hazelwood admitted that he did not know exactly when the entries were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">We conclude that even though Hazelwood could not identify the person who prepared the printout and could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>not identify when the printout was made, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the printout as a business record. Hazelwood testified that an intake counselor would prepare this type of printout every day. Even though Hazelwood did not know who the intake counselor was that day, \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (b) (1) provides that the failure to produce the person who has personal knowledge of the event recorded will not affect the admissibility of a document, although that failure may affect the weight to be accorded to it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>supra, 31 Conn. App. 666. Thus, it is of no moment that Hazelwood was not the person who created the printout and did not have personal knowledge of the person who actually created the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Moreover, the defendant claims that the state failed to prove that the printout was made at the time that the defendant was admitted to the prison. We conclude, however, that the trial court reasonably could have found that the printout was made contemporaneously with the defendant\u2019s admittance to the prison. \u201c[T]he inability of [the witness] to testify as to the exact date and time when a report was filled out does not render the report inadmissible. We have held that the statute should be liberally interpreted. ... In part, this is due to the fact that the statute recognizes that the trustworthiness of such documents comes from their being used for business and not for litigation. ... In light of this principle, if it can be demonstrated . . . that it was the regular business practice to file reports within a reasonable time after the incident itself, this is sufficient to assure that the report was made at a time when the incident was fresh in the author\u2019s mind.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, U.A.W., </em>190 Conn. 371, 388-89, 461 A.2d 422 (1983). We conclude, therefore, that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the printout under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The defendant also claims that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting a photograph of the defendant under the business records exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">The state called Sergeant Joyce Illingworth to testify that the arrest records of the New Haven police department are maintained by the department in the regular course of business and are made by the officers within the department at or about the time that the person is arrested. One of the records brought by Illingworth to trial was a computerized photograph of the defendant. Illingworth explained that the department took the photograph as part of the booking process. Illingworth searched the defendant\u2019s computerized records and determined that the photograph was the defendant\u2019s arrest photograph of August 16, 1996. The trial court, under the business records exception, admitted the photograph over the defendant\u2019s objection that there was no evidence of who took the photograph or of when the photograph was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Illingworth testified that Marie Mancini, a record clerk under her supervision, took the photograph on August 16, 1996, at 5:35 p.m. Further, Illingworth testified that the photograph was taken as part of the booking process. The trial court reasonably could have inferred that the photograph was taken at the time the defendant was ar rested and booked on August 16, 1996. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photograph as a business record under \u00a7 52-180.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he violated his probation. In light of our conclusion that the trial court properly found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the charges, we conclude that the trial court properly found that the defendant violated his probation under the lower burden of proof required in a probation revocation proceeding. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 295, 641 A.2d 370 (1994) (holding that state has burden of establishing violation of probation by fair preponderance of evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> Robbery and larceny require the perpetrator to have the same level of intent.
