We agree and reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The defendant was ticketed for failure to make an appropriate turn signal in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-242. He entered aplea of not guilty, was tried before a magistrate, found guilty and fined $78. He was instructed to pay the fine at the clerk\u2019s office, which he did before leaving the courthouse. Three days later he filed his demand for a trial de novo, which was denied by the trial court. The trial court concluded that because the defendant paid the fine, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant a trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">The state concedes, and we agree, that the magistrate system does not preclude a person from the opportunity to be heard before a judge of the Superior Court. Because the defendant filed his demand for a trial de novo within five days of the magistrate\u2019s action as required by \u00a7 51-193u (d), the magistrate\u2019s ruling became null and void, and the defendant was entitled to a trial de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded for a trial de novo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-193u (d) provides: \u201cA decision of the magistrate, including any penalty imposed, shall become a,judgment of the court if no demand for a trial de novo is filed. Such decision of the magistrate shall become null and void if a timely demand for a trial de novo is filed. A demand for a trial de novo shall be filed with the court clerk within five days of the date the decision was rendered by the magistrate and, if filed by the prosecutorial official, it shall include a certification that a copy thereof has been served on the defendant or his attorney, in accordance with the rules of court. No record of the proceedings shall be required to be kept.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b793-14\"> Practice Book \u00a7 44-30 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Infractions and motor vehicle violations which may be submitted to a magistrate pursuant to statute may be heard by magistrates in those court locations where a magistrate has been appointed by the chief court administrator, except that magistrates may not conduct jury trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>\u201c(b) Hearings by magistrates shall be conducted in accordance with the criminal rules of evidence and with the provisions of chapter 42 insofar as the provisions of that chapter are applicable.

Such decision of the magistrate shall become null and void if a timely demand for a trial de novo is filed. A demand for a trial de novo shall be filed with the court clerk within five days of the date the decision was rendered by the magistrate and, if filed by the prosecuting authority, it shall include a certification that a copy thereof has been served on the defendant or his or her attorney, in accordance with the rules of practice. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96a vacates an appeal and restores the judgment \u201cof the Superior Court\u201d of a fine only, when the fine is paid before the appeal is heard. The payment of such a fine fully executes the sentence, terminates the case and precludes an appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>35 Conn.

The fine in the present case is not from a judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
