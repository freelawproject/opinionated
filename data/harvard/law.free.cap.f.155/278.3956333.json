The bill asks for the usual relief. The defendant denies infringement, and also the validity of the patent The case is here on final hearing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b315-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Without going into a recital of the nature of the patent and the testimony-introduced on the issues made, it is enough for me to announce my conclusion, as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b315-3\">1. If all that the complainant did was to obtain the patent for casting the partition separating the explosion chamber and the socket integrally, instead of forming the partition from a separate piece and securing it in place by a rivet or set screw, then I find that the complainant was not the inventor of such a method.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b315-4\">2. As to the other claim of novelty and usefulness in the patent, I find that it is not novel, having been anticipated by other patents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b315-5\">Decree may therefore be entered dismissing the bill, at the complainant\u2019s costs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-6\">S.
