You agree to furnish us on or before the 15th of each month the tonnage that you wish to order during the following month.

This was accepted in writing by indorsing thereon, at the foot of the proposition, \u201cAccepted April 10, 1902,\u201d and duly signed by the Lima Company. This contract the defendant set out in its cross-petition and averred: First, that the castings for which the plaintiff had sued were ordered and supplied under this contract; second, that the plaintiff -had failed and refused, though requested, to supply it with other castings necessary to meet the requirements of its business, and that defendant in consequence had been obliged to contract for same with other founders and had paid for the eastings so procured $5,498.24 over and above the contract price with plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-9\">The defenses to the cross-petition were: First, that the contract was void for want of mutuality; second, that the furnace of the plaintiff broke down through an \u201cunavoidable accident,\u201d and the plant closed for repairs from about August 1 to November 19, 1902, and that for this reason the plaintiff was excused from carrying out its agreement, if valid, during that time, and that there was an universal custom among manufacturers of steel castings, well known to defendant, that all contracts were subject to the contingency of strikes, accidents, and unavoidable delays, and that this contract was entered into with reference to this custom; third, that notice was given the defendant that the furnace of the plaintiff would resume operation about November 19th, but defendant did not furnish plaintiff with patterns by which it might have supplied defendant\u2019s November and December requirements.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\">Henry W.

We find ourselves unable to agree with the learned circuit judge in respect to the nonmutuality of the contract by which the plaintiff agreed to supply all of the \u2018Requirements\u201d of the defendant\u2019s business for the remainder of the year 1902. The defendant was engaged in an established manufacturing business which required a large amount of steel castings. This was well known to the plaintiff, and the proposition made and accepted was made with reference to the \u201crequirements\u201d of that well-established business. The plaintiffs were not proposing to make castings beyond the current requirements of that business, and would not have been obligated to supply castings not required in the usual course of that business. By the acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s proposal, the defendant was obligated to take from the plaintiff all castings which their business should require. The contract, if capable of two equally reasonable interpretations, should be given that intei-pretation which will tend to support it and thus carry out the presumed intent of both parties. The second and third paragraphs must be read in the light of the first. Thus read, there is no ground for doubting that the words the \u201ctonnage you wish to order,\u201d and \u201csuch deliveries as you may require,\u201d have reference to the established'\u201crequirements\u201d of the business for the following \u201cmonth,\u201d and the deliveries of the tonnage thus estimated. The contract falls under and is governed by the case of Loudenback Fertilizer Co. v. Tennessee Phosphate Co., 121 Fed. 298, 58 C. C. A. 220, 61 L. R. A. 402, where the contract was to sell to a manufacturer of fertilizer \u201cits entire consumption of phosphate rock\u201d for a term of five years. In that case we held that the contract was mutual, and the buyer under obligation to take its entire requirement of phosphate rock from the seller. Concerning the definiteness of such a contract, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">\u201cA contract to buy all that one shall require for one\u2019s own use in a particular manufacturing business is a very different thing from a promise to buy all that one may desire, or all that one may order. The promise to take all that one can consume would he broken by buying from another, and it is this obligation to take the entire supply of an established business which saves the mutual character of the promise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">To the same effect and directly in point are the cases of Cold Blast Transp. Co. v. Kansas City Bolt &amp; Nut Co., 114 Fed. 77, 52 C. C. A. 25, 57 L. R. A. 696, Minnesota Lumber Co. v. Whitebreast Coal Co., 160 Ill. 85, 43 N. E. 774, 31 L. R. A. 529, and Wells v. Alexandre, 130 N. Y. 642, 29 N. E. 142, 15 L. R. A. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">2. Among the findings of fact was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">\u201c(10) Throughout the United States it is a custom among manufacturers of steel eastings, such as were to be manufactured for defendant by plaintiff, to make all agreements contingent upon strikes, accidents, and other unavoidable delays, and all contracts for the manufacture of such castings were made with reference to and conditioned upon such custom, which said custom was well known to defendant when said agreement was entered into, and was made with reference to said custom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The court also found that the contract itself was contained upon the printed letter head of the plaintiff, which, among other things, had printed thereon these words: \u201cAll agreements contingent upon strikes, accidents and other unavoidable delays, beyond our control.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Nothing is better settled than that it is not admissible to contradict a contract by evidence of custom or usage, but admissible to explain the meaning of words' and phrases used and to annex to such contracts certain incidents which circumstances indicate the parties intended to annex when the words they have used do not necessarily exclude the operation of such custom or usage. Lillard v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., 134 Fed. 168, 174, 67 C. C. A. 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">That nothing will excuse the performance of a contract except an act of God or the public enemy is equally clear. Whether the plain agreement to supply the defendant with all the castings which its business should require is not contradicted by a custom or usage which would excuse the performance upon the contingency of a strike or accident is a very grave question, and one which we pretermit because we do not find that the plaintiff was prevented from performing its contract by the occurrence of any accident or other contingency included by the alleged custom or usage in the steel casting business. It is true that the plaintiff\u2019s furnace was shut down from August 1st to November 15th for the purpose of making necessary repairs. But the facts found show that the want of repair which necessitated going out of blast for repairs August 1st was a condition which existed at the time this contract was executed, and had existed for some months before. The' output had been severally affected for months by a- defective operation, the cause of which was not understood. Various efforts were made to remedy the matter, but without results. In this existing .crippled condition plaintiff entered into the contract here involved and continued to operate until some time in June, matters growing worse, when notice was given of a shutdown August 1st to overhaul and repair. It was after the work of overhauling had begun that the cause.of the bad draught which had troubled the operation was discovered and remedied. The \u201caccident\u201d or \u201cunavoidable delay\u201d excused by custom or usage must be confined to accidents and delays due to- causes originating after the contract. Plaintiff knew when it made this contract that its furnace was working badly, and that normal results could not be relied upon. They did not then know the cause of the- trouble, but that the trouble was more vital than they then suspected, and would take longer to remedy is a misfortune that cannot be cast.upon the defendant-as an \u201caccident\u201d excused by custom or usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">3. The \u201crequirements\u201d for defendant\u2019s business- for November and December were in. excess of requirements of preceding months. The defendant in error says, .that on October 24th it gave plaintiff in error notice that on -or before November 19th its furnace would be in running order, and that if furnished patterns they could put them in sand and be ready to turn out work on or before that day. The facts found show that the castings required were made upon patterns supplied by defendant, and that when plaintiff shut down these patterns were necessarily returned and placed with other founders, and so were in the hand\u00e1 of other contractors. When this notice was given, defendant notified plaintiff that it had been forced to make arrangements with) other\u2019 founders for- its requirement's for the remainder of the y'earpand that its' patterns were in the possession of such other con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tractors, to whom orders had been given. The court below found as a fact that from April 1st to the close of the year the prices of such castings advanced materially, and that it was difficult to get orders filled, and that the contracts made by defendants were for the best prices obtainable. The plaintiff, having inexcusably breached its agreement, is not in a situation to complain of the measures resorted to in good faith by the defendant to supply itself with the castings which the plaintiff was under obligation to furnish. It may be that some of defendant\u2019s outstanding contracts for November and December \u201crequirements\u201d might have been canceled and the patterns returned to plaintiff; but it was not bound to do so under the circumstances. The market was an advancing one, and defendant made arrangements on best obtainable terms to obtain what plaintiff was unable to furnish, and this- is all the plaintiff had a right to ask. Upon the facts found the judgment should have been for defendant for $5,498.24, less $3,-700.78, with interest on this balance from January 1, 1903, and the costs of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Judgment reversed, with directions to enter judgment in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
