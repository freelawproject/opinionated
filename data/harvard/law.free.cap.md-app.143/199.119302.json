(the \u201cHospital\u201d or \u201cHoly Cross\u201d). On May 9, 1997, appellants filed a malpractice claim with the Maryland Health Claims Arbitration Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">After arbitration was waived, appellants filed a five-count complaint on December 10, 1997, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The suit named sixteen defendants, including Contemporary OB/GYN Associates (\u201cContemporary\u201d), the obstetrical practice that cared for Ms. Brown; Contemporary\u2019s individual physicians and their respective professional associations; Holy Cross; and two of the Hospital\u2019s nurses, all appellees herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellants sought compensatory and punitive damages of $20 million in connection with their claims for wrongful death (Count I); a survival action (Count II); health care malpractice (Count III); breach of contract (Count IV); and intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count V).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Prior to trial, the circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Holy Cross, Dr. Jeffrey Levitt, Dr. Goldberg, Dr. Brooks, and the two nurses, McKibben and Craddock. As to Contemporary, Dr. Donald Levitt, Dr. Goodman, and Dr. Rosenblatt, the court granted summary judgment as to the claims of wrongful death, the survival action, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Thereafter, the court bifurcated the issues of liability and damages. Accordingly, as to the remaining defendants, the case proceeded to trial on liability in June 1999 (Mason, J.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>with respect to the claims of health care malpractice and intentional infliction of emotional distress. At the trial, Newton Osborne, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Howard University Hospital (\u201cHoward\u201d or \u201cHoward Hospital\u201d), and chairman of the Department from 1994 to 1997, testified as an expert for appellants. After the court determined that he offered an opinion that had not been previously disclosed to opposing counsel, the court granted a mistrial. A second trial, as to both liability and damages, commenced in January 2000 (Woodward, J.). It, too, ended in a mistrial, apparently because a juror overheard certain comments by a lawyer representing the Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">In the meantime, after the second trial, and without appellants\u2019 knowledge, Dr. Osborne\u2019s employer, Howard Hospital, retained H. Kenneth Armstrong, Esq., to represent Dr. Osborne in a medical malpractice action filed again him and others in the District of Columbia (the <em>\u201cSingleton </em>\u201d case). At that time, Armstrong was also the attorney for Contemporary and its physicians in this case (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the <em>\u201cBrown\" </em>case). Nevertheless, Dr. Osborne and Armstrong did not plan to meet to discuss the <em>Singleton </em>case until after the trial in the <em>Brown </em>matter was completed. As a result of the second mistrial, that matter did not end when anticipated. Nevertheless, prior to the third attempt to try the underlying case, Armstrong met with Dr. Osborne to discuss the <em>Singleton </em>litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">After the commencement of the third trial in March 2000, appellants learned that Armstrong represented Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>matter. During the course of the third trial, appellants also learned that Dr. Osborne was out of the country and unavailable to testify as their expert. They also discovered that Armstrong knew that Dr. Osborne would be unavailable at that time, yet had failed to disclose that information to appellants. The court (John McAuliffe, J.) attributed Dr. Osborne\u2019s unavailability to appellants\u2019 failure to subpoena the doctor, but permitted appellants to put in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>dence the testimony of Dr. Osborne, elicited at the first trial in June 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">On appeal, appellants present the following four questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">I. Did the [tjrial [cjourt err in denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for a Mistrial and Post-trial Motion for a new trial where the court had before it evidence of witness tampering by defense [cjounsel, Kenneth Armstrong, Esquire, when he had undisclosed and unsupervised access to Appellants\u2019 expert and he became attorney for Appellants\u2019 expert in an unrelated case shortly before Appellants\u2019 expert was scheduled to testify in this case; which caused or contributed to the absence of Appellants\u2019 expert witness at trial; which had [aj prejudicial effect upon Appellants\u2019 ability to present their case at trial; which deprived Appellants [of] a fair trial; and was prejudicial to the administration of justice in this case[?J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">II. Did the trial [cjourt err in allowing testimony of defense expert Lindsay Alger who rendered new opinions at trial which were prejudicial to Appellants\u2019 case, which had never been rendered before and Appellants were not put on reasonable notice of those opinions at anytime before trial[?J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">III. Did the trial [cjourt err when it ordered the use of Dr. Osborne\u2019s previous trial testimony at the March 2000 trial which did not contain testimony regarding [mjen-tal anguish that Dr. Osborne had prepared to render at the June 1999 trial but for the bifurcation of the trial and the objection of Appellees[?J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">IV. Did the trial [cjourt err where the [cjourt gave an incorrect instruction to the jury that a wrongful death claim could not be brought by the Plaintiffs because the baby was non-viable without advising the jurors that that [sic] under Maryland law, a wrongful death suit may be maintained if a nonviable fetus was born-alive[?J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">In January 1994, Ms. Brown came under the prenatal care of Contemporary. At that time, she had already endured four unsuccessful pregnancies, and was experiencing difficulties in the early stages of the pregnancy at issue, including infection and vaginal bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On May 12, 1994, when Ms. Brown was twenty-two weeks pregnant, she had severe abdominal pains and contractions. As a result, Dr. Brown took his wife to the Hospital\u2019s emergency room, where she was examined by Craddock and McKibben. The nurses then contacted Dr. Goodman, the physician on call for Contemporary. He told the nurses to discharge Ms. Brown and instruct her to follow up with Contemporary the next day. Accordingly, Ms. Brown was examined the next day by Dr. Rosenblatt. After an ultrasound revealed that Ms. Brown was dilated four centimeters, she was admitted to Holy Cross. The baby was delivered by Dr. Donald Levitt on May 13, 1994. During the delivery, the baby\u2019s head was severed from its body.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">At the first trial in June 1999, Dr. Osborne opined that the premature delivery was caused by an undiagnosed \u201clower genital tract infection\u201d that \u201ceventually progressed to an upper genital tract infection with amnionitis and chorioamnioni-tis, and caused a contraction of the uterus that resulted in a [premature] delivery.\u201d Defense counsel claimed that Dr. Os<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>borne\u2019s opinion had not been disclosed by appellants prior to trial, in violation of the Pretrial Scheduling Order. Therefore, appellees moved for a mistrial. Although the court recognized that the disputed opinion was \u201cso important\u201d to the plaintiffs\u2019 case, it found that they never disclosed the opinion \u201cin any reasonable form,\u201d or \u201cat any time.... \u201d Accordingly, the court granted a mistrial, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">[T]o allow the case to proceed in the absence of any kind of reasonable disclosure, which I do not find from my review of the record, would in fact unfairly and severely prejudice the defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">Accordingly, over the objection of the plaintiffs, I will grant the motion for the mistrial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Because the court also struck the bifurcation, the trial was rescheduled for January 10, 2000, as to both liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In the meantime, on or about September 2, 1999, Dr. Osbojme was sued in the District of Columbia for malpractice, in his capacity as Chairman of Howard\u2019s Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in the <em>\u201cSingleton </em>\u201d case. In December 1999, a representative of Howard Hospital contacted Armstrong and asked him to represent Dr. Osborne in that unrelated matter. Although appellants were not aware of the request, Armstrong knew, of course, that Dr. Osborne was appellants\u2019 expert in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In a telephone conversation with Dr. Osborne on January 5, 2000, Armstrong advised the doctor of his willingness to represent him. But, mindful of the impending trial in this case, he suggested that they defer meeting until after the conclusion of the second <em>Brown </em>trial, then scheduled to commence on January 10, 2000. Armstrong also advised Dr. Osborne that it would be inappropriate for the two of them to discuss the <em>Brown </em>litigation at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Armstrong confirmed his telephone conversation with Dr. Osborne by letter of January 6, 2000, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">This will confirm our telephone conversation of January 5, 2000. At that time, we discussed that I had been retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>by Howard University Hospital to represent your interest in a lawsuit brought by the Singleton family in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action No. 99-0006001.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">We have a meeting set up in my office for Thursday, January 20, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">This will also confirm that I specifically advised you that I will <em>not </em>discuss the <em>Brown </em>litigation with you at any time. In addition, I specifically set our first meeting to discuss the <em>Singleton </em>case for <em>after </em>the <em>Brown </em>case is concluded in the Circuit Court. While I do not believe that your participation as an expert in the <em>Brown </em>case will prevent us from having a completely appropriate and satisfactory attorney/client relationship, I did not want to discuss any matters with you in the <em>Brown </em>case at all as I am preparing in my last couple of days prior to the beginning of that trial. <em>Feel free to advise [appellants\u2019 counsel] that I will be representing you in the litigation and that we tvill not discuss the Brown case if you feel that you would like to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">I look forward to meeting you on the 20th [of January, 2000].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">(Italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">On January 6, 2000, appellants\u2019 counsel deposed an expert witness of the appellees. In preparation for that deposition, appellants\u2019 counsel met with Dr. Osborne, but the doctor did not disclose that Howard Hospital had retained Armstrong to represent him in another matter. Armstrong entered his appearance as attorney for Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>case on January 7, 2000, three days before the second trial in the instant case was scheduled to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Although the second trial commenced on January 10, 2000, as scheduled, it ended in a mistrial the next day. As the court told the jury, \u201cduring one of the recesses a representative of a former Defendant in this case was overheard by several jurors making comments about this case.\u201d That same day, the parties agreed to yet a third trial date \u2014 March 20, 2000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Thereafter, appellants\u2019 counsel sent a letter to Dr. Osborne on January 16, 2000, informing him that the case had been rescheduled for trial beginning on March 20, 2000. The letter provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">We have a new trial date in two months beginning on March 20, 2000. It is a 10 day trial. Please mark your calendar. As usual, I will contact you shortly before the trial to meet you to prepare for this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Dr. Osborne did not respond to the letter, nor did he ever advise appellants\u2019 attorney as to his availability for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Although the <em>Brown </em>matter was not resolved by January 22, 2000, the date Dr. Osborne was to have his initial meeting with Armstrong concerning the <em>Singleton </em>case, Armstrong decided to proceed with the meeting, because the deadline for a responsive pleading was approaching. As a result of that meeting, Armstrong learned that Dr. Osborne would not be available when the third trial in the <em>Brown </em>case was set to commence on March 20, 2000. By letter dated January 27, 2000, Armstrong wrote to Dr. Osborne about their meeting of January 22, 2000. The letter said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\"><em>I understand that you, will be out-of-town in late February [2000] to Venezuela and the week of March 21 [2000] to Panama. </em>We should hopefully have a number of things happening before you go to Panama. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">As scheduled, the third jury trial in the <em>Brown </em>case began on March 20, 2000. On the morning of March 22, 2000, one of appellants\u2019 attorneys advised the court that he had just learned on March 21, 2000, that Dr. Osborne was out of the country at a medical conference and was unavailable to testify until Monday, March 27, 2000, \u201cat the earliest.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>initially said: \u201cThat is not acceptable. We can\u2019t wait till then ...,\u201d because \u201cit would set us way back....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Armstrong indicated to the court that he had no knowledge of Dr. Osborne\u2019s unavailability. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: As you know from our scheduling discussions, Dr. Alger [, the defense\u2019s expert witness,] is scheduled to testify on Friday afternoon [March 24, 2000]. It was always my understanding in the scheduling of the events of this case that Dr. Osborne was testifying prior to Dr. Alger so that in the normal course of events\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">THE COURT: Almost have to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: \u2014 I would be able to then rebut the allegations. <em>This is the first that I have heard of his unavailability, </em>and I think I can say this without it being inappropriate: If it goes as scheduled, Alger first and Osborne second, I am screwed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">Because of Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence, the court explored appellants\u2019 possible use of the prior testimony of Dr. Osborne, elicited at the first trial in June 1999. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">THE COURT: Did [Dr. Osborne] testify fully at the prior trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: No, he did not, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">THE COURT: It was aborted before he finished his testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, they had finished the direct examination, and I was half way through my cross, at which time we had fully developed the issue that was precipitating the mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>THE COURT: Well, obviously, the reason I ask is, [i]s the prior testimony available for utilization by the plaintiffs in the absence of the witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes, and to the extent that it is a full direct examination, then I think we are okay....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac9\">THE COURT: Well, I guess the ball is in your court. You say you have got about a half of cross; is that enough? I mean, you covered the issues that you wanted to cover?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: I will have to discuss that with my clients at a recess to determine whether they believe that we can proceed with the status of the cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">THE COURT: So if plaintiffs are required to proceed and they do not have the presence-the physical presence of the doctor, then the question will arise whether the use of the deposition is sufficient....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">At that point, appellants\u2019 lead counsel, Taiwo Agbaje, arrived in court. The following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-8\">THE COURT: A situation has arisen where your co-counsel advised me that Dr. Osborne has, as recently as last night, advised the two of you that he will be out of the country until Sunday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-10\">THE COURT: That is not acceptable. We can\u2019t wait till then, and the question is \u2014 and he was scheduled to testify and you were scheduled to finish your case this wee[k].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-11\">The question is whether you can work it out with his prior testimony in the earlier case being read in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I, before responding to that, admit a representation to the Court that my case may go until Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-13\">THE COURT: Well, it is not going to because of a doctor who you said was arranged to be here tomorrow. Now I don\u2019t know whose fault that was that the doctor is not here tomorrow, but it would set us way back and cause us distress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Now either get the doctor here or proceed by deposition or by prior testimony, if the prior testimony is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">Do you know?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Armstrong informed the court that he was \u201cwilling to go with the reading of the prior testimony from the June trial.\u201d He also said: \u201c[I]f there is any prejudice in proceedings with the transcript alone, the prejudice is against my clients and not against the plaintiffs.\u201d Nevertheless, appellants\u2019 counsel complained that, at the first trial, Dr. Osborne testified only as to matters regarding liability, and appellants had intended to elicit additional evidence from him pertaining to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Agbaje also disputed that Dr. Osborne had been scheduled to testify on March 23, 2000, despite what his co-counsel had previously told the court. Agbaje insisted that he had arranged for Dr. Osborne to testify on Friday, March 24, 2000 or Monday, March 27, 2000. After reviewing the record, the court determined that appellants had said they planned to call Dr. Osborne on March 23, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The court expressed concern about a lengthy delay of the trial if it were to accommodate Dr. Osborne by waiting until March 27, 2000, for his testimony. Nevertheless, it continued to explore the matter, noting appellants\u2019 desire while also observing that the testimony of several other witnesses had been scheduled based on the belief that Dr. Osborne would testify on March 23, 2000. The following colloquy is illuminating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">THE COURT: And I don\u2019t know that you are even certain of having Dr. Osborne on Monday, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: We can get him here Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">THE COURT: Well, let\u2019s assume that happened. That would mean that the defense doctor would have to be put off beyond Dr. Osborne because obviously the defense doctor is testifying in response to Dr. Osborne.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-11\">The whole trial was aborted last time to allow counsel to get some doctor to meet this new theory that Dr. Osborne presented, as I understand. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-4\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: To meet the theory, but in sequence\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">THE COURT: Well, of course. You can\u2019t meet it before it is presented, and you see what that would do to our scheduling? We would probably have a down day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">Now you have the testimony of Dr. Osborne from a prior transcript, do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: We do, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-9\">THE COURT: And I have offered you the opportunity to use that, and counsel has agreed that even though you had incomplete cross-examination that he would not interpose an objection to that as opposed to not having the testimony of Dr. Osborne at all, and now you are telling me you want Dr. Osborne here on Monday.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">The prejudice is loss of a full trial day potentially, maybe more.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">\u201c[0]ut of a super abundance of caution,\u201d the court decided it would permit Dr. Osborne to testify on Monday, March 27, 2000, if appellants\u2019 counsel could assure the court the next day of Dr. Osborne\u2019s availability on that date. Unfortunately for appellants, Dr. Osborne was not available on March 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">During the discussion about delaying Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony until March 27, 2000, Armstrong made a statement to the court that is of significance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-13\">I have to be careful how I do this. <em>It is no secret to me from January that Dr. Osborne wasn\u2019t going to be here this week, no secret to me at all, and that is because of other business contacts that I had ivith him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-14\"><em>I knew in January that he ivasn\u2019t going to be in town this week. I kneiv he wasn\u2019t even going to be in the country, </em>and the gall it takes [for appellants\u2019 counsel] to come in and represent [that they just found out last night that Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Osborne would be unavailable to testify until Monday] is appalling to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">(Emphasis added). At that juncture, however, appellants did not complain, protest, or inquire about Armstrong\u2019s communications with Dr. Osborne regarding \u201cother business contacts .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">At that point, the court revisited its earlier concern about the failure of appellants\u2019 counsel to arrange for Dr. Osborne\u2019s presence at trial. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">THE COURT: Well, how could you have possibly \u2014 I am going back to the question I asked you before: How could you have possibly made any arrangements with this doctor for his testimony this week if since January Dr. Osborne has known he is not going to be here this week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5H\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I sent him a letter every time I have tried this case with him. I have always sent him a letter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">THE COURT: You have had no communication with him, no confirmation of a date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: A lot of times I don\u2019t call; I just send him a letter. That is how we have always done this, and he has always been very flexible with us \u2014 always.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZp\">THE COURT: You sent him a letter when? I just asked you if you had a letter to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I sent him a letter in January\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">THE COURT: But you didn\u2019t tell him when you expected him to testify; you just told him \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-11\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-12\">THE COURT: \u2014 when the case was going to start.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arq\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I told him the case was March 20 and I will get back in touch with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-13\">THE COURT: Did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-14\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: When I came in, that is when I sent him the e-mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asa\">THE COURT: When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: It was Monday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">THE COURT: Not until Monday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: It wasn\u2019t until Monday that I sent him an e-mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">THE COURT: That is just not enough lead time for any expert witness when you are trying to set up scheduling, and we discussed scheduling even last week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And again, Your Honor, just to \u2014 just for credibility purposes, if I knew that Dr. Osborne was going to be out of the country this week and he knew\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-t\">THE COURT: If you had contacted Dr. Osborne, you would have known that.... The failure to contact your expert witness, a failure to make arrangements for his presence on a specific day or days is what has gotten us into this problem, and I have got restless jurors who have got other things to do in their lives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">In a chambers conference the next day, March 23, 2000, appellants\u2019 counsel voiced concern about Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>matter. The court considered the matter \u201cof sufficient import ... that it ought to be fully on the record.\u201d Accordingly, in open court, the judge recounted \u201cpart of what was said [in chambers] and then call[ed] upon counsel to flesh out the bones.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">For its part, the court noted that Armstrong had intended to delay meeting with Dr. Osborne until the end of the second <em>Brown </em>trial in January 2000. But, that trial abruptly and unexpectedly ended before the date that Armstrong had scheduled for the meeting with Dr. Osborne. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aej-dedup-0\">So, it became necessary for Mr. Armstrong to get on with his representation of Dr. Osborne in the D.C. case, and he did so, he says, by making it clear and having an understanding with Dr. Osborne that he would not, could not in any way discuss the aspects of this case with Dr. Osborne while he represented him in Dr. Osborne\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">The court continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The concern of the plaintiffs is that \u2014 two-fold, I guess, or maybe three-fold: That the representation of Dr. Osborne by Mr. Armstrong presents an irreconcilable and unwaiva-ble conflict, in that Dr. Osborne, by reason of the ongoing representation of him by Mr. Armstrong, may be biased somewhat, which may affect his testimony, either in substance or in flavor, and that they are concerned that they were not advised of this earlier....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">The attorneys are concerned about the appearance of the matter to their clients. So, whether there is a conflict in fact or not, there is the appearance that concerns them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">And finally, I am advised [by appellants\u2019 counsel] that they are unable to procure the attendance of Dr. Osborne on Monday [March 27, 2000]. Dr. Osborne is, as we know, out of the country attending a meeting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">And we knew that, but <em>I said if he could be back here by Monday morning, we would allow them to go, notwithstanding my concerns about their failure to have placed him under subpoena or made any precise arrangements with him for the date of his attendance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\n<em>I am now advised that he cannot be back here to testify on Monday and that they are simply unable to procure his attendance.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">Now, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have indicated that they are concerned that in some fashion or some manner perhaps Mr. Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne has caused or contributed to (a) Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence or (b) Dr. Osborne\u2019s inability to be back by Monday or reticence to be back by Monday</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">That is as far as we got. I felt it was sufficiently serious so that we ought to be on [the] record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">I pointed out to counsel that <em>certainly my initial observation here is that counsel for plaintiff did not make the necessary, prudent, and required arrangements with Dr. Osborne to be present. He is not under subpoena.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">\n<em>We have bent over backwards to say that if he could get him here by Monday and if other arrangements could be </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\n<em>made for the rebuttal witness or for the defense witness to follow him, that I would reconsider my earlier determination, and indeed I am willing to.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-4\">But now I am told he can\u2019t be here, but then that is complicated by the fact of why can\u2019t he be here.... And this certainly does pose a problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">However, my initial inclination is that since they did not take the necessary steps to procure the presence of Dr. Osborne \u2014 and although having represented to me that arrangements were made for his attendance on Thursday, they clearly did not.... [N]o arrangements were made either for Thursday or for Monday \u2014 specific arrangements, because if so, Dr. Osborne would be here and there would be no problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">I am not going to wait until Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of next week for Dr. Osborne. And therefore, it seems to me the solution is that <em>the plaintiffs, by reason of their own failure to make the necessary arrangements, are going to be required, if they want Dr. Osborne at all, to use the prior stvom testimony of Dr. Osborne [from the first trial].</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-7\">They are concerned about that for two reasons. I guess (1) it doesn\u2019t have the impact of a live witness, and (2) they claim that had Mr. Armstrong finished his cross-examination, they would have been entitled to redirect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Well, I am not much impressed by certainly the second argument, because redirect is nothing except meeting new matter that is presented on cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">And so, theoretically at least and practically, they should have laid forth their entire case to be presented by Dr. Osborne during the direct testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-10\">That being the case and <em>it being the fact that Dr. Osborne indeed gave his prior testimony before there was any sniff of representation of Dr. Osborne by Mr. Armstrong, there can be no bias. There can be no potential for bias in the testimony that Dr. Osborne has already given.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Accordingly, <em>it seems to me that a potential problem and a potential conflict that would have required much deeper inquiry is avoided, </em>perhaps fortuitously, by the developments in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">During the ensuing discussion, appellants vigorously complained that they had \u201cbeen prejudiced by the failure of Mr. Armstrong to notify [them] that he had been in contact with Dr. Osborne\u201d since December 1999. They also claimed that their \u201cexpert ha[d] been contaminated.\u201d In addition, appellants expressed \u201cconcern with regards to the objectivity and the credibility\u201d of Dr. Osborne, claiming that if they had been provided with notice of Armstrong\u2019s representation, appellants could have made a decision \u201cas to what [they] wanted to do with Dr. Osborne.\u201d Consequently, appellants \u201cmov[ed] the Court for a mistrial,\u201d moved to disqualify Armstrong, and asked the court \u201cto grant the plaintiffs an extension of time within which to designate a new expert witness and to grant the plaintiffs a new trial date in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Armstrong explained how he came to represent Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>matter. Before agreeing to do so, he claimed that he had reviewed the ethics rules but did not perceive a conflict because the <em>Singleton </em>case was \u201ca completely unrelated matter in a different jurisdiction.\u201d Moreover, he said that he met with Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>case on only one occasion, and made a genuine effort to avoid contact with Dr. Osborne until the conclusion of the <em>-Brown </em>trial. He added: \u201cWe made very specific arrangements that we would not discuss this case.\u201d Armstrong asserted, however, that after the second mistrial in January 2000, he \u201chad to meet\u201d with Dr. Osborne because an answer had to be filed in the <em>Singleton </em>case by the end of January 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Further, Armstrong maintained that he learned of Dr. Osborne\u2019s plans to be out of the country the week of March 21, 2000, only because the <em>Singleton </em>case was scheduled for a status conference on March 24, 2000, and he had inquired of Dr. Osborne as to where he would be on that date, so that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201ccould report to him ... what happened.\u201d As he saw it, that did not mean that Dr. Osborne would be unavailable for the duration of the trial. Armstrong also observed that Dr. Osborne had already given his opinion in court, <em>before </em>Armstrong was ever retained in the <em>Singleton </em>case, and his opinion was thus cast \u201cin concrete.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The court questioned Armstrong about whether he encouraged Dr. Osborne not to appear. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">THE COURT: Did you in any way procure the absence of Dr. Osborne at this time or encourage it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">[ARMSTRONG]: My understanding from what he told me about the scheduling was that he is from Panama and that he was planning on going to Panama the week of March 21st , and he was going for a conference, and I think he was receiving an award if I remember correctly, and that it had been scheduled for many months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">So, the direct answer is no, but that was the context.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">The court also asked:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">THE COURT: Did you in any way, you know, encourage him not to cooperate with plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2B\">[ARMSTRONG]: I haven\u2019t even discussed that subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Appellants\u2019 attorney responded that, \u201cknowing what counsel knew, ... as an officer of the court, [Armstrong] had a duty to at least inform the Court that he knew that Dr. Osborne was now going to be away.... It looks like there is an attempt to mislead in this situation. My clients have been seriously prejudiced.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Nevertheless, the court questioned how Dr. Osborne\u2019s \u201cearlier testimony could have been in any way' contaminated,\u201d given that Armstrong did not represent Dr. Osborne in June 1999. In the view of appellants\u2019 counsel, the answer to that question required \u201cDr. Osborne here to tell us exactly when this representation began.\u201d The court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-12\">Well, I am going to accept [Armstrong\u2019s] representation on the record in court that it began in December of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>1999.... I mean, if you find out something different at a subsequent time, obviously that is the subject of a post-trial motion. But at this point I am certainly going to accept it for the purposes of making a determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Accordingly, the court denied appellants\u2019 mistrial motion. In reaching that decision, the court was satisfied that it did not have to resolve the conflict issue, because it concluded that it was the failure of appellants\u2019 counsel to make the necessary arrangements to secure the presence of Dr. Osborne at trial that resulted in the expert\u2019s unavailability. Moreover, the court was also satisfied that appellants\u2019 cause was not completely disadvantaged, because the court agreed to permit appellants to introduce in evidence Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony from the first trial. The court said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">I am going to stick with my original determination in this case, which is reinforced, that <em>sufficient arrangements were not made </em>\u2014 notwithstanding <em>the representations made to me, sufficient arrangements were not made for the presence of Dr. Osborne. </em>And therefore, I am \u2014 and to this date can\u2019t be made to have him here in anywhere near time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">^ H: Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">At the very latest, we should finish up the testimony Monday at noon, according to current scheduling, as I gathered. And I am not going to put this case off any longer or drag it or delay it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">And obviously defense counsel would have the right to have their doctor who rebuts Dr. Osborne come after Dr. Osborne. So, that would completely snarl things....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">\n<em>You didn\u2019t make sufficient arrangements. There was not the exercise of ordwmry prudence in arranging for the attendance of Dr. Osborne, and you, know, you are stuck with that.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\"><em>Now, happily, you are not shuck entirely, because you do have the earlier trial transcript, which I will allow to be used </em>with a suitable reader and so on. We can work out the details of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>And that can\u2019t be tainted, </em>... I find from information available to me now, <em>by any subsequent representation of [Dr. Osboime by] Mr. Armstrong. </em>So, again, somewhat fortuitously, a potential problem is solved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">Now in making that determination, let me make it also clear that if things were different, if Dr. Osborne were coming in here on Monday to testify and you raised this problem with me, I would have to give that a great deal of thought as to whether that potential conflict and the potential for subtle influences on Dr. Osborne would necessitate granting your motion. But that is not the case, and I am not going to tilt at windmills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\n<em>I just don\u2019t want the record to shotu that I am accepting carte blanche the argument of defense counsel that there is no conflict. I am simply finding that I don\u2019t have to get into that for other reasons that, as I say, are somewhat fortuitous.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>Motion for mistrial is denied.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the court granted appel-lees\u2019 motion for judgment as to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The case was then submitted to the jury on the remaining claim of negligence. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">On April 7, 2000, appellants filed a \u201cMotion For New Trial, And For Sanctions,\u201d supported by an affidavit of Agbaje. He averred, <em>inter alia, </em>that he contacted Dr. Osborne on January 11, 2000, to advise him of the new trial date of March 20, 2000, and the doctor \u201cconfirmed that the week of March 20 \u2014 March 30, 2000 was available for him.\u201d Agbaje also said that he wrote to Dr. Osborne on January 16, 2000, \u201cto memorialize the trial date of March 20, 2000,\u201d and made other attempts to contact the doctor in February and March 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The court held an evidentiary hearing on May 30, 2000, at which Robert Michael, Esquire, appeared as co-counsel with Armstrong. The evidence included the post-trial testimony of Dr. Osborne, taken on March 29, 2000; transcripts from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>third trial; pleadings from the <em>Singleton </em>case, including Armstrong\u2019s entry of appearance on January 7, 2000; Agbaje\u2019s affidavit; testimony of Armstrong; and testimony of Paul Bekman, Esq., an expert for Armstrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Appellants argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that, based on their prior relationship with Dr. Osborne, appellants\u2019 counsel \u201cnever had a reason to subpoena Dr. Osborne.\u201d Agbaje asserted: \u201cThis is not about me issuing a subpoena to Dr. Osborne.... \u201d He maintained that he did not subpoena Dr. Osborne because he considered it \u201cunwise to subpoena your own expert, that it is actually never done....\u201d Moreover, Agbaje reiterated his contention that Armstrong had access to \u201cconfidential information\u201d and \u201cstrategies\u201d of appellants through appellants\u2019 expert. He also attributed the doctor\u2019s \u201cunusual behavior\u201d in not responding to his calls to Armstrong\u2019s involvement with Dr. Osborne, implying that Armstrong \u201cconnived to procure Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence.\u201d Agbaje conceded, however, that he had no evidence to that effect. Instead, he pointed to the \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d characterizing Armstrong\u2019s conduct as \u201cpatently inappropriate\u201d and \u201cgrossly unfair,\u201d and charging that Armstrong \u201corchestrated\u201d the expert\u2019s failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The court responded, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">I indicated that while I might have some concern with the advisability, propriety, what have you of representing a doctor that you knew was going to be involved on the other side as an expert witness in a case, but that under the particular circumstances of this case I didn\u2019t feel it necessary to delve too deeply into that because you had not made the necessary arrangements for the presence of the doctor nor had you exercised any prudence or been in contact with the doctor nor had you issued a subpoena for the doctor to be present, and we were going to allow you to use the doctor\u2019s deposition, and there was no possibility that that testimony could have been in any way tainted by subsequent representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>[I]f you could offer some evidence ... that [Dr. Osborne\u2019s] absence had been procured, ... then that would put a different light on it, but what evidence do you have, therefore, that his absence had been procured by Mr. Armstrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">Mr. Armstrong represented to the Court he had not procured his absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">[Y]ou think that inferences can be drawn that somehow Mr. Armstrong procured the absence of this witness for this trial, and I guess I am asking you what evidence you have of that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, first and foremost, if we review the testimony of Dr. Osborne throughout the course of this trial and, you know, the question that bothers me is how his testimony continued to just change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">Everything just kept changing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">[THE COURT]: Well, now wait a minute. The testimony of Dr. Osborne that was admitted at the trial before the jury . .. was taken before the representation of Mr. Armstrong began, was it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: It was taken ... before the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">[THE COURT]: So how could that representation have affected that preexisting testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Well, that is assuming \u2014 that is if we were to assume that this whole collusion began in December.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">[THE COURT]: All right. Now what evidence do you have to the contrary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-14\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I do not believe that I need to present that evidence to this Court. I think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-15\">[THE COURT]: Well do you have it? I mean, are you holding it in your back pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: As to \u2014 no, I don\u2019t, Your Honor, but that is not the inquiry, Your Honor. What we are trying to do here is find direct evidence of their involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">It is never going to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">[THE COURT]: No, circumstantial evidence can be just as strong as direct sometimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: That is right, and I do have the circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">[THE COURT]: All right, tell me what it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Okay. The circumstantial evidence is Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony had started changing from the time \u2014 and I did present the Court with the various reports, his deposition testimony and his trial testimony, from the time that we hired him up until the time of the last trial in June....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">Mr. Armstrong should be removed from this case because we believe that he has had confidential information. He ... knew about our strategy. Everything that was done in this court was orchestrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">As noted, shortly after the third trial, appellants deposed Dr. Osborne. They introduced his deposition testimony, which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-10\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: When was the first time that you had contact with Mr. Armstrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">[DR. OSBORNE]: That was [when] Howard University referred me to Mr. Armstrong because of an unrelated matter just before I left for Caracas, Venezuela.... There was no discussion about this case whatsoever....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0Y\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Who initiated the contact, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-12\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Howard University.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-13\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Did you have any telephone discussion with Mr. Armstrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>[DR. OSBORNE]: I\u2019m sure 1 did only to be notified that Howard has appointed him to represent me in the case against Howard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: When was that, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Oh, that was just before leaving for Venezuela. I don\u2019t remember the exact date. It must have been February 25th or thereabouts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Prior to February 2000, have you had any contact with Mr. Armstrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Only in court [with respect to the <em>Brown </em>matter],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Did Mr. Armstrong advise you that \u2014 to inform the plaintiffs and their counsel of his potential representation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">[DR. OSBORNE]: I think he mentioned that we should talk about it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">[DR. OSBORNE]: He asked me if I had any problem, if I foresaw any conflict with this. I said no, I will testify what I have to testify in court regardless of who I am appointed to, it would have absolutely no bearing whatsoever on my testimony [in the <em>Brown </em>case], and I haven\u2019t gotten in contact with him since then.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Have you met Mr. Armstrong in person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-14\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-15\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: When did you meet with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-16\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Just before leaving [the country]. I don\u2019t remember the exact date....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-17\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: That was sometime in February?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-18\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Late February.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: What was the nature of the meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Just to discuss what the <em>[Singleton] </em>case was all about, what involvement I had with the patient ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Now, the trip to Panama, when was it planned?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\n<em>[DR. OSBORNE]: Oh, it was planned months in advance. I don\u2019t know if I have the program here. It\u2019s over a year ago.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Did Mr. Armstrong have your telephone number [in Panama]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">[DR. OSBORNE]: No....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Doctor, before today have you advised the plaintiff of your role with Kenneth Armstrong, before this testimony that you are giving, have you ever contacted the plaintiffs about your involvement with Mr. Armstrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-12\">[DR. OSBORNE]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: So if I didn\u2019t bring this up, Doctor, there\u2019s no way we would have known, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agl\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Well, I don\u2019t know if there is any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5N\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: But it would not have come from you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-14\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Not from me, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\">Armstrong recounted the chronology of his representation of Dr. Osborne, explaining that Howard Hospital first contacted him in late December 1999. Thereafter, on January 5, 2000, Armstrong talked to Dr. Osborne for the first time, and told him that he wanted to meet after completion of the <em>Brown </em>trial, which was scheduled to begin January 10, 2000. He also maintained that he promptly invoked the principles of a \u201cChi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>nese wall,\u201d and advised Dr. Osborne that he \u201cwould not be discussing the Brown case with [Dr. Osborne] at any time.... \u201d Further, Armstrong testified that he \u201cleft it to [Dr. Osborne] to contact Mr. Agbaje if he wished to do so, about [Armstrong\u2019s] representation [of him] in the <em>Singleton </em>case,\u201d because he thought that was the \u201cbest\u201d way to proceed. In his view, any conflict was Dr. Osborne\u2019s, not his. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">I did not believe once I had created the information or wall, as it has been phrased, a Chinese wall, that I had a separate obligation to contact Mr. Agbaje to advise him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">I believed that was \u2014 with the attorney/client privilege particularly at that stage, it was for Mr. \u2014 or for Dr. Osborne to waive the privilege and discuss it directly with\u2014 with counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The following testimony of Armstrong is also pertinent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae_\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: And can you tell us, sir, [a]t any time after you commenced representation of Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>matter, had you at any time, either orally, in writing, directly, indirectly, discussed with him any aspect of the Brown case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">[ARMSTRONG]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: Does that also include his availability for trial\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">[ARMSTRONG]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: \u2014 in March of the Year 2000?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">[ARMSTRONG]: Yes, it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: And did you make any effort at any time, either before trial or during trial to find out from Dr. Osborne or his staff or have a member of your staff try to find out information about whether he was actually coming to this trial or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-12\">[ARMSTRONG]: I made no attempt to make any such contact or to determine that at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>[COUNSEL FOR APPELLEES]: And did you, Mr. Armstrong, do anything, either directly or indirectly, to cause, influence or in any way have Dr. Osborne not be present for trial in the Brown matter in March of the Year 2000?

Bekman noted that the propriety of contact between an attorney and an expert for an opposing party \u201cdepends upon the facts and the particular circumstances of the case.... \u201d Bekman opined: \u201cI think [Armstrong] acted totally appropriately when he contacted [Dr. Osborne]....\u201d In Bekman\u2019s view, it was significant that Dr. Osborne had \u201ccommitted himself to his testimony in June of 1999 ... \u201d, before Howard Hospital ever retained Armstrong. He also considered it noteworthy that Armstrong had not sought out Dr. Osborne.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Additionally, Bekman deemed it significant that Armstrong was never put in the position of having to cross-examine Dr. Osborne. Moreover, Bekman suggested that it was Dr. Osborne who may have had the conflict. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">I believe it is Dr. Osborne\u2019s call here as to whether there is a conflict, and I think that was made very clear in Mr. Armstrong\u2019s letter to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">Let\u2019s say that Mr. Armstrong had met with Dr. Osborne and was going to cross-examine him at the time of trial, and Dr. Osborne, in connection with the <em>Singleton </em>case, gave Mr. Armstrong confidential information about his background; for example, that he had been denied privileges or his privileges had been suspended at a hospital for some conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">That would be information that Mr. Armstrong would have garnered during the course of his professional relationship with Dr. Osborne which he would not otherwise have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>learned, and for him to then take that and use it in the <em>Brown </em>case would be improper, and that is why, under those circumstances, had that situation arose, it would have been improper, but as I have indicated and as the facts in this case have shown, there was no taint because the testimony that was used was the June 1999 testimony, and Mr. Armstrong never cross-examined Dr. Osborne after he was appointed to his representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">On the other hand, Bekman was critical of the failure of appellants\u2019 counsel to subpoena Dr. Osborne. Although \u201cMr. Agbaje ... candidly admitted that he did not subpoena Dr. Osborne....,\u201d Bekman said that, by custom and practice, and for the protection of both the lawyer and the doctor, a lawyer should subpoena a physician whose testimony is needed for trial. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">[T]he physicians and experts who testify are extremely busy and their calendars are extremely busy, so it\u2019s critical to map out when someone is going to testify during a trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">The court does not want any down time; the court wants to move the case along, and the parties and everyone is entitled to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">So the specific time and date is going to be determined well in advance because the physician or expert has to make arrangements within their schedule when they can come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">So you have got to give them as much advance notice as is possible, and they are going to want to know not just a week ahead of time; they\u2019re going to want to know as much as a month or more ahead of time when they\u2019re going to be able to come in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The court carefully considered the circumstances of the case and the evidence. It was \u201cpersuaded\u201d that \u201cthe so-called Chinese wall was effectively erected; that is, one was put in place immediately ...\u201d by Armstrong. Although the court was satisfied that \u201cno information was exchanged or obtained with respect to the Brown case ...,\u201d it was also mindful of the potential \u201csubliminal effect\u201d of Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The problem ... perhaps transcends [the Chinese wall]. The problem is in the existence of a lawyer/client confidential relationship and its potentially subtle .. . effect on Dr. Osborne\u2019s later testimony.... It is not always possible to fully understand how the representation of an expert in a separate case, by the very lawyer opposing the party who retained the expert in another case, may impact on you whether you want it to impact on you or not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Thus, the court acknowledged a \u201clingering concern about the representation of the opposing expert even under the circumstances that occurred here.\u201d It also had a \u201clingering concern about Mr. Armstrong\u2019s obligation, if any, to say something to Mr. Agbaje about this so that if there was a problem that required the court\u2019s attention before the case came to trial, it might have been fully litigated then.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Ultimately, however, the court again determined that, in the context of this case, any conflict or impropriety of Armstrong was of no consequence, because it was the conduct of appellants in failing to arrange for Dr. Osborne\u2019s appearance at trial that led to his unavailability. The court reasoned that there were two possible grounds that would alter the significance of appellants\u2019 failure to arrange for Dr. Osborne\u2019s appearance at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">[I]f there is harm, there is no foul unless one of two things is present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">If Mr. Armstrong procured the absence of Dr. Osborne or counseled Dr. Osborne as to non-availability or non-communication with plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that would be a different matter because that then would affect why Dr. Osborne was not there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">The second possibility that could change my mind would be if Mr. Armstrong had some contact with Dr. Osborne apart from normal and appropriate contact dealing with this Brown case before Dr. Osborne\u2019s deposition and testimony became of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">The court was readily satisfied that neither circumstance outlined above occurred. Therefore, it did not consider it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>necessary to determine whether Armstrong committed any ethical violation. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">I find without difficulty that neither of those two contingencies occurred. Mr. Armstrong did not procure the absence of Dr. Osborne nor did he counsel him about nonavailability or non-communication with plaintiffs counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">Mr. Armstrong, furthermore, had no contact outside of the normal expected contact in this case with Dr. Osborne before Dr. Osborne\u2019s deposition and testimony were taken.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">So what I opined at the time I think continues to be true, that I need not determine here whether there was a violation of an ethical standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">I have admitted to having some lingering concern for the reasons I have expressed, but it doesn\u2019t matter in the context of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">The ruling that I made was a ruling that had to do with whether Dr. Osborne \u2014 whether there had been any prudent steps to procure his presence, and actually his deposition was ultimately used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">The court also concluded that the use at the third trial of Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony from the first trial was due solely to appellants\u2019 failure to subpoena Dr. Osborne. Because that testimony was elicited in June 1999, months before Armstrong ever began to represent Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>case, the court found that the June 1999 testimony could not have been tainted by any conflict of interest. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKy\">[H]ere, as I pointed out at trial, the determination of whether there was anything that was in violation of ethical standards turns out not to be critical because I found then and I was absolutely correct, in my opinion, that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel had made no appropriate arrangements for the appearance of Dr. Osborne, had not subpoenaed Dr. Osborne, had not made sufficient pre-trial efforts to locate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">At one point I was told by co-counsel for Mr. Agbaje that yes, the arrangements had been made, the doctor would be there, and a specific date was given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Now that turned out to be or at least it was represented to me to be a misunderstanding between counsel and that co-counsel had made a representation that he had no right to make.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">He understood it one way, but it was not that way because in fact counsel for the plaintiffs had not been in touch with Dr. Osborne to make the arrangements, and I had made it very clear before any of this really came into full bloom that they were going to have to go with the deposition or lose the testimony of the doctor entirely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">As it turned out, they did go with the deposition, and so the fact that there was a subsequent representation, even if it may have offended any ethical standards, is of no import to me in connection with whether this trial was fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">Plaintiffs were appropriately, in my opinion, relegated to the use of Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">Accordingly, the court ruled:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">So I find there [are] no grounds for the granting of a mistrial.... I deny that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">There was a motion for sanctions. I deny that. There is a motion for new trial, and I deny that....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-10\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">Appellants contend that the court erred in failing to grant either a mistrial or a new trial as a result of Arm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>strong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>case. They argue that Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>matter during the pendency of the <em>Brown </em>case, and his <em>ex parte </em>communications with Dr. Osborne, \u201cdeprived appellants of a fair trial,\u201d amounted to \u201cwitness tampering,\u201d and constituted \u201cmisconduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Indeed, appellants assert that the relationship between Armstrong and Dr. Osborne \u201creeks of bias, impropriety and it stinks to the high heavens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In particular, appellants maintain that, \u201c[b]y his unsupervised access to Osborne on more than two occasions, Aim-strong violate[d] Rule 8.4(d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d Rule 8.4(d) provides: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Appellants also contend that \u201cArmstrong\u2019s attempts to mislead the Trial Court by stating that he was just hearing of Osborne\u2019s unavailability on March 22, 2000 is professional misconduct which violates Rule 8.4(c), which prohibits a lawyer\u2019s engagement in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d Therefore, appellants contend that the trial court erred in concluding that they were not prejudiced by Armstrong\u2019s relationship with Dr. Osborne.'</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Appellees raise several arguments in opposition to appellants\u2019 claims. They point out that Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence at trial was the result of the failure of appellants\u2019 counsel \u201cto secure his attendance\u201d by subpoena. Moreover, they maintain that appellants were not prejudiced because the court allowed them to offer the testimony of Dr. Osborne, adduced at the first trial in June 1999, which \u201cpreceded any relationship with Mr. Armstrong, thereby removing any possible taint or prejudice.\u201d In addition, appellees observe that appellants never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>objected to the use of Dr. Osborne\u2019s trial testimony of June 9, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">At the outset, because appellants\u2019 challenge is raised in the context of the court\u2019s failure to grant a mistrial or a new trial, we pause to review the standards that govern our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe declaration of a mistrial is an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Hill v.

State, </em>366 Md. 574, 589, 785 A.2d 348 (2001). \u201cWhether to order a mistrial lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and appellate review of the denial of the motion is limited to whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Godwin, </em>340 Md. at 407, 667 A.2d 116; <em>see Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 555, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999); <em>Medical Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc\u2019y v. Evans, </em>330 Md. 1, 19, 622 A.2d 103 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Maryland Rule 2-533 permits a party to seek a new trial upon a timely motion founded on proper grounds. <em>See Thodos v. Bland, </em>75 Md.App. 700, 706, 542 A.2d 1307, <em>cert. denied, </em>313 Md. 689, 548 A.2d 128 (1988). As the Court of Appeals recently made clear, the denial of a motion for new trial is reviewable on appeal and, ordinarily, \u201cdiscretionary rulings on such motions are subject to reversal where there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Merritt v. State, </em>367 Md. 17, 28, 785 A.2d 756 (2001); <em>see Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em>328 Md. 51, 56-7, 612 A.2d 1294 (1992). But, in <em>Merritt, </em>the Court also recognized that a ruling on a motion for new trial is sometimes reviewed under an error standard. The Court said: \u201cConsistent with the recognition in <em>Buck </em>that sometimes a trial court has virtually no discretion to deny a new trial motion, we have taken the position that some denials of new trial motions are reviewable under a standard of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>court erred rather than under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Merritt, </em>367 Md. at 30-31, 785 A.2d 756. Moreover, the Court explained that, when an alleged error occurs during trial and is not discovered, without fault, during the trial, the denial of a new trial motion is reviewed \u201cunder a standard of whether the denial was erroneous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In this case, on March 23, 2000, and again on May 30, 2000, the court fully heard the issues spawned by Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne in the unrelated malpractice case. As we have seen, the evidence and proffers showed that Howard Hospital contacted Armstrong about an unrelated matter. He intended to meet with Dr. Osborne in late January 2000, after the conclusion of the second <em>Brown </em>trial. Because it ended in a mistrial, however, Armstrong proceeded with the meeting that had been previously scheduled. In doing so, the court found that Armstrong quickly erected a \u201cChinese wall,\u201d and never exchanged confidential information or discussed any aspect of the <em>Brown </em>case with Dr. Osborne. Significantly, the court was also satisfied that Armstrong did not procure Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence at the <em>Brown </em>trial, or suggest to him that he should not cooperate with appellants. Indeed, the court explicitly found: \u201cMr. Armstrong did not procure the absence of Dr. Osborne nor did he counsel him about non-availability or non-communication with plaintiffs counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">To be sure, the court acknowledged \u201clingering\u201d concerns as to the propriety of Armstrong\u2019s conduct and the possible \u201csubliminal\u201d influences on Dr. Osborne as a result of Armstrong\u2019s representation of him. But, it concluded that the misconduct, if any, was of no legal significance, because Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence at trial was the result of appellants\u2019 own dereliction in failing to exercise \u201cordinary prudence in arranging for [his] attendance.\u201d Therefore, the trial judge concluded that it was not necessary to determine \u201cwhether there was a violation of an ethical standard\u201d by Armstrong. As a result of that ruling, appellants introduced in evidence Dr. Osborne\u2019s untainted testimony from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>We apply the clearly erroneous standard to the lower court\u2019s numerous findings of fact. Rule 8-131(c); <em>see Gregg Neck Yacht Club, Inc. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent County, </em>137 Md.App. 732, 751-52, 769 A.2d 982 (2001). \u201cThe clearly erroneous standard requires an appellate court to consider the evidence produced at trial in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Murphy v. 24th Street Cadillac Corp., </em>353 Md. 480, 497, 727 A.2d 915 (1999). \u201cA trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous when they are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Gregg Neck, </em>137 Md.App. at 752, 769 A.2d 982. In our view, the court\u2019s factual findings, including that Armstrong erected a Chinese wall, did not procure Dr. Osborne\u2019s absence, and did not induce him not to cooperate with appellants, were not clearly erroneous. We also completely agree with the court that Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony from June 1999 was not tainted by Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne, because that representation did not begin until some six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">We are equally satisfied that the court was legally and factually correct in finding that Dr. Osborne was unavailable due to appellants\u2019 conduct. This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cWhen an expert to support the litigant\u2019s position is found, it behooves counsel to consult with the expert witness to review the facts, examine the record and discuss the theory of the claim or a defense of the client. At the same time, it is the responsibility of trial counsel to discuss fees for consultations, review of opposing experts\u2019 opinions and voluntary attendance at trial. If the expert is beyond the jurisdiction of the court to compel attendance at trial, it is the responsibility of the party offering the expert to ascertain the willingness and availability of the expert to appear at trial. The proponent of the expert must attempt to arrange a trial date at which the expert can appear. <em>Since the expert is under the control of the offering litigant, due diligence must be used to secure the attendance of the witness at trial.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Myers v. Estate of Alessi, </em>80 Md.App. 124, 140, 560 A.2d 59, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. at 641, 566 A.2d 101 (1989) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">With respect to the alleged conflict of interest, we note that in our review of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, we have not found a provision that specifically governs the circumstances of this case. Rule 1.7 and Rule 1.8, for example, pertain to conflicts of interest, but do not apply here. To illustrate, Rule 1.7(a) generally bars an attorney from representing a client if the representation would be \u201cadverse to another client.\u201d Rule 3.4(a), which prohibits a lawyer from \u201cobstructing] another party\u2019s access to evidence ... [or] counseling] or assisting] another person to do any such act,\u201d would have general applicability, but the court expressly found no such conduct by Armstrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Even if Armstrong had a conflict of interest with regard to his representation of Dr. Osborne, a conflict alone does not compel us to reverse. Analogizing this case to a claim of conflict of interest by a defense attorney in a criminal case, we believe that a finding of conflict is but \u201cthe first step in determining\u201d whether a mistrial or a new trial is warranted. <em>See United States v. Schwarz, </em>283 F.3d 76, 92 (2nd Cir., 2002)(concluding that defendant\u2019s trial attorney had conflict of interest in representing defendant in police brutality case, because he also represented police association; therefore, defendant was denied constitutional right to counsel). Indeed, the Second Circuit recently acknowledged that a new trial is warranted when the conflict \u201cadversely affect[s]\u201d the lawyer\u2019s performance. <em>Id. </em>In much the same way, we have looked here for some evidence that the alleged conflict adversely affected the expert\u2019s performance. That issue' never materialized, however, because appellants never secured the expert\u2019s attendance at trial, and there was no finding or evidence that Armstrong somehow corrupted the expert to induce him not to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Appellants rely on <em>Erickson v. Newmar Corp., </em>87 F.3d 298 (9th Cir.1996), to support them contentions. In that case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Donald Erickson, who was <em>pro se, </em>brought suit against New-mar Coloration, claiming that his motor home, manufactured by Newmar, was defective. Before a scheduled deposition of Erickson\u2019s metal expert, Newmar\u2019s attorney sought to hire the plaintiffs expert to evaluate a lock for an unrelated case. The plaintiff was present during the conversation, and when the defense lawyer asked him if he had a problem with the arrangement, he said that it was not his decision. <em>Id. </em>at 300. Subsequently, the plaintiff told the attorney that she had \u201cviolated the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Erickson filed a \u201cMotion for Judgment Against Newmar for Tampering with a Material Witness,\u201d <em>id., </em>which the court denied. That same day, after the expert resigned from his role with defense counsel in the unrelated case, Erickson fired the expert, claiming a lack of trust. In addition, Erickson\u2019s other expert witness refused to testify, because \u201che did not want to be involved in a case where \u2018the attorneys [were] bothering the witnesses.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, Erickson went to trial without his expert witnesses, and the court entered judgment in favor of Newmar.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit framed its inquiry as follows: \u201c[Pjlaintiffs claim of unethical conduct by defense counsel requires us to decide: 1) whether [the defense] attorney[\u2019s] offer of employment and subsequent ex parte communication with [the plaintiffs expert] was unethical; and 2) if so, what sanction is appropriate?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. The court ruled that the trial court \u201cabused its discretion by failing to address Erickson\u2019s claim of unethical conduct in the form of witness tampering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303. Consequently, the court reversed the judgment of the district court, remanded the matter for a new trial, and instructed the trial court to impose appropriate sanctions upon the defense attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]here is a scarcity of case law on the issue of ex parte contact with expert witnesses, possibly because the violation seldom happens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. Nonetheless, citing American Bar Association Formal Ethics Opinion 93-378 (1993), and the Oregon State Bar Association\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Formal Opinion 1992-132 (1992), the court stated that \u201can attorney violates an ethical duty when the attorney has ex parte contact with the opposing party\u2019s expert witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that, \u201c[r]egardless of [the defense attorney\u2019s] motive, at a minimum, the offer of employment put [the plaintiffs expert] in the position of having divided loyalties. Quite simply, this court chooses to abide by the ageless wisdom that a person cannot serve two masters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">We agree with appellees that <em>Erickson </em>is distinguishable from this case. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In <em>Erickson, </em>the communications between the plaintiffs expert and the opposing counsel preceded the deposition of the plaintiffs expert. In contrast, Armstrong and Dr. Osborne had no contact until after Dr. Osborne had testified at the first trial in June 1999; due to the failure of appellants\u2019 lawyers to secure Dr. Osborne\u2019s presence at the third trial, that was the testimony that was introduced at the third trial. Clearly, that testimony was not tainted by Armstrong\u2019s representation of Dr. Osborne. Put another way, Dr. Osborne could not have been influenced in regard to his testimony, even subliminally, because his testimony was provided <em>prior to Amistrong\u2019s representation of him.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">To be sure, it is unfortunate that Dr. Osborne did not see fit to respond to the efforts of appellants\u2019 counsel to contact him, so as to advise appellants\u2019 lawyers of his scheduling difficulty. On the other hand, he never affirmatively represented that he would be present at the June trial, and therefore appellants did not rely on any such representation. In short, Dr. Osborne neither misled appellants\u2019 attorneys nor induced them not to issue a subpoena for his attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Moreover, although Armstrong knew that Dr. Osborne would be out of the country during the week of March 20, 2000, there was no evidence that Armstrong encouraged or directed Dr. Osborne to leave the country at the time of the third trial, or to'withhold such information from appellants. Further, although Armstrong was aware of Dr. Osborne\u2019s unavailability, there was no evidence that appellants lacked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>such knowledge, or that he was aware that Dr. Osborne was unavailable for the entire trial. While not dispositive, we also observe that in <em>Erickson </em>it was the attorney who solicited the opposition\u2019s expert, while here it was the expert\u2019s employer who solicited the opposing attorney in an unrelated case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">We recognize that Armstrong might have found himself in an uncomfortable position had Dr. Osborne been present at the third trial, and we do not commend his decision to leave it to Dr. Osborne to disclose to appellants that Armstrong had been retained to represent Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>case. Dr. Osborne, who is not an attorney, may not have appreciated the possible implications of the situation. Appellants\u2019 eleventh hour discovery of that representation injected an issue in the case that was completely avoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Nevertheless, even if it was improper for Armstrong to have represented Dr. Osborne during the pendency of the <em>Brown </em>case, and even if he should have disclosed to appellants his representation of Dr. Osborne in the <em>Singleton </em>matter, such conduct ultimately had no bearing on Dr. Osborne\u2019s failure to appear at trial. Put another way, any impropriety or conflict was not the proximate cause of appellants\u2019 fundamental problem. Rather, the problem resulted from the unavailability of Dr. Osborne, and it was a problem of appellants\u2019 own making. Given the attendant circumstances, we conclude that the trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motions for mistrial and new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Appellants complain that, during the third trial, appellees\u2019 expert witness, Lindsay Alger, M.D., improperly and unfairly offered new opinion testimony concerning gram negative rods and E. coli, without providing appellants with notice of these opinions. Therefore, they maintain that they were unable to prepare for them. Appellants also observe that, at the first trial in June 1999, when appellees alleged that Dr. Osborne offered an opinion that had not been disclosed, the court granted appellees\u2019 mistrial motion. In a \u201cgood for the goose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>good for the gander\u201d argument, appellants suggest they were entitled to the same relief when they sought a mistrial at the third trial. Appellants add that they were prejudiced by the absence of Dr. Osborne at the third trial, because it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for them \u201cto rebut any new testimony ...,\u201d that Dr. Osborne\u2019s prior testimony did not address. Consequently, appellants argue that the trial court erred in denying their motions for mistrial or new trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Appellees argue that, for several reasons, appellants have waived their objection to the admissibility of evidence regarding gram-negative rods and E.coli. First, they contend that Lewis Townsend, M.D., who was identified in appellees\u2019 \u201cPreliminary Identification of Expert Witness\u201d as a board certified obstetrician/gynecologist, testified prior to Dr. Alger and expressed the same opinion as Dr. Alger, without objection. In addition, appellees maintain that appellants pursued this issue by eliciting like evidence through their witness, Dr. Anthony Scialli. Appellees also assert that it was appellants who elicited the testimony on cross-examination. Further, appel-lees argue that \u201c[appellants\u2019 assertions on this issue were not preserved by raising them for the first time, in a motion for new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We agree with appellees that the issue of the propriety of Dr. Alger\u2019s testimony has not been properly preserved. Nor is the issue of surprise supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The record reflects that, on March 24, 2000, Dr. Townsend, a defense expert, expressed an opinion similar to Dr. Alger\u2019s, without objection from appellants\u2019 counsel. The following testimony is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Now, have you learned from your review of the records anything about the condition of the child at the time of the autopsy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>[DR. TOWNSEND]: Well, the condition of the child from the pathology report from Holy Cross demonstrated several things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">No. 1, there was \u2014 seemed to be an acute infection of the placenta, the cord, as well as the baby. There were some\u2014 within the embryo itself, there were signs of infection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">And looking forward in those records, it appeared that <em>the infection was caused by a gram-negative rod organism, </em>which is a particular organism that we find not uncommonly in the female genital tract and can cause infections in the uterus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: <em>And what is that common gram-negative rod organism?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">[DR. TOWNSEND]: <em>It could be an E. coli, </em>which comes from the bowel area and certainly is colonized in a lot of patients\u2019 vaginal-cervical areas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: That is all the questions I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Moreover, in reviewing Dr. Alger\u2019s testimony at the third trial, we are unable to find any place where appellants\u2019 counsel objected to the testimony regarding gram-negative rods and E. coli. The following testimony is illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Is there any way for you to determine where the infection of the placenta and the fetus came from or comes from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">[DR. ALGER]: Well, we know that the bacteria that they wrote in the \u2014 I think there was a culture that was done. I can\u2019t remember what it was, but 1 know there\u2019s a report that says enteric\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-14\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-15\">[DR. ALGER]: \u2014 gram-negative rods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: Yes....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-17\">[DR. ALGER]: <em>Let\u2019s see. Where is that coming from? There is </em>\u2014 the <em>placenta ivas cultured after the delivery, and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number><em>what it showed was many and a pure growth of gram-negative rods (enteric).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\"><em>And what that normally would mean is that this is E. coli. Escherichia coli is the </em>bacteria\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: <em>And where does E. coli come from?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">[DR. ALGER]: <em>And that comes from the gut, the intestines. And it\u2019s very common, because the vagina is close to the anal orifice, to have E. coli get inside the vagina. This is one of the most common pathogens.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\"><em>When you have somebody who has this kind of single organism grow out, usually it is E. coli, or it can be &amp;roup E strep. Group E strep doesn\u2019t look anything like </em>this\u2014 <em>little cocci.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">\n<em>And the fact that it says \u201centeric\u201d means that it\u2019s coming from the gut. And when you have bacterial vaginosis, for example, Gardnerella is not an enteric organism.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">\n<em>So, that wasn\u2019t what they were finding in the placenta. What they were finding was E. coli. And that\u2019s been associated many times with preterm birth.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">On recross, the following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Okay. [At your deposition,] I had asked you what was the cause of infection, and you said you didn\u2019t even know the cause of infection. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-13\">[DR. ALGER]: Yeah. <em>I don\u2019t know why the E. coli got up there.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-14\">* Hi \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-15\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: <em>So, when did you find out that it was E. coli?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-16\">[DR. ALGER]: <em>We\u2019re talking about two different things. I\u2019m not saying E. coli caused this preterm labor. I\u2019m saying that what was cultured from the placenta is an </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>enteric gram-negative rod </em>\u2014 greater <em>than 50-percent probability that that would be E. </em>coli....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In addition, Anthony Scialli, M.D., a board certified obstetri-eian/gyneeologist, testified as an expert for appellants on March 27, 2000, three days after Dr. Alger. He, too, gave testimony as to a bacterial infection, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Doctor, when you reviewed the pathology report that was done sometime after May 13, 1994, did you make a determination as to the cause of the infection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">[DR. SCIALLI]: I saw there was evidence of infection in the placenta, in the membranes, in the baby; but as to the organism causing the infection, I can\u2019t tell you what that is, except to say <em>that it appears to be a gram-negative rod.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Now, Doctor, did you render an opinion in this case previously with regard to the cause of infection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">[DR. SCIALLI]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-10\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: What was that opinion, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-11\">[DR. SCIALLI]: There was testimony in which I said that the infection was caused by an organism called lyseria [phj.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXM\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Doctor, what was the basis for that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">[DR. SCIALLI]: I read a pathology report that, as I read it, said that there was lyseria [ph].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-13\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And. can you read that report for the members of the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-14\">[DR. SCIALLI]: I don\u2019t think you want me to read every word, but the pertinent parts are: <em>many and pure growsth of gram-negative rod, </em>enteric, sensitivity upon request....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: <em>Now, prior to today, have you ever rendered an opinion as to E. coli being the cause of infection in this case?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">[DR. SCIALLI]: <em>Not that I recall.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: In fact, you reviewed that report very well the last time, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">[DR. SCIALLI]: Yes.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: <em>And you had no opinion that E. coli was the cause of the infection, comet?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">[DR. SCIALLI]: <em>That\u2019s comet.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">Ordinarily, if an argument is not raised below, it is not preserved for appellate review. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule' 8-131(a). The Court of Appeals \u201chas stated that the \u2018primary purpose of Rule 8-131(a) is \u201c \u2018to ensure fairness for all patties in a case and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>Davis v. DiPino, </em>337 Md. 642, 647, 655 A.2d 401 (1995) (citations omitted). \u201cProviding fairness to the parties may be accomplished by \u2018requiring] counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Clayman v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>266 Md. 409, 416, 292 A.2d 689 (1972) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Although appellants raised the issue in their motion for new trial, they did not object to Dr. Alger\u2019s testimony at trial. A party who does not raise an issue at trial, and later pursues the point in a post-trial motion, is precluded from raising the substantive issue on appeal. <em>See Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 549, 578-79, 694 A.2d 150 (1997)(stat-ing that although \u201ca trial court may grant a new trial on the basis of an issue that could have been, but was not, raised at trial,\u201d when \u201cthe trial court denies such a motion, ... the movant is precluded from raising those substantive issues on appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Buck v. Cam\u2019s Broadloom Rugs, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number><em>supra, </em>328 Md. at 61, 612 A.2d 1294- In addition, appellees examined other experts on the same issue, without objection. Consequently, we are satisfied that the propriety of Dr. Alger\u2019s testimony is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Appellants\u2019 third issue is integrally related to their first issue. They contend that the trial court erred in ordering the use of the transcript of Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony from the first trial in June 1999, in lieu of delaying the trial in order to obtain his live testimony. They note that Dr. Osborne\u2019s testimony at the first trial pertained only to liability, because the case was initially bifurcated for trial. Thus, they complain that Dr. Osborne never had an opportunity to render an opinion as to the Browns\u2019 \u201cmental anguish,\u201d suffered as a result of the loss of their baby. In their view, \u201cthe trial Court denied the Appellants an opportunity to present that opinion to the jurors which prejudiced the Plaintiffs [sic] case at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">In the half page that appellants devote to this issue, they fail to direct our attention to any legal authority in support of their contention. As we see it, the claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">In the first place, the court never <em>ordered </em>appellants to use the testimony of Dr. Osborne from the first trial. Rather, in the exercise of its discretion, the court denied a request for postponement. Based on the facts that we previously set forth, we are readily satisfied that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the postponement request. <em>See Green v. Director\", Patuxent Institution, </em>3 Md.App. 1, 4, 237 A.2d 463 (1968). As a consequence of the denial, the court gave appellants the option of either using Dr. Osborne\u2019s earlier trial testimony or proceeding without any evidence from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">To be sure, on March 22, 2000, when the court first considered the use of Dr. Osborne\u2019s prior testimony, appellants\u2019 counsel expressed concern about the limited scope of that prior testimony. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Again, Your Honor, [the first trial] was a bifurcated trial, and there were a lot of rulings with regards to inquiries in the area of damages, and I am not sure if we can actually be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">[THE COURT]: Dr. Osborne was a liability witness; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_S\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: He was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">[THE COURT]: Not a damage witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: With respect to \u2014 there is an area with respect to mental anguish which has to be with them being trained as OB/GYN physicians to recognize when a patient has suffered mental anguish from these kind of losses and referring that patient to a psychiatrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">So there is that area which we had attempted to have Dr. Osborne testify as an expert in that area, which counsel objected to and in which counsel had previously acknowledged that the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology even trains these doctors to be able to evaluate these patients for this kind of condition so that there is an issue with that, and that was an area I wasn\u2019t able to bring up with Dr. Osborne at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">THE COURT: What do you [appellees\u2019 counsel] have to say about his argument that there were certain objections sustained in the earlier trial because it was bifurcated that would be admissible if it were not a bifurcated trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: That he was presented as a liability only witness. There has been no expert identification or supplemental answer to interrogatory or informal letter that has ever notified me that he is going to be testifying as to psychiatric damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">They have two psychiatrists to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">THE COURT: I think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I did notify him, and it is in the records that I did provide a supplemental pre-trial statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>It is in the records in which I indicated that Dr. Osborne was an expert, was qualified to render opinions with respect to patients who have suffered this kind of loss, and they have suffered some kind of mental anguish for them to be referred to a psychiatrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\">It is in the pre-trial, and I did give a copy to \u2014 I did send you a copy. This was a month ago, about a month or two ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL]: I mean, I can debate whether that is present or not. Let\u2019s assume it is. He has two psychiatrists on tap to testify to that very issue tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApH\">Ultimately, appellants elected to use the earlier testimony. Accordingly, the trial court carefully explained to the jury the use of prior testimony, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">Now, at this time we are ready to continue, and I should explain to you the procedure about to be employed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">You have already learned through the course of this trial that our Rules provide for the taking of depositions before trial. In addition to that-and you have learned that these depositions may be taken at various places.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">They are simply swearing in a witness the same as a witness is sworn in here, with the presence of counsel for both sides, and questioning, cross-examination, direct, redirect, exactly as it would occur in a courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">And sometimes these depositions are used. Now, occasionally they are used \u2014 and you have seen them used primarily for purposes of asking a witness if in fact the witness did not say something on a previous occasion and refreshing their recollection or impeaching the witness\u2019s current testimony with prior testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">That is certainly a legitimate use of depositions. Both sides have utilized depositions for this purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-11\">Sometimes depositions are used in lieu of the attendance of a witness and simply are read into evidence. Occasionally they are done even by videotape sometimes, and we play the videotape. So, there are a number of ways they are done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Any testimony that qualifies, that is has been taken under oath and when both sides have an opportunity to be present and ask questions \u2014 qualifies for use at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">And that is what we are going to do now. In lieu of calling as a witness in person, Dr. Newton Osborne, we are going to have read to you the testimony of Dr. Osborne, which will include the direct testimony and cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We perceive no merit to appellants\u2019 claim that they were prejudiced because, in using Dr. Osborne\u2019s earlier testimony, they were denied the opportunity to present testimony from Dr. Osborne concerning mental anguish. As appellees point out, such testimony would have been cumulative, because appellants \u201chad the benefit of expert testimony on mental pain and anguish\u201d from two other witnesses. Moreover, given the jury\u2019s verdict, it never reached the issue of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Furthermore, it is well settled that the \u201cadmissibility of expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its action will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u201d <em>Pepper v. Johns Hopkins Hosp., </em>Ill Md.App. 49, 76, 680 A.2d 532 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 679, 697 A.2d 1358 (1997); <em>see also Buxton v.

Alessi, supra, </em>80 Md.App. 124, 560 A.2d 59, is instructive. There, a patient brought suit against her physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>cian to recover for alleged negligence and failure to diagnose cancer at the base of the patient\u2019s tongue. At trial, the patient presented three expert witnesses who testified that the doctor breached the applicable standard of care by failing to conduct an extensive examination of the patient\u2019s mouth. In addition, the patient asked the court to permit the jury to hear the transcript of the testimony of another physician, from an earlier arbitration hearing, arguing: \u201cHis opinions were the same as the other experts who testified for [the patient] at trial regarding the applicable standard of care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 560 A.2d 59. After the doctor objected, the trial court excluded the transcript. On appeal, we affirmed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">Even if we had determined that the trial court erred in excluding [the other doctor\u2019s] transcript, the error was not prejudicial. As noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Harris v. Harris, </em>310 Md. 310, 319, 529 A.2d 356 (1987), \u201cto justify reversal two things are essential. There must be error and there must be injury; and unless it is perceived that the error causes the injury there can be no reversal merely because there is error.\u201d (quoting <em>Joseph Bros. Co. v. Schonthal, </em>99 Md. 382, 400, 58 A. 205 (1904)). The burden of demonstrating both error and prejudice is on the complaining party. <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 330, 368 A.2d 1005 (1977). <em>Here, the substance of [the other doctor\u2019s] testimony had been echoed by three other expert witnesses, each of whom testified that he was familiar with the standard of care for a general or family practitioner. Thus, [that] testimony would have been merely cumulative evidence presented to the jury. The exclusion of his testimony, therefore, would not be grounds for reversal. See Hutchison v. Balto. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>241 Md. 329, 333-34, 216 A.2d 573 (1966); <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Kuenne, </em>240 Md. 232, 235, 213 A.2d 567 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Here, Dr. and Mrs. Brown presented the testimony of two experts, both of whom testified as to the psychiatric injuries they sustained as a result of the tragic death of their baby. Any further testimony as to their mental anguish would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>been cumulative. Therefore, any error did not prejudice appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellants argue that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury regarding the law of wrongful death, and therefore erred in denying the motion for new trial. They assert that the trial court \u201comitted the fact that if Baby Brown had been born alive, a wrongful death claim may have been maintained.\u201d Moreover, they suggest that Dr. Donald Levitt intentionally decapitated the baby during birth, so that the baby would not be born alive, in order to avoid a wrongful death suit. They assert: \u201c[H]ad the Trial Court instructed the Jury that Appellants would have had a wrongful death claim if Baby Brown was born alive, the jurors may have made a reasonable inference that Dr. [Donald] Levitt decapitated Baby Brown to avoid a wrongful death lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The trial court instructed the jury, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">And obviously, as you know, and as the evidence is clear, at the time that this child was delivered, at the time that this spontaneous abortion occurred, there was \u2014 the child was not viable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">And by \u201cviable,\u201d the Maryland law means this: That if the child is \u2014 is the child capable of survival outside the womb, and the answer for a child of this age of gestation is \u201cno.\u201d That\u2019s a matter of law. This child was not viable, could not have lived, and therefore the parents of the child delivering at this age have no claim for what we call \u201cwrongful death\u201d or a \u201csurvival action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">Wrongful death or a survival action allows in some cases a parent, for example, to claim [solatium] damages, damages for the loss of companionship and counseling and company of the child, during the child\u2019s entire minority when the child would be growing up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">That is not a claim that can be made or is being made in this case. You would not consider damages for such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>At the hearing on appellants\u2019 new trial motion, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">Similarly, with respect to the failure to give an instruction that if the baby had been born alive, a wrongful death case could have been maintained even though the infant was nonviable, we did not take the time to research the underlying legal legitimacy of that because I was persuaded at the time and continue to be persuaded that there was no justification in the evidence for the giving of such an instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">I think I understood and believe I still understand the point that counsel is trying to make. I thought then and think now that the potential for jury obfuscation was far greater than any possibility of relevance, and indeed <em>there just was no testimony to support the rather extraordinary theory that plaintiffs wanted to inject in this case, that the doctor somehow caused the death of this infant during delivery intentionally in order to avoid a wrongful death claim, knowing that it was a non-viable infant and therefore causing death to avoid such a claim.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>That is rather bizarre. There ivas nothing in the evidence to support it.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">On April 14, 1999, the court granted summary judgment on the wrongful death claim. At the trial in March 2000, no evidence was presented to establish that Dr. Donald Levitt acted intentionally in decapitating the baby. Therefore, we agree with appellees that \u201cthe Trial Court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct the jury on [wrongful death].\u201d Additionally, as appellees argue, \u201cthere can be no error in the Trial Court\u2019s instructions regarding wrongful death because the jury did not reach the issue of damages in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Maryland Code (1974, 1998 Rep. Vol.), \u00a7 3-902(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d) provides: \u201cAn action may be maintained against a person whose wrongful act causes the death of another.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-904(a) provides: \u201cAn action under this subtitle shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent, and child of the deceased person.\u201d But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>in <em>Kandel v. White, </em>339 Md. 432, 436, 663 A.2d 1264 (1995), the Court held that a cause of action for wrongful death may not be maintained on behalf of a nonviable fetus that is stillborn. <em>See also Group Health Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>295 Md. 104, 119, 453 A.2d 1198 (1983) (recognizing that \u201ca cause of action lies for the wrongful death of a child born <em>alive </em>who dies as a result of injuries sustained while <em>en ventre sa mere.\u201d) </em>(Emphasis added). Consequently, under Maryland law, a wrongful death claim lies only if the fetus is viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In this case, there was no evidence that the fetus was viable at birth. In Dr. Osborne\u2019s deposition of December 22, 1998, which was an exhibit to appellants\u2019 opposition to summary judgment, he said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: As a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, do you have an opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, as to whether or not a 20 to 21-week fetus would be viable if delivered at that gestation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Yes, I have an opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: What\u2019s that opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">[DR. OSBORNE]: From what I know and from what I have seen ... I don\u2019t think ... that it would be viable at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Furthermore, appellants\u2019 theory that Dr. Donald Levitt intentionally decapitated the baby to avoid a wrongful death suit was little more than total surmise, unsupported by any evidence in the record. Again, deposition testimony of Dr. Osborne is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now, you also were asked to look at the case and determine whether or not you had an opinion with regard to Dr. Levitt\u2019s role in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you find that Dr. Levitt intentionally killed this baby?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-13\">[DR. OSBORNE]: I couldn\u2019t find \u2014 when you say intentionally killed the baby, you mean when decapitation occurred if he did that intentionally with aforethought and so forth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Whether he intentionally aborted the baby, whether he was responsible for performing a partial birth abortion of the baby?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\">[DR. OSBORNE]: Yes, from my review of the records I couldn\u2019t come up with that conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">In addition, Dr. Donald Levitt testified at the third trial, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Now, Doctor, let us assume that this baby was dead, for the sake of this question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9i\">[DR. LEVITT]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: [W]hat was the complication that stopped you from delivering the baby without the head being attached from the body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">[DR. LEVITT]: All right. Well, I think I have to go through the entire delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Okay. Explain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">[DR. LEVITT]: Okay. There were two feet, classical breech, as you straightened out the legs, which is easy to do. They were right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">You rotate the baby because the baby, as a breech, must be delivered head down. The diameter \u2014 this diameter \u2014 is much too big for delivery, you want this diameter even on a small one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">Because the lower uterine segment is a muscle, and that dilates as far as it has to dilate. It doesn\u2019t dilate on its own, it dilates because there\u2019s a presenting part that\u2019s pushing it aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">So I turned it over. You use a towel on the buttocks and you gradually pull down and then you shift to the left, right arm, left arm, and now I have the baby in the palm of my hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">The baby was 10 inches from crown to toe. According to the pathologist, the head was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-15\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: I\u2019m talking about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-16\">[DR. LEVITT]: \u2014 two inches\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>[DR. LEVITT]: And then the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: (Inaudible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">[DR. LEVITT]: \u2014 neck, which I could see, was no thicker than a ballpoint pen. Completely loose and flaccid, not [sic] heartbeat in my palm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">I did a classical breech. I pushed the head down to try and engage this \u2014 this is called the occiput, and if you can engage it, then you put your finger in the cervix just to give it as much room. Pick it up and remove the head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">Well, when I did the downward pressure, minuscule stalk, limp fetus, it simply separated....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Dr. Alger also testified at trial as to the potential for harm to the' fetus, given the circumstances of this cas\u00e9. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">This is a terrible situation to be in, for the patient, the husband, and for the obstetrician. Nothing good is going to come of this whole situation, no matter what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">First of all, you are guaranteed, no matter how the baby is delivered, that the baby is going to die. There is a 100-percent mortality rate in a delivery at this gestation. So that\u2019s inevitable. So it\u2019s bad to begin with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">Now what we have is we have a woman who has delivered the body of a fetus that \u2014 a baby that she wanted very much, and this is hanging out between her legs. And what do you do at this situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">When you decide to try to deliver the baby, you\u2019re not doing it with the idea that you\u2019re purposely going to try to separate the baby\u2019s head from the torso.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">You\u2019re trying to expedite the delivery, because here are your alternatives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">(1) In most situations, the baby is already dead at this time. Because the baby is so small, as it comes down the vagina, by the time it\u2019s coming of the introitus....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">The opening of the vagina \u2014 the opening of the vagina coming out \u2014 the umbilical cord has already been compressed against that body of the baby, because it\u2019s already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>down in the vagina, the length of the baby being such that it\u2019s getting compressed by the vaginal walls and it\u2019s cutting off the blood supply to the baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">So, usually, these babies are bom either stillborn or moribund with just a heartbeat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">So, you have \u2014 one possibility is the baby is already dead, and she has a dead fetus hanging between her legs. And I think that\u2019s a very stressful situation to be lying there knowing that this fetus is hanging out of there and that\u2019s your baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">So that I, as an obstetrician, am going to attempt to expedite that delivery and not leave you hanging there, you know, in this situation that\u2019s very stressful, if I can go ahead and deliver this baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The other alternative is that maybe the baby is still live-born. And so, then I have the alternative of this baby that is potentially live there, but is slowing [sic] dying right between the mother\u2019s legs before her \u2014 if she could feel it move or anything and then it just stops and it\u2019s just lying there, that, to me, would be incredibly stressful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">So my natural instinct to try to help my patient is to try to expedite that delivery, so that she doesn\u2019t have to go through that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">And in most cases, I will be able to accomplish that delivery without any injury to the fetus and be able to wrap the fetus in a towel, take it away, present it to her later on when she can cope with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\"><em>Occasionally </em>\u2014 it\u2019s <em>not common </em>\u2014 because <em>the fetus is so fragile at that gestational age, without even using much force at all, this can occur. The head can separate from the torso.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">\n<em>And this is not the fist time that any obstetrician who deals with this mil have heard of this. It does happen.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-12\">\n<em>But that\u2019s not your intent when you\u2019re doing this, and it can happen using judicious force.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\n<em>It\u2019s just the nature of delivery that has this as a possible outcome.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">It is well settled that a \u201cparty is entitled to have his or her theory of the case presented to the jury, <em>provided that the theory is legally and factually supported.\u201d Shapiro v. Massengill, </em>105 Md.App. 743, 761, 661 A.2d 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 28, 668 A.2d 36 (1995) (emphasis added). Thus, \u201ca trial court must properly instruct the jury on a point of law that is supported by some evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Green v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 547, 562, 705 A.2d 133 (1998). \u201cIn reviewing the propriety of a tidal court\u2019s denial of a requested jury instruction, we must examine \u2018whether the requested instruction was a correct exposition of the law, <em>whether that law was applicable in light of the evidence before the jury, </em>and finally whether the substance of the requested instruction was fairly covered by the instruction actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 47, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Wegad v. Howard St. Jewelers, </em>326 Md. 409, 414, 605 A.2d 123 (1992)); <em>see Molock v.
