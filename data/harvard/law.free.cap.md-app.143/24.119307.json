Appellant alleged that Donegal breached its contract of insurance by failing to satisfy Wholesale with respect to a loss it had sustained in August 1997. Pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>appellee\u2019s request for a jury trial, the case was transferred to the circuit court in October 1997. Within a month, appellant\u2019s lawyer withdrew from the case. Then, in January 2001, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion to strike and dismissed the suit, with prejudice, because appellant did not file its amended complaint in the time prescribed by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">On appeal, Wholesale presents two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">I. Did the circuit court err as a matter of law in granting Appellee\u2019s Motion to Sti'ike Complaint by default thereby striking Appellant\u2019s Complaint and dismissing its case with prejudice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">II. Did the circuit court abused [sic] its discretion in granting Appellee\u2019s Motion to Strike Complaint by default thereby striking Appellant\u2019s Complaint and dismissing its case with prejudice?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Among other things, appellee asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">Should the Appeal be dismissed because the owner of the corporation filed the Notice of Appeal on behalf of the Appellant corporation, making such filing a nullity?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">On July 18, 2000, Wholesale, through counsel, instituted suit in the District Court against Donegal for breach of an insurance contract. Wholesale sought to recover $25,000 in damages, claiming that Donegal failed to pay monies due and owing under an insurance policy issued to Wholesale, in regard to a loss that appellant incurred in August 1997. On or about September 27, 2000, Donegal prayed a jury trial. Accordingly, the case was transferred to the circuit court on October 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-15\">By letter dated October 5, 2000, appellant\u2019s counsel, Paul Bennett, sent a letter to Adebisi Anthony A\u2019Denariwo, Wholesale\u2019s sole owner, advising of his intent to withdraw as counsel for Wholesale. The letter said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>[PJlease be advised that I will file my withdrawal as your attorney with the court in the above referenced matter in five days. My office has been advised that [Donegal] has requested a jury trial, and the case will be transferred to the Circuit Court.' <em>You have the option of having another attorney enter an appearance in. the case or of notifying the court clerk in writing of your intention to proceed and represent yourself.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">On October 16, 2000, Bennett filed a motion to withdraw his appearance, and attached as an exhibit his letter to A\u2019Denari-wo of October 5, 2000. The motion was granted by order dated November 6, 2000. On November 8, 2000, when the order was docketed, the court sent notice to Wholesale, stating, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">It appears from the record in the ... case that you are not ... represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">You are hereby notified this day, that your failure to have new counsel enter his appearance in this case within fifteen (15) days after service upon you of this notice shall not be grounds for postponing any further proceedings, concerning the case. You are warned that without counsel to protect your interests in the case, you risk a nonsuit or judgment by default and all court costs being ordered against you by the court....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In the meantime, on November 6, 2000, appellee filed a Motion for More Definite Statement, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(d), asserting that appellant\u2019s District Court complaint was \u201cso general, vague and ambiguous that movant cannot reasonably frame an answer.\u201d Appellee sought such information as appellant\u2019s policy number, date of loss, nature of the claim, and the reason that the claim was denied. By Order dated November 29, 2000, docketed on November 30, 2000, the court granted appellee\u2019s motion, and ordered appellant to file an amended complaint within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">On January 2, 2001, when appellant had not yet filed its amended complaint, appellee filed a \u201cMotion to Strike Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>plaint,\u201d requesting dismissal of the case, with prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Al-though the motion was filed on that date with the court, the certificate of service indicates that appellee chose to serve the motion on appellant by mailing it on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">On January 23, 2001, A\u2019Denariwo, as \u201cowner\u201d of Wholesale and its \u201conly principal officer,\u201d filed a response to the motion to strike, titled \u201cPlaintiff First Wholesale Cleaners, Inc[.] Response Motion Not to Grant the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike With Prejudice.\u201d According to the certificate of service, the opposition to the motion to strike had already been mailed to appellee\u2019s attorney on January 8, 2001. A\u2019Denariwo included a sworn affidavit in which he averred that he had not received a copy of the court\u2019s order requiring Wholesale to file an amended complaint. Furthermore, he stated that he was the only person with sufficient personal knowledge to respond for Wholesale, and he had been away on vacation from November 22, 2000 to January 3, 2001 \u2014 his first vacation in nine years. Additionally, he asserted that he was \u201cmaking progress for arrangement for a new counsel,\u201d but told the court that, \u201cbecause of statue [sic] of limitation, if this honorable court favorably grant the defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike we would not be able to refile this case.... \u201d On behalf of Wholesale, A\u2019Denariwo also filed a \u201cResponse To Order,\u201d in answer to the Motion For More Definite Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The next day, January 24, 2001, the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion to strike and dismissed appellant\u2019s suit, with prejudice. In doing so, the court signed appellee\u2019s proposed order, but added that the motion was granted \u201cby default.\u201d Because the court did not mention the opposition to the motion to strike, filed the day before, we cannot determine with certainty whether the judge was aware of the opposition when he ruled on the motion to strike. In view of the \u201cby default\u201d language added by the judge, however, it is reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>able to assume that the judge had no knowledge of the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">After the suit was dismissed, A\u2019Denariwo filed a notice of appeal on behalf of Wholesale. The notice of appeal states in its entirety: \u201cFIRST WHOLESALE CLEANERS, Inc[.], notices an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in the above-captioned action.\u201d Wholesale subsequently retained a lawyer to prepare its appellate brief and to present oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Preliminarily, appellee urges the Court to dismiss the appeal as a nullity, because Wholesale, the appellant, is a corporation, A\u2019Denariwo is not a lawyer, and therefore A\u2019Denariwo was not allowed to file the appeal on behalf of Wholesale. We decline appellee\u2019s invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Maryland Rule 2-131 requires that, ordinarily, a lawyer must represent a corporation in court. It states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Rule 2-131. Appearance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">(a) Except as otherwise provided by rule or statute:(l) an individual may enter an appearance by an attorney or in . proper person and (2) a person other than an individual may enter an appearance only by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-15\">A corporation is considered a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of the rule. <em>See </em>Rule l-202(r)(stating that \u201cPerson\u201d includes, <em>inter alia, </em>a corporation).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-16\">Other rules and statutory provisions are also relevant. Maryland Rule l-311(a) states that \u201c[ejvery pleading and paper of a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney who has been admitted to practice in this State....\u201d Under Rule 1 \u2014 311(c), \u201cif a pleading or paper is not signed as required ... or is signed with intent to defeat the purpose of this Rule, it may be stricken and the action may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>proceed as though the pleading had not been filed.\u201d Similarly, Md. Rule 8-402(d) pertaining to the appellate courts, states: \u201cA corporation may enter an appearance only by an attorney, except as otherwise provided by rule or statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">Sections 10-206 and 10-601 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article (\u201cB.O.P.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (2000) are also relevant. B.O.P. \u00a7 10-206(a) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2R\">\u00a7 10-206. Admission required; exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">(a) <em>Admission required. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided by law, before an individual may practice law in the State, the individual shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">(1) be admitted to the Bar; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">(2) meet any requirement that the Court of Appeals may set by rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">B.O.P. \u00a7 10-206(b) enumerates certain exceptions to the requirement that a corporation must be represented in court by an attorney. In part, \u00a7 10 \u2014 206(b)(4)(i)(1) permits a corporate officer to appear on behalf of the corporation in a civil action in District Court, so long as the claim does not exceed the amount set forth for a small claim action under Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 4-405 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d). That sum is $2500.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">B.O.P. \u00a7 10-601(a) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u00a7 10-601. Practicing without admission to Bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except as otherwise provided by law, a person may not practice, attempt to practice, or offer to practice law in the State unless admitted to the Bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-12\"><em>Turkey Point Property Owners\u2019 Association, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>106 Md.App. 710, 715, 666 A.2d 904 (1995), is also instructive. There, the Court recognized that \u201c[t]he requirement of Rule 2-131(a)(2) that corporations be represented in the circuit court by attorneys reflects a long history of legislation prohibiting lay persons from practicing law except in those situations in which they are acting <em>pro se. \u201d </em>Moreover, we acknowledged that \u201c \u2018[t]he goal of the prohibition against unauthorized practice is to protect the public from being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>preyed upon by those not competent to practice law \u2014 from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 666 A.2d 904 (quoting <em>In re Application of R.G.S., </em>312 Md. 626, 638, 541 A.2d 977 (1988)). Accordingly, the Court dismissed an appeal in which a lay person purported to represent a corporation in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">The appellant, Turkey Point Property Owners\u2019 Association, Inc. (\u201cthe Association\u201d), a corporation, had petitioned the circuit court for review of a decision by a local zoning board. Although the Association had been represented by counsel in the administrative proceedings, the petition for judicial review was signed by the Association\u2019s president, who was not an attorney. The Association\u2019s president also submitted a legal memorandum, and then appeared in court on behalf of the Association. The appellees objected, arguing that because the Association was not represented by an attorney, the petition for review was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Although the Association\u2019s president did not use coercion or trickery to persuade the Association to accept her services as to representation, and the trial court had expressly allowed the president to proceed, we nonetheless concluded that \u201cthe prohibition against the practice of law by nonlawyers applie[d] to this situation.\u201d <em>Turkey Point, </em>106 Md.App. at 717, 666 A.2d 904. The Court explained, at 106 Md.App. at 715, 666 A.2d 904: \u201cThere is no dispute that, by filing the petition for judicial review, <em>then representing the Association in the trial court, </em>[the president] engaged in the practice of law.\u201d (Emphasis added). In its analysis, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Although Rule 2-131 (a) (2) requires that a corporation such as the Association be represented by an attorney in the circuit court, it sets forth no sanction for noncompliance. Rule 2-201,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> however, provides, that \u2018if no consequences are prescribed, the court may compel compliance with the rule or may determine the consequences of the noncompliance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>light of the totality of the circumstances.\u2019 As a general rule in other jurisdictions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201c[proceedings in a suit by a person not entitled to practice are a nullity, and if appropriate steps are timely taken the suit may be dismissed.... If the case has proceeded to judgment, the judgment is void and will be reversed. Furthermore, the acts or steps of the unauthorized practitioner will be disregarded, and the papers and documents drafted should be stricken.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\"><em>Id. </em>at 718, 666 A.2d 904 (quoting 7 C.J.S. Attorney &amp; Client \u00a7 31 at 869 (1980))(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Accordingly, we determined that the trial court \u201cerred by accepting the petition for judicial review that [the president] prepared and signed, and by permitting her to represent the Association at the hearing on the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 719, 666 A.2d 904. Moreover, because the petition and the proceedings before the trial court were deemed \u201ca nullity,\u201d the Court vacated the judgment and dismissed the case. <em>Turkey Point, </em>106 Md.App. at 720, 666 A.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\"><em>Turkey Point </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case, however. Here, Wholesale properly acted through counsel when it initially filed suit. Then, when the case was transferred to circuit court upon appellee\u2019s request, Wholesale\u2019s attorney, Bennett, withdrew from the case. In doing so, Bennett wrote to A\u2019Denariwo, the corporate owner, and incorrectly advised A\u2019Denariwo that he had the option of representing himself. As A\u2019Denariwo was not himself a party, but was the sole owner of the corporation, the party plaintiff, A\u2019Denar-iwo may have been led to believe by Wholesale\u2019s attorney that he could act on Wholesale\u2019s behalf. In any event, A\u2019Denariwo claimed below that he was attempting to arrange for another attorney, but had been on vacation for a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Moreover, when A\u2019Denariwo filed the notice of appeal on behalf of Wholesale, it was evidently a protective course of action, meant to preserve the corporation\u2019s right to appeal, which had to be filed within thirty days from the entry of judgment. See Maryland Rule 8-202(a). Its content was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>skeletal, without any legal substance, quite unlike the memorandum submitted in <em>Turkey Point. </em>Indeed, the filing itself was tantamount to a \u201cministerial act.... \u201d <em>County Council of Prince George\u2019s County v. Dutcher, </em>365 Md. 399, 416, 780 A.2d 1137 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">It is also noteworthy that, after filing the notice of appeal, Wholesale obtained legal counsel for purposes of pursuing the appeal; A\u2019Denariwo neither prepared the brief nor sought to argue the appeal. In stark contrast, <em>Turkey Point </em>involved the submission of a substantive legal memorandum by a lay person, and an actual attempt by that person to represent the corporation in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">As the <em>Turkey Point </em>Court observed, Rule 2-131(a) does not mandate any particular sanction. Therefore, even if the filing of the notice of appeal by A\u2019Denariwo constituted the unauthorized practice of law, dismissal of the appeal is not compelled by the rule. Moreover, <em>Ginn v. Farley, </em>43 Md.App. 229, 403 A.2d 858 (1979), suggests that an appellate court has some discretion when confronted with a case such as this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In <em>Ginn, </em>a nonlawyer represented herself and other persons in a zoning case, although she was not personally an aggrieved individual under zoning law. After the proceedings in the circuit court, she noted an appeal to this Court and prepared both the brief and record extract. Chief Judge Gilbert wrote for the Court that \u201c \u2018what constitutes the practice of law is vested solely in the judicial branch of government....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 232, 403 A.2d 858 (citation omitted). He added that the judiciary alone has \u201c \u2018[t]he power to regulate and define what constitutes the practice of law....\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Court dismissed the appeal of the nonlawyer, concluding that the conduct constituted the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Id. </em>at 233, 403 A.2d 858. But, it declined to dismiss the appeals of the other individuals. Instead, one person argued for himself, and the Court treated the others as having submitted on brief. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">It might be argued that we should dismiss the appeal as to all appellants because the brief was written in their behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>by Ms. Ginn. We know of no rule or procedure that requires such action, nor shall we impose it....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><em>Id, </em>at 238 n. 8, 403 A.2d 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Other jurisdictions have recognized that there is discretion in regard to the issue of dismissal of a non-lawyer\u2019s pleadings on behalf of a corporation. For example, in <em>BQP Industries, Inc. v. State, </em>694 P.2d 337 (Colo.App.1984), <em>aff'd., </em>770 P.2d 1189 (Colo.1989), ten corporate taxpayers appealed judgments of the trial court entered against them in connection with judicial review of an agency action. Each corporation initiated administrative review by submission of the prescribed form through an officer or director, as agent. But, each corporation subsequently pursued its appeal through an attorney. Nevertheless, the trial court dismissed the appeals on the ground that the applications were void because they had been signed by nonlawyer officers or directors of the corporations. <em>See id. </em>at 341. The appellate court disagreed. Relying, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Ginn v. Farley, </em>it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">We agree that a corporation can only appear in court by a licensed attorney and that proceedings instituted in violation of this rule are void. A corporation is an artificial entity created by law. Thus, unlike a natural person, it cannot appear or act in a judicial proceeding in person, but rather must act in legal matters through a licensed attorney. And, while the BAA is an administrative agency, it acts in a quasi-judicial capacity when it resolves disputes of adjudicative facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">The question whether the preparation and filing of [the form] constitutes the practice of law depends upon the totality of the circumstances and the character of the act. The completion of this form does not require any knowledge and skill beyond that possessed by an ordinary, intelligent taxpayer. Thus, its preparation and filing is sufficiently informal to permit completion by a corporation through its officer or director.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-9\">Under the circumstances at issue, we know of no rule of law or procedure that requires or justifies dismissal of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>corporate taxpayers\u2019 administrative petitions for review. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 341^42 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Similarly, in <em>Szteinbaum v. Kaes Inversiones y Valores, C.A., </em>476 So.2d 247 (Fla.App.1985), the court considered \u201cwhether a complaint filed by a non-attorney on behalf of a corporation may be amended to cure this deficiency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court initially dismissed the complaint, without prejudice, because the corporate plaintiff was not represented by a lawyer. Although an amended complaint was filed by an attorney, the defendant moved again to dismiss, arguing that the first complaint was a nullity. When that motion was denied, the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">On appeal, the court said that \u201cthere can be little doubt that the act of filing a complaint constitutes the practice of law....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Nevertheless, it recognized that \u201c[cjourts have reflexively applied\u201d the rules barring the unauthorized practice of law. <em>Id. </em>It noted, too, that the record did not reflect that the corporation had \u201cproceeded with knowledge of the impropriety of its actions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 251, or that the defendant had actually been prejudiced by what occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 252. The court concluded that the corporation\u2019s initial failure to act through counsel was cured when the amended complaint was filed by an attorney. <em>Szteinbaum, </em>476 So.2d at 250.</p>\n<p id=\"Anu\">In reaching that result, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">[Pjublie policy dictates that, whenever possible, cases \u2018should be determined on their merits, instead of upon irrelevant technicalities.\u2019 Thus, dismissal of the amended complaint in the present case in derogation of this \u2018welcome policy\u2019 is warranted only if it can be said that treating the defect of the initial complaint as incurable will somehow substantially advance some other more compelling public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">To be sure, the \u2018protection of the public from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation\u2019 through the prevention of the unauthorized practice of law is a compel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ling public policy. We suggest, however, that this latter policy is not served by a rule of law that declares that a complaint filed by a non-attorney on behalf of a corporation cannot be cured by the later appearance of counsel to represent the corporation and, moreover, that such a rule of law disserves the policy that cases should be decided on their merits. Where, as here, the representation of the plaintiff corporation, confined as it was to the filing of the complaint, was brief, minimal and essentially innocuous, the unauthorized practice of law was adequately curtailed by the trial judge\u2019s eminently sensible decision to allow an attorney to appear for the corporation and thereby amend the complaint. ... Indeed, prohibiting amendment and dismissing as a nullity the complaint would yield the ironic result of prejudicing the constituents of the corporation, the very people sought to be protected by the rule against the unauthorized practice of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">In short, only unquestioning adherence to the rigid mechanistic rule ... would require the draconian measure of nullifying a complaint filed by a non-attorney on behalf of a corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">We therefore conclude that the defect of the complaint herein was curable and indeed cured by the later appearance in the action of the plaintiff corporation\u2019s attorney. The draconian sanction of dismissal without leave to amend is unduly harsh in light of the prejudice to the unwary corporate constituents and the total lack of prejudice to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 249-52. (Footnotes and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\"><em>Starrett v. Shepard, </em>606 P.2d 1247 (Wyo.1980), also provides guidance. There, the court considered whether to enter a default judgment against a corporation because \u201ca non-lawyer corporate officer filed a motion to quash service of summons\u201d on the corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. After the corporate officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>filed the motion to quash, the defendants, who were also third-party plaintiffs, moved to strike the motion and for a default judgment, claiming that the corporate officer was a non-lawyer. <em>See id. </em>Thereafter, an attorney appeared for the corporation and represented it throughout the case. <em>See id. </em>The trial court held that \u201cthe improper appearance of [the corporation] through a non-lawyer corporate officer was \u2018cured\u2019 by the subsequent proper appearance ... through an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the court affirmed. It reasoned, at 606 P.2d at 1253-54:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">Pleadings filed and actions taken by a non-lawyer corporate officer in a legal action are subject to be stricken or held to be a nullity; and there may be cases in which entry of a default judgment against a corporation may be justified on the ground that the corporation was improperly represented in the action by a non-lawyer corporate officer, but such is not justified in a case such as this, wherein the representation was very limited. The record does not reflect that the representation was made with knowledge of its impropriety, it was followed within a reasonable time by proper representation through an attorney admitted to practice before the court, and the other party was not substantially prejudiced thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that an appellate court has discretion in determining whether to dismiss an appeal under the circumstances presented here. To be sure, such discretion should be exercised cautiously and used sparingly, in light of the longstanding prohibition of lay persons engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, and the requirement that corporations appear in court through legal counsel. Nonetheless, in light of the totality of circumstances, we are satisfied that, in the exercise of our discretion, the appeal ought not be dismissed. To do so would not serve the interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred or abused its discretion by granting appellee\u2019s motion to strike, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>dismissing the case, with prejudice, \u201cby default.\u201d Appellant complains that the court failed \u201cto follow the dictates of the rule regarding default judgments,\u201d which prejudiced appellant. For example, appellant argues that it was entitled to notice of a default order and the right to move to vacate the order, yet no such notice was provided. In our view, appellant\u2019s analysis of what occurred is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Maryland Rule 2-613 governs default judgments. It is clear that the rule had no application here, because appellant was the plaintiff, appellee was the defendant, and the rule provides that when the <em>defendant </em>fails to plead, the <em>plaintiff </em>on written request, may seek an order of default. Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 613(b). Thereafter, <em>\u201c[t]he defendant may move to vacate the order of default within SO days after its entry. </em>\u201d Maryland Rule 2-613(d) (emphasis added). In this case, it was appellee, as the defendant, who sought to dismiss the case. In doing so, Donegal never relied on Rule 2-613.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">A\u2019Denariwo filed the \u201cResponse Motion Not to Grant the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike with Prejudice\u201d on January 23, 2001. The next day, January 24, 2001, the court signed the proposed order submitted by appellee, granting the motion to strike; that order was then docketed on January 25, 2001. The order states: \u201cUpon consideration of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike the Complaint and <em>any/no response </em>filed thereto.... \u201d (Emphasis added). The order also provides: \u201cIT IS HEREBY ORDERED, this 24th day of January, 2001, that Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike be and is hereby GRANTED <em>by default. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added). The words \u201cby default\u201d were added by the court, by hand, to appellee\u2019s proposed order. Further, the order provides that \u201cPlaintiffs Complaint ... be and is hereby STRICKEN, and the above entitled action is hereby DISMISSED with prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">As we see it, the court did not intend to grant a default judgment merely because it added the words \u201cby default\u201d to appellee\u2019s proposed order. Indeed, given the posture of the case, the court could not treat appellee\u2019s motion to strike as a request for default judgment under Rule 2-613. Rather, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>evident that the court inserted the words \u201cby default\u201d because it was unaware that, just one day earlier, appellant filed an opposition to the motion to strike; the words \u201cby default\u201d reflect the court\u2019s belief that no opposition had been filed by Wholesale.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Although we do not agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the court improperly entered an order of default under Rule 2-613, we do agree with appellant that the court abused its discretion in granting the motion to strike and dismissing the case, with prejudice. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As we noted earlier, in the circuit court Donegal filed a Motion for More Definite Statement, arguing that the original complaint, filed in the District Court, was too vague for it to frame an answer. The circuit court\u2019s order granting appellee\u2019s motion was docketed on November 30, 2000. Among other things, it ordered Wholesale to file an amended complaint within thirty days. Because December 30, 2000, fell on a Saturday, appellant\u2019s complaint was not due until the next business day. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 1 \u2014 203(a)(1). The following Monday was not a business day, however; it was New Year\u2019s Day, January 1, 2001. Therefore, the amended complaint could not have been due until the end of the next business day on Tuesday, January 2, 2001. <em>Id. </em>In addition, pursuant to Md. Rule 1 \u2014 203(c), appellant had an additional three days to file its amended complaint, because service of the court\u2019s order was made by mail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, Wholesale\u2019s pleading was not due until the end of the work day on January 5, 2001. It follows that appellee prematurely filed its motion to strike on January 2, 2001, three days before appellant\u2019s amended complaint was due. Without excusing appellant\u2019s tardiness, Donegal\u2019s premature action set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the dismissal of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">When a plaintiff fails timely to comply with a deadline set by the court, the complaint is subject to a motion to strike under Rule 2-322(e). That rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>(e) Motion to strike. On motion made by a party before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading is required by these rules, on motion made by a party within 15 days after the service of the pleading or on the court\u2019s own initiative at any time, the court may order any insufficient defense or any improper, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter stricken from any pleading or <em>may order any pleading that is late or otherwise not in compliance with these rules stricken in its entirety.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Appellant contends, however, that the court should grant a motion to strike only when \u201cegregious circumstances when prejudice can be shown.\u201d <em>See </em>Paul V. Niemeyer <em>&amp; </em>Linda M. Richards, Maryland Rules Commentary 151 (1984). Appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">There are other mechanisms for bringing a matter to final resolution such as by way of a motion to dismiss, a motion for summary judgment, or a motion for default. In the instant case, Appellee filed a motion to strike requesting that the Appellant\u2019s Complaint be stricken and dismissed. Appellee, however, failed to state what the egregious circumstances were to entitle it to such draconian relief or how Appellee had suffered prejudice as a result of Appellant\u2019s late filing of its amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\"> The decision whether to grant a motion to strike is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Lancaster v. Gardiner, </em>225 Md. 260, 269-70, 170 A.2d 181, <em>cert. denied, </em>368 U.S. 836, 82 S.Ct. 63, 7 L.Ed.2d 37 (1961); <em>Patapsco Assoc. Ltd. Part. v. Gurany, </em>80 Md.App. 200, 204, 560 A.2d 611 (1989). But, we have held \u201cthat such a motion should be granted only if the delay prejudices the defendant.\u201d <em>Garrett v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 23, 27, 720 A.2d 1193 (1998); <em>see also Patapsco Associates Limited Partnership, </em>80 Md.App. at 204, 560 A.2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Neither party has cited <em>Garrett, </em>124 Md.App. 23, 720 A.2d 1193, yet it is certainly pertinent. In <em>Garrett, </em>we held that when \u201ca motion to strike has been filed in response to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>tardily-filed complaint ... the moving party has the burden of proving that it has been prejudiced by the tardiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 720 A.2d 1193. There, the plaintiffs case was one over which both the District Court and the circuit court had concurrent jurisdiction. After the case was transferred to circuit court, the plaintiff failed to file timely her complaint, and therefore the defense moved to strike. In response, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had the burden to establish prejudice from the delayed filing and failed to meet that burden. The circuit court granted the motion to strike, without a hearing. On appeal, because there was no indication that the defendant suffered any prejudice from the delayed filing, we concluded that the court should not have granted the motion. <em>See also Ratapsco Assoc. Ltd. Part., </em>80 Md.App. at 204, 560 A.2d 611 (\u201cin deciding a motion to strike for failure to file a pleading timely, [courts] should afford \u2018great liberality in the allowance of amendments in order to prevent the substantial injustice of a cause from being defeated by formal slips or slight variances.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Based on <em>Garrett, </em>we consider it significant that the word \u201cprejudice\u201d does not appear anywhere in appellee\u2019s motion to strike. Yet, under the circumstances attendant here, appellee had the burden to show that it was prejudiced by the delay. Thus, we conclude that the circuit court erred or abused its discretion in granting the motion to strike, and in dismissing the case with prejudice. We add that if the court was of the view that some sanction was appropriate, surely a less draconian measure could have been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">.
