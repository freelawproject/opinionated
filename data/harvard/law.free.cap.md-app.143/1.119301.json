The thumbprint, if Bank of America has its way, will now be one more means by which the identity of a non-account check holder is expressed and confirmed. This idea has of course not met with universal approval, and that is why this matter of first impression is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-12\">Specifically, we are presented with the question of whether Bank of America\u2019s practice of requiring non-account check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>holders to provide a thumbprint signature before it will honor a check is lawful. Appellant, Jeff E. Messing, claims that it is not and filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the Circuit for Baltimore City, requesting a declaration that the practice is illegal and an order requiring its cessation. In reply, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment. That motion was granted; appellant\u2019s complaint was dismissed; and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">In addition to the question of the legality of appellee\u2019s thumbprint signature program, appellant also raises questions as to whether appellee \u201caccepted,\u201d \u201cdishonored,\u201d or \u201cconverted\u201d appellant\u2019s check upon presentment. All of these questions have been presented for our review and are set forth below as they appear in appellant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">I. Did the circuit court err in construing the requirement of giving \u201creasonable identification\u201d under [C.L.] \u00a7 3-501(b)(2) to require a thumbprint if demanded by a drawee to whom presentment of a check is made, notwithstanding the proffer of reasonable and customary documentary forms of identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-6\">II. Did the circuit court err in finding the appellee did not accept the particular check at issue, as \u201cacceptance\u201d is defined in [C.L.] \u00a7 3-409(a)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">III. Did the circuit court err in finding that the appellee did not dishonor the particular check at issue, as \u201cdishonor\u201d is defined in [C.L.] \u00a7 3-502(d)(l)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-8\">IV. Did the circuit court err in finding the appellee did not convert the cash proceeds of the particular check at issue, as \u201cconversion\u201d is set out in [C.L.] \u00a7 3-420?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">V. Did the circuit court err in not giving full effect to the plain language of [C.L.] \u00a7 3-111, that states that when no address is stated in an instrument, \u201cthe place of payment is the place of business of the drawee or maker. If the drawee or maker has more than one place of business, the place of business is any place of business of the drawee or maker chosen by the person entitled to enforce the instrument\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>VI. Did the circuit court err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing with prejudice as a matter of law the appellant\u2019s complaint for declaratory judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment and dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint. Requiring thumbprint signatures for non-account check holders is lawful, and at no time did appellee accept, convert, or dishonor appellant\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">However, because this appeal involves a request for declaratory judgment and the circuit court neither entered a written declaration of the rights of the parties nor did it file any written opinion which could be treated as a declaratory judgment, we shall vacate the judgment and remand this case to the circuit court to enter a written declaration of the rights of the parties consistent with this opinion. <em>Bushey v. Northern Assurance Co. of America, </em>362 Md. 626, 651-52, 766 A.2d 598 (2001); <em>see also Maryland Ass\u2019n of Health Maintenance Organizations v. Health Servs. Cost Review Comm\u2019n, </em>356 Md. 581, 741 A.2d 483 (1999)(\u201c \u2018whether a declaratory judgment action is decided for or against the plaintiff, there should be a declaration in the judgment or decree defining the rights of the parties under the issues made.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Before doing so, however, we shall review the merits of this case. <em>Bushey, </em>362 Md. at 651-52, 766 A.2d 598 (2001); <em>see also Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 660 A.2d 447 (1995)(remand was appropriate action even though the merits of the controversy were addressed on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">On August 3, 2000, appellant attempted to cash a check for $976 at the Light Street branch office of appellee in Baltimore City. That check was made out to appellant and drawn on a Bank of America customer checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Upon entering the bank, appellant handed the check to a teller. The teller then confirmed the availability of the funds on deposit, and placed the check in a computer validation slot. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>After \u201cvalidating\u201d the availability of those funds, the computer stamped the time, date, account number, and teller number on the back of the check. It also placed a hold on $976 in the drawer\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The teller then gave the check back to appellant to endorse. After he had endorsed the check, the teller asked appellant for identification. In response, appellant presented his driver\u2019s license and a major credit card. The identification information on the license and credit card was then transferred by the teller to the back of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">During this transaction, the teller asked appellant if he was a Bank of America customer. When he said \u201cno,\u201d the teller returned the check to appellant and requested that he place his \u201cthumbprint signature\u201d on the check in accordance with appellee\u2019s thumbprint signature policy for \u201cnon-account holders.\u201d That policy, which is posted at each teller\u2019s station,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires a non-account holder, seeking to cash a check drawn on a Bank of America customer account, to provide a thumbprint signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The provision of such a signature is neither messy nor time consuming. A thumbprint signature is created by applying one\u2019s right thumb to an inkless fingerprinting device that leaves no ink stain or residue. The thumbprint is then placed on the face of the check between the memo and signature line.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">After requesting appellant\u2019s thumbprint signature, the teller counted out $976 in cash from her drawer anticipating that appellant would comply with that request. When he refused to do so, the teller indicated that the bank would not be able to complete the transaction without his thumbprint. Appellant then asked to see the branch manager, and the teller referred him to a \u201cMr. Obrigkeit,\u201d the branch manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Upon entering the branch manager\u2019s office, appellant demanded that the check be cashed despite his refusal to place his thumbprint on the check. The branch manager examined the check and returned it to appellant explaining that because appellant was not an account holder, Bank of America would not cash the check without his thumbprint on the instrument. The requirement of a thumbprint signature from non-account holders was in accordance with the deposit agreement that Bank of America has with each of its account holders. That agreement states that Bank of America is permitted \u201cto establish physical and/or documentary requirements\u201d of payees or other holders who seek to cash an item drawn on a Bank of America customer\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Appellant then requested that the branch manager provide him with a copy of the Bank\u2019s thumbprint policy. The branch manager contacted appellee\u2019s regional headquarters and was informed that no such information was available for public distribution. After the branch manager conveyed that information to appellant, appellant left the bank. Moments later, the teller released the hold on the customer\u2019s funds, voided the transaction in the computer, and placed the $976 in cash back in her drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Indignant over the bank\u2019s policy, appellant filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment requesting the circuit court to \u201cdetermine and declare\u201d that 1) appellant had provided appellee with \u201creasonable identification\u201d without his thumbprint; 2) requiring a thumbprint is not \u201creasonable identification\u201d under Maryland Code (1975, 1997 Repl.Vol., Supp.2000), \u00a7 3-501(b)(2) of the Commercial Law Article (\u201cC.L.\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3) requiring a thumbprint of non-account holders to cash a check is \u201cillegal, inappropriate, and unnecessary;\u201d 4) requiring non-account holders to provide a thumbprint is an invasion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>privacy; 5) non-account holders need not provide a thumbprint to cash a check with appellee; 6) appellee had accepted the check; 7) appellee had wrongfully dishonored the check; and 8) appellee had wrongfully converted the check. Appellant also requested that the circuit court order appellee to cease and desist from requiring thumbprint signatures in Maryland.'</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">In reply, appellee filed a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Appellant then responded by filing an opposition to appellee\u2019s motion and a cross motion for summary judgment. At a hearing on those motions, the circuit court entered summary judgment in favor of appellee and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">In evaluating appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court erred in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we observe that summary judgment is appropriate only when, after viewing the motion and response in favor of the non-moving party, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>127 Md.App. 255, 269-70, 732 A.2d 912, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000); Md. Rule 2-501(e). In other words, once we have concluded that there is no genuine issue of material fact, our standard of review \u201cis whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). Applying that standard to the instant case, we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that the circuit court was legally correct in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing with prejudice appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in construing the \u201creasonable identification\u201d requirement of C.L. \u00a7 3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>501(b)(2) to include a thumbprint signature if demanded by appellee, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s proffer of his driver\u2019s license and a credit card. C.L. \u00a7 3-501 (b)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment must (i) exhibit the instrument, (ii) give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so, and (iii) sign a receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if full payment is made. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Because C.L. \u00a7 3-501(b)(2) does not define \u201creasonable identification,\u201d appellant maintains that we should look to Title 31, \u00a7 103.28 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\u201cCFR\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which, according to appellant, does. That regulation was promulgated by the United States Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311, <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For certain cash transactions exceeding $10,000 per business day,'<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.28 requires that financial institutions handling such transactions verify \u201cthe identity ... of any person or entity on whose behalf such transaction is to be effected.\u201d That verification is to \u201cbe made by examination of a document, other than a bank signature card, that is normally acceptable within the banking community as a means of identification when cashing checks for nondepositors <em>(e.g., </em>a drivers [sic] license or credit card).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because 31 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u00a7 103.28 recognizes a driver\u2019s license or credit card as a reasonable method for establishing \u201cidentification when cashing checks for nondepositors,\u201d appellant argues that other methods of identification, such as appellee\u2019s thumbprint signature program, are unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">While 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.28 does indicate that a driver\u2019s license or a credit card may be an acceptable form of identification for certain transactions in excess of $10,000, it does not, as appellant suggests, preclude appellee from requiring a thumbprint signature of non-account holders who wish appellee to honor their checks. A \u201cdrivers license [sic] or credit card,\u201d according to 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.28, are only examples of the types of identification \u201cnormally acceptable within the banking community as a means of identification when cashing-checks for nondepositors.\u201d Nowhere does 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.28 suggest that a driver\u2019s license and a credit card are the only acceptable forms of identification. Nor does 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.28 preclude a financial institution from requesting additional or alternative forms of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Indeed, if the Treasury Department had intended to limit reasonable identification under 31 C.F.R. 103.28 to just a driver\u2019s license and a credit card, it could have done so. But it did not. Nonetheless, appellant would have us disregard a cardinal tenet of statutory construction that a court may not \u201comit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> by omitting the language in 31 C.F.R. 103.28 indicating that a driver\u2019s license or a credit card are only examples of reasonable identification and not the only acceptable forms of such identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">While the phrase \u201creasonable identification\u201d under former U.C.C. \u00a7 3-505(l)(b), now codified in Maryland as C.L. \u00a7 3-501(b)(2), has been addressed by the other state courts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>other contexts,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> what constitutes \u201creasonable identification\u201d under C.L. 3 \u2014 501(b)(2)\u2014particularly whether a \u201cthumbprint signature\u201d does \u2014 is a question that has not been addressed by any federal or state court, at least not in any reported opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Appellee\u2019s thumbprint requirement is a form of \u201creasonable identification\u201d for a number of reasons. First, a thumbprint signature has been accepted by the drafters of the Maryland UCC as an effective, reliable, and accurate way to authenticate a writing on a negotiable instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u201cIn accord with the systematic presentation of the UCC and its use of consistent terminology,\u201d U.C.C. \u00a7 1-201 sets forth \u201c46 basic terms\u201d to be used throughout the Code to \u201coffer a starting point for the interpretation of many Code sections.\u201d 1 William D. Hawkland, <em>Uniform Commercial Code Series, </em>\u00a7 1-201:1 (1998). The term \u201csigned\u201d is defined in C.L. \u00a7 1-201(39)(1975, 1997 Repl.Vol.) as \u201cany symbol executed or adopted by a party with present intention to authenticate a writing,\u201d and that definition applies throughout the Maryland UCC. As to what \u201csigned\u201d means, the Official Comment to C.L. \u00a7 1-201(39) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">The inclusion of authentication in the definition of \u201csigned\u201d is to make clear that as the term is used in this Act a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>complete signature is not necessary. Authentication may be printed, stamped or written; it may be by initials or by thumbprint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">C.L. \u00a7 1-201, Official Comment 39 (1975, 1997 Repl.Vol.)(em-phasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Among the sections of the Maryland UCC employing the term \u201csigned,\u201d which, as noted, includes a thumbprint, are: C.L. \u00a7 3-401(a)(holding that a \u201cperson is not liable on an instrument unless (i) the person <em>signed </em>the instrument.\u201d)(emphasis added); C.L. \u00a7 3-402(a)(\u201cIf a person acting ... as a representative <em>signs </em>an instrument ..., the represented person is bound by the signature ... .\u201d)(emphasis added); C.L. \u00a7 3^403(a)(\u201c[A]n unauthorized <em>signature </em>is ineffective except ... in favor of a person who in good faith pays the instrument or takes it for value.\u201d)(emphasis added); C.L. \u00a7 3-419(b)(\u201cAn accommodation party may <em>sign </em>the instrument [and] ... is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party szpres.\u201d)(emphasis added). Consequently, a thumbprint is deemed an acceptable and reliable form of signature throughout the Maryland UCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Second, the process that a non-account holder goes through to provide a thumbprint signature is not unreasonably inconvenient. As noted, non-account holders seeking to cash a check are asked to apply their right thumb to an inkless fingerprinting device to create a \u201cthumbprint signature.\u201d Unlike fingerprinting \u2014 which has repeatedly been upheld as an \u201cunobtrusive\u201d form of identification<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u2014 thumbprint signatures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>do not require application of ink nor do they require the participation of more than one digit. In fact, appellant\u2019s thumbprint signature program uses an inkless fingerprinting device that leaves no ink stains or residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">And third, this procedure is a reasonable and necessary answer to the growing incidence of check fraud. The American Bankers Association has reported that check fraud losses have grown, between 1995 and 1997, at an average rate of 17.5 percent. Carreker-Antinori, <em>Provide Your Bank with a Shield of Protection against Check Fraud, </em>Thompson Financial Publishing, at <em>http://www.tfp.com/text/Fraudlink.pdf. </em>\u201cIndustry estimates based on survey data show that actual losses from check fraud amounted to $512.3 million in 1997, a 5.2 percent increase over the $487.1 million estimated for 1995.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">As a result of the rising level of check fraud, thumbprint programs, as appellee notes, \u201chave been endorsed by the American Bankers Association and more than thirty (30) state bankers associations including Arizona, Maryland, Missouri, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia.\u201d Testifying before the United States House of Representatives as to the effectiveness of these programs, Charles L. Owens, former Chief of the Financial Crimes Section of the FBI, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">We have supported implementation of inkless fingerprint policies which have been adopted by over 20 State bankers associations for non-bank customers negotiating checks. Where implemented, these procedures have successfully reduced negotiation of stolen and counterfeit checks by as much as 50 percent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\"><em>Computer Generated Check Fraud, Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Committee on Banking and Financial Services, </em>U.S. House of Representatives, May 1, 1997; <em>see also Perkey v. Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>42 Cal.3d 185, 228 Cal.Rptr. 169, 721 P.2d 50, 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>(1986)(stating that the fingerprint requirement is one of the few non-invasive reliable means of combating rampant fraud).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Finally, appellant\u2019s contention that a thumbprint does not serve the purposes of the Act is unpersuasive. We agree with appellant that a thumbprint cannot be used, in most instances, to confirm the identity of a non-account checkholder at the time that the check is presented for cashing, as his or her thumbprint is usually not on file with the drawee at that time. We disagree, however, with appellant\u2019s conclusion that a thumbprint signature is therefore not \u201creasonable identification\u201d for purposes of C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 501(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Nowhere does the language of C.L. \u00a7 3-501(b)(2) suggest that \u201creasonable identification\u201d is limited to information appellee can authenticate at the time presentment is made. Rather, all that is required is that the \u201cperson making presentment must ... give reasonable identification.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-501(b)(2). While providing a thumbprint signature does not necessarily confirm identification of the checkholder at presentment \u2014 unless of course the drawee bank has a duplicate thumbprint signature on file \u2014 it does assist in the identification of the checkholder should the check later prove to be bad. It therefore serves as a powerful deterrent to those who might otherwise attempt to pass a bad check. That one method provides identification \u2019at the time of presentment and the other identification after the check may have been honored, does not prevent the latter from being \u201creasonable identification\u201d for purposes of C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 501(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in holding that appellee did not \u201caccept\u201d the check at issue under C.L. \u00a7 3-409(a)(1975,1997 Repl.Vol.). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY1\">\u201cAcceptance\u201d means the drawee\u2019s signed agreement to pay a draft as presented. It must be written on the draft and may consist of the drawee\u2019s signature alone. Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>draft is delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Appellant claims that the teller had accepted the draft in question and that appellee was therefore required to pay it at the time of acceptance. Indeed, C.L. \u00a7 3-413(a)(1975, 1997 Repl.Vol.) states that \u201c[t]he acceptor of a draft is obliged to pay the draft (i) according to its terms at the time it was accepted.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[i]f a draft is accepted by a bank, the drawer is discharged, regardless of when or by whom acceptance was obtained.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-414(c). Therefore, according to appellant, \u201cthe check that was returned to the Appellant when the Appellee wrongfully refused to pay the Appellant the proceeds of same is no longer negotiable and the drawer\u2019s obligation to Appellant was discharged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In support of his claim that his check was accepted by appellee, appellant cites the testimony of the teller that she \u201cput the Check into the validation slot of [her] computer and validated the Check.\u201d By that act, appellant claims, appellee endorsed the check. And indeed, a \u201csignature may be made (i) manually or by means of a device or machine, and (ii) by the use of any name, including a trade or assumed name, or by a word, mark, or symbol executed or adopted by a person with present intention to authenticate a writing.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 401(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Appellant then points to Official Comment 2 to C.L. \u00a7 3-409(a), which states that, as a general rule, \u201cthe mere signature of the drawee on the instrument is a sufficient acceptance.\u201d He therefore concludes that appellee\u2019s placement of that check in the validation slot of the computer constituted \u201cacceptance.\u201d We disagree and hold that the check in question was not \u201caccepted\u201d as that term is defined by C.L. \u00a7 3-409(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">To constitute an \u201cacceptance\u201d under C.L. \u00a7 3-409(a), the acceptance must be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">(1) in writing, (2) written on the instrument itself, (3) signed and (4) delivered to the holder or the holder notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Although usually an obligation on a negotiable instrument is not effective until the instrument is delivered, an acceptance becomes operative when completed either by delivery or by notification [by the drawee]. By permitting an acceptance to be effective upon notification, the acceptance becomes effective earlier and delay is avoided. The notification must indicat\u00e9 that there has been a written acceptance and must be sent to the holder or to another person at the holder\u2019s direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">6 William D. Hawkland, <em>Uniform Commercial Code Series, </em>[Rev] \u00a7 8-409:2 (1999)(emphasis added)(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In other words, for an acceptance to occur, appellant must establish that the instrument was signed by the appellee and that the latter notified appellant that it had accepted it. <em>See e.g., Union Export Co. v. N.I.B. Intermarket, A.B., </em>786 S.W.2d 628, 629 (Tenn.1990)(bank accepted draft where it both signed draft and sent notice of acceptance under former 3-410);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Merson v. Sun Ins. Co. of New York, </em>44 Misc.2d 131, 253 N.Y.S.2d 51, 52-53-(1964)( [D]rawee bank did not irrevocably accept [a] draft by notification or delivery, despite drawee\u2019s tentative approval of the check by placing the words \u201cupon acceptance [by the drawee bank]\u201d on it.); <em>see also Schering-Plough Healthcare Products, Inc., v. NBD Bank, N.A., </em>98 F.3d 904, 908 (6th Cir.1996)(holding that the words \u201cNo Stops\u201d [indicating no stop payments] and \u201cTV\u201d [initial of drawee bank employee providing that information] on the back of two checks did not evidence a \u201csigned agreement\u201d or \u201cintent to pay the drafts\u201d to constitute acceptance under the UCC \u00a7 3-409(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">While Bank of America\u2019s stamping of the check may constitute a \u201csigned agreement\u201d to pay the check as presented, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>there is no evidence that appellee notified or delivered notification to appellant that an acceptance had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">As noted earlier, the check was given back to appellant by the teller so that he could put his thumbprint signature on it,' not to notify or give him rights on the purported acceptance. After appellant declined to put his thumbprint signature on the check, he was informed by both the teller and the branch manager that it was against bank policy to honor the check without a thumbprint signature. Indignant, appellant walked out of the bank with the check. Because appellant did not comply with appellee\u2019s request to provide a thumbprint signature when the check was handed over, it cannot be said that there was an \u201caccepted draft ... delivered [by appellee] for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to\u201d appellant. C.L. \u00a7 3-409(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Appellant further asserts that the circuit court erred in holding that the appellee did not dishonor the check under C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 502(d)(1). That section provides that \u201cif the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.\u201d Because the check \u201cpresented to [appellee] was payable on demand\u201d and because appellee \u201caccepted the check on August 3, 2000, but did not make payment on that date,\u201d appellant concludes that appellee \u201cdishonored the check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 502(d)(1), however, is not relevant to the instant case because the check in question, as we concluded earlier, was never accepted by appellee. In other words, appellant cites the wrong section of the UCC. The section that appellant should have cited is C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 502(b)(2), as it applies to dishonored \u201cunaccepted\u201d checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">That section provides that if an unaccepted \u201cdraft is payable on demand ... the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 502(b)(2). There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>dishonor, however, if presentment fails \u201cto comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 501(b)(3). In the words of one authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">If the presentment is not proper, payment or acceptance may be refused by the presentee and this refusal does not constitute a dishonoring of the instrument. This provision comes into play if the presentment does not comply \u201cwith the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">6B <em>Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code </em>[Rev] \u00a7 3-501:15(3d Ed.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">It is undisputed that appellee had the authority to refuse payment in accordance with the deposit agreement it had with each account holder, including with the drawer of the check in question. Pursuant to that agreement, appellee was permitted to set \u201cphysical and/or documentary requirements\u201d for all those who seek to cash a check with appellee. And because appellee had the authority to refuse payment by agreement with its customer under C.L. \u00a7 3-501 (b)(2)(ii) unless \u201creasonable identification\u201d was presented, appellant\u2019s failure to provide his thumbprint rendered the presentment ineffective and did not result in a dishonor of the check when appellee returned it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Appellant contends the circuit court erred in holding that appellee \u201cdid not convert the cash proceeds of the particular check at issue, as \u2018conversion\u2019 is set out\u201d in C.L. \u00a7 3-420(a) (1975, Repl.Vol.1997, Cumm.Supp.2000). That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Appellant, argues that because appellee\u2019s teller took possession of the check and then counted and separated out the proceeds of the check to pay them to appellant, the failure of the teller to then do so constituted a conversion. In appellant\u2019s words, he \u201cwas deprived of the proceeds to which he was entitled to possess at that time, and the refusal of [appellee] to turn over the proceeds to [him] was a conversion.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Appellant unfortunately confuses the check, which was his property, with the proceeds of that check, which were not. The proceeds of the check belonged to the bank until paid over to appellant \u2014 which of course they never were because of appellant\u2019s refusal to provide a thumbprint signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">\u201cConversion,\u201d we have held, \u201crequires not merely temporary interference with property rights, but the exercise of unauthorized dominion and control to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor.\u201d <em>Yost v. Early, </em>87 Md.App. 364, 388, 589 A.2d 1291 (1991) (citations omitted)(quotations omitted). At no time did appellee exercise \u201cunauthorized dominion and control [over the check] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,\u201d appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Appellant voluntarily gave the check to appellee\u2019s teller. When appellant indicated to the teller that he was not an account holder, she gave the check back to him for a thumbprint signature in accordance with bank policy. After being informed by both appellee\u2019s teller and branch manager that it was appellee\u2019s policy not to cash a non-account holder\u2019s check without a thumbprint signature, appellant left the bank with the check in hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Because appellant gave the check to the teller, appellee\u2019s possession of that check was anything but \u201cunauthorized.\u201d And, having returned the check, within minutes of its receipt, to appellant for his thumbprint signature, appellant never exercised \u201cdominion and control [over it] to the complete exclusion of the rightful possessor,\u201d appellant. In short, there was no conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>y.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Finally, appellant contends that the circuit court erred in not giving full effect to the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 3-111 (1975,1997 Repl.Vol.). That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">[A]n instrument is payable at the place of payment stated in the instrument. If no place of payment is stated, an instrument is payable at the address of the drawee or maker stated in the instrument. If no address is stated, the place of payment is the place of business of the drawee or maker. If a drawee or maker has more than one place of business, the place of payment is any place of business of the drawee or maker chosen by the person entitled to enforce the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Appellant argues that since neither the place of payment nor the address of the drawee or maker was stated in the check, the check was payable at any place of business of appellee (the drawee) chosen by the appellant (the person entitled to enforce the instrument). Thus, once appellant was in a branch office of appellee, the bank was required to pay the check under C.L. \u00a7 3-111. Otherwise, appellant argues, C.L. \u00a7 3-111 would have no meaning. That argument is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">C.L. \u00a7 3-111 provides that an instrument will be paid at the location specified in that instrument. In the event that no location is specified, C.L. \u00a7 3-111 provides that the appropriate place of payment of an instrument is \u201cthe place of business of the drawee.\u201d As appellee was the drawee, any of its branch offices was an appropriate place to present the check in question. Although the location was correct, presentment was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u201c \u2018Presentment\u2019 means a demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce an instrument\u201d by either paying the instrument or accepting the draft. C.L. \u00a7 3-501(a). Proper presentment, however, depends upon more than a demand for payment at the right location. Indeed, an instrument may be returned to its presenter, as appellant concedes, for \u201clack of reasonable identification by the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>making presentment,\u201d or, for that matter, for failing to comply with any of \u201cthe terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties, or other applicable law or rule.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3 \u2014 501(b)(3). By refusing to provide a thumbprint signature, appellant violated appellant\u2019s rules for honoring a non-account holder\u2019s check. This failure rendered appellant\u2019s presentment ineffective. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s C.L. \u00a7 3-111 argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">As noted, because this appeal involves a request for declaratory judgment, the circuit court must enter \u201ca written declaration of the rights of the parties\u201d or file a \u201cwritten opinion\u201d which could be treated as such. <em>Bushey v. Northern Assurance Co. of America, </em>362 Md. 626, 651-52, 766 A.2d 598 (2001). Because it did not, we shall vacate the judgment and remand the case to the circuit court to enter a written declaration of the rights of the parties consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b27-13\">.
