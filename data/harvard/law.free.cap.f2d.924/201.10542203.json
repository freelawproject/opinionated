The Presentence Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) prepared for each conspirator characterized appellant as one of the least culpable participants in the conspiracy. Prior to sentencing, appellant filed a \u201cConsolidated Notice of Objection, Factual Discrepancies in PSI and Sentencing Memorandum,\u201d in which he sought to be considered a minor participant in the conspiracy under the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (Nov.1990) (hereafter sentencing guidelines). At the sentencing hearing, the district court held that appellant\u2019s role in the conspiracy was not minor and refused to deduct two points from his offense level under \u00a7 3B1.2. The court concluded that appellant\u2019s offense level was 34,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which translated into a sentencing range of 151 to 188 months incarceration. Appellant was sentenced to 151 months incarceration and five years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-18\">Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he was not a minor participant in the conspiracy. Appellant emphasizes that application note 3 for \u00a7 3B1.2 provides that a minor participant \u201cmeans any participant who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S. S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment, (n.3). Appellant contends that because he was characterized as one of the least culpable conspirators by the PSI, he is clearly \u201cless culpable than most other participants\u201d and, therefore, qualifies for a two point reduction in his offense level \u201cwithout any further finding.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-19\">The district court\u2019s determination that appellant was not a minor participant in the conspiracy is a finding of fact which will be reversed on appeal only if \u201cclearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Sellers, </em>906 F.2d 597 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Appellant\u2019s argument would require sentencing courts to regard the least culpable member of any conspiracy as a minor participant, regardless of the extent of that member\u2019s participation. Although the PSI indicated that appellant was one of the \u201cleast culpable\u201d defendants, the district court was not obliged on that basis to determine that appellant was a \u201cminor\u201d participant for the purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2 of the sentencing guidelines. It is entirely possible for conspiracies to exist in which there are no minor participants or for which the least culpable participants, for whatever reason, were not indicted. In either case, the fact that a particular defendant may be least culpable among those who are actually named as defendants does not establish that he performed a minor role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The evidence in this case established that appellant knowingly and intentionally assisted in the illegal importation of approximately 800 kilograms of cocaine into the United States in exchange for $75,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Given the extremely large amount of cocaine involved and the amount of money promised to appellant, we cannot find that the district court was clearly erroneous in determining that appellant was not a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-14\">. The district court reduced appellant's offense level by two points, from a base level of 36 to 34, based on appellant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. It is undisputed that appellant never received the promised money, but that is irrelevant to the assessment of his role in the conspiracy. He agreed to participate in the conspiracy in exchange for $75,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
