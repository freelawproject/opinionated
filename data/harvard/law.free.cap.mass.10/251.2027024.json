The defendant objected to the motion, which was, notwithstanding, granted upon the common rule, the defendant electing his costs. The plaintiff then erased the said order, and, instead thereof, inserted over the name of the defendant these words: \u201c <em>For value received by a horse, I guaranty the payment to </em>David Hutchinson, <em>Jun.\u201d </em>The plaintiff also added three new counts to his original declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">A verdict being found for the plaintiff, the defendant moved for a new trial, on the ground that the Court had improperly permitted the said alteration and amendment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-6\"><em>Dewey, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6qm\">This being a record of another court, the Court here have not the same power in granting amendments as in their own records.

Our statute gives an unlimited and discretionary power to grant amendments in all cases, on such terms as the Court shall think reasonable. Nor does it countenance a distinction between original processes and proceedings upon writs of error. The discretion of the Court, in the present case, has been exercised by a judge of competent jurisdiction. [ *252 ] * Until the practice was introduced of ordering trials at the bar of this Court, causes were sent back to the court below for a new trial, upon the reversal of the former judg ments. In such case, the lower court could have authorized this amendment. The plaintiff ought not to be prejudiced in his right\u00bb by this new practice of retaining the cause here for trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-11\">The action being continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, in the following week, at <em>Northampton,</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b254-14\"> 8 <em>W.

We can only examine that record, as it is certified to us, and determine whether it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>warrants the judgment rendered by the other court If any alteration is made in it here, it is no longer the same record, which alone we have authority to examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The amendment of records, mentioned in the books, after error brought, is made by the court from which the record is sent. Clerical mistakes and errors, are frequently so amended, when sulistantial justice requires it, and when there is any thing on the record by which to amend; in which case the plaintiff in error is usually entitled to the costs of the writ of error, if he proceeds no farther. On a trial, a few years ago, in this Court, a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff for a sum greater than the damages demanded in his writ. The error was not perceived, and no <em>remittitur </em>of the excess was entered at the time. Afterwards, and after a writ of error brought for this cause, this Court, being the same in which the judgment complained of was rendered, permitted an amendment of the record by the original plaintiff\u2019s entering a <em>remittitur. </em>If the original judgment in that case had been in the Court of Common Pleas, <em>they </em>might, in their discretion, have allowed the same amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The authorities cited for the defendant go to show that * such an amendment as the present ought not to [ * 253 <em>] </em>be allowed, even by the court which has authority ; as it is in a material point, and would vary the issue or point to be tried, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But it is unnecessary to consider the question, as it is clear that, this Court has no authority to make any amendment or alteration in the record which is certified to us. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The new counts filed in this Court must be struck out; and at the request of the plaintiff in error, the award of a <em>venire de novo </em>is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">[As to amendment of records, see <em>Davis </em>vs. <em>Ballard, 7 Monr. </em>604. \u2014 2 <em>Penns. </em>1012. \u2014 <em>The State </em>vs. <em>Cherrey, </em>2 <em>Dev. </em>550. \u2014 <em>Patton </em>vs. <em>Massey, </em>2 <em>Hill, </em>475. \u2014 <em>Dowey </em>vs. <em>Teneyck, </em>2 <em>Penns. </em>1023. \u2014 <em>Bank, </em>&amp;c., vs. <em>Ridgley, </em>1 <em>Har. &amp; G. </em>324. \u2014 <em>Doe vs. Owen, </em>2 <em>Black. </em>452. \u2014 <em>Allen vs. Addington, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>215.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">In case of.a process against A and B, which is served against A only, the plead ings being only against him, and the verdict and judgment against both; the judgment may be amended at a subsequent term, by striking out the name of B. \u2014 <em>Hartomer vs. M'Connell, </em>2 <em>Ham. </em>32.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Where a declaration set forth, by mistake, a demand for 12 dollars, instead of 1200 dollars, and the plaintiff in the court below recovered nearly 1200 dollars, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>defendant appealed, but failed to enter his appeal; upon the plaintiff\u2019s complaint fol affirmation of judgment, held, he could not be allowed to amend the record by inserting the word <em>hundred. </em>\u2014 <em>Varnum </em>vs. Bissell, 14 <em>Pick. </em>191.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">After the lapse of a reasonable time, judicial proceedings cannot be amended.\u2014 <em>Fowble </em>vs. <em>Rayberrg, 4 Ham. 45. </em>\u2014A general judgment cannot be amended into a special one; nor a final judgment (except in matter of form) at a subsequent term. \u2014 <em>Green </em>vs. <em>Dodge, </em>3 <em>Ham. </em>486. \u2014 <em>Botkin </em>vs. <em>Commissioners, </em>1 <em>Ham. </em>375. \u2014 Nor is any error, except a mere clerical misprision, amendable after the end of the term.\u2014 <em>Hall </em>vs. <em>Williams, </em>1 <em>Fairf. </em>278. \u2014 And see <em>Freeland </em>vs. <em>Field, </em>6 <em>Call, </em>12. \u2014 <em>State </em>vs. <em>Calhoon, </em>1 <em>Dev. &amp; B. </em>374.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">But where, in 1817, judgment was entered on a wrong count, the plaintiff had leave to amend the record in 1827, saving the rights of third persons, acquired under the judgment.\u2014 <em>Chamberlain </em>vs. <em>Crane, 4 N.
