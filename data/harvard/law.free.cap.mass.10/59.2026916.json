The prisoner is not to be retaken by the same officer; and if he suffers in damages recovered against him by the creditor, the original debtor is not habl\u00e9 to the officer, as he is in case of a negligent escape, in which he is a wrong-doer as to the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16-pl-split\">But neither a negligent nor a voluntary escape, unless the cred-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u00a1tor has himself consented to the discharge of his debtor, when arrested and a prisoner in execution, is an answer for him to the demand of the creditor upon the same judgment. As to him, the officer and prisoner are wrong-doers, as well in the case of a voluntary as of a negligent escape, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The second plea of the defendant is bad and insufficient, as it contains no averment of a consent by the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">See 1 <em>Show. </em>174. \u20142 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>126.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">[In what cases the levy of an execution is no satisfaction of the judgment, see <em>Green </em>vs. <em>Burke, </em>23 <em>Wend. </em>490.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">A levy upon chattels of a third person is no satisfaction, and <em>scire facias </em>still lies upon the judgment. \u2014 <em>Flagg </em>vs. <em>Dryden, </em>7 <em>Pick. </em>52. \u2014 And this without petition to the court. \u2014 <em>Wilson </em>vs. <em>Green, </em>19 <em>Pick. </em>433.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">If a debtor be arrested on a <em>ca. sa., </em>and discharged by order of the creditor, or his agent, no other execution can issue upon the same judgment.\u2014 <em>Windrum </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>2 <em>Leigh. </em>361. \u2014 But if a debtor in custody under a <em>ca. sa. </em>is permitted to escape, an other execution may issue. \u2014 <em>Ibid. </em>\u2014 See 2 <em>Hayio. </em>110.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">The return of satisfaction to a <em>fi. fa. </em>is conclusive against a <em>scire facias </em>upon the judgment, unless the return can be amended by leave of court. \u2014 <em>Snead </em>vs. <em>Rhodes 2 Dev. &amp; B. </em>386. \u2014F.
