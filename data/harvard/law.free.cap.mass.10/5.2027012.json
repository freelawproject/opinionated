And depositions were offered and filed with the motion, proving the facts therein alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\"><em>Curia. </em>We cannot decide this upon motion, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The allegations are traversable. They must therefore be pleaded in abatement, as since the last continuance. If the petitioner demurs, we shall have the facts regularly before us upon the record: if they take issue, the jury will decide the facts, which will then also be properly before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-8\">Accordingly the respondents filed a plea in abatement, praying judgment of the petition: \u2014 Because (protesting that * the land, whereof partition is prayed, is held by the pro- [ * 7 ] prietors thereof, as members of an ancient corporation) they say that <em>Matthew Barnard, </em>of the same <em>Nantucket, </em>yeoman who, at the time of filing of said petition, and until his decease, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>was one of the proprietors of the land aforesaid, after the last con tinuance of the petition, and before the present term of this Court, viz., at said <em>Nantucket, </em>on the 1st day of March instant, did die, leaving two daughters, <em>viz., Mary Barnard </em>and <em>Elizabeth Barnard, </em>both now in full life, at <em>Nantucket </em>aforesaid, his heirs at law, to whom his interest in said land descended, and this the said respondents are ready to verify: wherefore they pray judgment of the petition, and if the Court here will further proceed in the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">The petitioners demurred to this plea, assigning for causes, that the said <em>Matthew </em>was not, and the said <em>Mary </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>were not, parties to the record or proceedings; that it appears by the plea that the said <em>Matthew </em>ought to have appeared and answered, and had not so done; and that the respondents, by their said plea, are officiously intermeddling with the rights and concerns of others without authority, and attempting to make persons parties to the record and proceedings against their wish, and without any au thority. The respondents joined in the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\"><em>Whitman, </em>in support of the demurrer, contended that it was incompetent for those respondents, who had appeared, to the petition, to appear for and represent the interests of others, who had never by an appearance made themselves parties to the suit. The only question in this process is, whether the petitioners are entitled as they claim. One respondent is sufficient to cause a due trial of that question; and if, in this case, where there are many hundred tenants in common, the death of one will abate the proceedings, partition can never be had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\">The statute of 1783, <em>c. </em>41, giving this process by petition, in the preamble declares partition of lands to be of great advan- [ * 8 ] tage, and proposes to supply a remedy against * the hinderances and delays to which it was then exposed. But this is a hinderance much beyond any the statute attempts to cure, and will in many cases prove fatal. And the additional statute of 1786, <em>c. </em>53, liberally provides for the trial and determination of the facts alleged in any such petition, when the same are controverted by <em>any of the tenants </em>in common. <em>Non constat </em>that this deceased proprietor had any objection to the partition, as prayed for. Indeed, his assent is to be presumed from his neglecting to appear and defend after notice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-8-pl-split\"><em>Dexter </em>and <em>Hall </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asv\">Every person interested in the land, of which partition is sought, is to be viewed in the same light as a tenant in a writ of partition at the common law. And thus the statute of 1783 requires personal notice to every person interested, if within the state, and to the attorneys of others, that all may have opportunity to make their exceptions to granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>the same. This Court adhered to this principle in the case of <em>Thomas </em>vs. <em>Smith &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> It is immaterial in what manner the interest is made known to the Court. They will see that no person\u2019s right is passed upon in judgment, without an opportunity of being heard. But the heirs of <em>Matthew Barnard </em>cannot be heard in this cause. They were not proprietors at the time of notice ordered: they have, therefore, never been notified of the petition, and have no right to make themselves parties to the proceeding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-5\">The plea now under consideration was indeed filed with a view to the question, whether this process can be applied to the proprie tors of the Island of <em>Nantucket, </em>in which there are, at this time, more than two million shares. It is a general principle of the common law, that the death of a party to a process abates it: no judgment can be rendered upon it. Nor does the statute, providing this peculiar process, derogate from the principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">The provision of the statute authorizing this process, where the other tenants are unknown, and the manner of giving notice in such case, is merely a grant of a convenience *to [ * 9 ] the party petitioning. But, in truth, every owner of the land is as much a party to the process, in interest, as if actually named in the petition. In the case of <em>Barnard, </em>there is nothing from which it may be inferred that he had not come in on the notice ordered, and was prepared to defend. There has been no default of any one yet entered of record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-7\"><em>Whitman </em>in reply. The judgment upon this process will not affect the rights of any but the parties to it. It is not an adversary suit. The petitioners claim their purparty to hold in severalty. If they are not entitled to what they claim, the respondents who appear can show it as well as all the inhabitants of the island could, if they had individually come in upon the notice. The only defence that any or all of them can make is, either that this land is not holden as an estate in common, or that the petitioners are not entitled to the share which they claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-8\">Perhaps, within the equity of the statute, these heirs of <em>Barnard </em>might have come in ; and it would not have lain in our mouths to say that, at the time of filing the petition, they were not interested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-9\">But if <em>Barnard </em>was yet living, it would be monstrous to say that he had a right to come in and plead at this stage of the process. If he could, each proprietor has a right to come in before judgment; each would have a right to plead severally, and there would never be an end to the suit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b15-9\"><em> </em>[But in <em>Ramsdell </em>vs. <em>Creasy, </em>(post, p. 170,) the defendant, after judgment <em>quod partitio fiat </em>and appointment of commissioners, and after their return of their doings into Court, upon petition suggesting an interest in the premises, was allowed to contest the right of the plaintiff, and the matter was submitted to a jury, and the defendant made out a title to a share in the premises, whereupon the former proceedings were set aside, and a new judgment rendered. \u2014 Ed ]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b17-12\"> 2 <em>Mass.

The deceased had opportunity to appear, if he had chosen to. [ * 10 ] The presumption is, that he had no * objection to the partition prayed for. The judgment in this case will affect the possession only, not the rights of the parties, <footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The immense number of shares, in which many estates in common are holden, as in townships, the lands f the <em>Plymouth Company, </em>and other similar proprieties, besides this of <em>Nantucket, </em>forms a strong argument against the support <em>of </em>this plea. In short, to sustain it would, as to the case before us, and many others often occurring, amount to a virtual repeal of a most useful and convenient provision of law. The plea is adjudged bad, and the respondents must make such further answer as they shall be advised to.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The respondents had also filed two pleas in bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">In the <em>first </em>plea, they deny the right of the petitioners to have the partition prayed for, because that in and by the statute of 1803, c. 121, entitled <em>\u201cAn Act making further provision for the proprietors of the Island of </em>Nantucket,\u201d (the preamble of which act is in the words following, \u00ab\u00bf2.; \u201c Whereas an act, entitled \u2018 An Act for the better managing of lands, wharves, and other real estates lying in common,\u2019 passed the 10th day of March, 1784, hath proved insufficient to restrain disorderly and unruly persons from overstocking their lands on the Island of <em>Nantucket,\u201d') </em>it was, among other things, enacted that the proprietors of the common and undivided lands on the Island of <em>Nantucket </em>should, from and after the passing of said act, meet together some time in March annually, and from time to time, as they should judge proper, to make such rules, and adopt such modes of improvement, as they should think just and equitable ; that said rules and regulations should be determined by a majority of votes; and that each proprietor should vote according to the quantity of land, or rights, which he or she should own therein, and that said votes should be binding on such proprietor. And tire respondents further say, that from the passing of the said act to the present time, the said proprietors have met at said <em>Nantucket </em>some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>time in March annually, and from time to time, as they have judged proper, and have made rules and adopted modes of improvement * for the regulation of their interest in the [ * 11 ] premises, pursuant to the above-recited provisions of the said act, which rules and modes of improvement have been duly entered and recorded by the said proprietors\u2019 clerk, duly chosen and qualified, in their records kept for that purpose; all which they are ready to verify; by reason of all which the said petitioners are by law precluded from having partition, &amp;.c.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-5\">In the second plea in bar, the respondents allege, that the proprietors of the common and undivided lands on the Island of <em>Nantucket </em>are, and, from the time whereof the memory of man is not to the contrary, have been, an ancient body politic and corporate, known by the name of the proprietors of the common and undivided lands on the Island of <em>Nantucket, </em>and, as a body politic and corporate, are, and have been, during all that time, invested with the exclusive right, at their corporate meetings, to divide, dispose, cultivate, feed, manage, and improve, the common and undivided lands aforesaid in such manner as, in their corporate capacity, they should deem just and equitable ; and the said respondents further say that, during all that time, they have, as a body politic and corporate as aforesaid, at their corporate meetings duly convened, exercised the exclusive right of dividing, disposing, cultivating, feeding, managing, and improving, the common and undivided lands aforesaid, in such manner as by them in their said corporate capacity hath been deemed just and equitable; and they further say, that it is not, and that during all the time aforesaid it hath not been, competent for any one or more members of said corporation to have any proportion of the property of said corporation set off or divided to him or them by petition for partition as aforesaid.

Wherefore, for this misdirection of the judge, and because the issue in fact was tried in the county of <em>Suffolk, </em>they prayed that the verdict might be set aside, and a new trial be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">A motion in arrest of judgment was also made by the respondents at this term, on the ground that the petition contains no definite and intelligible description of the land, of which partition is prayed; and that, if judgment for partition should be rendered upon the verdict, the commissioners to be appointed to make partition will, from the defect of metes and bounds, be unable to execute the duties of their appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">This latter motion, and the motion for a new trial, now came on to be argued together, by the same counsel who argued the demurrer upon the plea in abatement.</p>\n<p id=\"Auk\"><em>*For a new trial, </em>it was contended that from the terms of the original grant of the lands in <em>Nantucket, </em>and particularly the last patent of Governor <em>Fungan, </em>it was manifest that these lands were holden by a peculiar tenure, altogether different from an estate in common, as known to the common law. The</p>\n<p id=\"Agb\">grant was to the trustees, as a corporation, in trust for the individual corporators. Although that corporation has ceased to exist, the freeholders of <em>Nantucket </em>are their successors, and from time immemorial have conducted the affairs of the propriety in a manner peculiar to themselves, and different from the management of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>other lands in the commonwealth. The tenure and occupation of the lands are very peculiar. The corporation controls and directs the occupation by the individual freeholders, although each holds his purparty in fee simple by inheritance. The use of each parcel is assigned yearly to the respective freeholders, and in the same parcel one frequently has the right of tillage, and another the agistment or pasturage. Nor is there any reason why these inhabitants should not be protected in the enjoyment of peculiar customs, which are consistent with their patent, which arose from their peculiar habits and employment, having always been devoted to the whale-fishery, and which were fully ratified and confirmed by the government of this then province of <em>Massachusetts Bay, </em>by the act of 5 <em>W. &lt;Sf M. </em>c. <em>2; </em>passed immediately after the annexation of the island by the charter of 1692. The legal estate is now vested in a corporation, and is not subject to partition by any provision of oui laws. Great mischiefs and inconveniences will be felt by these inhabitants, in finding their ancient habits and customs thus broken up. The community will be deranged, and the utmost confusion and disorder follow from a judgment of this Court, that the lands of the corporation are subject to partition.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">If, however, the Court should yet be of opinion that these lands are subject to partition, it is still contended that the trial of this issue.of fact ought by law to be in the county * where the land lies. The statute of 1786, c. 53, $ 2, is [ * 18 ] express and positive as to this point. \u201c The trial of the fact by a jury, whether the petitioner holds in common, in the same proportion he alleges in his petition, or in a lesser proportion, <em>shall be determined in the same county where the land lies, </em>unless the parties shall expressly agree to the contrary,\u201d &amp;c. This provision max-well consist with that of the statute of 1782, c. 57, &lt;\u00a7, 2, giving this Court jurisdiction of appeals, &amp;c., from the courts in <em>Nantucket. </em>But if it were otherwise, the statute of 1786, being posterior, must prevail. It is true the petition may be presented in any county; but the trial of this issue' can be in one only. This process being wholly given by statute, the provisions of the statute must be con formed to.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\"><em>In arrest of judgment, </em>it was contended that the description of the lands was so uncertain, that it would be impossible for commissioners to execute a warrant of partition. If they could by inquiry satisfy themselves of the boundaries of the tract said to be knoxvr by the name of <em>Quaise, </em>and of the situation and quantity of the lands which have heretofore been assigned to sundry persons in severalty, who are not even named, still the respondents have a right that these facts should be tried by the jury. A description so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>loose and uncertain would not be sufficient in trespass, where dam ages only are in question; but certainty is much more necessary where, as in this case, possession is to be given. It is true that parties aggrieved may be heard by the Court upon the return of the commissioners; but the Court are not a jury, nor are they the forum, by which facts involving the rights of the parties are to be settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\"><em>In support of the verdict, </em>it was said that the grant of these lands was in no essential point different from the usual grants to a number of individuals collectively, which always constitute the grantees a proprietary or <em>quasi </em>corporation. The grant was to the individual freeholders, not to the corporation. These are distinct; [ * 19 ] for the freeholders * may inhabit elsewhere, but members of the corporation must be inhabitants of the island. The grant was also confirmed to individuals by the statute of <em>William fy Mary. </em>The peculiar modes of occupying and managing lands by tenants in common cannot be said to take away their right to partition, which, from such peculiarities, may become more necessary to the tenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">The objection that there has been a mistrial has no foundation, if both the statutes referred to are taken in connection. The-statute of 1786 intends only that issues of fact arising upon petitions for partition shall be tried as other issues of fact are to be tried ; that is, in the county where the land lies, if this Court sits in such county; if not, then in the county where this Court sitting has jurisdiction of real actions arising in the county where the land lies. The issues arising in <em>Nantucket </em>causes, brought to this Court by appeal, are always tried in this county. And if the objection is founded, tenants in common of lands, not only in this, but in several other counties, will be deprived of a trial of their rights at the bar of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">As to the ground taken for the motion in arrest of judgment, it was answered that the description was as definite as could be given of the lands in question, and was sufficiently certain for the purpose of a partition. The commissioners will ascertain the bounds and quantities upon their view.</p>\n<author id=\"b26-8-pl-split\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A3_\">The objection to partition of the lands in the Island of <em>Nantucket, </em>in any case, arises from the peculiar phraseology used by the governors of <em>New York </em>in their patents or grants of the island, heretofore within the jurisdiction of that government. The object of the governors seems to have been to prevent individuals from purchasing lands from the aboriginal proprietors, not to create any peculiar tenure. The construction of the grants must be governed by the statute of uses. The right of preemption from the <em>Indians </em>was vested in the corporation; and when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>legal estate was in them, a use was created to the * in- [ * 20 ] habitants and their heirs. Since the statute of 12 <em>Anne, </em>these proprietors have acted as a proprietary, in conformity with the provisions of that statute. The owners of the land are then tenants in common, and as such they are entitled to partition by this process of petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">This Court sits as well for the county of <em>Nantucket </em>as for the county of <em>Suffolk; </em>and, from the necessity of the case, all issues of fact arising in <em>Nantucket </em>must be tried here. If this Court does not sit <em>in </em>the county of <em>Nantucket, </em>it sits here <em>for </em>that county. The issue on this petition must have been tried here, or it could never have been tried at all. The same objection would lie to the trial of issues on petitions for partition of lands in <em>Dukes </em>county, <em>Oxford, Somerset, Washington, Hampden, </em>and <em>Franklin. </em>Such a construction of the statute cannot be yielded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The objection, made in arrest of judgment, that the description of the land in the petition is too loose and uncertain, may be obviated by a plan and survey to be made of the island, which we shall order to be done under the direction of the commissioners. <em>Id cerium est, quod cerium reddi potest. </em><footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> Let the interlocutory judgment be entered, that partition be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Commissioners were appointed by the Court to make the partition prayed for, and their return was accepted and ordered to be recorded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b18-8\"> <em>[Thomas </em>vs. <em>Smith </em>&amp; <em>Al., 2 Mass.

The answer to the petition of the <em>Commons </em>was, u Let the law heretofore in use remain until it shall be otherwise ordained.\u201d 2 <em>Roll. Mr. </em>269, 35\u201440. \u2014 It has been said, that for the same reason that time of memory was limited to the beginning of the reign of <em>Richard </em>1, upon an equitable construction of the statute of <em>Westminster </em>2, it ought now, since 32 <em>Hen. </em>8, c. <em>% </em>to be limited to sixty years, upon a like construction of that statute, or, in Massachusetts, to forty years, according to the statute of 1807, c. 75, sec. 1. \u2014 2 <em>Roll. Mr. </em>269, c. 45. But the construction put upon the statute of <em>Westminster 2, </em>seems to have been much questioned at the time, <em>{Litt. </em>sec. 170. 34 <em>Hen. </em>6, 36,) and not to be very reasonable. In the case of <em>The Prior of Tiheford </em>vs. <em>The Prior of </em>Caldwell, (34 <em>H. </em>6, 36,) the plaintiff in a writ of annuity counted upon a prescription in himself and his predecessors from time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. This prescription the defendant traversed. A deed was produced bearing date in the year 1213, wherein the predecessor of the defendant granted the annuity claimed And a' question arose whether this would maintain the issue. u Suppose,\u201d said Moile, J., u that the jurors should find that the annuity commenced since the time of <em>Richard </em>l,this issue.must be found against the plaintiff/ Jishton, J. u That is not a good verdict, where the issue is joined of the prescription generally. And, sir, in this case, we have nothing to do with the time of King <em>Richard; </em>for notwithstanding the limitation in a writ of <em>Right </em>is fixed to this time, yet in this writ of annuity, or in any other writ where the time of memory is alleged, there is nothing to the purpose of tne statute; for the statute was not made with such intent of a common prescription, but to limit from what time one should allege seisin in a writ of <em>Right,\u201d </em>&amp;c. Prisot, J., however, seemed to think that the statute had fixed the time of memory to which jurors might limit their inquiry. Now, if an unwarrantable construction was put upon the statute of <em>Westminster </em>2, for the relief of jurors, where they were liable to a heavy penalty for a false verdict, there is no good reason for giving an unwarrantable construction also to the statute of <em>Hen. </em>8, or to those statutes whicli have been copied from it. This statute does not confer any right; but only precludes the remedy in certain cases. \u2014 <em>Davenport </em>vs. Tyrrell, 1 <em>Bla. </em>675. \u2014 Lapse of time might be a good answer to a claim against one in possession, when, at the same time, it could furnish no reasonable ground to support a claim of one demanding possession. \u2014See <em>Dane's Abr. </em>3 <em>Roll. </em>c. 79, art. 3, sec. 20,21. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"pAh6\"> <em>[Potter </em>vs. <em>Wheeler, </em>13 <em>Ma.
