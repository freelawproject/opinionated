Afterwards the bargain between A and B was rescinded, of which C had notice; notwithstanding which he sold it to D, a stranger, tailing his promissory note for the value. It was holden, that, by the rescinding of the bargain between A and B, the property was revested in A, wholly discharged from any supposed lien on the part of C, and that the sale to D was wholly void.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">Replevin of twenty-four hogsheads of rum. Issue being joined on the property of the plaintiffs, the same ws tried at the last November term in this county, before <em>Parker, </em>J., and a verdict found for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the following facts reported by the judge, who sat at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">In February, 1810, the plaintiffs were the owners of the rum replevied, it being in the store of <em>Ammi Cutter; </em>when one <em>Phineas Cole </em>agreed to purchase it of <em>Spring, </em>and to pay for it by his note payable in-days, endorsed by <em>William F. Salter, </em>who was a commission merchant in <em>Boston, </em>but was then absent on business at <em>Portland. </em>About the 22d of February, while the rum remained in <em>Cutter\u2019s </em>store, before the note was made, <em>Cutter, </em>wishing to have it removed, informed <em>Cole, </em>who desired <em>Samuel Blake, </em>then occupying a part of <em>Salter\u2019s </em>store, to remove it to that store. <em>Blake </em>called on <em>Cutter </em>for the rum, but he refused to deliver it without an order. <em>Blake, </em>having met <em>Spring </em>and <em>Cole </em>in State Street, told them an order was necessary; and <em>Spring </em>immediately wrote and signed one in the following words: \u201c Please deliver the bearer 24 hogsheads of rum sold <em>Cole.\u201d </em>\u2014 <em>Blake </em>took the rum, and placed eight hogsheads in <em>Salter\u2019s </em>store, eleven in a cellar occupied by <em>Blake </em>himself, and five were sent to some other store. <em>Blake </em>considered himself as acting for <em>Salter, </em>who was absent; and having other rum, which he was about advertising, for sale, asked <em>Cole </em>whether he wished to have this sold; to which he assented, if a cer- [ *32 ] tain price could be obtained; * but it was not sold. <em>Salter </em>returned to <em>Boston </em>about the last of February, and <em>Cole </em>(who had forwarded to him at <em>Portland </em>a note or notes to be endorsed, pursuant to his agreement with <em>Spring, </em>but which had not been received,) informed him of his purchase, and that he had agreed to procure his, <em>Salter\u2019s, </em>endorsement; to which <em>Salter </em>assented. On the 1st of March, <em>Spring </em>came to <em>Salter\u2019s </em>store, and observed to <em>Cole </em>that he had never received a bill of parcels of the mm, and that it would be better to bring the business to a close, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>and requested <em>Cole </em>to call at his lodgings that evening. <em>Cole </em>procured the endorsement of <em>Salter </em>to his note, and carried it to <em>Spring, </em>who expressed doubts of the security, which <em>Cole </em>attempted to remove, suggesting that the endorser was sufficient, if he himself should be unable to pay. <em>Spring </em>said that he had rather give up the bargain, and take the rum again, unless <em>Cole </em>would procure the endorsement of a Mr. <em>Coffin, </em>of <em>Newbwryport. Cole </em>then agreed that, unless he brought the note endorsed by said <em>Coffin </em>that evening, the bargain should be at an end. On returning to his lodgings, having heard of a failure in <em>Salem </em>which would much affect him, he concluded not to ask <em>Coffin </em>to endorse his note, and did not return to <em>Spring. </em>On the next day, <em>Salter </em>called at the lodgings of <em>Cole, </em>who then informed him of the conversation with <em>Spring </em>held the evening before, and gave back to him the. note which he had endorsed, as the consideration for the rum. <em>Salter </em>expressed some regret that <em>Cole </em>had given up the bargain, to which <em>Cole </em>replied by asking whether his note was not worth as much as the rum. <em>Salter, </em>in his business of a commission merchant, had done business to a considerable amount for <em>Cole, </em>and at the time of this transaction was endorser upon his notes for 5000 dollars; but the notes were not then due. There was an unsettled account between them, on which it is now found that a balance of 56 dollars was due from <em>Cole </em>to <em>Salter </em>on the 7th of March. On the day last mentioned, it being ascertained that <em>Cole </em>had failed, <em>Salter </em>caused the rum to be attached as <em>Cole\u2019s </em>property. <em>Spring </em>* came into the store and said the rum was his, that the [ * 33 J bargain between him and <em>Cole </em>was not complete, and that he should replevy it; of which <em>Salter </em>and Mr. <em>Townsend, </em>his attorney, were informed; and <em>Salter </em>said that he knew all about it. The attachment was relinquished, and the officer was desired to leave his man there for an hour or two; when the defendant having come into the store, <em>Salter </em>made a bill of parcels of the rum to him, and received his note for the amount, without an endorser, payable to <em>Salter </em>in ninety days. <em>Salter </em>then procured several trucks to remove the rum to the defendant\u2019s store, and the plaintiffs replevied it, after part of it was in the store, and part was on its passage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">The judge instructed the jury, that if they were satisfied from the evidence that <em>Spring </em>and <em>Cole </em>had agreed to rescind the bargain respecting the rum, and that <em>Salter </em>knew this fact on the day after it took place, he could not convey any title to the rum, by selling it as <em>Cole\u2019s </em>property; that the rescinding of the bargain revested the property in <em>Spring, </em>and that <em>Salter </em>had no control over it, having had no directions or authority from <em>Spring </em>to dispose of it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-6\"><em>Prescott </em>and <em>Townsend, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ais\">argued that, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>sale from <em>Spring </em>to <em>Cole, </em>the property was vested in the latter, and, when placed by him in <em>Salter\u2019s </em>hands for sale, <em>Salter </em>had a lien upon it for the moneys due him from <em>Cole. Salter </em>never assented to the rescinding of the bargain, and therefore never gave up his lien. The defendant, ignorant of all these transactions, found the rum for sale in the hands of a commission merchant, and made a <em>bona fide </em>purchase of it, in which the law will protect him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-5\"><em>The Solicitor-General, </em>and <em>Munroe, </em>for the plaintiffs, were stopped by the Court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b42-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A0o\">When the contract between <em>Spring </em>and <em>Cole </em>was rescinded, its whole effect ceased; it was annihilated. The property remained the plaintiffs\u2019 absolutely, and was discharged from any supposed lien on the part of <em>Salter. </em>As he knew all the [ <em>* </em>34 ] facts, the sale by him to the * defendant was fraudulent, and nothing passed by it. If the defendant has paid the note, which was the consideration for the sale, he has his remedy against <em>Salter </em>for the money, as paid for a consideration which has failed. The plaintiffs may enter judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">[As to the possession and claim of title necessary to a lien, see <em>Wheeler </em>vs. <em>M'Farland, </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>318.\u2014 <em>Saltus </em>vs. <em>Everett, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>267. \u2014 <em>M'Farland </em>vs. <em>Wheeler, </em>26 <em>Wend. </em>467. \u2014 <em>Bryce </em>vs. <em>Brooks, Ibid. </em>367. \u2014 <em>Lloyd </em>vs. <em>Holly, </em>8 <em>Conn. </em>491. \u2014 <em>Townsend </em>vs. <em>Newell, </em>14 <em>Pick. </em>332. \u2014 <em>Buxton </em>vs. <em>Baughan, </em>6 <em>C.
