H.]</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\"><em> </em>[At the common law, the observance of the <em>Sabbath </em>was a duty of imperfect obligation. \u2014 <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Brotherton, </em>2 <em>Str. </em>702. \u2014 By the statute 29 <em>Car. </em>2, <em>Ca </em>7, s. 1, it is enacted \u201c that no tradesman, artificer, workman, laborer, or other person whatsoever, shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business, or work of their ordinary callings, upon the <em>Lord\u2019s day. </em>\u2014 In <em>Drury </em>vs. Defontaine, (1 <em>Taunt. </em>131,) it was decided that the sale of a horse made on <em>Sunday </em>was valid, because not made in the exercise of the <em>ordinary calling </em>of the vendor or his agent. This case is recognized as law in <em>Bloxome </em>vs. <em>Williams, </em>(3 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>232. \u2014 5 <em>D. &amp; R. </em>82,) and <em>Fennell </em>vs. <em>Ridler, </em>(5 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>406. \u2014 8 <em>D &amp; R. </em>204 ;) and although <em>Parkr </em>J., in <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Sparrovi, </em>(4 <em>Bingh </em>88,) said he did not think the decision was right, and that the expression \u201c any worldly labor \u201d could not be confined to a man\u2019s <em>ordinary </em>calling, but applied to any business he might carry on, whether in his ordinary calling or not, yet, in <em>The King </em>vs. <em>The Inhabitants of Whitnash, </em>(7 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>596,) it was confirmed. <em>Bayley, </em>J., in delivering his opinion, said, \u201c If the true construction of the act be that every description of business is prohibited, all contracts whatever, made on <em>Sunday, </em>will be void. I think that was not the intention of the legislature. Religion and piety do not require that every moment of every <em>Sunday </em>should be devoted to the performance of religious exercises ; to a reasonable degree, a man may on that day consider his own condition and that of his neighbor, and may do acts beneficial to himself, and calculated to promote the comfort of his neighbor. 1 am of opinion that this act does not prohibit labor, business, or work, of every description, and that the hiring of a servant by a farmer on <em>Sunday </em>is not work or business, within the act of parliament. I also think it is not labor, t usiness, or work, of the ordinary calling of the farmer.\u201d <em>Holroyd, </em>J., said, \u201c If a farmer sold his corn, or a servant ploughed his land, those would be parts of their ordinary callings.\u201d <em>Littledale, </em>J., said the words \u201c other persons \u201d meant persons <em>ejusdem generis, </em>viz., persons having an ordinary calling. And so it was held in <em>Sandiman </em>vs. <em>Breach, </em>(7 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>100,) where it was decided that these words did not include the owner and driver of a stage-coach. It was an action to recover damage for not conveying the plaintiff in a stage-coach according to agreement made and to be executed on <em>Sunday; </em>and it was held the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages. In <em>Bloxome </em>vs. <em>Williams, </em>ubi sup., <em>Bayley, </em>J., expressed a doubt whether the statute applied to <em>private </em>sales, such as were not open breaches of the <em>Sunday; </em>but, in <em>Fennell </em>vs. <em>Ridler, </em>ubi sup., he said he was satisfied, upon further consideration, that this would be a narrow construction of the act; that there was nothing in the act to show that it was passed exclusively for promoting public decency, and not for regulating private conduct; that labor might be private, and not meet the public eye, and so not offend against public decency; but it was equally labor, and equally interfered with a man\u2019s religious duties; and that the same might be said of business or work. In this case, it was held that the plaintiffs, who were <em>horse-dealers, </em>could not maintain an action on a warranty of a horse given on <em>Sunday. </em>In <em>Bloxome </em>vs. <em>Williams, </em>it was held that a contract for sale and warranty of a horse, coming within the statute of frauds, entered into on <em>Sunday </em>by parole, but not per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>fected by delivery and payment till Tuesday, was not affected by the act respecting the <em>Lora's day. </em>But, in <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Sparrow, </em>ubi sup., <em>Best, </em>C. J., said lie would not say that the mere inception of a contract on <em>Sunday </em>would avoid it, if completed the next day ; but if most of the terms were settled on <em>Sunday, </em>and the mere signature referred to the next day, such a contract could scarcely be supported. This was an action for damages for a breach of contract in not accepting certain nutmegs sold by the plaintiff\u2019s agent on <em>Sunday, </em>at the pressing solicitation of the defendant; the broker at first objecting to deliver the contract until the following day, and leaving a blank in his contract book for the name of the vendor, which was not filled up until Monday, and the sold note was delivered to the plaintiff two or three days afterwards. It was held, that the plaintiff could not sustain his action. <em>Gazelee, </em>J., said, \u201c The plaintiff\u2019s subsequent assent was an assent to the contract made on the Sunday, and there was no evidence to show that there was any subsequent contract.\u201d It is said to have been held in the Circuit Court U. S. in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>that it was no objection to the validity of a deed that it was executed on <em>Sunday, Oct. </em>3821, <em>MSS. </em>But, in <em>Morgan </em>vs. <em>Richards, </em>(1 <em>Brown, P. R. </em>172,) it was held that a contract made on Sun* <em>day </em>was void, by the common law, and as being contrary to the act prohibiting any person from doing or performing \u201c any worldly employment or business whatsoever on the <em>Lord's day.\u201d </em>In <em>Connecticut, </em>by a statutory law, all secular business is forbidden from being done on the <em>Lord's day, </em>or any part thereof; and the courts of that state, from the earliest times, have accordingly adjudged all contracts, whether by parole, or in writing, made or executed on that day, to be void. \u2014 <em>Fox </em>vs. <em>Abel, 2 Conn. Rep </em>548. \u2014 1 <em>Swift's </em>System, 367.\u2014 <em>Wight </em>vs. <em>Geer, </em>1 <em>Root, </em>474.\u2014 Our statute of 1791, c. 58, s. 1, enacts that no person or persons whatsoever shall keep open his, her, or their shop, warehouse, or work-house, nor shall, upon land or water, do any manner of labor, business, or work, (works of necessity and charity only excepted,) on the <em>Lord's day, </em>or any part thereof. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
