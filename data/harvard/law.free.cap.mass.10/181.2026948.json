There was a second count for uttering and publishing the order thus altered; but the attorney-general had entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to this last count during the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-12\">Trial was had at this term, before <em>Sewall, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-13\">The evidence in support of the first count in the indictment was1 the testimony of <em>Sturtevant, </em>who swore that he gave the prisoner the order for five dollars, and that it had been altered. <em>Jonathan Currier </em>testified that the prisoner, in a conversation with him, said that the alteration was made by one <em>Palmer, </em>but that he, the prisoner, was knowing and assenting to it, and that he had been led to the commission of this and many other crimes by <em>Palmer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-14\">Upon this evidence the prisoner being found guilty, <em>Wilde, </em>on his part, moved for a new trial, as on a verdict against evidence. The confession of the defendant, as it was introduced by the government, must be taken as true. Then he neither altered the order, nor caused or procured it to be altered. If he is chargeable upon this evidence with any crime, it must be with aiding or assisting, in the words of the statute, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> upon which the indictment is grounded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADuU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>* Morton, </em>(Attorney-General.)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM1\">This is but a misdemeanor, in which there are no accessaries.

From that confession it must be considered as proved, that he was present and assenting; and, since he alone was to derive benefit from the act, the jury were justified in inferring that he procured it to be done. The evidence was quite sufficient to satisfy the jury that the prisoner committed the crime, either with his own hand, or by the hand of another; and there is no ground for setting aside their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The motion for a new trial was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">[See <em>Cayford\u2019s </em>case, <em>7 Greenl. 57__Vance </em>vs. <em>Vance, </em>8 <em>Greenl. </em>132. \u2014 <em>Ham &amp; </em>ease, 2 <em>Fairf. </em>391. \u2014 F.
