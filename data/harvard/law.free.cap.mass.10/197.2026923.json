Bird, D. Insp.,\u201d </em>at six dollars per barrel, being the full price of good and wholesome beef of that quality, and have received payment for the same at that price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-5\">The plaintiffs transported the same from <em>Boston </em>to <em>Bath, </em>and exported four barrels thereof, being ignorant of its state and condition, to <em>Madeira </em>for a market; and would have exported the whole, had not the accidental bursting of a barrel, in lading it, discovered its unfitness for use. Twenty-one barrels, on inspection and examination- at <em>Bath, </em>were discovered to have been packed without suffi cient salt and pickle to preserve the same, and were not packed, in any respect, except in external appearance, according to the <em>brand, </em>and were unwholesome and unfit for use. Of this the plaintiffs immediately gave the defendants notice. The four barrels sent to <em>Madeira </em>were there discovered to be bad and unwholesome, and were returned to the plaintiffs on that account, and lost by them, after having been sold at sixteen dollars per barrel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">It was also agreed that the said beef was sent to the defendants from <em>Falmouth, </em>branded by a regular inspector, to sell on commission ; that they were agents for the owners in making the sale, and did not know, at the time of the sale and delivery, that the beef was bad and unwholesome, and not packed according to law. But they did not inform the plaintiffs that they were agents in making the sale; and their bill of the same was made in their [ * 198 ] own names, and receipted * by them; and the note, taken in payment for the same, was payable to them ; and the plaintiffs were still, at the time of stating the facts, ignorant of any other owners thereof than the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, the defendants agreed to be defaulted, and that judgment should be rendered against them for a sum fixed, with costs; otherwise the plaintiffs agreed to become nonsuit, and that the defendants should recover their costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-8\"><em>Mellen, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEZ\">contended that, in the sale <em>o\u00ed provisions, </em>the law always implies a warranty that they are sound and wholesome ; and where they are not, it gives this action. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In the case at bar, particularly, there was an implied warranty that the quality of the beef was such as the brand designated, since a fair price was paid for it as such. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> It was the duty of the defendants to know the quality or kind of goods they sold; and it is more reasonable in every case, whether the sale be by a factor or a principal, that the vendor should suffer for the defect in the article sold than the vendee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number><em>Orr, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqzo\">The case negatives any knowledge, on the part of the defendants, of the unsoundness of the beef; there was no express warranty ; and such a one alone extends to defects unknown to the seller. If the action be laid in deceit, a <em>scienter </em>must be alleged and proved. The deceit is the <em>gravamen, </em>the <em>scienter, </em>the gist. If the buyer be deceived without the knowledge of the seller, it is his own folly not to exact a warranty at the time of sale, \u2014a security which he may always require, and thus render the seller liable in all events. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> If the vendor sells the thing as he believes it to be, without fraud, the law implies no further responsibility than he has voluntarily taken upon himself. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> But it is contended, for the plaintiff, that <em>provisions </em>are an exception to the general law on this subject. The authorities cited do not come up to the position assumed. It is in neither of them stated that a knowledge of the unsoundness is to be dispensed with upon an implied warranty; and * other authorities are [*199] conclusive upon this point. But if such exception exists, it is inapplicable to the case at bar. It is laid down by the Court, in the case of <em>Roswel </em>vs. <em>Vaughan,- </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> that the reason why an action lies for selling <em>\u201c </em>victuals which is corrupt \u201d is because it is against the commonwealth. By the statute of 1799, c. 69, the government has regulated the preparation of beef as an article of export. By the second section, the inspector-general is made answerable for the doings of his deputies. He is so to any purchaser who may detect a fraud in inspecting. Every purchaser is to take it for what it purports to be, on the faith of the brand, as an article truly represented under the authority of the law. The reason, therefore, of the common law authorities, if they were pertinent, wholly fails, and with it the law itself making a distinction as to provisions.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-5\"><em>Mellen, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATI\">The ancient authorities differ as to the necessity of the <em>scienter, </em>and of an express warranty in contracts of sale generally. But as to the sale of provisions, it is well settled, that, where the article sold is different from what it is represented to be, an implied warranty is always understood. It is very plain, in the present case, that the defendants received the plaintiffs\u2019 money for an article which they did not sell. They ought, then, to refund it. The remedy against the inspector is tedious and uncertain. The beef may have been altered since the inspection. The defendants themselves may have done it. If not, they may trace it back to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>faulty person. If, in truth, it was the officer\u2019s fault, those by whom he was employed have their remedy against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-5\">The action being continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, the opinion of the Court was delivered at the following term in <em>Berkshire, </em>by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b204-9\"> 3 <em>Black.

There is, then, an injury, for which the law affords a remedy. <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In applying this rule, there has been some diversity of opinions, as to the cases within it. The rule has not been varied; but the decisions have not been uniform, as to the facts and circumstances from which a wilful and actual deception are, in particular cases, to be presumed and considered as proved. Where the sale has been accompanied with a warranty, the remedy of the purchaser is maintained upon other principles. It is for a deception, or mistake, amounting to a breach of a contract, \u2014 a contract which may be said to be collateral to the sale, by force of which the purchase is placed at the risk of the seller, as to every existing defect in the qualities of the articles sold, so far as the warranty applies. <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> The general doctrine, as it has ever since been recognized in practice, is accurately exemplified by Justice <em>Popharn </em>in the case of the Bezoar stone, as cited in <em>Dyer. </em><footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark> The case is reported by <em>Croke, </em>and was referred to by the defendants\u2019 counsel in the case at bar. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Justice <em>Popharn </em>states the rule thus: If I have an article, which is defective, whether victuals, or any thing else, and I, knowing it to be defective, sell it as sound, and so represent or affirm it, an action upon the case lies for the deceit; but although it be defective, if that is unknown to me, although I represent or affirm it to be sound, yet no action lies, unless I warrant it to be sound. To be liable to an action for the deceit incurred, the affirmation or representation of the seller is to be proved ; and it must appear that he had been therein wilfully and intentionally false. Now, there are cases in which a representation wilfully false is to be presumed from the circumstances of the transaction and of the parties, when it is not required to be otherwise or directly proved. In this way perhaps what was cited from <em>Blackstone\u2019s </em>Commentaries, and relied on for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the plaintiff, in the argument of the case at bar, may be reconciled with the general doctrine as I have stated it; and so likewise many decisions, which seeni at first sight to indicate another rule, will be found within the general doctrine exemplified by Justice <em>Popham, </em>at least in the intended application of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">* Justice <em>Blacksione </em><footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark> has classed the cases of deceit [ * 201 ] and breaches of express warranties, in contracts for sales, under the head of implied contracts. He says it is constantly understood that the seller undertakes that the commodity he sells is his own; and in contracts for provisions, it is always implied that they are wholesome ; and in a sale with warranty, the law annexes a tacit contract that, if the article be not as warranted, compensation shall be made to the buyer; and if the vendor knows his goods to be unsound, and hath used any art to disguise them, or if they be in any shape different from what he represents them to be to the buyer, this artifice shall be equivalent to an express warranty, and the vendor is answerable for their goodness.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">It is obvious that, in this very general classification, the details and examples are imperfectly introduced, and with some inaccuracy. It is not implied, in every sale of provisions, that they are wholesome, any move than it is in sales of other articles, where proof of a distinct affirmation seems, in Justice <em>Blacksione\u2019s </em>opinion, to be requisite. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The contrary may be, and often is, understood between the parties; and it is only when the false representation, to be proved in the one case, may be presumed or taken to be proved in the other, that the rule of law applies, and the remedy, as in a case of deceit, is allowed. An artifice must be proved, to entitle the suffering party to the remedy, equivalent to a remedy upon an express warranty, as well in the case of provisions, as in any other case. The difference is, that, in the case of provisions, the artifice is proved, when a victualler sells meat as fresh to his customers at a sound price, which at the time was stale and defective, or unwholesome from the state in which the animal died. For, in the nature of the bargain, the very offer to sell is a representation or affirmation of the soundness of the article, when nothing to the contrary is expressly stated ; and his knowledge of the falsehood in this representation is also to be presumed from the nature and duties of his calling and trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">But cases may be supposed where, this presumption being repelled by contrary evidence, the seller would not be * liable ; as where a different representation made; and [ * 202 ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>this is proved directly, or is necessarily to be presumed from the nature of the article, the state of the market, or other circumstances. Indeed, there is nothing to be inferred in a sale of provisions which may not be inferred, to a like purpose, in other cases, where the calling or profession of the seller, the soundness of the price, and the nature of the article sold, have been made the grounds of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">There is an especial and invariable presumption as to the <em>property </em>of the vendor, where the article sold was in his possession; and hence the distinction, when the article is, and when it is not, in his possession. And, upon the whole, it will be found, I believe, in every instance, that the action as for a deceit has been maintained in those cases only where an affirmation or representation wilfully false, or some artifice, has been proved, or has been taken to be proved, either directly, or because it was necessarily to be presumed from the circumstances and nature of the bargain, and the situation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6-pl-split\">It is admitted, in the case at bar, that, in the bargain between these parties, there was no direct affirmation of the soundness of the article. Perhaps, however, a representation to this effect is necessarily to be implied from the nature of the bargain, it being in the common course of dealing, and for a sound price, and for an article which, to be of any value, must be understood to be sound. Thus much, at least, may be safely presumed, as the understanding between these parties, that, as to the kind, the quality, the state, and quantity, of the meat contained in the barrels sold by the one, and purchased by the other, as barrels of merchantable beef, the seller undertook to have full faith in the brand of the deputy inspector, a public officer employed and intrusted to ascertain these facts. The seller must be understood to represent that, for aught he had known to the contrary, the brand appearing on the barrels had been truly and faithfully applied, and that no alteration or change of the article had happened within his knowledge. Now, is there any evidence, or any circumstance in this transaction, from which it may be inferred that; in an affirmation to this effect, [ * 203 ] * the sellers would have been wilfully false, or that, in an express representation, such as I have supposed to be implied in this case, they would have been guilty of an artifice ? They would have been chargeable to that extent, if, at the time of the sale, they had any knowledge of the bad state of the barrels, such as it proved to he, or .had any special reason to suspect that the beef in them had not been properly cured, was without sufficient salt, was already in a putrid state, or becoming putrid, or, in short, if they then knew, or actually suspected, that, in this instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the inspector had been false, ignorant, or depraved. With evidence to that effect, this case would be within the rule, and the plaintiffs entitled to this remedy for the deception, which they undoubtedly suffered, and from which a loss and damage have ensued. But on this point the evidence fails. Indeed, it is admitted that the defendants had no knowledge, at the time of the sale, of the unsuitable quality and state of the beef, or of the barrels containing <em>it; </em>or that it had not been packed as the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In this state of the evidence and of the case, the result is in favor of the defendants. Against them the plaintiffs have no remedy for the loss and damage sustained by a deception which has not happened, or been effected by any false representation or artifice chargeable to the defendants ; and they took upon them no extraordinary risk in this particular by any warranty accompanying the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The plaintiffs are to become nonsuit, and judgment is to be entered, for the defendants to recover their costs, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">[See <em>Osgood </em>vs. <em>Lewis, </em>2 <em>Har. &amp; G. </em>495.\u2014 <em>Hyatt </em>vs. <em>Boyle, </em>5 <em>Gill &amp;. </em>110.-<em>-Franklin </em>vs. Long, 7 <em>Gill &amp;. 407.\u2014Executors, </em>&amp;c., vs. Edwards, 2 <em>Bail </em>306.\u2014 <em>Davis </em>vs. <em>Hunt, </em>2 <em>Bait. </em>413. \u2014 <em>Fuller </em>vs. <em>Fowler, </em>1 <em>Bail </em>75. \u2014 <em>Carnochan </em>vs. <em>Gould,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">I <em>Bail </em>179. \u2014 <em>Smith </em>vs. <em>Rice, </em>1 <em>Bail. </em>648. \u2014 <em>Baird </em>vs. <em>Matthews, </em>6 <em>Dana, </em>129.\u2014 <em>King </em>vs. <em>Barker, </em>1 <em>Yerg. </em>450.\u2014 <em>Shenault </em>vs. <em>Eaton, 4 Yerg. </em>98.\u20145 <em>Yerg. </em>265.\u2014 <em>Morehead </em>vs. <em>Gayle, </em>2 <em>St. </em>&amp; <em>P. </em>224. \u2014 <em>Cozzins </em>vs. <em>Whitaker, </em>3 <em>St. &amp; P. </em>322. \u2014 <em>Ricks </em>vs. <em>Dillahunty, </em>8 <em>Por. 133.\u2014Hogan </em>vs. <em>Thorington, </em>8 <em>Por. </em>428.\u2014 <em>West </em>vs. <em>Cunningham, </em>9 <em>Por. </em>104. \u2014 <em>Barnett </em>vs. <em>Stanton, </em>2 <em>Alab.
