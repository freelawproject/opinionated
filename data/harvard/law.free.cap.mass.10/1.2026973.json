The bills in question were drawn by <em>Robert Fields, </em>on the 9th of January, 1809, upon <em>Frederick Dawson, </em>of <em>Mile-End-Road, London, </em>payable, in sixty, days after sight, to said <em>William Leverett </em>or order, and, on the 19th of January aforesaid, sold to the plaintiff in <em>New York, </em>through the agency of a Mr. <em>Willard, </em>of <em>Boston, </em>who transmitted them to the plaintiff, the said <em>Leverett </em>having endorsed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>them, and having received five per cent, advance on the face thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-5\">On the 27th of the same January, the plaintiff remitted the [ * 2 ] * bills to his correspondents in <em>London, </em>who received the same on the 25th of the ensuing March; and on that and the succeeding day, the clerks of the merchants in <em>London </em>made diligent search for <em>Lawson, </em>the drawee, but were unable to gain any intelligence of him : on the contrary, they ascertained that there had been no such person as <em>Frederick Lawson </em>at <em>Mile-End-Road. </em>On the 1st of April, the bills were carried to a notary, who <em>noted </em>the same for non-acceptance; but there was no evidence that any <em>protest </em>for non-acceptance was ever made, except what arises from a letter to the plaintiff from Messrs. <em>Holford &amp;/\u25a0 Gonne, </em>merchants of <em>London, </em>to whom the said bills had been remitted, dated the 5th of April, 1809, stating, among other things, that, in the course of their inquiries, they had called on Messrs. <em>Thomas Murdock &amp;/\u25a0 Co., </em>who offered to take up the bills, at their maturity, for the honor of the plaintiff, and had delivered to them the protest in form, &amp;c. This letter was received by the plaintiff on the 9th of June, 1809, and the contents thereof immediately communicated to Mr. <em>Willard </em>in <em>Boston, </em>and by him to <em>Leverett, </em>the endorser. On the 3d of June, 1809, the bills were duly protested for non-payment, and were taken up and paid by said <em>Murdock 8f Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-6\">On the 19th of June, <em>Murdock &amp;f Co. </em>wrote the plaintiff that the bills had been protested for non-payment, and that the bills and protest were forwarded ; and upon receipt of this letter, information was immediately communicated to Mr. <em>Willard, </em>and by him to <em>Leverett. </em>No protest came to hand with said letter; and the only evidence that a protest was forwarded, except what arises from said letter, was contained in the deposition of <em>John P. Glen, </em>clerk to\" Messrs. <em>Murdock Sf Co., </em>stating that it appeared by their letter-book, and was verily believed by the witness, that on the said 19th of June, a letter was written by them to the plaintiff, enclosing the said bills, and regular protests, and advising that the said bills had been paid by them under protest, for the honor of the plaintiff; and that the said letter was sent to the general post-office in <em>London, </em>[ * 3 ] in duplicate, * one to be forwarded by the packet, and the other by a private ship ; and that the said <em>Murdock Co., </em>on the 5th of December, 1809, having learned, by a letter from the plaintiff, that the said bills and protests had not been received by him, duplicates thereof were then immediately forwarded to him by the packet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-8-pl-split\">It was in evidence that the usual intercourse between the <em>United States </em>and <em>Great Britain </em>was interrupted at the time the bills were taken up as aforesaid ; but that a packet, carrying a mail, sailed every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>month from <em>England, </em>being advertised for the first Wednesday of each month, and usually sailing within a week or ten days after that time. It was also proved that none of the monthly mails from <em>England </em>by the packets had been missing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-5\">The duplicate of the bills and protest forwarded on the 5th of December, 1809, was received in March, 1810, by the plaintiff, sent to Mr. <em>Willard, </em>and by him communicated to <em>Leverett.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-6\">The bills, when drawn by <em>Fields, </em>were negotiated by <em>Benjamin Leverett, </em>brother of the deceased, and one half of the amount was paid to <em>Fields, </em>the other half being retained, with a view to ascertain whether they would be accepted. The money so received had been paid over to the plaintiff, upon an agreement that the payment should not affect the question between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-7\"><em>Fields, </em>the drawer, was insolvent before the drawing of these bills, although at that time he had some property, and a credit at one of the banks in <em>Boston. </em>In November, 1809, his furniture was attached, and his credit totally gone. Soon after the bills were negotiated by <em>Leverett, </em>he expressed some apprehension that they would not be accepted; as other bills drawn by <em>Fields </em>had been '\u2022eturned protested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted, 1. That the plaintiff ought not to recover, without producing a protest for non-acceptance, and notice thereof to the endorser; and, 2. That the delay in notifying the endorser of the non-acceptance and non-payment had discharged him from all liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-9\">* The jury were instructed that any unreasonable delay [ * 4 ] m notifying the non-acceptance or non-payment was fatal to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, notwithstanding the bill had been taken up for his honor; that a protest for non-acceptance was not necessary to be produced, if the endorser had otherwise due notice that the bills were not accepted; but that the delay from the 3d to the 19th of June, before any letter or other information was sent of the nonpayment, was laches, which discharged the endorser; unless they were satisfied that such delay was occasioned by difficulties in com munication, which could not be removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b11-10\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, which the defendant moved to set aside, as being against law and evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b11-11\"><em>Selfridge </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6\">The holder of these bills was guilty of laches in employing his clerks to present the bill, instead of a ' notary, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> or in not employing a notary until three days after the bill was received; and the case shows that he then made the protest for facts which were not within his knowledge. There were laches</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>also in delaying to give the necessary information ; by which delay the opportunity of a packet was lost, and thus the information was received here a month later than it might and ought to have peen. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The same delay again took place in forwarding the protest for non-acceptance.. What is reasonable notice, is said, by Lord <em>Mansfield, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> to be partly a question of fact, and partly a question of law. Then, when the facts are agreed, it must be wholly a question of law. There was no protest for non-accep'tance produced at the trial, which is necessary to support this action. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b12-5\"><em>Welsh </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab\">There was sufficient evidence to satisfy the jury that the bills were regularly protested for non-acceptance. It was not necessary to produce the protest at the trial; noi at any time to produce it to the endorser; so that notice of the non-acceptance was forwarded, and duly given to him. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> The defendant had a right of action against the drawer immediately on [ * 5 ] notice * of the non-acceptance.

This payment did not vary the duties of the holder.

But the sum in dispute being very small, and the parties unwilling to incur the expense of a special verdict, the recommendation of the court was not attended to, and the case was not mentioned again \u2014 1 <em>Selw. </em>p. 360, 5th ed. \u2014 <em>Starkie, </em>in his treatise on Evidence, lays it down as law, <em>that11 </em>where the drawer resides abroad, the notice of the non-acceptance should be accompanied by a copy, or some other memorial, of the protest; for otherwise he cannot know of the protesting. But if he resides here, although at the time of the dishonor he be abroad, or if lie has returned to this country previous to the dishonor of the bill, notice of dishonor is sufficient; for he can make inquiry as to the protest \u201d \u20142 <em>Starkie on Ev. </em>265 \u2014 He cites <em>Goosetrey </em>vs. <em>Mead, Bul. </em>N.

Mr. Thomson, in reference both to the <em>English </em>and <em>Scotch </em>law, says, \u201c It is not now held necessary that notice should be accompanied by the bill, or by the principal, or a copy of the protest, even in the case of a foreign bill. <em>It does not even seem requisite to mention that there has been a protest, </em>when the person receiving the notice is in this country at the time of the dishonor; as he may, in that case, ascertain this fact, although it should not be notified to him. But if he is abroad, <em>the fact of a protest having been taken, ought to be mentioned </em>in the notice, since he cannot otherwise be supposed to be aware of it. If he afterwards require a copy of the protest, it must be sent to him.\u201d\u2014 <em>Thomson on Bills, </em>pp. 505, 506, 507.
