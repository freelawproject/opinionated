Upon a trial, which was had at the same term before Thatcher, J., the jury found the said <em>John </em>guilty; and as to the said <em>Elizabeth, </em>they found specially, \u2014 \u201c that she committed the assault and battery charged in the indictment, in company with, and commanded by the said <em>John Neal, </em>her husband. And if this in law will make her guilty, then the jury find her guilty ; but if being in company with and commanded by her husband will justify or excuse her in law, then the jury find that the said <em>Elizabeth Neal </em>is not guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">The indictment was continued to this term for judgment upon this verdict; and now</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\"><em>Whitman </em>argued that the wife, acting under the direction and coercion of the husband, was not personally liable to conviction and punishment, and this immunity extends to every case, except those of keeping a bawdy house and a gaming house. The jury have found that the wife, in this case, acted by the command of her husband. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b162-9\"><em>Morton, </em>('Attorney-General,) for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj4\">The law excuses the wife only in cases where she may be supposed ignorant of the criminality of the act; as in larceny, &amp;c., she may not know in whom the property of the goods is. The husband\u2019s commands are no excuse for her where she must know, as well as he, that the action is wrong; as in the case at bar, where she could not be ignorant that it was unjustifiable to beat and wound her neighbor. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\"> 4 <em>Black.

To this general rule, there are certain exceptions, as of crimes forbidden by the law of nature, which are <em>mala in fe, </em>and some where the wife may be presumed the principal agent. The case at bar is not within the exceptions, and <em>Elizabeth Neal </em>is not guilty, and must therefore be discharged, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">[A married woman, living apart from her husband, may be indicted alone, and pun ished, for keeping a house of ill fame.\u2014 <em>Com. </em>vs. <em>Lewis, </em>1 <em>Metc. </em>181. \u2014 F.
