If, in the opinion of the Court, this objection ought to prevail, the verdict was to be set aside ; otherwise it was to stand, and judgment be rendered upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-11\">A the last October term, the verdict being set aside by consent, tne parties entered into a rule of Court referring the action to three persons named in the rule, and agreeing that the referees should have power to go into a consideration of the whole subject matter of the action, as fully as if the same had been referred to them at the first term in which it was entered, and that final judg inent should be entered on their report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>At the last April term, the referees made a report in the plaintiffs\u2019 lavor, and a motion was made, on the part of the plaintiffs, for its acceptance, which being opposed by the defendants, the action was continued to this term, for the consideration of the said motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-5\">And now <em>Ward, </em>of counsel for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ_\">contended that the referees had mistaken the law, for that, by the provisions of the fourth section of the statute of 1786, c. 10, the action was maintainable only against the first parish. That section enacts that, <em>\u201c </em>where any town, consisting of but one parish only, has been or shall be divided or made into two or more parishes, any contracts entered into by such town, before such division, if of a parochial nature only, shall not be considered as extinguished by such division ; but shall remain in force against the inhabitants and estates lying within the first parish, who shall be deemed the successors of the town, so far as relates to parochial agreements and contracts, to every intent and purpose whatever.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-6\">* <em>Draper, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT1\">relied on the proviso at- [ * <em>432 </em>] tached to the same section of the statute, by which it is enacted that debts of a parochial nature, that are or shall be in fact due and owing from any town, before a division thereof into parishes, for services actually performed, for the general benefit of the persons who shall after be included in each of the parishes, shall in no respect be altered, or devolved on the first parish, as the successors of the town in its parochial capacity.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam,.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A6W\">The objection to the report of the referees, in this case, rests upon a mistaken construction of the statute in question. The fourth section of that statute is very obscure in its terms, and very difficult of explanation. The first part of the section provides that, upon a division of a town into several parishes, all engagements or contracts made before the division, of a parochial nature only, shall remain in force against the first parish only, meaning the parish which is left after the new parish is set off. And the second part, in the form of a proviso, enacts that all debts of a parochial nature, in fact due and owing before a division, for services or other matters actually done and performed for the general benefit, &amp;c., shall not be altered or devolved upon the first parish; intending, as we suppose, that such contracts shall remain chargeable upon the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">It is supposed by the defendants that, because the meeting-house, for some part of the expense of building which this action is brought, is within the limits of the first parish, the building of it was not for the general benefit of persons living in each of the pansnes; and therefore, not coming within this last branch of the section, is included within the first, which makes the first parish liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>But the defendants are mistaken. The meeting-house, being built in pursuance of a vote of the town, before any division was made, must be considered as being for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the town <em>at that time. </em>And it would be a very \u2022 [ * 433 ] inequitable provision, that, after a town had * built a meeting-house, of a size equal to the accommodation of the whole town, and at a proportionate expense, a disaffected part should be permitted to be set off, and rid themselves of their proportion of the burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We think the services for which this action was brought were for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the town, within the intent of the section of the statute we have been considering, and so were not chargeable to the first parish only, but to the town, agreeably to the proviso of said section. The referees proceeded upon this <em>principle; </em>and therefore we see no legal objection to their report; which is accepted, and judgment is to be entered accordingly, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">ADDITIONAL.
