Sergeant <em>Bina Hayt, </em>\u2014 You are hereby ordered to warn the company under my command to appear at the usual place of parade on Fort Hill, on Tuesday, the 16th inst., at 1 o\u2019clock, P. M., armed and equipped for company duty <em>James B. Marston, </em>captain,\u201d) requested said <em>Peabody </em>to * give information of the names of persons residing [ * 37 ] with him liable as aforesaid, which said <em>Peabody </em>then and there refused to do; and the said <em>Hayt </em>further saith, that there then resided in said <em>Peabody\u2019s </em>boarding-house divers persons so liable, which said <em>Peabody </em>well knew, but whose names were un known to said <em>Hayt; </em>whereby, and by force of the law aforesaid, an action had accrued to said <em>Hayt </em>to have and demand of said <em>Peabody </em>the sum of twenty dollars; and the said <em>Peabody, </em>then and there, in consideration of the premises, became liable, and in consideration thereof promised the said <em>Hayt </em>to pay him the said sum on demand ; yet, though requested, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">Upon the general issue of <em>non assumpsit, </em>joined in the court below, a verdict was found for the plaintiff, and judgment rendered thereon, for the sum of twenty dollars and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-7\">The plaintiff in error assigned the following errors:\u20141. That the action was <em>assumpsit, </em>instead of case. \u2014 2. That it does not appear, from the said declaration, that <em>Hayt </em>had any orders from his commanding officer to make application to <em>Peabody </em>for the names of persons boarding with him, but only to warn the company under his command, <em>viz., </em>such persons as were actually enrolled in the company. \u2014 3. That it is not set forth in the said declaration for whose use the- action was brought, nor how the forfeiture, if recovered, was to be appropriated. \u2014- 4. That the issue tried in the action was immaterial. \u2014 5. The general error, under which he shows that there is no allegation in the said declaration, that the facts charged therein are against the form of the statute.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-8\">The defendant in error pleads <em>in nullo est erratum.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b45-9\"><em>Fuller </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKV\">The statute gives the clerk of the company an action of the case for the forfeiture. This could never intend an action upon an <em>assumpsit, </em>for which there is no consideration, and between which and case for a tort there is a very wide distinction. The penalty is given, when the keeper of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>boarding-house refuses information when applied to for that purpose by the commanding officer of the company, or by [ * 38 ] any person acting under the * orders of such commanding officer. The orders here must intend orders for this special purpose. Enrolment must precede a warning to appear at a muster, but the clerk had no authority to enroll, which belongs exclusively to the commander of the company. The clerk\u2019s authority to warn could not then extend to any boarders in <em>Peabody\u2019s </em>house, who had not been previously enrolled. The statute gives one fourth only of the penalties prescribed by it to the clerk, and the residue is to be paid over to the commanding officer. It is essential that this be stated in a declaration for a penalty. This being in its nature an action for a tort, the issue should have been <em>not guilty; </em>and the issue of <em>non assumpsit </em>is wholly immaterial. And in such an action it is essential that the fact or omission be alleged to be <em>contra formam statuti. </em><footnotemark><em>(2)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-5\"><em>Whitman </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEp\">The allegation of a promise to pay may be rejected as surplusage. The order to warn all persons liable included the authority to demand the names of inmates in boarding-houses; as without their names they could never be warned. The thirty-seventh section of the statute directs how the clerk is to distribute the fines and penalties; but it is his right and duty to collect them. If he neglects or refuses to pay them over, an action lies against him ; but this is nothing to the person who has incurred a forfeiture. The issue is not immaterial, but merely informal ; and this is cured, as are all the defects suggested, by the verdict, and particularly the omission of <em>contra formam statuti. </em>The jury, having found the promise, have thereby found every thing necessary to give it validity and binding force.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b44-17\"> <em>Stat. </em>1809, c. 10S.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\"> 2 <em>East's C.

This inquiry he may make by another; but in that case he must give a special authority for the purpose, and the person making the inquiry, if another than the commanding officer, must produce his authority, or the keeper of the boardinghouse is not bound to give the information required. This is a very distinct service from that of warning the members of a company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>already enrolled to attend a muster. Perhaps both services might be performed at the same time; but the delegating a power to enroll soldiers is a different thing from ordering the company to be warned, and ought not commonly to be intrusted to a warrant officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The action was misconceived. The statute gives an action upon the case for a tort, but no <em>assumpsit </em>is implied.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">When a penalty is given by statute, and a civil action is provided for its recovery, it is essential, not only to set forth the provision of the statute, as was done in the case before us, but there must be a direct allegation that the offence, for which the penalty is given, was committed against the form of the statute, &amp;c. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The declaration was also essentially defective in this case, in that it did not set forth the uses to which, by the statute, the penalty is appropriated. The clerk could not recover it to his own use; and if he did, the other person or persons entitled would have no remedy against him for their shares of the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\"><em> [Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Inhabitants of </em>Stockbridge, 11 <em>Mass.
