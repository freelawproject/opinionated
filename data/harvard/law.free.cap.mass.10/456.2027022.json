In April, 1810, <em>Hezekiah </em>Maynard, the demandant, called upon <em>Benjamin Rice, </em>Esq., who is a subscribing witness to the execution of the deed, and the magistrate before whom it was acknowledged, and told him he wished to make some provision for his son <em>Abel, </em>and requested the witness to write a deed of the land, being part of the demandant\u2019s farm, which is described in the deed. This was done by the witness, who read it to the demandant, and he was satisfied with it. A few days afterwards, he called *on the witness, and signed, sealed, and ac- [*457] knowledged, the deed; and he requested the witness to take it to the register\u2019s office, and get it recorded. The witness carried it to the register accordingly, procured it to be recorded, and, in May following, received it back. The witness informed the demandant of this, who told him it was right, and requested him to keep the deed until it was called for. <em>Abel, </em>the son, was never present at any of these transactions, nor did it appear that he ever knew of the execution of the deed. About a year afterwards, <em>Abel </em>died, and, soon after he was buried, the demandant called upon the witness for the deed, which was given to him, he then saying that he supposed he had a right to do as he pleased with it; and then cut his name and seal from it. It was proved that <em>Abel, </em>the son, lived upon the farm with the demandant, his father, and carried it on with his labor, and supported his family upon it. It was also proved, by several witnesses, that the demandant, in conversation after the execution of the deed, considered the land as his son\u2019s property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">The judge instructed the jury that there were no facts proved in the case which, in law, could amount to a delivery of the deed to <em>Abel; </em>so that the conveyance was not perfect, and the demandant must recover possession. A verdict was accordingly returned for the demandant, which the tenants moved might be set aside, and a new trial be granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-6\"><em>Prescott, </em>for the tenants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN6\">contended that the delivery of the deed to <em>Rice </em>might be considered as a constructive delivery to the grantee. It seems uncertain, from the report, who was to call on <em>Rice </em>for the deed. It might be the son, and his death may have prevented it. In that case, it may be considered as an escrow, to take effect when it should be called for by the son. The facts would support a construction, that this was a covenant to stand oeised to the use of the grantor for life, remainder to the use of the son and his heirs. If, by any construction, the law cnn give effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>to the deed, the Court will incline to such construction, for the benefit of the widow and orphan children, who are the tenants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-5\"><em>Bigelow </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AMS\">* <em>Per Curiam.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AEH\">It is very clear that there was no delivery of this deed, so as to give it the effect of passing the estate from the demandant to his son, as whose widow and heirs the tenants claim. The act of registering a deed does not amount to a delivery of it; there not appearing any assent on the part of the son, or even any knowledge that the deed had been executed in his favor, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> A delivery of a deed, duly executed and acknowledged, to the Register of deeds, aided by a subsequent possession of the deed by the grantee, might be evidence of a delivery to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">But the facts in the case at bar, testified by the person who acted as the scrivener and magistrate, leave no doubt of the intention of the grantor ultimately to pass this land to his son, but to keep the control over it until he should be more determined upon the subject. He may have chosen to place the deed, perfect as it was, except as to delivery, in the hands of the witness, in lieu of a devise, to operate after his decease ; for nothing was wanting to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>complete effect but to direct the witness to deliver it to his son after his own decease. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> He probably chose to consider it as revocable a-t all times by himself, in case of any important change in his family or estate. Whatever may have been his views, however, he retained an authority over it; and having reclaimed and cancelled it, the tenants can claim no title under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Whether a creditor of his son might not have taken it in satisfaction of a debt, in consequence of the credit given by putting such an apparent title upon record, and especially as the son was in actual possession of the premises, need not now be determined. We are satisfied that the title never passed out of the demandant, and that he is therefore entitled to a recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">[A grantor, upon signing a deed, put it before the grantee, saying, \u201c There is no go back from that,\u201d and the witnesses then attested it; a note, which was to be the con sideration of the deed, was not handed to the grantor, but the two papers were taken up by the grantee, and the parties went to a magistrate, that he might take the acknowledgment, which was thereupon taken and certified, but the grantor withheld the deed from the grantee, who did not then assert or claim that it had been previously delivered. The grantor, in his answer to a bill in equity, denies any delivery. Held, no delivery was proved <em>\u2014Mills </em>vs. Gore, 20 <em>Pick. </em>28.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The grantor in a deed having previously contracted to make it, and both parties being present at the execution, the grantee took it- up and carried it away without consent of the grantor.

The case was very elaborately argued on both sides; and Best, J., in pronouncing the judgment of the court, argues the case with great learning and ability He says, ;t As to the question whether a deed will operate as a deed, though it is never parted with by the person who executed it, there are many authorities to show that it will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">He cites <em>Barlow </em>vs. <em>Heveage, Prec.
