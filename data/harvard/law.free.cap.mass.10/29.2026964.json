The replication was adjudged bad, and the defendant had judgment</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-9\">This was an action of the case upon a promissory note made to the plaintiff by the defendant. The declaration also contained the common money counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\">The defendant pleads in bar, \u201c that the cause or causes of action in the said counts supposed did not, at any time within six years next before the commencement of the said action, accrue to the plaintiff. And this he is ready,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\">The plaintiff replies, that he ought not to be barred, &amp;c., because he says, \u201c that at the time of making the several promises in the declaration mentioned, the plaintiff and the defendant were in parts beyond sea, <em>viz., </em>at <em>Paris, </em>in the kingdom or empire of <em>France </em>; and the plaintiff further says, that he never was, at any time thereafter-wards, in the <em>United States </em>of <em>America, </em>at the same time that the defendant was also within the same, or at the same time that he, the said defendant, had any property in this commonwealth to be attached by the common and ordinary process of law, until within six years before the commencement of this action, <em>viz., </em>until the 1st day of September, 1808. And this,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>To this replication the defendant demurs generally, and the plaintiff joins in demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">The demurrer was argued at the last March term in this county, by <em>Savage </em>for the defendant, and <em>Prescott </em>and <em>Selfridge </em>for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-6\">\n<em>Savage.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4\">Our statute of limitations <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> has the very words of the <em>English </em>statutes of 21 <em>Jac. </em>c. 16, and of 4 <em>Anne, </em>c. 16, in the first of which disabilities of plaintiffs, and in the other those of [ * 30 ] defendants, are provided against. The construction * of the <em>English </em>statutes, as adopted in <em>Westminster Hall, </em>will then govern in the construction of our own. When the statute begins to run, it runs over all mesne acts. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> So, in the case at bar, the plaintiff was here more than six years before the action was commenced, and after the cause of -action accrued; and therefore the statute began to run, unless the impediment of the defendant\u2019s absence, and his having no property here, is saved by the clause in the fourth section of the statute. But the impediment is not thus saved, because the defendant was within the commonwealth after the cause of action accrued, and more than six years before action brought; both which facts are admitted by the replication.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-7\">This reasoning is fortified by the case of <em>Hickman </em>vs. <em>Walker, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> which is very like the case at bar, and by that of <em>Smith, Exr. </em>vs. <em>Hill, Exr. </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> If one plaintiff be abroad, and the other in <em>England, </em>the action must be commenced within the six years. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> If these decisions are not followed, the plaintiff might be here one half the time, and the defendant the other half, and thus the operation of the statute would be prevented forever. \u2014 The cases of <em>White </em>vs <em>Bailey </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> and <em>Bow </em>vs. <em>Warren </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> support the construction for which we contend.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\"><em>Prescott </em>and <em>Selfridge.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afh\">The statutes of limitations are founded on the presumption of payment. The common law bars actions on a similar presumption, after a longer time. But no such presumption can exist, where the parties cannot have been together. The statute never runs against a creditor, while his debtor is without the <em>United States, </em>and has no property to be attached. There is no case in the English books like the one at bar. When both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>parties were abroad, the statute did not operate; nor when the plaintiff was absent, though the defendant was here; nor when the plaintiff was here, and the defendant absent, leaving no property. <footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b38-9\"> <em>Stat. </em>1786, c. 52, \u00a7 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b38-10\"> Strange, 556, <em>Gray </em>vs. <em>Mendez</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> <em>Willes\u2019s Rep. </em>27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\"> 1 <em>Wils. </em>134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(5)\">\n<p id=\"b38-13\"> 4 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>516, <em>Perry </em>vs. <em>Jackson.\u2014Ibid. </em>300, <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Jones.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(6)\">\n<p id=\"b38-14\"> 3 Mass. <em>Rep. </em>273.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(7)\">\n<p id=\"b38-15\"> 6 <em>Mass.
