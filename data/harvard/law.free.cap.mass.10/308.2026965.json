The devise to <em>Wolcott </em>being for life, the remainder went to the ancestor of the demandants in fee, by the devise of the residue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>For the tenant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACR\">it was argued that the lands devised to <em>Wo-cvtl </em>being uncultivated or wild, if the devise should be holden to give an estate for life, he could have derived no benefit from it, since the cutting down the trees, which would have been necessary to any enjoyment of the estate, would have been in itself an act of waste, and a forfeiture of the estate. But it is a general rule that such sense shall be made of a devise, that it may be for the profit of the devisee, and not to his prejudice. On this point a decision of this Court, in the county of <em>Suffolk, </em>was recollected by <em>Parsons, </em>C. J This was in the action of <em>Ridgway </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>a note of which is given in the margin. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> And the counsel for the tenant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>sidered the decision as settling the principal question in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak_C\">* <em>The demandants\u2019 </em>counsel contended that it was not competent for the tenant to avail himself of evidence <em>dehors </em>the will, to alter the estate devised. The construction must be gathered out of the words of the will, and not by any parol averment. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">But if it were competent to go into such evidence, yet the inference attempted to be drawn, that a devise of wild land gives necessarily a fee, does not follow. It is not true that tenant for life of such property can derive no benefit from his estate in it. He may take the wood which has decayed and fallen as estovers; and in many other ways derive a benefit; and the smallness of this benefit will not affect the argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">The case of <em>Ridgway </em>vs. <em>Parker </em>is a solitary decision, and the point made in the present case came there only collaterally before the Court. And it would have been as correct to have decided in that case, that because the devise of the messuage in <em>Boston </em>was but of an estate for life, so also was the devise of the lands in <em>Hills-borough, </em>as to have settled the point as it was.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag2\">* The principle is also too uncertain to form a rule</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">of judicial decision.

P., </em>the devisee, did not take a fee simple estate by the same will in the premises, then the parties agree that the defendant has not kept, but has broken, his covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Upon these facts it was argued for the plaintiff, (as was recollected by the chief justice, who was present, but not of counsel in the case,) that the devise of the land in <em>Hillsborough, </em>being of lands uncultivated and in a state of nature, must be considered as giving a fee, for the reason relied on in the principal case; and that the devise of the mepmage and land in <em>Boston, </em>being in the same will and in the same words, must intend a devise in fee simple also.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">And the Court were of this opinion, and for this reason; and they decided \u201c that <em>J. P., </em>the devisee in the will, the son of the testator, took an estate in fee simple in the lands in question; and therefore that the defendant had not broken his covenant, as the plaintiff had declared against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">\n<em>Costs for the defendant</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b304-16\"> <em>*Shep.

Supposing, in the devise to <em>Wolcott, </em>the testator had expressly described the land devised as wild or uncultivated, what estate would <em>W. </em>have taken by the will ?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">A devise is always intended for the benefit of the party. But it is very certain that a life estate in wild land cannot be considered as of any value. No one would undertake the bringing of it into a state of cultivation, waste being out of the question, if his estate might be determined before he should be reimbursed his labor and expense. The inference, then, is clear, that a devise of such land, without words of inheritance, carries a fee. This was, in fact, the whole ground of the decision in <em>Ridgway </em>vs. <em>Parker; </em>and that decision, founded as it was in reason and good sense, is a precedent for the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">2. Is it competent to prove this circumstance, and thus affect the construction of the devise ?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">Parol averments are admitted to aid the exposition of a written will, not only where there is an ambiguity as to the person, as where there are two persons of the same name, but as to the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ject matter of the devise, as where there are <em>black-acres. </em>Averments are also received of facts which were known to the testator, and which may be reasonably presumed to have influenced him in the disposition of his property. On this ground, we think the evidence of the situation of the land devised to <em>Wolcott </em>is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Upon the whole matter, it is our opinion that <em>Wolcott </em>took an estate in fee, and that the demandants have not maintained their action, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>Demandants nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Additional note.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">[Devise of all the testator\u2019s <em>back 'lands. </em>Held, parol evidence was admissible, that certain lands of his were called and known by this title, by the testator, his family, and neighbors. \u2014 <em>Ryerss </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>22 <em>Wend, </em>148.\u2014F.

R. </em>270. \u2014 <em>Richards </em>vs. <em>Dutch, </em>8 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>506. \u2014The case in the text, upon the words of the will, is free from ambiguity, and admits of no doubt. The legal construction is so plain and well settled that parol proof is wholly inadmissible. \u201c The rule of law,\u201d says Lord Mansfield, \u201c is established and'certain, that express words of limitation, or words tantamount, are necessary to pass an estate of inheritance. \u2018 All my lands in such a place \u2019 is not sufficient.\u201d \u2014 <em>Right </em>vs. <em>Sidebotham, Doug. 763.\u2014Doe </em>vs. <em>Allen, </em>8 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>502. \u2014 2 <em>Preston on Est. </em>196, 201. \u2014 \u201cA will,\u201d says the same learned judge, \u201c shall be construed by what appears on the face of it, and not upon circumstances, or matter extrinsic. Where the testator uses no words of limitation, there the rule of law in the case of grants and deeds, that without words of limitation it shall be for life, and for life only, takes place.\u201d <em>\u2014Doe </em>vs. <em>Fildes, Cowp. </em>840, 841. \u2014 But, further, the rule of law is peremptory that the heir shall not tie disinherited, unless by plain and cogent inference arising from the words of the will. \u2014 <em>Doe </em>vs. Dring, 2 <em>M. &amp; S. </em>454.\u2014\u201c If the intention of the testator is doubtful,\u201d says Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>\u201cthe rule of law must take place.\u201d <em>Loveacres </em>vs. Blight, <em>Cowp. </em>355.\u2014So in <em>Kellett </em>vs. <em>Kellett, </em>(3 <em>Dow. </em>248,) it was laid down by Lords <em>Redesdale </em>and <em>Eldon, </em>as a clear rule of law, that if the court cannot find words sufficient to carry a fee, though they themselves be satisfied <em>beyond the possibility of a doubt, </em>as to what the intention of the party was, they must adhere to the fixed legal construction, because the heir cannot be disinherited, except by express words, or necessary implication.\u20142 <em>Prest. Est. </em>196,160. \u2014 It is said by the Court, in the case in the text, that \u201c A life estate in <em>wild </em>land cannot be considered of any value ; and that the inference is clear, that a devise of such land*, without words of inheritance, carries a fee.\u201d Both the premises and the conclusion are denied. A life estate in such land is valuable. The Court say, \u201c No one would undertake the bringing of it into a state of cultivation, waste being out of the question, if his estate might be determined before he should be reimbursed his labor and expense.\u201d But how does it appear that great profit might not be derived, over and above the labor and expense of cultivation, even during the life estate? The case finds that the lands \u201c were in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>state of nature, uncultivated., and covered with woods and brush.\u2019 But whether there were any, or how many, timber trees, does not appear. And it does not appeal that they could not be easily subjected to cultivation; nor is it quite clear that by so doing the tenant would be chargeable with waste, as it could be no damage, but a benefit, to the inheritance. \u2014 <em>Governors, </em>&amp;c., <em>Harrow School </em>vs. <em>Alderton, </em>2 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>87. \u2014 <em>Hastings </em>vs. <em>Crunkleton, </em>3 <em>Yeates, </em>261. \u2014 <em>Jackson vs. Andrew, </em>18 <em>Johns. </em>431.\u2014 But if the lands could not be subjected to cultivation, jet some advantage might be derived from them. It is true that the court;. of this commonwealth have regarded a life estate in such lands to be worthless. \u2014 <em>Conner vs. Shepherd, </em>15 <em>Mass Rep. </em>164.\u2014 <em>Webb </em>vs. <em>Townsend, </em>1 <em>Pick. </em>21. \u2014 But these decisions were founded on the assumption of what is not true, namely, that a tenant for life can derive no possible benefit from such lands without committing waste. What is waste, in this country, is a question not entirely free from difficulty. It may often depend on another question, equally unsettled, namely, what are timber trees. The law upon this subject, throughout <em>England, </em>is not uniform. And the <em>English </em>law is not strictly applicable <em>here.\u2014Hastings </em>vs. <em>Crunkleton, </em>3 <em>Yeates, 261.\u2014Findlay vs Smith, </em>6 <em>Munf. </em>134. \u2014 <em>Jackson vs. </em>Brownson, 7 <em>Johns </em>227. \u2014 <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Sellick, </em>8 <em>Johns. </em>262. \u2014 <em>Ballentine </em>vs. <em>Poyner, </em>2 <em>Hayw. </em>110. \u2014 <em>Parkins </em>vs. <em>Cox, </em>2 <em>Hayw. </em>339. \u2014 <em>Elliot vs. Smith, </em>2 N. <em>H. Rep. </em>430. \u2014 According to the cases last referred to, it is clear that a tenant for life may, to a certain extent, cut wood from waste lands, and derive considerable benefit therefrom, without incurring a charge of waste. But if it should be admitted that a life estate in such lands, unless held without impeach ment for waste, were of no value, it would not necessarily follow that, by a devise of them, the testator intended to pass a fee. It might, with as much reason at least, be presumed that he intended to give a life estate, without impeachment for waste, if it were allowable, to the condition of the lands, at all to discover his intent. But whatever may be the condition of the premises devised, and whether a life estate in them be valuable or worthless, since the language of the will, interpreted by the settled rules of construction, is intelligible, clear, and unequivocal, the intention of the testator must be collected only from the expressions used on the face of it. Otherwise, to use the words of Lord <em>Hale, </em>\u201c how could there be any certainty ? A will would be any thing, every thing, nothing.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 1 <em>Mod. </em>310, <em>Fry </em>vs. <em>Porter. </em>\u2014 \u201cIf we-once travel into the affairs of the testator, and leave the will, says Lord <em>Holt, </em>we shall not know the mind of the testator by his words, but by his circumstances.\u201d\u2014 <em>Cole </em>vs. <em>Rawlinson, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>234. \u2014 If the intention of the testator, from facts <em>dehors </em>the will, appear to have been to give an estate in fee, and by the will, upon a legal construction of the words of it, an estate for life only is given, it can only be said, <em>Quod voluit non dixit. </em>It is said by the court, that averments are received of facts which were known to the testator, and which may reasonably be presumed to have influenced him in the disposition of his property. But no authorities are cited to show that such averments <em>dehors </em>the will have ever been allowed, in a case like this, to show the intent of the testator, except the case of <em>Ridgway </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>referred to by <em>Parsons, </em>C. J. If this case be correctly reported in the note, the decision was clearly wrong; and the reasons given for it would quite as well have maintained a decision directly the reverse of that which it is said the court pronounced.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
