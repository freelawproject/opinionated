And the said <em>Nathan, </em>the son, died on the 24th of April, 1774, under age, and without issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\">\u201c After the death of the testator, his widow lived in the house, and continued in possession of the demanded premises until the 26th of April, 1764, when she intermarried with <em>Zebediah Wyman, </em>who immediately took possession of the demanded premises, and lived with his said wife in the house until August, 1774, when she died, leaving issue by the said <em>Zebediah.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-8\">\u201cIn the course of the years 1774 and 1775, the said <em>Zebediah </em>purchased in the shares of all the brothers and sisters of the whole blood, who survived the testator\u2019s son, <em>Nathan, </em>except one ; and in 1782, he purchased in the remaining one, and also took a release of the testator\u2019s sister of the half blood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-9\">\u201c Between the years 1775 and 1778, the said <em>Zebediah </em>made great improvements and alterations upon the premises, thereby making the same of more than twice the value they would have been without those alterations and improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-10\">\u201c The demandant, a daughter of <em>Isaac, </em>came of age in 1786, and had generally lived within a mile of the premises, until she married, in 1784, when she removed, with her husband, into <em>New Hampshire, </em>where he died in 1788. Soon after the death of her husband, the demandant returned from <em>New Hampshire, </em>and has resided ever since within half a mile of the premises, having married a second husband in 1790, with whom she lived about five years, when he died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALZg\">* \u201cDuring the minority of the demandant and her brother and sister, their guardian, or some friend on their behalf, made claim to a part of the demanded premises against the said <em>Zebediah, </em>who denied their right. Afterwards the parties, by agreement, consulted counsel, and were advised that the said minors took nothing by the said testator\u2019s will. This opinion was acquiesced in until 1785 or 1786, when the demandant\u2019s brother having come of age, he made claim, in behalf of himself and his sisters, to the said premises; and the said <em>Zebediah </em>denied their right, saying tha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ne had bought in the shares of all the family who could get any thing under the will. He also made the same declaration several times to other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">\u201c In April, 1793, the said <em>Zebediah Wyman </em>died intestate, leaving the tenant his widow, he having been in the exclusive possession of the demanded premises from the time of his intermarriage with the testator\u2019s widow. In September, 1793, commissioners, appointed by the judge of probate, duly assigned the demanded premises to the tenant, as a part of her dower, out of the estate of her said husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\"><em>\u201c </em>Ten days before the commencement of this action, <em>viz., </em>March, 1809, the demandant requested her agent to make an entry upon the premises; and he immediately entered into the house, and spoke with the tenant; but it did not appear that he told her he had come to make an entry in behalf of the demandant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-7\">\u201c The whole of the premises of which the demandant claims a part have been increased in value fourteen hundred dollars, by reason of buildings and improvements made thereon by the tenant, and those under whom she claims. And the value of the same premises, without these improvements, would have been eight hun dred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\">\u201c Upon these facts, the referee is of opinion that the said <em>Mary Cummings </em>is not entitled to recover in this action.

She made no actual entry on the demanded premises within thirty years after her supposed title accrued ; which is the utmost period allowed, even to a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The questions, whether the entry of a tenant in common is such as to accrue to the benefit of the others, and whether one has actually ousted another, are questions of fact, involving'sometimes the intentions and motives of the party in possession, which it is the province of a jury to determine. These have been submitted by the parties in this case to the referee, and we must understand him to have decided them against the demandant.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We are satisfied that this decision is perfectly correct. If these same facts had been found before a jury, they would have been instructed by the Court that they might presume an ouster and an adverse possession by <em>Z. Wyman </em>and those claiming under him. It would not be too much to say that a verdict for the demandant might have been set aside as against evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"A2g\">*From the year 1774, <em>Z. Wyman </em>and his assigns have had the actual and exclusive possession of the premises. He procured deeds of conveyance from all the brothers and sisters, who, according to his opinion, had any title under the will. He made, at his own expense, important and valuable improvements, and took all the rents and profits to his own use. The claims made by the demandant and her brother tend further to prove the ouster by <em>Wyman, </em>and his adverse possession, inasmuch as they gave him occasion to deny their title, and openly to assert his own exclusive property in the premises. His pretensions were supported by the opinion of counsel consulted by both parties at the time; and whether that opinion were correct or not, the fact shows the nature of his possession, and the title under which he . claimed to hold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">All this is abundant evidence of an actual ouster, and of an adverse possession, which continued upwards of thirty years. The cases of <em>Fisher </em>vs. <em>Prosser, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> and <em>Gordon </em>vs. <em>Pearson, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> which were cited by the counsel for the tenant, fully support the award of the referee, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\n<em>Report accepted,</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">[A tenant in common of certain land conveyed the whole; the grantee enteren, and afterwards a creditor of the latter levied and entered upon the whole, claiming tobe sole owner.

The respondent fenced the dower land in presence of F, another heir, declaring that he claimed an exclusive right to it. F never attempted to disturb his possession, but the petitioner, the son of F, made several attempts to enter and occupy the land, which were repelled; and the respondent maintained his posses sion, and was in actual possession when F conveyed all his right to the petitioner.
