The said <em>Hildreth, </em>by deed, dated July 18, 1807, conveyed the same [*422 ] premises to one <em>John </em>* Putnam, subject to the aforesaid mortgages to <em>Mellen; </em>and on the 23d day of July, 1807, the said <em>Putnam, </em>mortgaged the premises, with other land, to <em>Mellen, </em>to secure the payment of 1500 dollars, and a further sum of 837 dollars, with interest. On the 24th day of the same July, <em>Mellen, </em>the tenant, discharged the aforesaid mortgages from <em>Hildreth </em>to him, acknowledging to have received the full sums secured by the same. The aforesaid deeds and discharges were duly registered. The sums of money secured by <em>Hildreth\u2019s </em>mortgages to <em>Mellen </em>were included in, and made a part of, the sums secured to the latter by <em>Putnam\u2019s </em>mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b418-9-pl-split\">The said <em>Hildreth, </em>being justly indebted to the demandant in the sum of 400 dollars, on the 16th day of March, 1807, made his promissory note for that sum, payable to the demandant, or order, on demand, with interest; which note the demandant, on the same day, for value received, endorsed to one <em>Benjamin Champ-71 ey, </em>who, on the 13th day of May, 1807, commenced an action thereon against <em>Hildreth, </em>and on the 18th day of the same May, caused the said <em>Hildreth\u2019s </em>estate in the demanded premises, then under the aforesaid mortgages of <em>Hildreth </em>to <em>Mellen, </em>to be attached on the original writ in said suit. <em>Champmey </em>recovered final judgment in his said suit against <em>Hildreth </em>at the Court of Common Pleas in December, 1807, and within thirty days after the rendition of the judgment, caused his execution to be extended on the said HU<em>dreth\u2019s </em>right in equity to redeem the said demanded premises, which were advertised for sale by the officer, and by him sold to the pres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ent demandant for the sum of 460 dollars, he being the highest bid\u00bb der; and a deed of the same was duly executed by the officer, and recorded. Neither <em>Champney, </em>nor the officer who extended the execution, had any knowledge that <em>Mellen </em>had discharged <em>Hildreth\u2019s </em>mortgages to him, until more than thirty days after the rendition of the judgment aforesaid. The demandant duly entered upon the demanded premises, after the execution of the officer\u2019s deed to him, and before the commencement of the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-5\">* If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion [ * 423 ] that the demandant ought by law to recover possession of the demanded premises, the tenant agreed to be defaulted, and that judgment be rendered for the demandant accordingly; otherwise the demandant agreed to become nonsuit, and that the tenant should have judgment for his costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-7\"><em>Abbot, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9l4\">The right which <em>Champney </em>caused to be attached was <em>Hildreth\u2019s </em>right to be reseised of the premises, as soon as <em>Mellen\u2019s </em>mortgages were paid off and discharged. This was all the estate that then remained in <em>Hildreth; </em>for while the mortgages remained uncancelled, the seisin of the estate was in the mortgagee. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-8\">And there cannot be a concurrent seisin. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> As soon, therefore, as the mortgage was discharged, by the provisions of the statute of 1799, c. 73, the purchaser of the equity of redemption, who, in this case, is the demandant, under his deed from the officer, by relation to the attachment, became seised of the legal estate, or had a right of entry against all persons in possession; and having made an actual entry, may maintain this action, counting on his own seisin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-9\">Perhaps this reasoning would not be questioned, supposing the mortgage to be paid off and discharged, even before the sale, at any time after a seizure of the equity of redemption by the officer on execution. Will the case differ, if the mortgage were discharged by the mortgagee, before a seizure of the equity in execution? If it will, and the reason be that no equity exists, in fact, at the time of its supposed seizure, then it follows that a debtor, or other person connected with him, may compel a creditor to acquire an estate different from that which would necessarily result from his attachment, or entirely lose it; so that the nature of a creditor\u2019s lien on real property by attachment may, by a debtor or other person, be changed against his will. A creditor\u2019s interest in lands taken by execution must, then, have relation to the time of the attachment, and not of the seizure in execution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b419-10\">* It is no objection to this reasoning, that, in a case [ * 424 / <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>like the present, the debtor\u2019s land may be sold for less than its value, since he has, for three years after the sale, a right to redeem by pay ing the purchaser the money justly due in consequence of such sale</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-5\"><em>Fay </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b420-6\">The action stood continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, and at the next March term in <em>Suffolk </em>judgment was pronounced for the tenant.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\"> 3 <em>Mass.

The sale is to be made with reference to the prior encumbrances ; and if it produces more than the sum to be levied, with the expenses, the surplus is to be paid to the judgment debtor. And he retains a right of redeeming against the purchaser for three years, by paying the sum satisfied on the execution, with the interest, and also such sums as the purchaser may have paid to the mortgagee, deducting the rents and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">If there was in the case at bar no subsisting mortgage, other than the charge by <em>Putnam, </em>under his title created after the attachment by <em>Champney, </em>then an extent by appraisement, within thirty daya after the judgment, was the only course for <em>Champney </em>to take, in order to avail himself of his prior attachment. And a levy and sale, as of an equity of redemption, was without authority of law, and wholly without effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">It becomes, therefore, necessary to the title of the demandant, and be must insist upon the continuance of the mortgages of <em>Hildreth </em>to <em>Mellen, </em>if the sale by the officer made a title to the demandant., the purchaser. For then he has a right in equity, which may entitle him to a remedy by process in equity, to redeem against those mortgages. But in that case he has no title to the possession against the mortgagee, or against <em>Putnam\u2019s </em>assignee. [ * 425 ] * <em>Mellen </em>is either the mortgagee, notwithstanding the discharge, or the assignee of <em>Putnam, </em>to whose use and benefit the mortgages are to be regarded as subsisting encumbrances. And it is impossible to consider this demandant as acquiring an equitable title in consequence of the conveyance, and at the same time to consider those mortgages as extinguished and defeated, without any expense to him. Even upon the supposition which might be made, that the mortgage had been redeemed by <em>Hildreth, </em>the mortgagor and execution debtor, if the demandant has any title at all, it must be because the encumbrances are still subsisting for the use and benefit of the mortgagor, and to secure to him the reimbursement of his money, paid, in that case, for the use of the demandant.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12-pl-split\">The demandant comes in the right of the mortgagor, and cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>claim against the effect of his deeds to the tenant, who is, if the demandant has any title or pretence of title, a mortgagee in possession, or the assignee of a subsisting mortgage, originally made to himself, and, as to this demandant, claiming under mortgages not redeemed or discharged, and subject to which his title was acquired. Perhaps it may be stated, as a general rule, applying in all cases of this kind, that the purchaser of an equity of redemption can aver no' seisin or title against any other person than the execution debtor, or his immediate tenants or assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The demandant might recover, therefore, against <em>Putnam., </em>if he had been in possession by virtue of his deed from <em>Hildreth, </em>and supposing the mortgages to remain due to <em>Mellen; </em>but he cannot recover against <em>Mellen, </em>for either he is still the mortgagee, or he claims under a purchaser of the mortgage, or under some one who has redeemed the encumbrance for the use of the present demand-ant ; and until that is redeemed, the demandant has no seisin or title. According to the agreement under which this case comes before us, the demandant must therefore be called, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\n<em>Demandant nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\"><em> </em>[ <em>Warren </em>vs. Child, 11 <em>Mass.
