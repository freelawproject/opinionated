That decision [ * 90 ] recognizes a practice essentially variant from the <em>English </em>practice, and from what is said to be the practice in <em>Pennsylvania. </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Where separate actions are justifiably commenced against parties severally liable in one contract, the plaintiff, according to the <em>English </em>practice, is entitled to a judgment in each action, unless prevented by a satisfaction of the debt and a payment of all costs; and after the debt has been paid in one action, he may have execution for costs on his other judgments. In our practice, the right of the creditor to commence separate actions is fully recognized. If, however, we adhere to the decision in the case of <em>Gilmore </em>vs. <em>Carr, </em>the plaintiff proceeds at the risk of costs \u2014 not only of the loss of his own costs, but of paying costs, when he receives satisfaction in one suit before judgments are recovered in the other suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">If the decision referred to had been in a case not distinguishable from the case at bar, in any essential circumstances, we should be disposed to consider it as an authority by which this case must be also decided. At least, we should not overrule it without taking further time for consideration. In the case of <em>Gilmore </em>vs. <em>Carr, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s judgment in his suit against the endorser had been satisfied; but in the case before us there has been no satisfaction, that is, no valuable satisfaction, in a payment accepted, either by the plaintiff, or by any person authorized to receive payment, and to discharge the plaintiff\u2019s demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The person of a debtor, taken in execution, and imprisoned, is pledge for the debt, but not a satisfaction of it; except that, under some circumstances, it may operate as a satisfaction, so far as the party imprisoned is liable, but not as a discharge of any other party liable with him. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The other facts stated in the exceptions, respecting the negotiation between the jailer and <em>James M. Ingraham, </em>while he was in prison upon the plaintiff\u2019s execution against him and <em>Goold, </em>the promisors in the note now sued against <em>Joseph II. Ingra- </em>[ * 91 ] <em>ham, </em>the endorser, are wholly irrelevant. * The jailer acted without authority, and beside his duty, and, indeed, in violation of it; and the plaintiff in this action is not concluded by any thing done upon the executions sued out against <em>James M Ingraham </em>and <em>Goold.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">We entirely concur in the opinion given at the trial. The exceptions are overruled, and judgment is to be entered according to the verdict, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12-pl-split\">(The maker of a note, being sued by the holder, and imprisoned upon execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>was afterwards, and during such imprisonment, sued by the indorser, who had paid the note.
