At the foot of the note was the following memorandum : \u201c Five thousand dollars * of the [ * 285 ] above sum are in <em>Northampton </em>Bank bills, numbered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>from one to two hundred, dated July 1, 1809; which bills I engage to redeem, whenever they return to the bank for specie, by paying the same according to a former contract with <em>me.\u2014Matthew Coffin.\u201d </em>Before the maturity of the note, the plaintiffs, as a banking company, stopped payment, and have never done business since. The signatures to the paper were proved, as were also the necessary demand and notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5I\">By the testimony of <em>Levi Lyman, </em>who had been the cashier of the bank, it was proved that, some time previous to the transaction, which was the ground of this action, the bank had loaned to <em>Matthew Coffin </em>14,000 dollars, for twelve months, and that, at the time of that loan, a promise was made, in writing, in substance like the writing on which this action is brought, which had the guaranty of <em>S. Hinldey, </em>Esq. <em>Coffin, </em>at the time of that loan, made an agreement with the officers of the bank, which was reduced to writing, and subscribed by him, (but which at the time of the trial was either-lost or mislaid;) the purport of which was, that., if any of the <em>Northampton </em>Bank bills, which were received from the bank by him, and which were distinguished by marks put upon them, should be returned during the term for which the loan was made, he, <em>Coffin, </em>would, on notice within ten days, receive them from the bank, and pay specie for such of them as had been by the bank redeemed by specie; and that, at the end of every three months, he would receive one thousand dollars from the bank in certain paper described as foreign bills, which were circulating, and which were generally received for purchases and in payments at par, but were in the market, when exchanged for specie, at a discount of about two per cent.; and that he would pay for them at their nominal amount in specie. In order to ascertain the market discount on foreign bills, all inquiries were confined to the market of <em>Boston ; </em>and no evidence was given, or offered, or proposed, of any other market. <em>Lyman </em>further testified that, at the time of the loan on which this action was brought, [ * 2S6 ] besides * the written memorandum on the note, it was agreed by <em>Coffin </em>that he would, every ninety days during the loan, receive 500 dollars in those foreign bills, and pay for them an equal amount in specie, and that there might have been a writing to that effect, which, however, he could not find. <em>Lyman </em>also swore that the consideration, paid to <em>Coffin </em>for his note, was 5000 dollars, in bills of the <em>Northampton </em>Bank, 1000 dollars in foreign bills, and a draft on the agent of the plaintiffs in <em>Boston </em>for 1000 dollars, in the last-mentioned bills ; that <em>Coffin </em>was a broker, and well acquainted with the value of bills in <em>Boston </em>and in the country; and that there were no bills not issued in <em>Boston </em>which were receiver there in exchange for specie without a discount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>It appeared in evidence that there was deducted from the money loaned, at the time of the loan, a discount at the rate of six per cent, per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\"><em>Coffin, </em>upon being released by the defendant, was admitted as a witness, although objected to by the plaintiffs. He testified that the second loan of 7000 dollars was made upon the same principles ns the first of 14,000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">On this evidence it was agreed that the jury, after ascertaining the damages, should find a verdict for the plaintiffs, subject to the opinion of the Court upon any question of law upon the facts ; and the verdict was to be altered or amended conformably to law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-7\"><em>Ashmun, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADA\">contended that the corporation had no authority to make the contract declared on and proved in the case. Corporations are mere creatures of statute; and any contract, not made by virtue of some authority thus derived, or made in violation of any statutory provision, cannot support an action. This corporation are authorized \u201c to loan and negotiate their moneys and effects upon banking principles.\u201d This is their only authority respecting loans; and this Court have said, in the case of <em>The Maine Bank </em>vs. <em>Butts, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> that the expression <em>hanking principles, </em>used in statutes of this kind, is but an authority to deduct the interest at the commencement of loans. But the loans must be * such as are to be repaid in cash, not in specific arti- [ * 287 ] c\u00edes and services, as in the case at bar. The notes of banking corporations should be the representatives of specie, and to secure this they are restricted from issuing more, than a limited number of notes. But this security is lost, and the principal object in the creation of banks, the accommodation of the citizens, fails, if contracts like the one disclosed in the present case are held valid. By their act of incorporation, the plaintiffs are prohibited from using meir moneys in trade or commerce. But here is, in substance, a trading not only in foreign bills, but in their own notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-8\">The contract was also usurious, and banking companies are equally restrained by the statute against usury with individuals. Here were certain benefits reserved to the plaintiffs over and above the discount of six per cent, per annum.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-9\"><em>L.

Our courts have held that such notes are not negotiable, because not within the statute, <em>(Clark </em>vs. <em>King, </em>2 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>524 <em>\u2014Jones </em>vs. <em>Fales, 4 Mass.

And yet they have held that an action may be maintained by the endorsee against the endorser, <em>(Sanger </em>vs. <em>Stimson, </em>8 <em>Mass.

Thus, without any obvious reason, anomalies in the law ol* bills and notes, and in pleading, have been introduced, so that the same contract between some parties is to be considered as within the adopted statute, to which all the law of bills and notes is to be applied ; and between others is to be viewed as wholly unprotected by the statute, or any part of it which has been adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">As to the question of usury, see <em>White </em>vs. <em>Wright, </em>5 <em>Dowl. &amp; Ryl. </em>110 \u20143 <em>B, &amp; C. </em>273. \u2014 <em>Davis </em>vs. <em>Hardacre, 2 Camp. </em>375. \u2014 <em>Lowe </em>vs. <em>Waller, </em>2 <em>Doug. </em>736. \u2014 <em>Pratt </em>vs. <em>Willey, </em>1 <em>Esp. </em>40. \u2014 <em>Parr </em>vs. <em>Eliason, </em>1 <em>East, </em>92. \u2014 <em>Davidson </em>vs. <em>Barnard, </em>1 <em>Esp. 11.\u2014Bedo vs. Sanderson, Cro.
