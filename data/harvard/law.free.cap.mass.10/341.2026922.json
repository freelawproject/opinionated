The cause was submitted to the decision of the Court upon the following facts: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-7\">The pauper was married, about the year 1750, to one <em>Joseph </em>Jeffrey, who was then settled in <em>Dartmouth, </em>and lived on that part of the old territory of <em>Dartmouth </em>which still retains the corporate name In 1762, he removed, with his wife, to that part of <em>Dartmouth </em>which is now <em>New Bedford, </em>where they lived two years prior to the year 1767; before which year, the said <em>Joseph </em>went to sea, leaving his family then dwelling on the territory now <em>New Bedford, </em>and was never afterwards heard of. It does not appear that the said <em>Amy </em>has ever gained any settlement since that derived from her husband. Her residence at the times of the incorporation of <em>New Bedford </em>and of <em>Westport </em>is unknown, or not capable of proof; she being a wandering woman, residing in different places, and having no fixed place of abode, until she became chargeable to <em>Westport. </em>The ex penses, for which indemnity is sought in this suit, were duly incurred by the plaintiffs in the support and maintenance of the pauper. If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the defendants were liable in this action, they were to be defaulted, and judgment rendered against them accordingly ; otherwise the plaintiffs were to become nonsuit, and the defendants recover their costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-8\">[By the act of 1786, c. 60, passed February 23, 1787, a part of the town of <em>Dartmouth </em>was incorporated by the name of <em>New Bedford. </em>The act contains no provision respecting paupers, that then were or might thereafter become chargeable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-9\">By the act of 1787, c. 9, passed July 2,1787, another part of <em>Dart mouth </em>was incorporated by the name of <em>Westport. </em>The third section of the act provides that the inhabitants of the new town shall support their own poor, and also * all persons, there- [ * <em>342 </em>J tofo re inhabitants of the territory constituting <em>Westport, </em>who should thereafter be returned to <em>Dartmouth </em>as paupers.]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-10\"><em>Sproat </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-11\"><em>Tillinghast </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-12\">The action being continued <em>nisi </em>for advisement, judgment was pronounced for the plaintiffs at the succeeding March term in <em>Suffolk</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Sewall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL3\">It is unnecessary to decide whether the settlement of <em>Amy Jeffrey, </em>the pauper for whose support this action is brought, is derivative, or in her own right; for, in either case, her settlement was originally in <em>Dartmouth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">If the pauper, when <em>New Bedford </em>was incorporated, had her residence in that part of <em>Dartmouth, </em>the act of incorporation, which contains no special provision respecting paupers, must have operated to change her place of settlement to <em>New Bedford. </em>Previous to the incorporation of <em>New Bedford, </em>there was no change of settlement, by the change of residence of any person residing within the precincts of the town of <em>Dartmouth. </em>Upon that event, all persons then having their legal settlement in <em>Dartmouth, </em>who actually dwelt and had their homes within the limits of the new town or district, gained, by force of the act of incorporation, a legal settlement in the new town or district.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">An act to incorporate, as a new town or district, a territory, with the inhabitants thereon, which are separated and set off from one or more ancient towns or districts, operated in this respect like the original incorporation of a plantation. All the inhabitants of a territory gained a legal settlement, as well before the general statute respecting settlements as since, in the newly-incorporated district or town; and that corporation became liable for their support and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">On the other hand, if <em>Amy Jeffrey </em>had changed her residence from the part incorporated as <em>New Bedford, </em>at the time [ * 343 ] of the incorporation, but continued to reside within * the limits of <em>Dartmouth </em>when <em>Westport </em>was incorporated, then that might have been her place of settlement. For if, at the incorporation of <em>Westport, </em>her residence was on that territory, or even if that had previously been her place of residence, and she was, at the time of the incorporation, removed and resident in some other place than <em>Dartmouth, </em>then <em>Westport </em>is liable for her support, and has no right of action against either <em>Dartmouth </em>or <em>New Bedford; </em>the act incorporating <em>Westport </em>containing a particular provision to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">But there is no proof, nor any fact agreed, from which the residence of the pauper, at the date of the incorporation of <em>New Bed-ford, </em>or of that of <em>Westport, </em>can be ascertained. And it seems to be a necessary result, in this view of the case, and upon the authority of the decision in the case of <em>Windham </em>vs. <em>Portland, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> that the settlement of the pauper must be understood to have continued in <em>Dartmouth, </em>there being no evidence upon which any other deter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>mination can be made. If not resident either in <em>New Bedford </em>or <em>Westport </em>when those places were incorporated, then <em>Dartmouth </em>continued her place of settlement. Judgment is, then, to be entered for the plaintiffs upon the default of the defendants, according to the agreement of the parties, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\n<em>Defendants defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">[See <em>Bridgewater </em>vs. <em>W.
