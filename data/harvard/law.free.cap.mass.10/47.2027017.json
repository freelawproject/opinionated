In some instances, the entries were, \u201c <em>Maynard 8f Lamb Drs. Brig </em>Louisa,\u201d \u2014 and in others, <em>\u201cBrig Louisa Dr. Maynard &amp;f Lamb.\u201d </em>\u2014 After all the articles which the vessel required were delivered, the charges were transferred to the plaintifl\u00ed\u2019s book, called the ship-book, in which <em>\u201c Maynard Sf Lamb </em>and I tie owners of the <em>Louisa </em>\u201d were made debtors; and a bill for the articles furnished in April, and another for those furnished in September, in which \u201c <em>Maynard &amp;f Lamb </em>and the owners of the <em>Louisa </em>\u201d were made debtors, were at those times delivered to <em>Maynard fy Lamb.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-10\">In all instances in the ship-book, the charges were made to certain persons <em>and </em>the owners of the vessel, <em>eo nomine, </em>whether there were other owners or not. But in the plaintiff\u2019s legers, in an account including these articles, and others for the supplies of vessels of which said <em>Durant </em>was part owner, with others in which he had no concern, and in others in which <em>Maynard Lamb </em>were, in fact, the only debtors, these latter were alone made debtors; although in the same page of the leger is contained an account of the plaintiff with another person, where he and the owners of the vessel, <em>eo nomine, </em>are made debtors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-11\">[ * 49 ] * In the months of September and December, 1809, two several accounts, copied from the leger as aforesaid, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>presented to <em>Maynard &amp;f Lamb, </em>naming them only as debtors, who thereupon charged <em>Durant </em>with his proportion of the articles furnished this vessel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">On the 4th of January, 1810, <em>Maynard Lamb </em>gave their negotiable note to the plaintiff for the amount of said account, payable in sixty days, and a separate receipt was given, expressing the note to have been received on account, the sum in the note being the foot of the account. This transaction took place in the street, and the parties had not the account with them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\">The note was endorsed by the plaintiff, and also by another person, and discounted at a bank for the plaintiff; and was afterwards taken up by him, and was produced at the trial, the said <em>Maynard</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\"><em>Lamb </em>having failed before the note became due. No credit was given for said note in the books of the plaintiff to <em>Maynard Lamb.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-8\">The said <em>Durant, </em>for some months before and after these trans actions, resided in the <em>West Indies, </em>and, at the time when these articles were furnished, had large funds in the hands of <em>Maynard S/ Lamb, </em>and continued so to have until after their failure, which happened in February, 1810. They also received from and paid to said <em>Durant </em>moneys to a large amount after the date of these charges; but after those dates, they paid him more moneys than they received; and they still remained, at the time of the trial, greatly indebted to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-9\">The fact of there being another part owner of said vessel, other than said <em>Maynard Lamb, </em>was known to the plaintiff; but he did not know that said <em>Durant </em>was that person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-10\">No advances had been made by <em>Durant </em>to <em>Maynard 8f Lamb </em>since the date of said note. After the commencement of this action, they settled their accounts, in which the said articles were charged to <em>Durant; </em>but it was not then, nor has it since been, in his power to obtain any payment from said <em>Maynard &amp;f Lamb.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-11\">* It was agreed by the parties, that the verdict in this [ * 50 j case should be set aside, and judgment entered for the plaintiff for 228 dollars 69 cents and costs, if the Court should be of opinion that upon these facts he ought to recover; otherwise the verdict to stand, and judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-12\"><em>Prescott, </em>for -the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6eP\">contended that all the owners of the vessel, whether known to him or not, were liable originally for these supplies It was plain, too, from the manner of the plaintiff\u2019s entering the charges in his books, that he meant to charge all the owners, knowing, as he did, that there were other owners than those whose names were known to him. And he would have been enti</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ded to his remedy against the owners generally, had <em>Maynard \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1' Lamb </em>acted only as agents for the owners, or had the plaintiff, at the time of the transaction, supposed them the sole owners of the vessel. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-5\">The note or bill of an agent is no discharge of his principal, unless the principal is thereby prejudiced, or put in a worse situation. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Nor does the note or bill of the principal operate as payment, but only as an extension of the credit; unless so expressly agreed, which was not the case here, or unless negotiated, or the creditor is guilty of laches. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-6\"><em>Ritchie </em>for the defendants. Where one charges one or more of several debtors, knowing that there are others, he must be presumed to rely wholly on those whom he expressly makes his debtors. All the evidence in the case at bar shows that the plaintiff considered <em>Maynard fy Lamb </em>as his debtors, without relying on any other. He could not rely on <em>Durant, </em>since he did not know of his interest in the concern. His intention to depend wholly on them is clearly proved by his taking their note in payment. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">But if <em>Durant </em>was originally liable for the supplies, he was discharged by the negotiable note received by the plaintiff in payment. In the case of <em>Thatcher </em>vs. <em>Dinsmore, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> the Court declare that it is the settled law of this state, that \u201c a negotiable note, given in consideration of a simple contract debt due, is a discharge of the simple contract,\u201d unless an express agreement be proved, [*51] that the note should * be received as collateral security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">In the case at bar, the consideration for the note given was the plaintiff\u2019s account. He gave a receipt \u201c on account; \u201d but this arose merely from the transaction taking place in the street, where the plaintiff had not his account, or his books. It must have been the understanding of the parties, that the amount was to be credited against the account in the plaintiff\u2019s books.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\"> <em>Campbell\u2019s N.

Neither a promissory note, nor a bill of exchange, will operate as payment, or a discharge of the original debt, unless where the debtor has sustained an injury by the laches of the creditor, in not making a demand upon, or giving notice to, some party on the bill or note.\u2014 <em>Bayley, </em>4th ed. c. 9, sec. 1, pi. 58\u201464. \u2014 <em>Chitty, </em>6th ed. 97\u2014100. \u2014 <em>Thomson on Bills, </em>192,194. \u2014 1 <em>Petersdorf, Mr. </em>126, and cases cited in a note. \u2014 But in order to maintain an action, it must be shown that the note, or bill, has been dishonored, and it must be produced or accounted for at the trial. And so is the <em>Scotch </em>law. \u2014 <em>Thom son, </em>ub. sup. \u2014 It may not be altogether useless to examine the cases upon which the doctrine laid down in the text rests. In <em>Greenwood </em>vs. <em>Curtis, </em>(4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>93,) it was held that a note not negotiable could not operate as payment, or a discharge of an original debt. In <em>Thatcher </em>vs. <em>Dinsmore, </em>(5 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>303,) <em>Parsons, </em>C. J., in delivering the opinion of the Court, cited the case of <em>Warren, Admr. of Wheelwright, </em>in which he said it was decided, before the revolution, that a negotiable note, given in consideration of a simple contract debt, was a discharge of the simple contract. But he intimated that this was a presumption which might be rebutted. In <em>Maneely </em>vs <em>Magee, </em>(6 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>145,) a case somewhat like the case reported in the text, <em>Par sons, </em>C. J., in giving the opinion of the court, said, \u201c it had been long settled that when a debtor shall give his creditor his negotiable note for a debt due on simple contract, the legal presumption is that the note was received in payment; but that this, like all other presumptions, might be rebutted.\u201d And in this case it was held not to ope rate as an extinguishment of the parol contract. In <em>Goodenow </em>vs. <em>Tyler, </em>(7 <em>Mass Rep. </em>43,) <em>Parsons, </em>C. J., said, \u201c it had been settled by a series of decisions, which could be traced back sixty years, that when a negotiable note is given to secure the payment of money due by simple contract, the simple contract is holden to be satisfied or merged in the note.\u201d And <em>Sedgwick, </em>J., in the same case, said, <em>\u201c A </em>promissory note, given and received for goods at the time of the sale of them, is payment as much and as effectual, to all intents and purposes, as cash. A previously-existing parol con tract, as the law is here understood, would have been merged by it as completely as it would have been by a bond, recognizance, or deed of any kind.\u201d In <em>Johnson </em>vs <em>Johnson, </em>(11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>362,) the doctrine laid down in <em>Thatcher </em>vs. <em>Dinsmore, </em>and <em>Maneely </em>vs. <em>Magee, </em>is recognized as law by <em>Parker, </em>C. J., in giving the opinion of the court. In <em>Hemenway </em>vs. <em>Bradford, </em>(14 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>121,) it was held that an action for return premium would lie, before the premium note, which had not been negotiated, had been paid. And this decision is recognized as law in <em>Russell </em>vs. <em>Digrand, </em>(15 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>38.) In <em>Whitcomb </em>vs. <em>Whiting, </em>(4 <em>Pick. </em>229,) it was held that a negotiable note, given for a simple contract debt, was equivalent to payment in money ; and that if, by mistake, it should be given for more than the just amount of the debt, the ex cess might, even before payment of the note, be recovered by the promisor of the creditor, in an action for money had and received. In <em>Wiseman &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Lyman, </em>(7 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>286,) it was held by <em>Sedgwick, </em>J., in giving the opinion of the court, that a promissory note of a third person, received for a stated balance of a merchant\u2019s ac count, would be a complete discharge of the original debt. \u2014 But see <em>Tucker </em>vs. <em>Max-well, </em>11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>143. \u2014From the above cases it appears that the language of the court has not always been precisely the same. Sometimes it has been said that receiving a negotiable promissory note operates as an extinguishment and discharge of the simple contract, in like manner as would a bond or deed; sometimes it has been said to be equivalent to, and to be considered as, payment in cash; and sometimes 'it has been said to be only <em>prim\u00e9 facie </em>evidence of payment. The reason given for these decisions has uniformly been, that to hold otherwise would subject the defendant to pay his debt twice. But this is not very apparent. It would seem to be enough to require the plaintiff to produce or account for the note, or bill, at the trial. These decisions are not very consistent with the doctrine held by the same court in regard to the admissibility of a promissory note in evidence to support the money counts in a suit by the promisee or endorsee against the maker, or to support a claim in set-off for money paid. \u2014 <em>Young </em>vs. <em>Adams, </em>6 <em>Mass Rep. </em>152. \u2014 <em>State Bank </em>vs. <em>Hurd, </em>12 <em>Mass.
