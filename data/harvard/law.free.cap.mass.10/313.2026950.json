The said <em>Hiram </em>entered upon the lands, and continued in possession thereof until the 5 th of December, 1801, when he conveyed the same to the plaintiff in fee, who thereupon entered and continued in possession thereof, until ousted of a part thereof, as hereafter mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-9\">On the 7th of September, 1807, the said <em>Jonathan </em>died, and the defendant was duly constituted executor of his last will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\"><em>Sarah Grout, </em>who was the lawful wife of the said <em>Jonathan </em>at and before the deed first above mentioned, and who survived him, not having in any manner barred herself of her right of dower in the said lands, duly instituted a suit against the plaintiff for the recovery thereof, and obtained judgment therefor in June, 1812. A writ of seisin issued upon the said judgment, upon which the dower of the said <em>Sarah </em>in said lands was set forth to her by three disinterested persons; one of whom, the parties agree, was * not a freeholder, unless a purchase of a right in [ * 314 ] equity under a sheriff\u2019s sale upon execution, pursuant to the provisions of a statute of this commonwealth, entitled \u201c An Act in addition to an act entitled An Act for giving remedies in equity,\u201d <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> the purchaser not having taken possession under such purchase, constituted him a freeholder, competent to be appointed by the sheriff to the assignment of said dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-11\">If, upon the facts stated, the Court should be of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>plaintiff was entitled to recover in this action, the defendant agreed to be defaulted, the plaintiff\u2019s damages to be assessed by a jury; otherwise the plaintiff was to become nonsuit, and the defendant to recover his costs</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-5\">Lincoln, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY1\">The right which a <em>feme covert </em>may have to dower in the lands of her husband is a contingency, subject to which, if it be not relinquished at the time of a conveyance, the purchaser takes the estate; and the enjoyment of this right, by an assignment of dower to the wife, after the decease of the husband, is not an encumbrance, within the legal meaning of covenants against encumbrances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-6\">But, in the present case, the assignment of dower to the testator\u2019s widow was not conformed to the statute, and is therefore either void or voidable. The purchaser of a right in equity is not a freeholder. The statute secures to a mortgagor, after a sale of his right, a further equity; and the sale amounts, in effect, to nothing more than an additional mortgage. The mortgagor, continuing in possession as well after as before the sale, remains tenant of the freehold.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-7\"><em>Blake, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMO\">Here was a regular judgment, and a writ of seisin, upon which the sheriff returned that he had caused the demandant\u2019s dower to be set forth by three disinterested freeholders of the county.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b313-15\"> <em>Stnt </em>17-98,0.77</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AoS\">The sheriff\u2019s return is conclusive upon the point.

In the argument of the plaintiff s counsel, however, it is stated that the sheriff returned that he had caused the dower to be set off by three disinterested freeholders. And probably the case is defectively stated in the report. If not, it cannot be distinguished from <em>Boston </em>vs. <em>Tileston, </em>(11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>468,) where the Court say that the return of the officer that the appraisers were disinterested freeholders would not have been traversable, but that the parties had removed that objection, by agreeing upon the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">As to the conclusiveness of the officer\u2019s return, see <em>Lawrence </em>vs. <em>Pond, </em>17 <em>Mass. Rep. 433.\u2014Bott </em>vs. <em>Burnell, </em>9 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>96. 11 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>163. <em>\u2014Bean </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em>17 <em>Mass.

Rep. </em>478. \u2014 In <em>Phillips on Evidence, </em>(7th ed. vo\u00ed. i. p. 391,) it is laid down that \u201c the return of the sheriff upon a writ is <em>primdfade </em>evidence of the fact there stated, when that fact comes incidentally into question, even in an action between third persons.\u201d.\u2014 See <em>Rex </em>vs. <em>Elkins, </em>4 <em>Burr. </em>2129.\u2014 <em>Cator </em>vs. <em>Stokes, 1 M. &amp; S. </em>599. \u2014 <em>Gyfford </em>vs. <em>Woodgate, </em>11 <em>East, </em>296.\u20142 <em>Phill. </em>p. 391. \u2014 <em>Dalton </em>says there can oe no averment directly against the return of the sheriff in the <em>same action, </em>except m the cases he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>mentions, but that one may traverse directly, and aver against the return of the sheriff in <em>another action. \u2014Salt.

Among the excepted cases are those where the life or <em>inheritance </em>of the party is in jeopardy, or his suit would otherwise abate, or he have no other remedy. <em>\u2014Dalt. </em>191. <em>\u2014Gibson </em>vs. <em>Brook, Cro. Eliz. </em>859. \u2014 <em>Via. Ab. Ret. O. 22, </em>3d ed. iv. p. 20. \u2014 And where the party cannot aver against the sheriff\u2019s return, he may show that the person making it is not sheriff, <em>(Arundel </em>vs. <em>Arundel, Yelv. 34.--indrew </em>vs. <em>Lynton, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>265.\u20142 Lord <em>Raym. </em>884. \u2014 <em>Saund.

C. </em>218.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">As to the grounds of'the action upon the covenants, it does not clearly appear whether the plaintiff counted upon the usual covenant that the premises were \u201c free of all encumbrances,\u201d or upon the covenant to warrant and defend against the claims and demands of all persons. In <em>Prescott </em>vs. <em>Trueman, </em>(4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>630,) <em>Parsons, </em>C. J., says, \u201c A claim of dower is an encumbrance.\u201d \u2014 See <em>Harrington </em>vs. <em>Rydears, </em>1 <em>Leon. </em>93\u2014 <em>Com. Dig., Cov. </em>E, 1. \u2014 But according to the opinion of the same -earned judge, and the whole Court in this and many other cases, the covenant was broken as soon as it was made; and the claim for damages, being a chose in action, was incapable of being assigned, <em>(Marston </em>vs. <em>Hobbs, </em>2 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>433. \u2014 <em>Beckford </em>vs. <em>Page, 2 Mass. Rep. </em>455. \u2014 <em>Caswell </em>vs. <em>Wendell, </em>4 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>108.\u2014 <em>Wyman </em>vs <em>Ballard, </em>12 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>304;) and so it has been often held by other courts. \u2014 <em>Mitchell </em>vs. <em>Warner, </em>5 <em>Conn. Rep. </em>497. \u2014 <em>Davis </em>vs. <em>Lyman, </em>6 <em>Conn.

Eliz. </em>863 \u2014 See, too, <em>Shep Touch. </em>170, ed. by <em>Peyton. </em>In this view of the case, the plaintiff could not have succeeded in his suit. But the <em>English </em>courts have held that like covenants were \u201c in the nature of covenants to do a thing <em>toties quoties, </em>as the exigency of the case might require; \u201d and that \u201c there was a continuing breach,\u201d so that the assignee might recover for \u201c a substantial breach in his time.\u201d \u2014 <em>Kingdom </em>vs. <em>Nottle, 4 M.
