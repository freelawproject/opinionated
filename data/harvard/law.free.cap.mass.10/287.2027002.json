It was agreed that the plaintiff had served out his time ; and it was in evidence that he had been to <em>Vermont </em>to examine the land, and before the commencement of this suit had signified to the defendant his refusal to accept it. The defendant objected that this evidence could not support either of the counts ; 1st. Because it proved a special contract, which ought to have been set forth. 2d. Because the promise, as proved, was made to the father, and not to the plaintiff. Both these objections being overruled by the judge, a verdict was returned for the plaintiff; and the defendant moved for a new trial on the above grounds.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-6\"><em>Allen, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfG\">urged the same exceptions which were taken at the trial: 1st. That the contract being made with the father of the plaintiff, the action can be maintained only in the name of the father. The son was at the time unable to contract, except for necessaries. He was certainly not competent to enter into this special agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">2. But the other exception, which was to the form of declaring, was most relied on. This was an executory contract, and was not to attach until the plaintiff came of age and had performed the service. It was an alternative undertaking, and the alternative ought to have been set forth. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-8\"><em>Mills, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_mn\">As long as a contract remains executory, the declaration must be special; but, when it ceases to be executory, a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>is sufficient. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Penny </em>vs. <em>Porter, </em>neither count was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-9\">* In the case at bar, the plaintiff having made his [ * 289 ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>election of the money, the land was out of the question.' The promise to pay money alone remained. Indeed, a verbal promise to convey land could never have been enforced; and it would have been idle to state-a void promise in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-5\">As to the action being brought in the name of the father, the promise was wholly for the benefit of the son, and he can well maintain an action upon it, declaring, as in this case, upon the promise as actually made to him. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">Where justice is substantially done by a verdict, the Court will not set it aside upon a technical objection to the form of declaring. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-7\"><em>Ashman, </em>in reply, was not disposed to contest that an action was maintainable by the plaintiff on the facts disclosed in this case, though, in many of the cases cited for the defendant, the nominal promisee was but the agent or attorney of the party in interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\">But he relied on the objection to the form of declaring, and thought no case had gone so far as this at bar. Though this was merely an oral contract, still it is to be treated as if it had been in writing; and it would be going a great way to say that a contract, so special as the one here proved and reduced to writing, could be given in evidence in support of the general counts in the declaration before the Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b287-10\"> 2 <em>East, </em>2, <em>Penny </em>vs. <em>Porter.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> <em>Bull.

It is undoubtedly true, that, where there is a special agreement relative to the performance of work and labor, the declaration ought to state that agreement, in order that the defendant may be apprized of the contract he is charged with breaking, and may have opportunity to show the want of performance, on the part of the plaintiff, of those [*290] stipulations, which * may have been the foundation or consideration of the promise made by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">But where there has been a special agreement, the terms of which have been performed, so that nothing remains but a mere duty to pay money, there seems to be no reason why a general count should not be sufficient for the recovery of the sum due. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The other objection, <em>viz., </em>that the contract was made with the father, we think has no validity. It is clear that, although the father contracted for the son, yet he had a view to the son\u2019s advantage, and not his own. The money was to be paid to the son upon the termination of his minority. Now, when a promise is made to one, for the benefit of another, he for whose benefit it is made may bring an action for the breach. This principle was settled as early as <em>Roll </em>\u2019.s time, in a case quite analogous to the present; and, it being cited by Lord C. B. <em>Comyns, </em>in his Digest <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> without any question of its authority, it is to be presumed that it continues to be received as a sound principle. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">[See <em>Causten vs. </em>Burke, 2 <em>Har. &amp; G. </em>295. \u2014 <em>Feeter </em>vs. <em>Heath, </em>12 <em>Wend. </em>477.\u2014 <em>Way </em>vs. <em>Wakefield, </em>7 <em>Verm. </em>223. \u2014 <em>Bagley </em>vs. Bates, <em>Wright, </em>705, affirming the rule in the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Otherwise, where a contract is still open, or to be performed nereafter. \u2014 <em>Shepard </em>vs. <em>Palmer, 6 Conn. 100.\u2014Halloway </em>vs. Davis, <em>Wright, </em>129. \u2014 <em>Russell </em>vs. <em>South, </em>&amp;c., 9 <em>Conn. </em>508. \u2014 <em>Blair </em>vs. <em>Asbury, </em>4 <em>Por. </em>435.\u2014 <em>Cranmer </em>vs. <em>Graham, </em>1 <em>Blackf. </em>406.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">And see <em>Dubois </em>vs. <em>Delaware, </em>&amp;c., 4 <em>Wend. </em>285. <em>\u2014Perrine </em>vs. <em>Haukinson, </em>6 <em>Halst. </em>181. \u2014F.

In a note to <em>White </em>vs. <em>Wilson, </em>(2 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>119,) are the following remarks: \u201cIn <em>Layton </em>vs. <em>Pearce, (Doug. </em>15,) it was held, in the case of an alternative contract, that the party who had not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>option could not state it as an absolute contract. Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>indeed, there laid down that, if the option had been in the party pleading, it had been otherwise. On the authority of this dictum it was contended, in <em>Chirchill </em>vs. Wilkins, (1 <em>T. R. </em>447,) that a contract, in the alternative where the option is in the party pleading, may be stated as an absolute contract; and this seems to have been admitted by Buller, J., for his reasoning went to show that the contract in that case was not a contract in the alternative, but merely a contract depending on a contingency, and therefore not within the above rule applicable to alternative contracts. However, in a subsequent case, of <em>Tate </em>vs. Wellings, (3 <em>T R. </em>531,) the court held that the defendant could not plead a contract, which was in the alternative as an absolute contract, though the option was in himself.\u201d See also <em>Perry </em>vs. Porter, (2 <em>East, </em>2,) and <em>Skiphan vs. Saunders, </em>(2 <em>East, </em>4,) and <em>White </em>vs. Wilson, (2 Bos. <em>Pul. </em>119.)
