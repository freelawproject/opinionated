After sundry continuances, and other proce\u00e9dings had upon the said information, judgment was rendered, that the head line aforesaid should be the true head line of <em>Balcerstown, </em>and that the same town should be bounded by certain [ * 166 ] lines in the. said judgment * recited, <em>\u201cprovided that the proprietors of Balcerstown aforesaid release all their right, title, and interest, to such part of the lands within the said, lines as were actually settled upon before the said </em>Davis <em>run the said head line as aforesaid to such persons as were actually settled thereon before the said </em>Davis <em>run the said head line as aforesaid, or to their heirs or assigns; </em>and that the commonwealth be seised of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the lands contained in the confirmation of the General Court of the grant to <em>Bakerstovm, </em>bearing date October 30, A.

Thereupon the judge who sat in the trial, for the reason assigned, refused to suffer the same to be read to the jury. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">The tenant excepted to the said decision; and the jury finding a verdict for the demandants, the action stood over to this term for the consideration of the said exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-7\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsQ\">contended that the demandants, claiming under one of the original grantees of <em>Bakerstoivn, </em>were privies to the judgment in question, and bound by it. The Court had au thority to prescribe the terms on which the forfeiture, which had been legally incurred, should be saved, and the proviso, being with in the jurisdiction of the Court, binds all parties and privies.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-8\"><em>Longfellow, </em>for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8q\">The proviso annexed to the judgment in question was wholly inoperative and void. It was not within the legitimate powers of the Court to prescribe it, or to render a conditional judgment. The tenant then derived no rights under it. But whether the judgment is valid or not, the demand-ants claim nothing under it: they hold their estate under the origi nal grant and confirmation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-9\">* The lines recited in the judgment gave to the pro- [ * 167 ] prietors no more land than was originally granted them. When the Court had assigned them those boundaries, they had exercised all the powers given them by the statute. (1) They were not authorized to transfer a part, and that without ascertaining, or even inquiring, how great a part, to strangers who had entered upon the lands without a shadow of title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-11\">The condition was also impossible, since the proprietors had transferred their claims and rights, before this judgment was rendered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-12\"><em>Whitman, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYs\">The Court here will not inquire into the quantity of land assigned to the proprietors by the judgment: if they did, it would appear that more was assigned by the judgment than was originally granted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-13\">This was not a conditional judgment. A part of the land lying within the boundaries recited was excepted, and this is within the powers given by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The demandants must hold, if at all, under the judgment, since the original grant was vacated by the fraud of the grantees, and annulled by the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-5\">If the proprietors had put it out of their power to execute the releases prescribed, that is not to affect the tenant. Indeed, without executing the release, their title is yet void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AL9\">The demandants derive their right 01 title to the demanded premises from and under the proprietors of <em>Bakersiown. </em>The grant and confirmation, by the legislature of the late province, to those proprietors, of a tract of land, or township, including the demanded-premises, was a conditional grant. So it appears by the resolves, which the demandants refer to as the evidence of their title. And as privies, claiming under the grant, they are subject to all the consequences of a defect in the title of the proprietors of <em>Bakerstoion, </em>especially a defect which is, in fact, a failure in the conditions annexed to the grant to them, or a forfeiture, under those conditions, of the entire grant. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> Besides, the statute directing inquests of office specially provides that all judgments rendered on any inquest of office, taken by virtue there- [ * 168 ] of, shall conclude all parties and * privies thereto, their heirs and assigns, so long as such judgments shall remain in force. By <em>privies thereto </em>must be understood those who are privies to the judgment by reason of their privity in any estate or title claimed under a grant or confirmation by the late province, or by the commonwealth, made on certain conditions, or in any other estate or title liable to be impeached and brought in question by an inquest of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The judgment offered in evidence for the tenant was rendered upon an inquest of office, by which the commonwealth claimed to be revested in the tract of land described in the grant and confirmation to the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown, </em>the entire tract, including the demanded premises, for the breach of one or more of the conditions annexed to the <em>grant; </em>and, among the rest, the condition that the survey and boundaries, by which the grant was confirmed, did not include a larger quantity of land than the grant expressed. Upon this process a breach of this condition was found, or confessed by the parties impleaded. The proprietors of <em>Bakersiown </em>had included in their survey a much larger territory than they were entitled to hold by the terms of their grant; and they had recourse to the equitable jurisdiction of the Court in that case provided by the.same statute. The entire forfeiture of the grant may be saved, when the only condition proved to be broken is, that the defendants hold more land, under such grant or confirmation, than they have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>right by force thereof to hold. In such case, \u201c the justices, &amp;c., shall have power to assign to the defendants, by metes and bounds, at their request, &amp;c., so much of the land which shall be held by them, &amp;c., as shall be equal in quantity to the land they might lawfully have held under the grant, &amp;c., and in such part thereof as shall be just and reasonable.\u201d Now, it was under this authority, exercised at the request of the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown, </em>that the court confirmed or assigned to them a tract of land, parcel of their original survey, including that part thereof which had been assigned to thev ancestor of the demandants, by the indenture which is part of the evidence of their title.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">* The demanded premises are within the metes and [ * 169 ] bounds thus designated by the equitable authority of the Court. The grant to the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown </em>is to be proved by this decree: their boundaries are assigned by this, and not by the survey, or the confirmation originally made to them. Those are to be considered as forfeited, excepting so far as they may be reinstated by the decree. What is said therein of lands to be released to certain occupants, prior to the running of <em>Davis\u2019s </em>line, may be construed as operating to except those locations from the territory assigned, and confirmed to the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown. </em>The line ascertained by <em>Davis </em>determines the part of the grant to the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown, </em>in which they are reinstated and confirmed. But, in assigning to them the quantity of land they were entitled to hold, in this part of the territory, which they had formerly surveyed to themselves, the Court have thought it \u201cjust and reasonable \u201d to except therefrom certain locations and settlements, and, it may be, grants by the legislature made and entered upon before that line was ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">What has been called a conditional judgment is more in the nature of a specific decree in chancery, pursuant to the jurisdiction and authority appointed and granted by the express provisions of the statute. It is not a judgment by the course of the common law <em>; </em>but it seems to be very clearly authorized and directed by the statute ; and the acceptance of it by the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown </em>is not only conclusive upon them, but upon all privies in estate, claiming under the same grant. These are all reduced to the location and boundaries appointed by that judgment and decree, subject to the limitations and exceptions therein expressed. The original patent and confirmation to the proprietors of <em>Bakerstown, </em>as it is controlled and altered, so it is to be examined and construed, by this judgment and decree. The rejection of it at the trial was therefore erroneous; and the tenant in the case at bar is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b176-8\"> See 10 <em>Co. </em>92, Dr. <em>Leyfield's </em>case</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
