Kidder f Al.; </em>and that judgment has been rendered against him on a <em>scire facias </em>for 1630 dollars 50 cents debt and 15 dollars 20 cents costs; upon which judgment execution hath issued. The petitioner further states that, since the rendition of that judgment, he has been informed, and verily believes, that the said <em>Butters </em>has drawn a bill of exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>upon the said firm in the <em>Havana, </em>which has been paid, and thereby a very small sum remains due to the said <em>Butters </em>from the pet'tioner, or from the said firm. Wherefore he prays for a <em>supersedeas </em>of the said execution, and for a review in the premises, that he may be enabled to answer as trustee in this Court, and be charged only for the sum actually in his hands. .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-5\"><em>Aylwin, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYh\">suggested a doubt whether a review could be granted in this case; and he referred to the case of <em>Dickinson </em>vs. <em>Davis, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where the Court say that, where a review is grantable, the cause must be <em>triable </em>on the review; intending, no doubt, that there must be an issue to be tried, which cannot be in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b422-6\"><em>Selfridge </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\"> 4 <em>Mass.

But the words of the statute are very comprehensive, and leave us no doubt of our authority in the case. Let the petitioner take his review; but, under the circumstances of this case, he must first pay to the plaintiffs in the original suit the costs of that suit, and also of the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">ADDITIONAL NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">[A writ of review lies for one who has been charged as trustee, either by accident or mistake, in the Court of Common <em>Pleas.\u2014Brigham, </em>vs. <em>Elliot, </em>12 <em>Pick. </em>172.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">See <em>Emerson </em>vs. <em>Paine, </em>9 <em>Verm. </em>271 \u2014 F.
