He likened it to a judgment, upon which interest is always allowed in an action of debt, brought upon the judgment; and he relied on the case of <em>Paine, Judge, </em>&amp;c., vs. <em>M\u2019Intier, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> which was an action brought to recover the distributive shares of a grandfather\u2019s estate; and there the Court awarded interest from the decree of distribution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-9\"><em>Chickering for </em>the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> 1 Mass. <em>Rep. </em>69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-10\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AcD\">took time for consideration, and afterwards, observing that they did not hold themselves bound by <em>the </em>decision in the case cited, decreed that interest should be added [ * 372 ] * to the sum found due by the judge\u2019s decree, from the time when a demand should be proved to have been made on the defendant, the surety in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12-pl-split\"><em>Memorandum. </em>\u2014 On' Saturday, the 30th of October, 1813, died, at his house in Boston, the Hon.

Justices Sewall, Parker, and Jackson, and the Rev. Dr. Kirkland, president of Harvard University.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The general sense of the public loss, in the death of this learned jurist, exemplary magistrate, and real Christian, alike honorable to the community and to the deceased, was shown in the unanimous act of the legislature, directing the secretary of the commonwealth to request of the Hon. Judge Parker a copy of that part of his charge to the grand jury of the county of Suffolk, \u201cwherein he delineated the character of the late venerated Chief Justice Parsons,\u201d and to cause it to be inserted in the next volume of the Reports. That interesting sketch will accordingly be found as an appendix to this volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">-Breve irreparabile tempus</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Omnibus est vit\u00ede; sed famam extendere factis, Hoc virtutis opus <em>Virgil</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
