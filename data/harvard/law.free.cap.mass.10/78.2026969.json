Since the indictment was found, the legislature, by an act passed on the 22d of.January, 1812, altered the name of the town from <em>Phillipsburg </em>to <em>Hollis.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-12\">The defendants at this term suggested the above alteration, and, upon the ground of it, moved the Court to quash the indictment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b90-13\"><em>Morton, </em>(Attorney-General,)</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0\">opposed the motion of the defendants, and moved, on behalf of the commonwealth, that the name in the indictment might be changed to <em>Hollis, </em>and the defendants holden to answer.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b90-14\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ahoo\">We cannot change the name of the defendants in the indictment; nor is there any occasion for it. We have no difficulty in proceeding upon the indictment as it stands; nor in inflicting a fine and awarding execution against the defendants by the name of the inhabitants of <em>Phillipsburg. </em>If a <em>feme sole </em>intermarries pending an action against her, the action still proceeds against her by her former name; and she may be taken on execution, notwithstanding her coverture.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-15\">So neither the defendants nor the attorney-general took any thing by their respective motions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
