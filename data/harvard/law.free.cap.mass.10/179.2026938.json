The power of assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\"ng these taxes was originally in the Sessions, by the statute of 1796. It was, with the other powers and duties of that court, transferred to the several Courts of Common Pleas for the respective counties by the statute of 1809. When the statute of 1811, c. 33, abolished the last-mentioned courts, and established in their stead the present Circuit Courts, it transferred to the new courts the jurisdiction of civil and criminal suits, but with the exception of such acts, matters, and things, as were or might be cognizable by the Courts of Sessions; and afterwards, by the statute of 1811, c. 81, the Courts of Sessions were revived, and their former jurisdiction restored to them, as it had been limited and restrained by the statute of 1803, c. 155, including, however, the powers exercised by the Common Pleas of <em>Somerset </em>in the proceedings brought into question by the <em>certiorari </em>in this case. The records of the Courts of Common Pleas were transferred, with their jurisdiction, to the revived Courts of Sessions. The writ should have been, therefore, directed to the presiding member of the Court of Sessions for <em>Somerset </em>county, and not to the chief justice of the Circuit Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-5\"><em>Williams </em>thought this an immaterial circumstance,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX33\">since the same individual is by law clerk of all the judicial courts in the county, and on him devolves the duty of making out the proceedings required, whatever officer may subscribe the formal return. Besides, it is now manifest to the Court, by the return of this writ, that the record sought is in possession of the Circuit Court. As it is now before the Court, from what source soever it may have been obtained, it may with propriety be heard and acted upon.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>The Court</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AnpC\">quashed the <em>certiorari, </em>as having issued improvidently, and ordered a new writ to issue to the first justice of the Court of Sessions for the county of <em>Somerset.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
