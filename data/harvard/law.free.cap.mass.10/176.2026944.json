And he cited the cases of <em>The Inhabitants of the County of Lincoln </em>vs. <em>Prince, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and <em>Hawkes Al. </em>vs. <em>The Inhabitants of the County of Kennebeck, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> in support of the motion. The first of these cases agreed with the case at bar, except that here the county treasurer was the nominal plaintiff, although the county was alone interested ; and in the last case the county [ *177 ] were * defendants instead of plaintiffs. The statute of 1809, c. 127, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 4, directs that any local or transitory action, in which the inhabitants of a county are plaintiffs, may bo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>brought in the county where the defendant lives, unless he be an inhabitant of the same county, in which case the action may be commenced and prosecuted in either of the adjoining counties. By this it should seem to be the intention of the legislature that such an action should in no case be brought in the county, the inhabitants of which are plaintiffs, as they virtually are here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-5\"><em>Wilde </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b184-12\">I) 2 <em>Mass.
