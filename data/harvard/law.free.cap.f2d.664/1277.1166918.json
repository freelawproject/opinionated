BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1318-22\">Appellant Croft &amp; Scully Co. appeals from a decision by the District Court limiting to $500 its recovery in an incident where the parties stipulated negligence. Finding that the District Court applied an incorrect standard in determining what constitutes a \u201cpackage\u201d for purposes of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1300 et <em>seq., </em>we reverse and remand. 508 F.Supp. 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-23\">\n<em>Things Go Better With Coke</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1318-24\">Croft &amp; Scully contracted to ship 1755 cases of soft drinks from Houston, Texas to the middle eastern country of Kuwait. Apparently Kuwaitis would like to be Peppers, too. Croft &amp; Scully arranged to ship the soft drinks on board M/V SKULPTOR VUCHETICH, which would arrive in Houston on December 8, 1977. Baltic Shipping Co., owner of SKULPTOR, dispatched a 20-foot steel container to Croft &amp; Scully\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>supplier in Wharton, Texas. Employees of the supplier loaded the 1755 cases, each containing 4 \u201c6-packs\u201d or 24 cans, into the container, closed and sealed it \u2014 a real Teem effort. The supplier then trucked the container to Goodpasture\u2019s yard, near the Houston Ship Channel, which Baltic had selected as a convenient storage facility pending arrival of SKULPTOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-5\">During the Refreshing Pause between arrival of the container and arrival of SKULPTOR, the vessel\u2019s agent prepared a Bill of Lading<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and hired Shippers Stevedoring, Inc., to load the soft drink container on board SKULPTOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-6\"><em>Pepsi Cola Hits the Spot </em>\u2014 On <em>the Pavement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1319-7\">As one of the Stevedore\u2019s employees was lifting the container, with the use of a forklift, he negligently dropped it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By our calculations, 42,120 cans of soft drinks crashed to the ground, never a thirst to quench. In the Crush, the cans were damaged. The stevedore, no doubt, was in no mood to have a Coke and a smile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-8\">\n<em>Dr. Pepper at 10, 2 and \u00a7 1S04</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-9\">Croft &amp; Scully sued Goodpasture, Shippers Stevedoring, and SKULPTOR and her owners to pick up the Tab for its damages. The District Court dismissed the suit as to Goodpasture because it had no agency relationship with Shippers Stevedoring. Relying upon a so-called Himalaya Clause in the Bill of Lading<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, it granted the remaining defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and, finding that the container constituted a \u201cpackage\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4(5) of\u2019 COGSA,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> limited Shippers Stevedoring\u2019s liability to $500. Croft &amp; Scully appeals. Things Go Better on appeal, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-19\">\n<em>A Peek at the Himalaya Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1319-20\">Croft &amp; Scully asserts that the Himalaya Clause limiting recovery to $500 violates public policy. That claim .fails to make the grade, given our decision in <em>Brown &amp; Root v. M/V PEISANDER, </em>648 F.2d 415,-A.M.C.-(5th Cir. 1981), upholding such a clause. Indeed, the conflict which we surmounted there does not even arise in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Clause 17 of the Bill of Lading makes clear provision for an increased valuation at a higher freight rate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A more unequivocal declaration, in fact, one could not find. As Croft &amp; Scully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>could have availed itself of extra loss or damage protection but chose not to, the District Court correctly ruled that the Himalaya Clause applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-4\">\n<em>Don\u2019t Judge The Package By Its Appearance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-5\">Even if liability is limited to $500 per package, Croft &amp; Scully argues, the cardboard cases of soft drinks rather than the 20-foot container should constitute the relevant \u201cpackage\u201d. Shippers Stevedoring responds with equal fervor that the container is the \u201cpackage\u201d. Their argument, we think, given the recent decision in <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Inversiones Navieras Imparca, </em>646 F.2d 169,-A.M.C.-(5th Cir. 1981), holds no water, carbonated or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">We begin by pointing out that COGSA does not apply by its own force and effect, since the incident occurred in the yard and not on the vessel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rather,' the Bill of Lading incorporates COGSA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, its provisions are merely terms of the contract of carriage which, like any other contractual terms, call out for judicial interpretation in case of dispute. <em>Commonwealth Petrochemicals, Inc. v. S/S Puerto Rico, </em>607 F.2d 322, 1979 A.M.C. 2772 (4th Cir. 1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJR\">We have held that when COGSA does not apply of its own force but is incorporated into a maritime contract by reference, it does not have \u2018statute rank\u2019; rather, it is merely part of the contract, a term like any other. ... In <em>Pannell v. United States Lines Co., </em>263 F.2d 497, 498 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>359 U.S. 1013 [, 79 S.Ct. 1151, 3 L.Ed.2d 1037] (1959), the ... Second Circuit held that when COGSA does not apply ex <em>proprio vigore, </em>effect should be given to the parties\u2019 definition of package even if that definition is contrary to that which would control if COG-SA were directly applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1320-14\">607 F.2d at 325, 1979 A.M.C. at 2776. In <em>Pannell, </em>the Court explained: \u201cWhere a statute is incorporated by reference its provisions are merely terms of the contract evidenced by the bill of lading.\u201d 263 F.2d at 498, 1959 A.M.C. at 936; <em>see also General Motors Corp. v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>357 F.Supp. 646, 651 n.6 (S.D.N.Y.1973); <em>U. S. v. Central Gulf Steamship Co., </em>340 F.Supp. 473, 479 (E.D.La.), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>456 F.2d 1281 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-15\">The District Court further observed that the Fifth Circuit had not established a test to determine what constitutes a \u201cpackage\u201d under COGSA. Since the date of its order, this Court has formulated such a test in whose good hands the parties \u2014 and the District Court \u2014 must rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-16\"><em>Allstate </em>involved the loss of 341 cartons of stereo equipment. The shipper loaded the cartons inside a container, sealed it, and had its agent deliver it to the carrier. The carrier issued a Bill of Lading which described the contents both in number and in kind.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the container arrived in Venezuela, it was as empty as a can of soda on a hot summer day. The shipper sought recovery for its full damages, but the carrier, relying on COGSA, sought shelter in the $500 limitation. Although the District Court concluded that the container was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>COGSA package, the winds of judicial change Schwepped away the $500 shelter and exposed the carrier to full liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">Judge Anderson, writing for the Court, after reviewing the history of COGSA and decisions in other Circuits, found that each stereo carton was a discrete \u201cpackage\u201d. He based his decision on a case in the Second Circuit, <em>Mitsui &amp; Co. v. American Export Lines, </em>636 F.2d 807,-A.M.C.-(2nd Cir. 1981). There Judge Friendly expressly rejected as unworkable and unsound the old \u201cfunctional economics\u201d test,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> propounded in <em>Royal Typewriter Co., Division of Litton Business Systems Inc. v. M/V Kulmerland, </em>483 F.2d 645, 1974 A.M.C. 1784 (2nd Cir. 1973). Instead, relying on dicta in <em>Leather\u2019s Best, Inc. v. SS Mormaclynx, </em>451 F.2d 800, 815, 1971 A.M.C. 2383, 2402 (2nd Cir. 1971), he looked to see whether the carrier had clear, unequivocal notice of the container\u2019s contents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-8\">Clearly the goal of international uniformity is better served by the approach in <em>Leather\u2019s Best </em>that generally a container supplied by the carrier is not a COGSA package if its contents and the number of packages or units are disclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">636 F.2d at 821, - A.M.C. at -.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">We find nothing in the Bill of Lading to indicate that the contracting parties intended some special meaning of the term \u201cpackage\u201d. Since Croft &amp; Scully included information about the contents of the container and their number, <em>Allstate </em>governs. Therefore, the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on the \u201cpackage\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">\n<em>Customary Freight Unit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AK7\">Even if the container was not a COGSA \u201cpackage\u201d, Shippers Stevedoring contends, the Court should uphold the $500 award because the container was a \u201ccustomary freight unit\u201d within the ambit of \u00a7 4(5) of COGSA, and thus the Himalaya Clause still applies. At the outset, we reject Croft &amp; Scully\u2019s argument that Shippers Stevedoring waived this point in the trial below.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The District Court, of course, never considered the issue, given its conclusion that the container was a \u201cpackage\u201d, but in the light of our decision that <em>Allstate </em>super-cedes the District Court\u2019s finding, we must necessarily address this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-15\">Turning to other Courts\u2019 interpretations of this clause, we find few cases but a fairly definite rule. In <em>Waterman S.S. Corp. v. United States S. R. &amp; M. Co., </em>155 F.2d 687, 1946 A.M.C. 997 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>329 U.S. 761, 67 S.Ct. 115, 91 L.Ed. 656 (1946), the earliest case in this Circuit, the Court, citing <em>The Bill, </em>55 F.Supp. 780, 783, 1944 A.M.C. 883 (D.Md.1944), <em>aff\u2019d., Lorentzen v. Brazil Oiticica, Inc., </em>145 F.2d 470 (4th Cir. 1944), held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1321-16\">[T]he phrase \u2018per customary freight unit\u2019 in this context in the light of its legislative history, refers to the <em>unit of quantity, weight or measurement </em>of the cargo customarily used as the basis for the calculation of the freight rate to be charged. Generally, in marine contracts, the word \u2018freight\u2019 is used to denote remuneration or reward for carriage of goods by ship, rather than the goods themselves. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avdu\">155 F.2d at 693, 1944 A.M.C. at 887 [citations omitted and emphasis supplied].</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-17\"><em>Caterpillar Americas Co. v. S/S Sea Roads, </em>231 F.Supp. 647, 1964 A.M.C. 2646 (S.D.Fla.1964), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>364 F.2d 829 (5th Cir. 1966), held that the \u201ccustomary freight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>unit\u201d was a tractor and its parts rather than hundredweight units, \u201cregardless of the harshness or seeming illogic of such a result\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-4\">With respect to the words \u2018customary freight unit\u2019, the authorities are conclusive that this phrase refers to the <em>unit upon which the charge for freight is computed </em>and not to the physical shipping unit. As thus construed, the statute gives the court the task of determining what unit was actually used by the carrier for computing the freight charge on the shipment in question. Under the statute the freight unit, if one exists, will control the question of limitation of liability, unless the freight unit employed was a mere sham, and, therefore, not a \u2018customary\u2019 unit within the meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">231 F.Supp. at 649-650, 1964 A.M.C. at 2648. <em>Accord, General Motors Corporation v. S/S Mormacoak, </em>327 F.Supp. 666, 669, 1971 A.M.C. 2647 (S.D.N.Y.1971), <em>aff\u2019d., </em>451 F.2d 24 (2nd Cir. 1971) (entire power plant was the customary freight unit).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">From these cases, we deduce that \u201ccustomary freight unit\u201d is a question of fact that will vary from contract to contract. Of particular importance in this as in any contractual dispute, then, is the parties\u2019 intent, as expressed in the Bill of Lading, applicable tariff, and perhaps elsewhere. Indeed, the District Court so recognized: \u201cFurther, consideration of the intent of the parties is particularly, although not exclusively, appropriate where, as in the instant cause, COGSA does not apply of its own force.\u201d 508 F.Supp. at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">Although Croft &amp; Scully admitted that the freight charge was $2200, calculated on a \u201cflat container rate\u201d, we do not know how the parties arrived at that rate. Does it depend upon the contents, weight, value, custom of the trade, applicable tariffs, if any, or other factors? The District Court must consider these questions on remand. If it finds that the container was a \u201ccustomary freight unit\u201d, then the Court should reinstate the $500 limitation of liability. If not, then it should hold further proceedings to determine the amount of damages. We, of course, express no opinion concerning the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">\n<em>Recap</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Goodpasture and its conclusion that the Himalaya Clause applies. We reverse its grant of summary judgment for Shippers Stevedoring and its finding that the steel container was a COGSA package. As the District Judge never reached the important factual question whether the container of soft drink cartons was a \u201ccustomary freight unit\u201d, we remand for further inquiry into the facts and for consideration of the parties\u2019 intent, factors that will guide the trial Court in determining the meaning of that COGSA clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1319-10\">.

Although Shippers Stevedoring did not raise this point in its brief in support of summary judgment, it devoted several pages to that argument in its Reply to Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Brief, filed with the District Court on August 19, 1980, prior to the Court\u2019s ruling.
