In his case against the superintendent of the institution in which he is incarcerated, plaintiff seeks habeas corpus relief on the ground that the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision (the board) has set a release date for him in 2018, but, when sentence reduction credits that he has earned under ORS 421.121 for appropriate institutional behavior (earned-time credits) are taken into account, his release date has passed; therefore, his continued incarceration is unlawful. In his administrative rule challenge, plaintiff argues that, to the extent that certain Department of Corrections (DOC) rules pertaining to the granting of earned-time sentence reductions are construed to exclude him from eligibility for such reductions, they are invalid.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons explained below, we conclude that, although \u2014 in light of precedent that this court will follow based on principles of <em>stare decisis </em>\u2014 plaintiff is entitled to have his term of incarceration reduced by earned-time credits, he is not entitled to habeas corpus relief, because the board has not yet performed its prerelease functions under ORS 144.125. We also conclude that it is unnecessary to address plaintiff\u2019s rule challenge. Accordingly, we dismiss plaintiff\u2019s petitions in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">These cases come to us with a distinctive and complex background. To set the stage for our discussion of the issues before us, we summarize the pertinent history of the extensive litigation between the parties. Plaintiff committed aggravated murder in 1990, when he was 15 years old. He was tried as an adult. He was convicted of that crime, and the trial court sentenced him to life in prison with a 30-year mandatory minimum term of imprisonment under ORS 163.105(l)(c) (1989). Plaintiff appealed, arguing, among other things, that the sentence that the trial court imposed was unlawful because ORS 161.620 (1989) prohibited trial courts from imposing a mandatory minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>sentence on any person who had been remanded from the juvenile court and was under 17 years of age when he or she committed the crime on which the remand was based. The Court of Appeals agreed with that argument and vacated the sentence. <em>State v. Engweiler, </em>118 Or App 132, 136, 846 P2d 1163, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 486 (1993) <em>(Engweiler I).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In 1994, plaintiff was resentenced to life in prison. In 1999, the board conducted a prison term hearing on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, under rules that it had adopted earlier that year, the \u201cJuvenile Aggravated Murder\u201d or so-called \u201cJAM\u201d rules. At the conclusion of that hearing, the board issued an order establishing a 480-month murder review date.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Plaintiff sought judicial review of that order. The Court of Appeals held that the board\u2019s order setting the review date was not subject to judicial review, <em>Engweiler v. Board of Parole, </em>197 Or App 43, 103 P3d 1201 (2005) <em>(Engweiler II), </em>and this court affirmed that decision. <em>Engweiler v. Board of Parole, </em>340 Or 361, 133 P3d 910 (2006) <em>(Engweiler </em>777). Plaintiff next sought a writ of mandamus ordering DOC to accelerate his 480-month review date based on earned-time credits in accordance with ORS 421.121(1). <em>State ex rel Engweiler v. Cook, </em>340 Or 373, 133 P3d 904 (2006) <em>(Engweiler IV). </em>In that case, this court stated that the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d in ORS 421.121(1) refers to \u201cthe amount of time that an inmate must spend in prison before the inmate is eligible for parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380. The court further held that, although the review date amounted to a 480-month \u201cprison term\u201d for plaintiff under the JAM rules, the board had not, at that point, given him a release date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and, therefore, he did not yet have a term of incarceration under ORS 421.121(1) against which earned-time reductions could be credited. <em>Id. </em>at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Thereafter, in <em>Engweiler V, </em>this court answered certified questions from the United States District Court for Oregon pertaining to the operation and effects of the JAM rules. In doing so, the court observed, as it had earlier in <em>Engweiler IV, </em>that, after the adoption of the sentencing guidelines system in 1989, juveniles who commit aggravated murder are <em>\u201ca </em>small class of inmates who continued to receive indeterminate sentences,\u201d <em>Engweiler IV, </em>340 Or at 381, and who, under ORS 161.620 (1989), were entitled to parole consideration. <em>Engweiler V, </em>343 Or at 545. However, the court ultimately rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that the prison terms set by the board under the JAM rules were \u201cmandatory minimum sentences\u201d within the meaning of, and therefore prohibited by, ORS 161.620 (1989). <em>Id. </em>at 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Plaintiff later brought a mandamus action in this court to compel the board to conduct a hearing and establish an initial release date for him under ORS 144.120(l)(a) (1989). In deciding that case, this court reiterated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201cin <em>Engweiler TV, </em>this court described [plaintiff\u2019s] sentence as \u2018life imprisonment with the possibility of release or parole\u2019 and observed that [plaintiff] was in the same position as an inmate serving an indeterminate sentence before the adoption of the guidelines sentencing scheme: The board is responsible for determining the actual duration of his imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\"><em>Engweiler VII, </em>350 Or at 607. The court concluded in <em>Engweiler VII </em>that ORS 144.120(l)(a) applied to juveniles convicted of aggravated murder and that it required the board to conduct parole hearings for those juveniles. <em>Id. </em>at 621. The court further concluded that the JAM rules requiring juveniles convicted of aggravated murder to undergo an intermediate process before they become eligible for parole consideration exceeded the board\u2019s rulemaking authority and were invalid because they were inconsistent with the statutes requiring the board to conduct a parole hearing and set an initial release date for that category of offenders, unless the board declines to do so under ORS 144.120(4). <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>at 627. The court ultimately concluded, however, that plaintiff was not entitled to the remedy of mandamus, because the board had no plain legal duty to set a release date given the terms of ORS 144.120(4), which permitted the board not to set a release date where it was able to explain why it had chosen not to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 628-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In the wake of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Engweiler VII, </em>the board set plaintiff\u2019s initial parole release date for February 2018. At plaintiff\u2019s request, on August 9, 2012, DOC\u2019s sentence computation unit calculated his earned-time credit to be 1,929.75 days. According to plaintiff, when added to his credit for time served, that earned time calculation meant that he should have been released from physical custody on July 17, 2012.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In essence, plaintiff asserts that his earned-time credits function to advance his initial release date set by the board and that his new release date already has passed, effectively requiring his immediate release. To date, however, plaintiff remains in physical custody at the Oregon State Correctional Institute (OSCI), a facility within DOC.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">To press his claim, plaintiff filed both this direct habeas corpus proceeding and this administrative rule challenge under ORS 183.400 against certain rules adopted by DOC. In December 2012, this court issued an order to defendant Persson, the superintendent of OSCI, to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not be issued. Defendants filed a response, and the parties\u2019 positions, as joined in their briefs, are elaborated in greater detail below.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">ORS 421.121 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">\u201c(1) Except as provided in ORS 137.635, each inmate sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections for felonies committed on or after November 1,1989, is eligible for a reduction in the term of incarceration for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201c(a) Appropriate institutional behavior, as defined by rule of the Department of Corrections [.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The first question before us is whether, despite the fact that plaintiff was convicted of aggravated murder and received an indeterminate sentence for that conviction, this court already has authoritatively decided that he is entitled to a reduction in a \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d based on appropriate institutional behavior \u2014 that is, earned time\u2014 under ORS 421.121(l)(a). Plaintiff contends that this court so decided in <em>Engweiler IV. </em>Defendants respond that this court\u2019s pronouncements on that issue in <em>Engweiler TV </em>were <em>dicta </em>and that, even if they were part of the holding in that case, they were erroneous and should be disavowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">As discussed above, in <em>Engweiler TV, </em>this court stated that the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d in ORS 421.121(1) refers to \u201cthe amount of time that an inmate must spend in prison before the inmate is eligible for parole.\u201d 340 Or at 380. Although defendants contend that that statement ought to be treated as <em>dictum, </em>for the reasons explained below, we conclude that it was a foundational element of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Engweiler TV </em>and therefore was part of the holding in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">After the board established a 480-month prison term for plaintiff pursuant to the JAM rules, plaintiff sought to compel DOC to credit his earned time against his \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d under ORS 421.121(1). <em>Engweiler TV, </em>340 Or at 375. In that case, plaintiff and DOC disputed the meaning of the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d in ORS 421.121(1). The first question presented to this court by plaintiff in <em>Engweiler TV </em>was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201cIs an inmate who is serving a life sentence for a crime committed on or after November 1, 1989, eligible for a reduction in his or her \u2018term of incarceration\u2019 pursuant to ORS 421.121(1)?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">In his opening brief, plaintiff first pointed to the text of ORS 421.121(1). After noting that the only exception set out in that provision did not apply to him, plaintiff argued that \u201cthe express and unambiguous terms of ORS 421.121(1) make [plaintiff] eligible for a reduction in the term of incarceration for appropriate institutional behavior.\u201d Plaintiff then discussed the statutory context of ORS 421.121(1), observing that ORS 421.121(2) also used the phrase \u201cterm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of incarceration,\u201d while contemporaneously amended ORS 421.120 (1989), which applies to offenses committed before November 1, 1989, instead used the phrase \u201cterm of sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a footnote, plaintiff indicated that the legislative history to HB 2250 (1989) \u2014 the bill that enacted ORS 421.121 \u2014 did not discuss any exceptions to ORS 421.121(1), nor did the legislature define the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The second question that plaintiff presented to this court in <em>Engweiler TV </em>was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201cWith respect to an inmate serving a life sentence for a crime committed on or after November 1, 1989, does the phrase \u2018term of incarceration\u2019 in ORS 421.121(1) mean the \u2018sentence\u2019 that was imposed by the trial court, or does it mean the \u2018prison term\u2019 that was established by the [board]?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Plaintiff argued that the \u201cprison term\u201d imposed by the board was synonymous with \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d under ORS 421.121(1). The defendants argued that \u201cterm of incarceration,\u201d as used in that statute, meant \u201cthe incarcerative term that a court can or does impose, and not a term that is set by the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">With respect to the first question presented in <em>Engweiler TV, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">\u201c[W]e observe that there is no dispute concerning the following: (1) petitioner was \u2018sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections\u2019 for a felony committed after November 1, 1989; (2) ORS 421.121(1) applies to \u2018each inmate\u2019 so sentenced, subject only to an exception not applicable here; (3) ORS 421.121 contains no explicit exception for inmates convicted of any particular crimes, including aggravated murder, for inmates not sentenced under the sentencing guidelines, or for inmates sentenced to life imprisonment; and (4) the phrase \u2018each inmate * * * <em>shall be eligible </em>for a reduction in the term of incarceration\u2019 (emphasis added) indicates that DOC\u2019s duty to reduce the \u2018term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of incarceration\u2019 is mandatory for each inmate who meets the criteria for such reductions elsewhere described in ORS 421.121.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">340 Or at 377-78 (emphasis in original). With respect to the second question, this court agreed with plaintiff that the board was responsible for establishing his \u201cterm of incarceration.\u201d The court held that \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d refers to the amount of time that an inmate must spend in prison before the inmate is eligible for parole. 340 Or at 380. However, the court rejected plaintiff\u2019s contention that his \u201cprison term\u201d established under the JAM rules constituted a \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d under ORS 421.121. 340 Or at 383-84. In reaching that conclusion, the court explained that the 480-month \u201cprison term\u201d meant only that the board would conduct a murder review hearing at the conclusion of that period \u201cand, if [plaintiff] is considered an appropriate candidate, the board will set a release date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. The court further concluded that, \u201cif the board does set [plaintiff\u2019s] parole release date, it also will have defined his \u2018term of incarceration.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383. Because the board was not a party to <em>Engweiler TV, </em>and because plaintiff had confined his mandamus claim \u201cto the theory that he was entitled to have the credits deducted from his next hearing date,\u201d the court\u2019s construction of \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d meant that, at that time, there was not yet any date against which plaintiff\u2019s earned time could be credited. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Again, the threshold question before us is whether, in light of the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion in <em>Engweiler TV </em>that plaintiff was not entitled to immediate release, the court\u2019s intermediate conclusion that \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d under ORS 421.121 refers to \u201cthe amount of time that an inmate must spend in prison before the inmate is eligible for parole,\u201d bears precedential weight or is <em>dictum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">This court may consider itself bound to follow a prior statutory construction as a matter of <em>stare decisis. Farmers Ins. Co. v. Mowry, </em>350 Or 686, 695-96, 261 P3d 1 (2011). When the court\u2019s prior construction is mere <em>dictum, </em>however, it has no such precedential effect. <em>See, e.g, Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 692 n 8, 159 P3d 1151 (2007) (\u201cThis court has declined to treat a prior interpretation of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>statute as authoritative when it is dictum.\u201d); <em>SAIF v. Allen, </em>320 Or 192, 204, 881 P2d 773 (1994) (same). \u201cDictum\u201d is short for <em>\u201cobiter </em>dictum,\u201d Latin for \u201csomething said in passing.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1102 (8th ed 2004). Injudicial opinions, it commonly refers to a statement that is not necessary to the court\u2019s decision. <em>See State ex rel Huddleston v. Sawyer, </em>324 Or 597, 621 n 19, 932 P2d 1145 (1997) (\u201c[T]hat statement [was] <em>dictum, </em>because it was not necessary to the outcome of the case.\u201d); <em>State v. Smith, </em>301 Or 681, 696 n 10, 725 P2d 894 (1986) (\u201c[T]he statement is not necessary to the decision in the case and is <em>dictum.\u201d). </em>Occasionally, it can be difficult to identify <em>dictum </em>in a court\u2019s opinion, because nonessential legal analysis and the assertions of immaterial legal propositions can be shrouded by the certitude of the court\u2019s views. As Justice Cardozo once said, <em>\u201c[DJicta </em>are not always ticketed as such, and one does not recognize them always at a glance.\u201d Benjamin N. Cardozo, <em>The Nature of the Judicial Process </em>30 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In this case, however, the task is not so difficult. Although the ultimate issue in <em>Engweiler TV </em>was whether plaintiff was entitled to immediate release from prison, the resolution of that issue depended on two foundational inquiries. As discussed, the first question before this court was whether \u201can inmate who is serving a life sentence for a crime committed on or after November 1, 1989, [is] eligible for a reduction in his or her \u2018term of incarceration\u2019 pursuant to ORS 421.121(1).\u201d As defendants assert, this court could have answered that question merely by concluding that \u201cthe phrase \u2018term of incarceration\u2019 implies some defined period of incarceration ending in some form of release\u201d and that \u201can order setting a review date is, therefore, not sufficient to create a term of incarceration.\u201d However, the ability to avoid fully deciding an issue before it \u2014 as sometimes occurs when a court \u201cassumes without deciding\u201d or engages in \u201ceven if\u201d analysis \u2014 does not require a court to do so at the risk of making <em>dictum </em>out of its complete resolution of the issue. In proceeding as it did in <em>Engweiler IV, </em>this court decided the issues presented to it in a logical order and manner of analysis, including its determination of the meaning of the disputed phrase in ORS 421.121. Because the court\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d in <em>Engweiler IV </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>was a predicate for the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, we decline to treat it as dictum.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">We next consider whether we should follow the decision in <em>Engwe\u00fcer IV </em>in these cases based on the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>As noted in <em>Mowry, </em>\u201c[stability and predictability are important values in the law.\u201d 350 Or at 698. Because of the importance of those values, we will not overrule prior decisions \u201csimply because the personal policy preferences of the members of the court may differ from those of our predecessors who decided the earlier case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). At the same time, this court has an obligation to reach what we regard as a correct interpretation of statutes and rules. Indeed, we are so obliged whether or not the correct interpretation has even been advanced by the parties. <em>See Stull v. Hoke, </em>326 Or 72, 77, 948 P2d 722 (1997) (so stating). Particularly when we \u201cfailed to apply our usual framework for decision or adequately analyze the controlling issue,\u201d we must be open to reconsidering earlier case law. <em>Mowry, </em>350 Or at 698. However, \u201cwe begin with the assumption that issues considered in our prior cases are correctly decided.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In <em>Mowry, </em>this court noted that, depending on the presenting circumstances, various factors can play a role in a court\u2019s determination whether to reconsider its decision in a previous case. <em>Id. </em>at 693-99. In this case, the parties have advanced several considerations that are germane to our analysis. As noted, defendants argue that this court\u2019s analysis of ORS 421.121(1) in <em>Engwe\u00fcer IV </em>was deficient because it did not follow the court\u2019s accepted methodology for statutory construction. In particular, defendants assert that, in <em>Engwe\u00fcer IV,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201cthis court failed to consider pertinent arguments and failed to apply the correct framework in making its decision. Specifically, this court did not consider several pieces of relevant context, and it failed to apply the correct standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>for assessing ambiguity in a statute. As explained above, although the phrase \u2018term of incarceration\u2019 plausibly could refer to a parole release date, that is not the only reasonable interpretation. Consequently, the statute is ambiguous. Because this court failed to acknowledge any ambiguity in the statute, it did not consider legislative history or other construction aids. The history and other interpretation aids confirm DOC\u2019s interpretation of ORS 421.121\u2019s meaning: earned time credits under that statute do not apply to advance parole release dates set by the board. This court should revisit and reject its prior conclusion to the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Although defendants are correct in observing that the statutory construction analysis in which this court engaged in <em>Engweiler TV </em>was not extensive, it is inaccurate to say that the court did not follow its accepted statutory construction methodology. The parties briefed and argued the case, including the issue at hand, based on their respective analyses of the text and context of ORS 421.121(1), and the court did the same. As always, our goal was to determine the meaning of the statute that the legislature that enacted it most likely intended. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and </em>Industries, 317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">It is true that this court in <em>Engweiler TV </em>did not have before it the legislative history that defendants have proffered in this case. It is also true that, based on the statutory construction methodology that the court followed when <em>Engweiler TV </em>was decided, this court generally did not consider legislative history unless it had determined that the statute at issue was ambiguous. <em>See PGE, </em>317 Or at 611-12. And it is true that we are no longer constrained from considering legislative history in the absence of a determination that a statute is ambiguous. Thus, in interpreting a statute, the parties may present legislative history to the court, and the court will give it the weight that it deems appropriate. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 165-73, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (analyzing ORS 174.020). That discretion notwithstanding, this court has emphasized that, in determining the meaning of a statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\u201cthere is no more persuasive evidence of the intent of the legislature than the words by which the legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes. Only the text of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>statute receives the consideration and approval of a majority of the members of the legislature, as required to have the effect of law. The formal requirements of lawmaking produce the best source from which to discern the legislature\u2019s intent, for it is not the intent of the individual legislators that governs, but the intent of the legislature as formally enacted into law[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><em>Gaines, </em>346 Or at 171 (citations and. internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In <em>Engweiler IV, </em>the defendants did not assert that ORS 421.121(1) was ambiguous, and the court did not conclude that it was. Neither does it appear that the legislative history that defendants now proffer was provided to this court in <em>Engweiler TV. </em>We nevertheless consider it for the sole purpose of determining whether our analysis in that case was sufficiently deficient so as to warrant its reexamination. We conclude that, although the material that defendants have submitted would be germane to a freshly undertaken statutory construction analysis, it does not demonstrate that reexamination of the decision in <em>Engweiler TV </em>is appropriate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To explain why, we briefly reiterate the issue at hand. As discussed, plaintiff\u2019s claims in <em>Engweiler TV </em>and in these cases were and are based on ORS 421.121(1). The issue is whether, under that statute, plaintiff is entitled to have earned-time sentence reduction credits applied to his initial parole release date, because that date fixes his \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d under ORS 421.121(1). Defendants argue that the phrase \u201cterm of incarceration\u201d is confined to terms imposed by a court, not by the board, and that, in <em>Engweiler TV, </em>this court failed to apply the correct standard for resolving ambiguity in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In particular, defendants note that, in endorsing the bill that would create the sentencing guidelines, the Oregon Criminal Justice Council explained that the \u201ccurrent parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>function\u201d would need to be \u201cretained for offenders convicted of Aggravated Murder\u201d because that crime is \u201cexcluded from the guidelines system.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 1073, May 5,1989, Ex A (statement of Oregon Criminal Justice Council). Second, defendants rely on a bill summary for what would become ORS 421.121(1), in which the council explained that the \u201cnew good-time program\u201d provides for a \u201cprison-term reduction for appropriate institutional behavior for all offenders sentenced under the guidelines.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee, SB 1073, June 15,1989, Ex D at 13. From those materials, defendants reason that ORS 421.121(1) applies only to offenders sentenced by courts under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Defendants have a point to make, but there is a reasonable competing view. Although it is undisputed that sentencing for aggravated murder is excluded from the sentencing guidelines system, ORS 421.121(1) is expressly conditional on the date of commission of the crime, not on any particular sentencing scheme. The fact that the bill summary confirmed that ORS 421.121(1) applies to court-sentenced offenders under the guidelines system \u2014 who undoubtedly constitute the vast majority of inmates to whom the statute applies \u2014 does not necessarily mean that it is inapplicable to inmates under the board\u2019s parole release authority who committed aggravated murder on or after the relevant date. In short, the material that defendants have proffered does not demonstrate that reexamination of this court\u2019s analysis in <em>Engweiler IV </em>is appropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">As we observed in <em>Mowry,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cStability and predictability are important values in the law; individuals and institutions act in reliance on this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>decisions, and to frustrate reasonable expectations based on prior decisions creates the potential for uncertainty, confusion and unfairness. Moreover, lower courts depend on consistency in this court\u2019s decisions in deciding the myriad cases that come before them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><em>Mowry, </em>350 Or at 698. In the circumstances here, when balanced against the considerations that defendants invoke,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the principles of stability and consistency bear the greater weight in the calculus. Accordingly, although other factors could play a role in the analysis in different circumstances, we decline to revisit our holding in <em>Engweiler TV.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We turn, then, to the ultimate issue: Whether plaintiff is entitled to immediate release. As noted, plaintiff\u2019s habeas corpus petition proceeds on two premises. First, he contends that earned-time credits should have advanced his initial parole release date that has been set by the board. Second, he asserts that, because that adjusted release date has passed, he is entitled to immediate release. Even though we do not revisit the holding in <em>Engweiler TV </em>on which plaintiff\u2019s first premise is based, plaintiff\u2019s second premise fails, for reasons that we will explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">ORS 144.245(1) provides that, when the parole board \u201chas set a date on which a prisoner is to be released upon parole, the prisoner shall be released on that date unless the prisoner on that date remains subject to an unexpired minimum term.\u201d Notwithstanding that mandatory wording, however, ORS 144.125 also provides that, \u201c[p]rior to the scheduled release of any prisoner on parole * * * the [parole board] may *** interview the prisoner\u201d to review the prisoner\u2019s suitability for release. ORS 144.125(1). If the board makes certain findings, the board may defer parole release. ORS 144.125(2) - (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>Plaintiff contends that the \u201cscheduled release\u201d referred to in ORS 144.125 is the same as the \u201cinitial parole release date\u201d set by the board pursuant to ORS 144.120 and that his initial parole release date \u2014 as adjusted by the application of earned time credits \u2014 has passed. Therefore, he asserts, DOC is required to order his release pursuant to ORS 144.245, and it is too late for the board to defer release under ORS 144.125(2) to (4). Plaintiff is mistaken. As we will explain, although the board has set plaintiff\u2019s initial release date in 2018, it has not yet scheduled his physical release from custody, taking into account his earned time credits, and plaintiff, therefore, does not yet have a \u201cscheduled release date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">This court confronted a similar situation in <em>Janowski v. Board of Parole, </em>349 Or 432, 245 P3d 1270 (2010). In that case, the petitioner was sentenced under a former version of ORS 163.105 that required imposition of at least a life sentence with a 30-year minimum prison term on a conviction for aggravated murder. In addition, under that scheme, after serving 20 years of such a term, the offender was entitled to a hearing before the board; if the board found that the offender was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time, it was required to eliminate the 30-year minimum prison term. In Janowski4 the board held the hearing required by ORS 163.105 (1985), and it found that the petitioner was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time. It entered an order to that effect, but it set his release date at the conclusion of his 30-year mandatory minimum sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 436-38. The petitioner challenged the board\u2019s decision, arguing that the board\u2019s finding had the effect of overriding \u2014 and thus eliminating \u2014 his 30-year mandatory minimum sentence. This court agreed, ruling that the petitioner\u2019s 30-year minimum had effectively been set aside. Because the petitioner then was left with an indeterminate life sentence, this court instructed the board to set his parole release date in accordance with the matrix system that was in effect when he committed his crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">By the time that the court issued its opinion, however, the matrix-based initial release date that could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>imposed for the petitioner already had passed. Thus, the petitioner argued that he must be immediately released on parole. In particular, he argued that, under ORS 144.245, when the board \u201chas set a date on which a prisoner is to be released upon parole, the prisoner shall be released on that date\u201d and that, because his matrix-based release date was in the past, it was too late for the board to defer his release under ORS 144.125(1). <em>Id. </em>at 456, 459. This court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument and concluded that, even though he had already reached and passed his matrix-based release date, the board still was authorized to conduct an interview and defer his release, if appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201cORS 144.125(1) (1985) provides that, \u2018prior to the scheduled release of any prisoner,\u2019 the board may interview the prisoner to determine if any of the statutory grounds for postponement of a parole release date are present. The phrase \u2018scheduled release\u2019 is not defined in the statute or in the applicable regulations. However, the plain and natural meaning of that phrase is the date that the board ultimately schedules for the prisoner\u2019s release. Again, in this case, [the petitioner] still is incarcerated; the board has not yet scheduled his release. Once the board sets [the petitioner\u2019s] release date, it will have an opportunity to interview him to determine whether any of the grounds for postponement of his release are present.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 459 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">This court\u2019s resolution of the issue in <em>Janowski </em>controls here. ORS 144.125 authorizes the board to conduct its prerelease interview any time before the \u201cscheduled\u201d release of the inmate. In common usage, \u201cschedule\u201d means to \u201cdesignate to do * * * something at a fixed time in the future.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2028. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s argument in <em>Janowski </em>\u2014 that because his matrix-based release date had passed, the board had missed its opportunity to conduct a prerelease interview \u2014 was incorrect. At the time of this court\u2019s decision, the board had not scheduled the petitioner\u2019s release. Therefore, the board necessarily would be required to schedule the petitioner\u2019s release for a future date and would have an opportunity to conduct its interview before that scheduled date.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s situation is identical. Plaintiff\u2019s current scheduled release date is in 2018. Even though the application of earned time credits appears to advance plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinitial release date\u201d to a date in the past, the board cannot \u201cschedule\u201d his physical release for a date in the past. Thus, plaintiff\u2019s physical release necessarily will be scheduled for a future date. And, before that date, the board will have the opportunity to conduct its prerelease interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Plaintiff protests that the position of the petitioner in <em>Janowski </em>was different in a key way: he committed his crime in 1985, before the sentencing guidelines were adopted and the parole system was replaced with post-prison supervision as the post-incarceration part of a defendant\u2019s sentence. Therefore, the petitioner in <em>Janowski </em>was subject to the parole regime set out in ORS 144.125. Plaintiff, by contrast, committed his crime in 1990, after the sentencing guidelines were adopted. According to plaintiff, the judgment in his case correctly stated that his release, if any, would be to post-prison supervision. And, he argues, no exit interview is required before release to post-prison supervision. Plaintiff is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">This court has repeatedly stated that plaintiff\u2019s entitlement, if any, to eventual release will be to parole. The court summarized those holdings as follows in <em>Engweiler VII:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\u201c[I]n <em>Engweiler V, </em>the court also observed, as it had earlier in <em>Engweiler IV, </em>that juvenile aggravated murderers are \u2018a small class of inmates who continued to receive indeterminate sentences,\u2019 <em>Engweiler IV, </em>340 Or at 381, and who are entitled to <em>parole consideration:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201c\u2018ORS 161.620 (1989) trumped [ORS 144.110(2)(b) (1989) and ORS 163.105(1) (1989)] by precluding imposition of the 30-year mandatory minimum sentence otherwise authorized by ORS 163.105(1) (1989) for juveniles who were under age 17 when they committed aggravated murder. Consequently, petitioners must be entitled to the possibility of <em>parole\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\"><em>\u201cEngweiler V, </em>343 Or at 545 [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\u201cFinally, in <em>Engweiler V, </em>this court observed that when Engweiler committed his crime, \u2018none of the board\u2019s existing rules provided either procedural or substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>mechanisms to determine whether and when to <em>parole </em>juvenile aggravated murderers.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 546.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cBased on the foregoing, to resolve the rule challenge and the mandamus cases, this court must decide two questions with regard to each inmate: To what extent has the legislature granted the board authority to make <em>parole release </em>decisions in the case of juvenile aggravated murderers like these inmates? And, if the legislature has granted the board authority to make <em>parole release </em>decisions in these cases, what release procedures and criteria did the legislature intend for the board to apply with regard to each inmate?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">350 Or at 607-08 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">From the foregoing, it is apparent that a necessary premise of each of this court\u2019s previous decisions involving the nature of plaintiff\u2019s sentence and his possible release depended on the conclusion that he is serving an indeterminate life sentence subject to the possibility of parole. Plaintiff has offered no persuasive analysis that would support a different understanding of his circumstances, and we perceive none.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The review process prescribed by ORS 144.125 exists to ensure that offenders are not released to parole unless and until the board is satisfied that their release is consistent with community safety. The legislature expressly made the parole scheme and that review process applicable to aggravated murder \u201cregardless of the date of the crime.\u201d Or Laws 1989, ch 790, \u00a7 28, <em>compiled as a note after </em>ORS 144.110 (1989). Aggravated murder is the most serious offense in Oregon criminal law. <em>State v. Haugen, </em>349 Or 174, 203, 243 P3d 31 (2010). It begs reason to conceive that the legislature would deliberately create a system in which \u2014 irrespective of their age at the time of their crimes \u2014 offenders convicted of aggravated murder would be entitled to parole release without any prior review by the parole board. To the contrary, by expressly making ORS 144.125 applicable to aggravated murder, the legislature demonstrated the opposite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">In sum, we conclude that the board is authorized to \u201cschedule\u201d plaintiff\u2019s release for a future date and to conduct a prerelease hearing under ORS 144.125, notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>that plaintiff\u2019s matrix-based release date, as modified by earned-time sentence reductions, already may have passed. Therefore, plaintiff is not entitled to immediate release.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We turn briefly to the second case that is before us: plaintiff\u2019s rule challenge. Plaintiff challenges certain DOC rules and policies based on ORS 183.400(4)(b), which provides for invalidation of a rule that \u201c[exceeds] the statutory authority of the agency.\u201d In his opening brief, plaintiff takes considerable pains to analyze various DOC rules and policies that, according to plaintiff, might permit DOC \u201cto ignore reductions that inmates serving life sentences have earned in their terms of incarceration.\u201d We decline to address those challenges for two reasons. First, in nearly all instances, plaintiff does not assert that a rule or policy is facially invalid; rather, he repeatedly suggests that, \u201cto the extent that\u201d a rule or policy could be interpreted to deny him earned time credits, it is invalid. Such arguments are not cognizable in a rule challenge under ORS 183.400, and we decline to address them. <em>See AFSCME Local 2623 v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>315 Or 74, 79, 843 P2d 409 (1992) (ORS 183.400 authorizes only facial challenges to agency rules; \u201cthe legality of any particular application of the rules is premature, and not subject to review under ORS 183.400\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Second, our reaffirmation of this court\u2019s prior construction of ORS 421.121(1) forecloses any inconsistent future action by defendants in regard to plaintiff that might be based on a contrary interpretation of DOC rules or policies pertaining to earned time credit entitlement. As noted, it appears to be undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s adjusted release date under ORS 421.121 has now passed. Thus, unsurprisingly, defendants have not made any separate response to plaintiff\u2019s rule challenges; instead, they have focused their efforts on questioning this court\u2019s prior construction of ORS 421.121(1) in <em>Engweiler TV.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Because we have adhered to that prior construction of the statute, DOC\u2019s rules pertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>to earned time credits cannot stand between plaintiff and his release on parole. Defendants do not contend otherwise, and plaintiff has not shown that, in contravention of our construction of ORS 421.121, defendants intend to apply those rules or policies to plaintiff in the ways to which he objects. Rather, as explained above, what now stands between plaintiff and release is the process prescribed by ORS 144.125. Accordingly, we decline to address plaintiff\u2019s rule challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The petition for writ of habeas corpus in case number S060793 is dismissed.
