We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 In\n   <em>\n    Morrison v. People,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121830\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/19/668/\">\n    19 P.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo.2000), our supreme court held that when a defendant's challenge for cause of a juror is improperly denied, and the challenged juror ultimately serves on the jury, the defendant's right to a fair and impartial jury is violated and reversal is required. In Part II, we conclude that\n   <em>\n    Morrison's\n   </em>\n   holding is not affected by the supreme court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    People v.

We therefore apply\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   in this case and conclude that defendant's convictions must be reversed. We also hold, in Part III.A.2.b., as a matter of first impression in Colorado, that a foundation for admission of bank statements under CRE 803(6) may be based on judicial notice of the nature of the business and of the records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Defendant began working for CDL Trucking as a secretary in 2004. Her duties included managing payroll, billing, making deposits, and loading money onto Comdata MasterCard cash cards for truck drivers' use while on the road. In 2005, the CDL owner became suspicious that defendant was stealing money from CDL. Upon reviewing a bank statement, he noticed defendant had signed multiple unauthorized CDL checks payable to herself or to \"cash.\" When the owner confronted defendant with the unauthorized checks, she told him that she would never steal from him and that her ex-husband, also employed by CDL, must have been responsible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 The owner later learned that, in addition to the Comdata card he was aware of and kept in his possession, a second Comdata card had been issued in his name. Records from Comdata showed that defendant had authorized multiple transactions loading money onto the second card, and that the card had been used to make purchases and for cash withdrawals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 The People charged defendant with five counts of theft of $500-$15,000 (series) and two counts of theft of more than $15,000 (series). A jury found her guilty on all counts, and the trial court sentenced her to eight years of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II. Juror Challenge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Defendant contends the trial court erred when it denied her challenges for cause to two jurors who indicated during voir dire that they expected defendant to present evidence in her defense. Defendant further argues that reversal is required because the challenged jurors ultimately sat on the jury. We agree with respect to the first challenged juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Standard of Review and Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 A criminal defendant has the right to a fair trial. U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV ; Colo. Const. art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 25.

That depends, in the first instance, on whether the challenged juror participated in determining the defendant's guilt. Where the challenged juror did not, our supreme court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Novotny\n   </em>\n   requires that a defendant ordinarily must show that a different biased or incompetent juror sat on the jury.\n   <em>\n    People v.

This holding is unaffected by\n   <em>\n    Novotny\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    Novotny\n   </em>\n   applies to situations where the defendant used a peremptory challenge to excuse the previously challenged juror and eventually used all of her peremptory challenges. In that situation, the impairment of the right to an impartial jury arising from participation of the challenged juror has been eliminated. Where, however, the challenged juror participates, that impairment has not been eliminated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Novotny,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 n. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B. The Voir Dire\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 At the beginning of voir dire, the trial court addressed the panel of prospective jurors, informing them that the burden of proof in the case was on the prosecution to prove all the elements of the charged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt and specifying that \"[t]he defendant does not need to prove anything in this case.\" Defense counsel later questioned Juror M:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: [I]f the trial were to begin and you were to hear some evidence from the prosecution that was somewhat damaging, would you then want to hear some kind of explanation from the defense's side of things?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   JUROR M: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: You would. Okay. And one of the important features of the burden of proof is not just that it's a high burden beyond a reasonable doubt, but also that it rests squarely on the shoulders of the prosecution and that legally the defense is not obligated to present any evidence or provide any explanations at all. So my question for you, ... then is would it be difficult for you to-let me rephrase. Do you think that you would maybe shift some of that burden onto the shoulders of the defense once you heard some evidence that was damaging and expect the defense to present some type of evidence refuting it or explaining it or something along those lines?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   JUROR M: Well, I would hope so because that's both sides of the story. And then, you know, as the trial goes on and the witnesses and the whole thing, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Right. If the defense did not present any evidence in this case, would you be able to presume [defendant] innocent until deliberations began?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   JUROR M: I'd have to hear the whole thing. You know, I'm not going to say one way or another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   DEFENSE COUNSEL: Okay. Do you think it could be-so it sounds to-correct me if I'm wrong. It sounds to me that you would expect the defense to present some type of evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   JUROR M: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 12 Defendant challenged Juror M and a second juror for cause because of \"burden shifting and the expectation of the presentation\n   of the case from the defense.\" The prosecutor responded that the jurors \"simply indicated that they would listen to the evidence and make a ruling at the end of the case. Such an argument fails to clearly recognize that cross-examination will present evidence in this case.\" The trial court denied defendant's challenges, ruling\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Each of [the jurors has] indicated to the Court and [they have] convinced the Court that they will listen to all the evidence, they'll follow the law, and only then determine a verdict and that they would base their verdict on the evidence that they hear and the law that I present to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant exhausted her peremptory challenges. She did not excuse Juror M or the second juror, and both jurors were seated on the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 13 Having reviewed the entire voir dire of Juror M with deference, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defendant's challenge for cause. We find support for our conclusion in\n   <em>\n    People v. Hancock,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n    220 P.3d 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo.App.2009). In\n   <em>\n    Hancock,\n   </em>\n   the trial court denied defendant's challenge for cause to a prospective juror who expressed her belief that while the prosecutor had to prove there was no reasonable doubt, it was defense counsel's job to prove that defendant was not guilty.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n    at 1018-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The juror testified that she expected a balance of the evidence and that both parties shared an equal burden.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1018\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 14 The division of this court deciding\n   <em>\n    Hancock\n   </em>\n   concluded that a trial court should do one of three things if a prospective juror indicates an unwillingness to apply the law: (1) dismiss the juror for cause; (2) conduct rehabilitative questioning following up on the juror's concerning statements before denying the challenge for cause; or (3) make findings on the record explaining why the juror's statements indicating an unwillingness or inability to follow the law should be disregarded in light of other seemingly inconsistent statements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n    at 1019-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the trial court conducted no rehabilitative questioning, and made no credibility findings or assessments concerning the prospective juror's demeanor, the division held that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the challenge for cause, and it reversed the defendant's conviction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n    at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 15 In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Hancock,\n   </em>\n   Juror M said that she expected defendant to present evidence in her defense. Neither the prosecutor nor the trial court engaged in any rehabilitative questioning of Juror M to clarify her expectations. The trial court gave no explanation on the record regarding why Juror M's statements should be disregarded.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6996644\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/220/1015/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (to provide a clear record on appeal, the trial court could have explained why a prospective juror's clear statements indicating her inability to follow the law should be disregarded in light of other earlier inconsistent statements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 16 The People, in their answer brief, cite to other portions of the voir dire in support of the trial court's conclusion. We are not persuaded by the People's arguments. The People emphasize that Juror M remained silent when defense counsel asked all prospective panel members if \"anybody [thought] that because we're here and we've spent all day talking to all of you all and interrupted each of your lives that there must be some reason that we're here? That [defendant] must have done something wrong?\" The People also argue that Juror M did not step forward when defense counsel asked all members of the panel to indicate if they had \"a problem with\" the standard of reasonable doubt. Silence, however, does not always constitute an affirmative indication of a juror's ability to follow the law and base her verdict on the evidence presented. Nor does it provide counter-balancing information that rehabilitates a juror and supports a trial court's denial of the challenge for cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v. Clemens,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20COA%20162\">\n    2013 COA 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 15, --- P.3d ---- (\"[W]here a prospective juror has taken a position supporting a challenge for cause, that juror's silence following a question or questions to the entire panel does not constitute sufficient rehabilitation.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 17 Thus, we conclude that the trial court's findings are not supported by the record. Juror M said that if she heard damaging\n   evidence from the prosecution, she would want an explanation from the defense and that she would expect the defense to present some evidence. The record does not contain any statements from Juror M indicating that she was able to follow the law and base her verdict on the evidence and law presented. Thus, the record does not support a finding that Juror M \"convinced\" the trial court of such an ability. While we defer to the trial court's unique perspective and ability to assess credibility and demeanor, absent any findings regarding credibility or demeanor we are left with a cold record devoid of any support for the trial court's conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conyac,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. We therefore determine that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defendant's challenge for cause to Juror M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 18 Because Juror M was ultimately seated on the jury, defendant's right to a fair trial was violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11121830\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/19/668/\">\n    19 P.3d at 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We accordingly reverse defendant's convictions and remand the case to the trial court for a new trial. In light of our conclusion that the denial of defendant's challenge for cause to Juror M constituted reversible error, we need not consider defendant's arguments regarding the other challenged juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III. Remaining Contentions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 19 Defendant also raises a number of other contentions of error. Specifically, she contends that the trial court improperly admitted her bank records and records that CDL received from Comdata. Because the prosecution relied on that evidence, these issues are likely to arise again on remand. Defendant also asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support her convictions on the counts involving theft through use of a Comdata card. We must consider that claim, because if defendant is correct, we must also consider whether she may be retried on those counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.

Defendant testified\n   that the Netbank statements admitted were copies of her bank account statements for April and May 2007 and that she accessed the statements online from the bank's website and printed them for the detective investigating this case. Because of the particular nature of bank statements, and the fact that defendant obtained her bank statements and personally delivered them to the detective, the trial court could have taken judicial notice of the statements as business records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516081\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/562/#p571\">\n    971 F.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 31 Accordingly, under the facts presented, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the bank statements under CRE 803(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   c. Comdata Records\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 32 Defendant argues the trial court erred when it concluded that records of CDL's cash card transactions apparently generated by Comdata fell within the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Because those records provide significant evidence regarding the transactions in question, defendant will likely reassert her objections at the retrial on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 33 The prosecution sought to admit, through CDL's office manager, (1) a report concerning the CDL Comdata cards, including card numbers issued to CDL's employees by name; (2) a report detailing all transactions for January 2006 on the Comdata cards issued to CDL employees; and (3) a report of all transactions on Comdata card 9406 from July 2006 through February 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 34 Defendant objected to the admission of these records, arguing that they were not CDL's business records, but rather Comdata records, as to which no custodian or foundational witness was present to testify. The trial court admitted the documents as business records, without specifying whether they were records of CDL or Comdata.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 35 CDL's office manager testified that she \"printed out\" the list of cards issued to CDL employees. She received the reports of transactions from \"a lady at Comdata\" via e-mail. The office manager conceded that this type of record for each particular card was not kept at CDL. While the Comdata card admitted into evidence indicates that it is a MasterCard debit card issued by AmSouth Bank, we are unable to determine from the record whether \"Comdata\" is a trade name or affiliate of that bank, who prepared the documents e-mailed to CDL's office manager, or the source of the data in those documents. The prosecution did not call or attempt to call any witness from Comdata or AmSouth Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 36 Thus, the trial court abused its discretion when it admitted the records from Comdata without the testimony of a foundational witness establishing the\n   <em>\n    Huehn\n   </em>\n   requirements for admission under CRE 803(6). Because these records constituted a significant portion of the prosecution's evidence demonstrating the unauthorized movement of CDL funds onto the cash card, and the subsequent spending or withdrawal of those funds, we cannot say that the admission of the documents did not substantially influence the verdict on the Comdata counts; therefore, their admission was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   3. Confrontation Clause\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 37 Defendant argues that admission of the Netbank statements and records received from Comdata violated her right to confrontation under the Confrontation Clauses of the United States and Colorado Constitutions. We disagree with respect to with respect to the Netbank statements. In light of our conclusion that the Comdata documents were inadmissible without necessary foundational testimony, we need not reach the constitutional issue as to those documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

The People presented the following evidence to support the cash card theft charges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   \u2022 Two Comdata cards were issued in CDL's owner's name in March 2004, card 6515 and card 9406.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   \u2022 One copy of card 6515 was in the owner's possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   \u2022 A duplicate card 6515 was located in defendant's desk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   \u2022 Card 9406 was not found during the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   \u2022 CDL's owner and office manager were unaware that card 9406 existed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \u2022 Comdata records showed that numerous cash loads had been made onto card 9406.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   \u2022 Defendant's name was listed as the initiator of the cash transfers onto card 9406. No other names appeared as initiators of transactions on card 9406.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 Defendant was the only person with authority to load funds onto the Comdata cards. CDL's owner did not load the Comdata cards.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 Many of the cash loads were initiated at night, outside of defendant's regular daytime working hours.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 The card was used to make purchases and for cash withdrawals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b6 48 The foregoing evidence supports the conclusion that defendant knowingly exercised control over the funds she placed on the Comdata card without authorization. Even absent direct evidence that defendant spent or withdrew the money loaded onto card 9406, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knowingly exercised control over the money transferred without authorization to card 9406 with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b6 49 Because the evidence, taking into account the improperly admitted Comdata records, would be sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions for theft under counts five through seven, those counts are subject to retrial on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   III.
