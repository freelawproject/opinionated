Roberts appeals his conviction for driving while under the influence (DWUI). Mr. Roberts claims that the district court denied him equal protection by allowing the State to peremptorily challenge a potential juror based on race. Because the record supports the validity of only one of the prosecutor's race-neutral reasons for his peremptory challenge, and does not show that the district court would credit this reason alone, we remand for a new\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Did the district court clearly err by allowing the State to exercise a peremptory challenge to exclude an African American from the jury?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b63] Mr. Roberts, an African American, was arrested in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and charged with DWUI under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2031-5-233\">\n    Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-5-233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(i). After a 11//2-day trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The DWUI conviction was his fourth in less than ten years, constituting a felony for which the district court sentenced him to three to five years incarceration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b64] Our inquiry is limited to the jury selection process, during which the State exercised a peremptory challenge to dismiss from the panel Juror 364, an African American woman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of 31 prospective jurors on the panel, 2 were African American. The prosecutor exercised his second peremptory challenge to remove the first African American, to which there was no objection. The prosecutor then exercised his fourth peremptory challenge to reject the second African American, Juror 364, to which defense counsel objected, prompting the district court to hold a side-bar conference:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [DEFENSE]: I do have concerns with the State's most recent strike as she is the last remaining person of African American descent. I understand why the first lady was struck of African American decent [sic], why she was selected by the prosecutor to be struck, but the second one I fail to see how that is based ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: [Prosecutor].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Her demeanor throughout was negative. She doesn't want to sit on the jury. One time she did answer, she expressed doubt as to whether this was alcohol-or a DUI. Her expressions seemed to-her facial expressions were more-she was kind of nodding. She was grimacing. My recollection is that she did not want to sit on the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE COURT: [Defense counsel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [DEFENSE]: Those words were not spoken by her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   THE COURT: What response are you expecting from the Court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [DEFENSE]: Just that it be done for the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: I will allow the State-is it Number 346 [sic]-seat number is it-17, [Juror 364].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEFENSE]: Thank you, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defense counsel was correct that Juror 364 had not spoken the words attributed to her by the prosecutor. In fact, we can find no record of Juror 364 speaking during voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b65] Following jury selection, the jury was sworn in, the unselected venirepersons were released, and each party presented opening statements. Before the State presented evidence, while the jury was out of the courtroom,\n   defense counsel requested that \"the prosecutor's and my jury selection notes be submitted to the Court and sealed, not seen by other parties to preserve the issue of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge I raised regarding [Juror 364] as a best practice method of preserving the record.\" The State objected, claiming that the notes were protected work product. The district court took the request under advisement, but there is no record that it ever ruled on the request. The attorney notes are not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b66] The State then presented its case in chief. After the State rested, the district court, on its own motion, announced to counsel that it would conduct a full hearing on the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I do think it's important for the defendant's benefit, if for no other reason, and so that we've created a full record, we conduct a full\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis-or I conduct a full\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis .... And if the defendant were to make a prima facie showing, the State would have to provide I think in a little bit more detail than has been done to date a neutral explanation for the exercise of the peremptory challenges so that I can make the decision that I need to make.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The district court immediately proceeded with a second\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [DEFENSE]: Your Honor, on this entire panel there were two members of what it appeared to be African American decent [sic]. Mr. Roberts is African American himself. The first lady who was challenged, peremptorily challenged by the State was ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   THE COURT: [Other juror].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEFENSE]: Thank you, Your Honor. When [the other juror] did speak she spoke that she knew Mr. Roberts from growing up with him. She also gave a lot of vocal answers for the State to base their peremptory strike on her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The issue I have is with the juror who was seated in Seat 17, Juror Number 364 .... She was the only other juror who appears to be of African American decent [sic], and she was the second person-it was the State's fourth peremptory strike and [the other juror] was the second. Then she was the only-the State struck two of the only two African American people who were on as a potential juror.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Juror 364] in her vocalization response to questions seemed to only vocalize the question, \"What is buzzed driving?\" That doesn't seem that that can indicate that that in and of itself is-she did not vocalize anything that seemed to indicate that her being struck is based on anything other than her race.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: Thank you, [Defense counsel]. [Prosecutor].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: The neutral reasons that the State would rely upon as laid forth earlier at the bench conference would be that the demeanor of the second juror struck, [Juror 364], throughout the case she was crumpling her face, she continued to wear a hat throughout the proceedings, Your Honor, when clearly outside the courtroom it says no hats.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b67] At this point, the district court explained that it had allowed Juror 364 to wear a hat during jury selection due to a dermatological condition. The prosecutor replied:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Certainly my only joinder to that, and I thank you for putting it on the record, was counsel was not informed of that so I had no idea of that. In any event, looking at that in addition to the one prominent question that defense counsel always put out is that she wanted to make clear that this was not a controlled substance versus alcohol DUI. It's that fine line drawing that concerned the State going, well, if she can draw this fine line and say, yeah, I want some more proof, that sends a red flag to the State. She might be uncomfortable with the bright line of a .08 as the state law in Wyoming.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   It's for those neutral reasons, Your Honor, that the State struck [Juror 364].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   And to further supplement the record when it comes to her demeanor, I noticed her arms were crossed, that she was shifting, that she-except for that one question, she was really silent. And I did notice, though, when talking about the law enforcement question that she did make a\n   crumpled face at that time as well when I was talking about, \"How do people feel about law enforcement?\" And there were some expressions of distrust of law enforcement. Those would be the neutral reasons the State would offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b68] The district court overruled the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, providing the following analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   I accept [the prosecutor's] explanation for the exercise of that particular peremptory challenge. I think it's completely understandable that the State would have concern based on [Juror 364's] expression of her own concerns, reservations about what she would refer to as a \"bright line.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   In addition to that I couldn't see [Juror 364]. She was in the second row and she's not the tallest of individuals and so I could not see her face very much of the time. I did not notice the facial expressions that [the prosecutor] would describe, but I will accept as accurate and credible [the prosecutor's] assessment of [Juror 364] that he was concerned about her demeanor and also concerned about her expression of-her reservations and concerns, as I said, about the law, the law being that bright line. And I do believe as a result of that the State properly exercised a peremptory challenge on [Juror 364] for neutral reasons and that the use of that particular peremptory challenge was not pretextual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [\u00b69] The transcript reveals, and the State concedes, that Juror 364 never expressed that she \"want[ed] some more proof\"-the assertion that allegedly caused the prosecutor to believe she might be uncomfortable with the \"bright line\" of the DWUI law. Nor had she asked the question, \"What is buzzed driving?,\" as reported by defense counsel. Juror 364 never spoke at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b610] The peremptory challenge-that is, a party's removal of a potential juror without showing cause-lies at the heart of jury selection in the American trial.

The record shows that Juror 364's demeanor figured into the district court's ruling. Specifically, the district court determined the prosecutor to be credible and, therefore, the court accepted the prosecutor's assertion that Juror 364 conveyed a negative demeanor. However, as in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the record does not show that the prosecution would have peremptorily challenged Juror 364 \"based on her demeanor alone.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p478\">\n    552 U.S. at 485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p478\">\n    128 S.Ct. at 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor does the record indicate that the district court would have grounded its decision solely in the demeanor-based explanation. Initially, the prosecutor offered Juror 364's negative demeanor as one explanation for his strike. But, when the district court announced the second hearing, it informed the prosecutor that it still needed more: \"the State would have to provide I think in a little bit more detail than has been done to date a neutral explanation for the exercise of the peremptory challenges so that I can make the decision that I need to make.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor offered additional details, including more descriptions of facial expressions and body language; the explanation that some of those expressions were made when the prosecutor was talking about law enforcement; the observation that she wore a hat in the courtroom; and the assertion that Juror 364 said she would \"want some more proof\" of a DWUI, which led him to believe that she \"might be uncomfortable with the bright line of a .08 as the state law in Wyoming.\" The district court stated that it would \"accept as accurate and credible [the prosecutor's]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   assessment of [Juror 364] that he was concerned about her demeanor and also concerned about her expression of-her reservations and concerns, as I said, about the law, the law being that bright line.\" The new detail that the court appeared to rely on to credit the demeanor-based explanation was the incorrect description of Juror 364's reservations about the \"bright line\" rule. The record does not show that the district court considered the prosecutor's assessment of Juror 364's demeanor separately from his false assertion that Juror 364 made statements that conveyed a concern with the \"bright line\" of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [\u00b628] Additionally, the prosecutor's false assertion casts a shadow on his credibility, which solely sustained the only valid reason for the strike. Misattributing statements to the same African American venireperson whose removal he sought to justify calls into question the reliability of the prosecutor's portrayal of that venireperson's demeanor. It compels us to ask whether the district court would have found the prosecutor credible if it had known that he ascribed unfavorable statements to Juror 364 that she had not made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   [\u00b629] Like in\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , one of the prosecutor's two explanations for the peremptory challenge upon which the district court relied fails and we cannot ignore its pretextual significance. The prosecutor's strike was motivated at least in substantial part by the invalid reason and the record does not show that the district court would find that the prosecutor was motivated solely by the valid, demeanor-based grounds.

However, the Court found the student teaching obligation explanation did not hold up as racially neutral because the prosecutor did not use peremptory challenges on similarly situated white jurors.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p478\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p478\">\n    at 483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/#p478\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1208. Because the trial court did not explain which basis it was relying on when it allowed the challenge, the Court was unwilling to assume the trial court's decision was based on the race neutral reason, or that the prosecutor would have challenged the juror based on solely the nervousness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   [\u00b634] Like\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor here gave two reasons for challenging Juror 364: 1) her demeanor; and 2) she appeared to be drawing distinctions between driving while under the influence charges based on alcohol versus a controlled substance. The majority accepts the juror's demeanor as a valid race neutral reason for the prosecutor's challenge. However, the majority concludes, without any citation to authority, the juror's statement is not a valid race neutral reason because the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   transcripts do not reflect that Juror 364 made any statements at all during the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   proceedings. While the majority is correct that the transcript does not attribute the statements relied upon by the prosecutor and the district court specifically to Juror 364, under the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not believe the transcript clearly indicates that Juror 364 did not make these statements. Furthermore, the record does not support an inference of a racial motivation on the part of the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b635] In\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the Court did not rely on speculation in assigning a racial motivation to the prosecutor's actions and, instead, pointed to specific instances where the prosecutor treated white jurors who were similarly situated to the black juror differently. Here, the majority's determination of racial motivation does not stem from a comparison of the prosecutor's decisions concerning white and black jurors. Rather, the majority questions the prosecutor's credibility in its entirety based on what the majority concludes is a \"false assertion\" regarding Juror 364. While the transcript does not attribute any statements during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   to Juror 364, the transcript contains several red flags that lead me to question whether the transcription is an accurate representation of what occurred during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Voir dire\n   </em>\n   was very short in this case, consuming less than forty pages of the trial transcript. When the court held the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   hearing after the State rested its case, the court had enough recollection of the\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   proceedings that it recalled where Juror 364 was sitting, that she was not tall, and the court could not see the juror's face most of the time. Based on this, it is curious that the court would then rely on statements the prosecutor claimed this juror said if this juror was, in fact, silent during the entire\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   process. This is bolstered by the fact that both the prosecutor and defense attorney discussed statements made by Juror 364 during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   . The prosecutor indicated he was striking this juror, in part, because the juror questioned the difference between alcohol DUI and impairment from other controlled substances. Defense counsel thought this juror asked, \"what is buzzed driving?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   [\u00b636] The transcript shows that the prosecutor asked potential jurors if \"anybody else like [sic] to share on that question, whether or not we should have [a] fuzzy determination or a bright line about potentialities [of impaired driving].\" In response, a juror referred to by the prosecutor as Ms. McFarland, said that \"a buzz is totally different to each individual person but-I don't know. To me there's no fuzzy line; if you're over the limit, you're over the limit. That's it.\" Then the prosecutor called on a juror he referred to as Ms. Gallagher. The exchange between that juror and the prosecutor appears to be the statement about the difference between alcohol and other substances mentioned by the prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [The Prosecutor]: Ms. Gallagher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   The Juror: Yes. Are we talking just basically about alcohol? It seems there are guidelines for alcohol, but there doesn't seem to be guidelines if you're impaired with other types of drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [The Prosecutor]: I will limit my question to alcohol, just talk about alcohol.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   The Juror: I am not. That's why I was asking. I know they have guidelines for drinking, but I don't know that they have guidelines if you are taking drugs or anything else.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b637] The jury panel list shows that there was no Ms. Gallagher on the jury panel. Juror 364 was Ms. Gadlin, and juror 370 was Mr. Gallagher. It appears that the prosecutor either referred to Ms. Gadlin as Ms. Gallagher, or to Mr. Gallagher as Ms. Gallagher. Based upon the statements and conduct of the attorneys and the court, the most reasonable conclusion is that the prosecutor erroneously referred to Ms. Gadlin as Ms. Gallagher, and Ms. Gadlin actually made the statements the prosecutor and the court relied upon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   [\u00b638] Further complicating matters, the court reporter did not indicate the names of the potential jurors anywhere in the transcript-not in the roll call or when specific jurors answered questions.

Although the court relied on the statements attributed to the juror, it also clearly relied on the information about the juror's demeanor.

Based on the record before us, I am satisfied that the district court was presented with, and relied upon, a valid race neutral reason to excuse Juror 364. While the statements attributed to Juror 364 are not clearly reflected by the record, the record is sufficiently suspect to lead one to the conclusion that a reporting error occurred and not that the prosecutor used the statements as a pretext for challenging Juror 364 based on her race.
