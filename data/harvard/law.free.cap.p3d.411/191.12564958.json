(mother) appeals from the judgment terminating the parent-child legal relationships between her and J.W. and N.W. (children) and from the order adjudicating the children dependent or neglected with respect to her. Because the court issued the adjudication order after the court entered judgment terminating mother's parental rights, and not before, we conclude that the court did not acquire jurisdiction to terminate the parent-child relationship. In addition, because the adjudication order was entered after mother filed her notice of appeal, we also conclude that the court lacked jurisdiction to enter that order as well. Accordingly, we vacate both the judgment and the order and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In May 2014, the Clear Creek County Department of Human Services (the department) sought temporary protective custody of J.W., then five years old, and N.W., then ten months old, citing serious (and ultimately fatal) injuries suffered by an unrelated child residing in the home and ongoing concerns about mother's ability to protect the children. The department noted that the family had been the subject of several previous referrals concerning drug use, domestic violence, and possible physical abuse of the children, including an allegation that J.O., the children's maternal uncle, had choked J.W. When confronted with the latter allegation, mother was protective of her brother, denying that he would ever do anything to hurt the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 Soon after being granted temporary custody of the children, the department filed a petition in dependency or neglect, alleging that the children were dependent or neglected for the reason set forth in section 19-3-102(1)(a), C.R.S. 2015, which provides that a child is dependent or neglected if \"[a] parent,\n   guardian, or legal custodian has abandoned the child or has subjected him or her to mistreatment or abuse or a parent, guardian, or legal custodian has suffered or allowed another to mistreat or abuse the child without taking lawful means to ... prevent it from recurring.\" As factual support for this allegation, the department cited, among other things, mother's lack of protectiveness when faced with the allegation that her brother had choked J.W. Mother denied the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Shortly before the adjudicatory hearing, the department filed an amended petition in dependency or neglect. This time the department did not allege that mother had abandoned the children, subjected them to mistreatment or abuse, or allowed another to mistreat or abuse them without taking lawful means to prevent it from recurring. It alleged instead that the children were dependent or neglected for the reasons set forth in section 19-3-102(1)(b), which provides that a child is dependent or neglected if \"[t]he child lacks proper parental care through the actions or omissions of the parent,\" and in section 19-3-102(1)(c), which provides that a child is dependent or neglected if \"[t]he child's environment is injurious to his or her welfare.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Mother's adjudicatory trial took place on July 10 and 11, 2014. Following the trial, the jury was asked to decide (1) whether the children were dependent or neglected because their environment was injurious to their welfare; and (2) whether the children were dependent or neglected because they lacked proper parental care through the actions or omissions of their parent, guardian, or legal custodian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 The trial did not result in an adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Instead, the jury answered \"no\" to the question asking whether the children lacked proper parental care through the actions or omissions of their parent, guardian, or legal custodian. It further stated that it was \"unable to return an answer\" to the question asking whether the children's environment was injurious to their welfare.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 On July 14, 2014, a hearing was held to discuss scheduling a new adjudication trial for mother. Rather than delay the proceedings by requesting a retrial, mother chose to admit that the children's environment was injurious to their welfare. The trial court accepted her admission. The parties agree that mother was not offered a deferred adjudication under section 19-3-505(5)(a), C.R.S. 2015, and that the court did not enter a formal order adjudicating the children dependent or neglected at the hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-3-505(7)(a) (\"When the court finds that the allegations of the petition are supported by a preponderance of the evidence ... the court shall sustain the petition and shall make an order of adjudication setting forth whether the child is neglected or dependent.\"). Instead, the court proceeded to adopt the treatment plan that was already in place as her treatment plan going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 A few months later, the court terminated mother's parental rights, finding that although mother loved the children and had made efforts to comply with her treatment plan, she could not meet the children's needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 On October 30, 2015, more than a month\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   mother's parental rights were terminated, the court entered a written order adjudicating the children dependent or neglected with respect to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. Timeliness of the Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 11 As an initial matter, we address the department's contention that the appeal is untimely with respect to issues arising during the adjudicatory stage of the proceeding. It argues the appeal of such issues is untimely because, although the court did not sign a written order adjudicating the children dependent or neglected with respect to mother until October 30, 2015, mother acknowledged in her petition on appeal that the adjudication and disposition order was \"made\" on July 14, 2014. We disagree that the appeal is untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 To begin, mother is appealing an order purporting to terminate her legal relationship with her children; therefore, this is a final appealable order under section 19-1-109(2)(b), C.R.S. 2015. Simply put, mother contends that the department did not prove all of the essential elements under section 19-3-604(1)(c), C.R.S. 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 As for the adjudicatory order, it is well established that \"an order or judgment must be reduced to writing and dated and signed before it is a final, appealable order.\"\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of O.J.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375983\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/844/1230/#p1233\">\n    844 P.2d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1233 (Colo.

Thus, if the court sustains the petition in dependency or neglect and adopts a treatment plan for a parent, but does not reduce the adjudicatory and dispositional orders to writing, those orders are not final and appealable until the entry of a judgment of termination or other final and appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of T.E.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8999370\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/124/905/#p907\">\n    124 P.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 907-08 (Colo. App. 2005) (holding that where the record established that children were adjudicated dependent or neglected and a treatment plan was adopted for the parent, but the orders were not reduced to writing, the orders became appealable upon entry of the judgment of termination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 14 Here, the court entered a written order purporting to adjudicate the children dependent or neglected with respect to mother and adopt a treatment plan for her, but it did not do so until October 30, 2015, more than a month after entering the judgment terminating her parental rights. Because the termination order was entered before an adjudicatory order was entered, it was the termination order that allowed mother to appeal issues arising during the adjudicatory stage of the proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   III. Jurisdiction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A. The Termination Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 We next consider whether the trial court had jurisdiction to terminate mother's parental rights before it entered an order adjudicating the children dependent or neglected with respect to her. We conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 Although mother did not initially raise this issue, in a dependency or neglect proceeding the court's subject matter jurisdiction is based on the fact of the child being dependent or neglected, and a challenge to a court's subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-1-104(1)(b), C.R.S. 2015;\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of N.D.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994285\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/224/410/#p414\">\n    224 P.3d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (Colo. App. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 In supplemental briefing requested by this court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   mother argues that the children were not adjudicated dependent or neglected until after the court entered the written order of adjudication in October 2015, and, therefore, the court did not have jurisdiction to terminate her parental rights. We agree that when the court terminated mother's parental rights, it did not have jurisdiction to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1. Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 For a parent involved in a dependency or neglect proceeding, the entry of an adjudicatory order is a critically important turning point. The purpose of the adjudicative process is to \"determine whether the factual allegations in the dependency or neglect petition are supported by a preponderance of the evidence\" such that the child's status \"warrants intrusive protective or corrective state intervention into the familial\n   relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of J.G. v. M.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805263\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/1151/\">\n    2016 CO 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6805263\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/370/1151/\">\n    370 P.3d 1151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Thus, if a parent admits the allegations in the petition in dependency or neglect-or if the state, in a contested case, proves the allegations-then the court may enter an adjudicatory order, which vests the court with \"extensive and flexible dispositional remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of A.M.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10437095\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/648/625/#p639\">\n    648 P.2d 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639-40 (Colo. 1982).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 Alternatively, if the parent denies the allegations and the state fails to prove them, the court must order the petition dismissed and the child, as well as his or her parents, guardian, or legal custodian, discharged from any restrictions or temporary orders. \u00a7 19-3-505(6) ;\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of A.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985123\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/271/1116/#p1121\">\n    271 P.3d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121 (Colo. App. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 Although the purpose of adjudication is to determine whether state intervention into the familial relationship is necessary to serve the best interests of the children, the determination must be made in a manner that protects parental rights.\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 24. Recognizing \"the bedrock principle\" that the right to parent one's children is a fundamental liberty interest, our supreme court has held that intervention into that interest requires \"fundamentally fair procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 21 Discovering what fundamental fairness consists of in a particular situation is often an \"uncertain enterprise,\" but due process requires the court to make the inquiry.\n   <em>\n    A.M. v. A.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    2013 CO 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6979999\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/1026/\">\n    296 P.3d 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Ensuring a fair procedure at the adjudicatory stage is critical because \"termination is impossible absent the preliminary determination that the child is dependent and neglected.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 22 The importance of the adjudicatory stage is reflected in the fact that a parent has a statutory right to a jury trial on the allegations set forth in the petition in dependency or neglect. \u00a7 19-3-202, C.R.S. 2015;\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of A.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384016\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/786/476/#p479\">\n    786 P.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (Colo. App. 1989). The parent may elect to waive his or her right to a jury trial and may confess, stipulate, or elect not to contest part or all of the allegations in a dependency or neglect petition. If a parent admits part or all of the allegations in the petition, \"the court may accept the admission after finding that (1) the parent understands his or her rights, the allegations contained in the petition, and the effect of the admission; and (2) the admission is voluntary.\"\n   <em>\n    N.D.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994285\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/224/410/#p414\">\n    224 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   417 (citing C.R.J.P. 4.2(c) ). If the court accepts the parent's admission, the state is relieved from the burden of proving such admitted allegations at the adjudicatory hearing. C.R.J.P. 4.2(c) ;\n   <em>\n    A.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384016\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/786/476/#p479\">\n    786 P.2d at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the statute does not provide any short cuts. The court must take the next step after accepting an admission-namely, it must adjudicate the child dependent or neglected. \u00a7 19-3-505(7)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 23 Indeed, in order to terminate parental rights in a dependency or neglect proceeding, the court must first find that the child who is the subject of the proceeding \"has been adjudicated dependent or neglected.\" \u00a7 19-3-604(1)(a), (b), (c). Without an adjudication, a court does not acquire subject matter jurisdiction to terminate a parent-child relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.M.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10437095\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/648/625/#p639\">\n    648 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   639-40 ;\n   <em>\n    N.D.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994285\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/224/410/#p414\">\n    224 P.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Lichtenstein, J., dissenting).

Application\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 In this case, an adjudicatory trial was held in July 2014. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found in mother's favor on one of the questions presented to it and was unable to reach a verdict on the other question. During a subsequent hearing, mother's attorney informed the court that he and mother had discussed further proceedings with the county attorney, and mother \"seem[ed] to be receptive to admitting\" the remaining allegation against her at that point. He noted, however, that mother wanted\n   very much to file an administrative challenge to the allegations of child abuse found in the state's child abuse database because, as a teacher, she did not want to have a child abuse report on her record. He explained that she was concerned about the possibility that entering an admission to the petition in dependency or neglect would affect the administrative appeal. The attorney admitted that he did not know the answers to mother's questions, and so he had not advised her one way or the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25 The trial court then questioned mother about her understanding of the proceedings and her desire to enter an admission that the children were in an injurious environment. Mother told the court that she wanted to enter an admission because she \"want[ed] to get [her] kids back the speediest way\" she could, and it would take time for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 26 The trial court then ruled as follows: \"All right, then, I'm willing to prepare-I'll make [sic] the admission that the mother's entered the admission that the child-children's environment is injurious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 27 Significantly, the court did not state at any time during the July 14 hearing-or at any other time prior to the termination order-that it was adjudicating the children dependent or neglected with respect to mother. \u00a7 19-3-505(7)(a). And that the written order entered on October 30, 2015, states that the order was \"entered and effective on this 14th day of July, 2014,\" does not change the fact that the court actually did not enter an adjudicatory order on July 14, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 28 The department and the guardian ad litem (GAL) rely on\n   <em>\n    N.D.V.\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that formal adjudication prior to termination is not required. In\n   <em>\n    N.D.V.\n   </em>\n   , a division of this court ruled that a juvenile court's subject matter jurisdiction in dependency or neglect cases is based on the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of the child being dependent or neglected.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994285\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/224/410/#p414\">\n    224 P.3d at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Emphasis added.) Because the court did not enter an order of adjudication, we conclude that mother's admission only authorized the court to continue its temporary intervention in the case pending an adjudication. In effect, adjudication was deferred. And, because an adjudication is a prerequisite to termination under section 19-3-604(1)(c), the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order terminating mother's parental rights. Given the enormous consequences at stake, we conclude that this is the fairest procedure and the one that most comports with legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.

Nor did the court make a finding as to whether she understood the effect of making an admission. On this record, we cannot determine whether mother understood the effect of her admission when she made it; thus, we cannot determine whether the court could properly accept her admission.

And I conclude that the failure to enter an adjudication order in dependency or neglect actions does not divest the juvenile\n   court of its subject matter jurisdiction to order a termination of the parent-child relationship under section 19-3-604(1)(c), C.R.S. 2015. So, I respectfully dissent from Part III.A of the majority opinion, which vacates the court's judgment terminating mother's parent-child legal relationship with the children and remands to the court to resume proceedings at the adjudicatory stage; from Part IV, which concludes that the issues raised by mother are moot; and from the conclusion in Part V.

And because mother did not raise the issue in the trial court, she has waived it. To the extent mother argues that section 19-3-505(5) or (7), C.R.S. 2015, establishes a procedural prerequisite to conducting the termination hearing or entering a termination order, I conclude that she has also waived this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 38 To insist that the trial court comply with a procedural rule, a party must object to the court's noncompliance in a timely manner or the noncompliance may be waived.\n   <em>\n    N.D.V.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994285\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/224/410/#p414\">\n    224 P.3d at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that because mother did not raise in trial court issue of error in conducting termination hearing without first entering an adjudicatory order, she had waived it);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of E.H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10362189\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/837/284/#p290\">\n    837 P.2d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (Colo.

She never sought to withdraw her admission and never challenged the trial court's subsequent orders on jurisdictional grounds. After mother's admission, but before the termination hearing, mother participated in additional hearings before the trial court. At no point did mother assert that prior to conducting those hearings the trial court was required to dismiss or sustain the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 19-3-505(6) - (7)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b6 40 During the two-day termination hearing mother did not demand that the court enter an adjudication order before conducting further proceedings. And she did not raise this objection when the court issued its oral termination order in which the court found that the children had been adjudicated dependent and neglected. Nor did she object to the court's later written termination order finding that \"the children have been adjudicated dependent and neglected.\" By her inaction, and under these circumstances, mother has waived her right to object to any procedural error arising from the court conducting\n   the termination hearing without first entering an adjudication order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b6 41 Mother does not contend on appeal that the court erred by accepting her admission or assert that the children were not dependent or neglected throughout the proceedings.

The jury did not find that the children's environment was not injurious to their welfare; it declared that it was unable to determine whether the environment was injurious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   B. Treatment Plan's Appropriateness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 45 Mother contends that decisions made by the trial court rendered her treatment plan inappropriate. First, she contends that the court erred when it failed to order a substitute family therapist when problems arose in her relationship with the therapist. Second, she contends that the court erred when it reduced her visits with the children. I do not agree that these decisions rendered the treatment plan inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 46 An appropriate treatment plan is one that is \"reasonably calculated to render the particular [parent] fit to provide adequate parenting to the child within a reasonable time and that relates to the child's needs.\" \u00a7 19-1-103(10), C.R.S. 2015.

Maintaining Family Therapist\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 47 The termination trial record shows that a therapist was retained to provide therapeutic visitation services to mother and the children. From the beginning, there were problems between mother and the therapist. The therapist reported that mother was very defensive in her parenting and she had difficulty accepting the therapist's intervention. Mother testified that she had a hard time understanding the family therapist because the therapist was \"too abstract.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 48 Mother had requested several times that the therapist be replaced because she did not believe the therapist was helpful. Her individual therapist noted that mother did not feel \"emotionally safe\" with the family therapist. But, the Clear Creek County Department of Human Services (CCCDHS) case supervisor testified that changing to a new family therapist was never seriously considered because the children were comfortable with the therapist and a change would have been disruptive for them; the therapist was regarded as \"one of the best\" at providing therapeutic visits; and, in the supervisor's view, mother's problem was that she did not agree with the feedback from the therapist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 49 The witnesses' credibility and the evidence's sufficiency, probative effect, and weight, as well as the inferences and conclusions to be drawn from it, are within the trial court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    People in Interest of C.A.K.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10432392\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/652/603/#p613\">\n    652 P.2d 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 613 (Colo. 1982).

Even so, the trial court found that mother's treatment plan was appropriate. I infer from\n   this finding that the trial court determined that the difficulties between the therapist and mother were insufficient to render the treatment plan inappropriate. Because the evidence supports this conclusion, I would not disturb it.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10432392\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/652/603/#p613\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   2.

It alleged that the family therapist, J.W.'s individual therapist, and mother's individual therapist had raised concerns that having visits twice a week was detrimental to both mother and the children. Reports from all three therapists described their concerns about mother's and the children's emotional condition during and after visits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 54 Following a hearing, the court reduced visits to once per week, citing testimony by the family therapist and J.W.'s therapist that the children were in a state of \"hyper arousal\" after visits with mother, and such a state was not healthy for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b6 55 The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reducing visitation because evidence indicated that visitation twice a week was emotionally harmful to the children, and I conclude that the reduction did not render mother's treatment plan inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   C. Adequacy of Factual Findings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b6 56 Mother contends that the termination order is inadequate because the court \"fail[ed] to make appropriate factual findings or to identify the deficiencies which rendered termination constitutionally appropriate.\" I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b6 57 Under section 19-3-604(1)(c), the parent-child legal relationship may be terminated if the court finds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   \u2022 that the child has been adjudicated dependent or neglected, and the court finds based on clear and convincing evidence that the parent did not reasonably comply with a treatment plan approved by the court or that the treatment plan has been unsuccessful;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   \u2022 that the parent is unfit; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   \u2022 that the parent's conduct or condition is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \u2022 the children had been adjudicated dependent and neglected as to mother;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   \u2022 the court had adopted an appropriate treatment plan and that plan had not been complied with or had not been successful;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   \u2022 mother was unfit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   \u2022 reasonable efforts had been made to rehabilitate her, but they had been unsuccessful; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \u2022 her condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b6 58 The court also made detailed and extensive findings as to the specific reasons why it concluded that mother's parental rights should be terminated. Citing a report prepared by the family therapist and the testimony of the psychologist who evaluated mother, the court noted that mother had a history of trauma and mental health problems that interfered with her ability to meet her children's needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b6 59 I conclude that the trial court's findings show that the court considered each factor in section 19-3-604(1)(c) and also identified the specific deficiencies leading the court to terminate mother's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b6 60 I would affirm the trial court's judgment terminating the parent-child legal relationship between mother and the children.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Throughout the adjudication, disposition, and termination proceedings, mother was represented by counsel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
