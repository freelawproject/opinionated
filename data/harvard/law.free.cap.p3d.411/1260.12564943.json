One prospective juror, Kaylie Utter (\"Utter\"), stated that she had \"a couple of experiences that might influence [her] opinions\" in this case. Utter explained that a close friend died in a drunk driving accident, and that her son-in-law was recently involved in a drunk driving accident. While Utter could not definitively answer whether those experiences would impact her ability to be fair or impartial, she admitted that it \"definitely affects [her] opinions.\" When asked if she was more inclined to believe a police officer's testimony and find Russell guilty, Utter stated, \"[t]hat could be; I can't say for sure but it's possible.\" In response to follow-up questions regarding her ability to neutrally evaluate potential evidence, Utter answered, \"yes\" when the prosecutor asked whether her life experiences would cause her to evaluate the evidence in a certain way. As to whether Russell's refusal to submit to a breath test in and of itself results in an assumption of guilt, Utter stated that she might infer guilt from a\n   defendant's refusal to submit to a breath test. Russell challenged Utter for cause, and the District Court excused Utter \"based on the experiences that she's had personally and the indication that those experiences would maybe influence her decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Upon Utter being excused, the District Court called Prospective Juror Donald Platisha (\"Platisha\"), who immediately stated that he \"might be in the same position as the last juror.\" In a follow-up question, Platisha explained that his sister was injured, and his brother-in-law killed, by a drunk driver. When pressed directly as to whether he thought his experiences would make it hard for him to be a fair in a DUI case, Platisha stated, \"I'm like [Utter]. I don't know.\" Defense Counsel Hud followed up:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Defense Counsel: Okay. But even with the presumption of innocence, Mr. Russell and the defense would have a hard time convincing you of his position in this case; is that fair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Platisha: I don't believe that's true, no.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Defense Counsel: Okay. Well, we have a situation here where Mr. Russell was arrested so a police officer believes something was wrong. The police officer's report was sent to the prosecutor and[,] based on the report, charges were filed against him. And now he's sitting here at trial. Would it be fair to say in your mind something must be serious here or there must be some evidence here or he wouldn't be here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Platisha: I don't know. I haven't heard that evidence so I guess I can't answer that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Defense Counsel: If you had a hunch the guy's guilty or maybe the guy's guilty, would that have been enough for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Platisha: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b66 Platisha stated that he had \"quite a few\" experiences involving drunk drivers and agreed that he would feel \"more comfortable\" sitting on another type of criminal case\n   where he didn't have so much personal experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 The State then followed up with a series of questions of Platisha:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   State Counsel: What does fairness mean to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Platisha: I think it's the correct evaluation of the information that you have, you make the correct judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   State Counsel: And so you wouldn't say if the defendant was an African American just because of his skin color you couldn't be fair?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Platisha: I could not say; right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   State Counsel: Okay. Just because someone is charged with a criminal offense doesn't mean you can't be fair, does it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Platisha: No, it doesn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   State Counsel: And just because you have a certain set of life experiences ... doesn't mean you can't be fair in evaluating the evidence that's presented, does it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Platisha: No, it doesn't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   State Counsel: And you believe you can be fair in this case, can't you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Platisha: I believe I could be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b68 Russell challenged Platisha for cause. The District Court denied the challenge after determining that Platisha \"indicated that even with his life experiences[,] which he has discussed with us, he is still able to be fair in the case ...\" and asking Platisha, \"is that correct, Mr. Platisha?\" Platisha answered in the affirmative. Following the denial of the for-cause challenge, Russell used his first peremptory challenge to excuse Platisha and went on to use all his remaining juror challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b69 On February 26, 2016, after a two-day trial, the impaneled jury found Russell guilty of Felony DUI. On April 27, 2016, the District Court sentenced Russell to thirteen months with the Department of Corrections for placement in a residential alcohol treatment program and four years suspended to be served consecutively. Russell appeals the District Court's denial of his for-cause challenge of Platisha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b610 We review denial of a challenge to dismiss a juror for cause for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

I haven't heard the evidence so I guess I can't answer that. ...\" and that merely having a \"hunch\" as to whether Russell was guilty would be\n   insufficient to convict him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 25 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Great Falls Tribune\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2569874\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/186/433/#p439\">\n    186 Mont. at 439-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2569874\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/186/433/#p439\">\n    608 P.2d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b619 Similar to the juror in\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   who had personal experiences pertinent to the case at bar, Platisha disclosed his experiences and recognized their relevance, but affirmed that he could be fair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 21, 23-24 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Normandy\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 22. Also like the juror in\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   , who understood a defendant might find her ill-suited to his case, Platisha stated that he might be more \"comfortable\" sitting as a juror on another type of case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 21. Still, his experiences and demeanor did not circumstantially show an inability to act with impartiality and without prejudice in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b620 The State's line of rehabilitative questioning delving into Platisha's definition of \"fairness\" was improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeVore\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 28 (\"coaxed recantations of admissions of bias are merely fodder for appeal and ultimately the source of major expense and inconvenience. ...\"). However, it was also unnecessary. Platisha had already demonstrated his ability to remain neutral prior to the State's series of leading questions. Considering the totality of Platisha's responses,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18, none of Platisha's initial responses, or those following the State's unnecessary rehabilitation attempts, evince bias or indicate a state of mind that would disqualify Platisha as a juror,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 26 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Falls Down\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Nothing else in the record indicates that Platisha would have acted with bias or prejudice to impair Russell's substantial rights had he been seated on the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Russell's for-cause challenge of Platisha.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richeson\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b621 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Russell's for-cause challenge to a prospective juror.
