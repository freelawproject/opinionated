Haley, of Kansas City, Missouri, an attorney admitted to the practice of law in Kansas in 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 9, 2017, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator filed a formal complaint against the respondent alleging violations of the Kansas Rules of Professional Conduct (KRPC). The respondent filed an answer on February 15, 2017. A hearing was held on the complaint before a panel of the Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys on May 24, 2017, where the respondent was personally present. The hearing panel determined that respondent violated KRPC 1.3 (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 290) (diligence), 3.2 (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 341) (expediting litigation), 5.5(a) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 361) (unauthorized practice of law), 8.4(d) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(g) (engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on lawyer's fitness to practice law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Upon conclusion of the hearing, the panel made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with its recommendation to this court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Findings of Fact\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"11. In 1990, the Missouri Supreme Court admitted the respondent to the practice of law in the state courts of Missouri. The Kansas Supreme Court admitted the respondent to the practice of law in the state courts of Kansas on October 4, 1991. The respondent was also licensed to practice law in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, and the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"12. In 2006, the respondent was appointed to represent F.M. and R.L.A. in criminal appeals pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The respondent failed to prosecute the two federal criminal appeals. The Eighth Circuit Court issued an order for the respondent to appear and show cause why he should not be disciplined for failing to prosecute the two federal criminal appeals. The respondent failed to respond to the order to appear and show cause. On November 8, 2006, the Eighth Circuit Court directed that the respondent's name be stricken from the [roll] of attorneys admitted to practice before the Eighth Circuit Court. (The respondent's licenses to practice before the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and the United States District Court for the District of Kansas were also suspended.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"13. On January 17, 2007, the federal court amended its order of disbarment to direct that the respondent's license be suspended for a minimum of one year. The court directed that any application for reinstatement be accompanied by a written opinion from a mental health provider that the respondent was able to effectively discharge his professional responsibilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"14. Following the federal court discipline, on January 30, 2007, in a reciprocal case, the Missouri Supreme Court issued an order suspending the respondent's license to practice law in Missouri, for having violated Missouri Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 3.2, and 8.4(d). The Missouri Supreme Court directed that no application for reinstatement would be entertained until the respondent was reinstated to practice in the federal courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"15. The respondent failed to comply with the annual requirements to maintain his Kansas law license. As a result, on October 9, 2007, the Kansas Supreme Court issued an order suspending the respondent's license to practice law in the state courts of Kansas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"16. On April 18, 2008, the Eighth Circuit Court terminated the suspension order. However, the respondent did not resume the practice of law at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"17. In 2009, the respondent filed an application for reinstatement in Missouri. Prior to the time the court ruled on the respondent's application, in June 2012, the respondent withdrew his application for reinstatement in Missouri.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"18. On May 3, 2013, the respondent informed the disciplinary administrator of the suspensions of his federal license and his Missouri license. The respondent indicated in the correspondence that he had not been practicing law, but was beginning the process of reinstatement. Even though the respondent was not subject to a disciplinary suspension in Kansas, a reinstatement questionnaire was provided to the respondent in order to obtain information regarding what the respondent had been doing since he last practiced law in Kansas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"19. Prior to the respondent's May 3, 2013, letter, the disciplinary administrator had not been made aware by the respondent or the other licensing authorities that the respondent had engaged in professional misconduct and his other licenses to practice law had been suspended. At that time, the disciplinary administrator considered the respondent's correspondence as a self-report of the misconduct which occurred in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"20. In a letter dated June 17, 2013, to the disciplinary administrator the respondent disclosed that he engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by drafting a codicil to his mother's will. There is no evidence that the codicil was anything other than his mother's intent, however, the codicil did benefit the respondent by shielding his future inheritance from an outstanding tax obligation he had at that time. Further, the respondent's family members understood the purpose of the document. However, later, the codicil was nullified in a Johnson County, Kansas, probate proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"21. On July 29, 2013, the respondent returned the completed reinstatement questionnaire to the disciplinary administrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"22. On August 19, 2013, the respondent informed the disciplinary administrator that he wished to withdraw his request for reinstatement of his Kansas license. (As an aside, the respondent had not taken the steps necessary to request reinstatement of his license to practice law in Kansas. In order to seek reinstatement, the respondent had to complete continuing legal education hours, submit certain forms, and pay fees.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"23. Because the respondent had not been disciplined on a reciprocal basis in Kansas for the professional misconduct that occurred in the federal courts, the disciplinary administrator proceeded with the investigation and continued to correspond with the respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"24. In December, 2013, the respondent filed a second application for reinstatement in Missouri.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"25. On March 10, 2015, in a pleading filed with the Missouri Supreme Court, Missouri bar counsel recommended that the respondent's request for reinstatement be granted:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   '1. The reinstatement report was mailed to Applicant on February 19, 2015. Applicant responded in a letter received by OCDC on March 5, 2015, stating he has no objection to the report. His application is, then ready for decision by the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   '2. Applicant has satisfied the minimum requirements set forth in Rule 5.28. He obtained a passing score on the MPRE within the timeframe set forth in the rule. The Missouri Bar Director of Continuing Legal Education programs confirmed Applicant has reported the requisite CLE credits. He has paid the reinstatement fee and owes no disciplinary costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   '3. The Court's January 30, 2007, order requires that no application for reinstatement will be considered by the Court until Applicant is reinstated to practice in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which is the court from which the disciplinary case originated. The suspension of Applicant's privilege to practice in that court was terminated by the Eighth Circuit's order, issued in April [of] 2008. While the Eighth Circuit's suspension was terminated by that court, Applicant is not eligible for readmission to the Eighth Circuit until he is admitted to, among other options, the highest court of a state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 46(a). (FN Aside from admission to a state bar, an attorney is eligible for admission to the bar of a court of appeals if the attorney is admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court, another court of appeals, or a U.S. District Court.) Thus, while Applicant's federal suspension is terminated, he must be readmitted to a state court bar before he is eligible to apply for readmission to the federal court. Under these unique circumstances, the fact that Applicant is not reinstated to practice before the Eighth Circuit should not be an insurmountable impediment to his reinstatement to Missouri's Bar.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   '4. Applicant's mental health was an issue addressed in the Eighth Circuit's order of discipline. He was required to, and did, supply that court with a written report from a treating psychiatrist attesting to his ability to discharge his professional obligations. Applicant has been forthcoming about his mental health struggles in the course of staff counsel's investigation in the instant reinstatement case. At OCDC's request, Applicant provided letters from his psychiatrist and treating psychologist attesting to his ability to discharge his professional responsibilities and the stability of his emotional and psychological state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   '5. Applicant's first application for reinstatement was withdrawn by him in large part because he was not compliant with federal and state tax laws. He is currently compliant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   '6. Applicant has established a long-term non-controversial work history in the years since his 2006 suspension by the federal court. He states that he has maintained proficiency in his preferred area of practice, federal criminal defense work, by attending CLEs and connections with former colleagues. He professes eagerness to return to that area of practice in the federal district court in western Missouri.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"26. On April 30, 2015, the Missouri Supreme Court granted the respondent's application and reinstated his law license. The court, however, placed the respondent on probation for two years. The Missouri bar counsel informed the disciplinary administrator that the respondent's license to practice law in Missouri had been reinstated, subject to two years['] probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"27. In order to rectify the administrative issues related to his Kansas license, the respondent must comply with certain administrative requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   a. At the time of the hearing, the respondent needed to complete 120 hours of continuing legal education, with 20 of those hours classified as ethics hours. Now, because another registration period has passed, the respondent must complete 132 hours of continuing legal education, including 22 hours of ethics. Further, the respondent must pay a fee of $220 to the Kansas Continuing Legal Education Commission. At the time of the hearing, the respondent had completed 55.5 hours. The respondent has now completed 127.5 hours, including 21 hours of ethics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   b. The respondent must also make a written request to the Kansas Supreme\n   Court for reinstatement, complete the application for reinstatement form and provide associated documentation, and complete the 2017-2018 annual attorney registration form. At the time of the hearing, the respondent owed $765 to the Clerk of the Supreme Court. Since that time, again, the registration period has passed, so the respondent now owes a total of $830 to the Clerk of the Supreme Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"28. On May 23, 2017, the respondent entered into a voluntary monitoring agreement with the Kansas Lawyers' Assistance Program.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Conclusions of Law\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"29. Based upon the findings of fact, the hearing panel concludes as a matter of law that the respondent violated KRPC 1.3, KRPC 3.2, KRPC 5.5, and KRPC 8.4, as detailed below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \" KRPC 1.3 and KRPC 3.2\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"30. Attorneys must act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing their clients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   KRPC 1.3. Further, if an attorney fails to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of his client, the attorney violated KRPC 3.2. In this case, the respondent failed to diligently and promptly represent F.M. and R.L.A. in their appeals before the Eight[h] Circuit Court of Appeals. Because the respondent failed to act with reasonable diligence and promptness and failed to expedite the litigation consistent with the interests of his clients, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 1.3 and KRPC 3.2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \" KRPC 5.5\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"31. KRPC 5.5(a) prohibits the unauthorized practice of law. After the Kansas Supreme Court administratively suspended the respondent's license to practice law for failing to comply with the annual requirements to maintain a license, the respondent drafted a codicil for his mother. Drafting the codicil constituted the practice of law. As such, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 5.5(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \" KRPC 8.4\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \"32.

The respondent engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice when he failed to properly prosecute the federal criminal appeals. The respondent engaged in conduct that adversely reflected on the respondent's fitness to practice law when he drafted a codicil for his mother when his license to practice law was suspended. As such, the hearing panel concludes that the respondent violated KRPC 8.4(d) and (g).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"33. In making this recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel considered the factors outlined by the American Bar Association in its Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (hereinafter 'Standards'). Pursuant to Standard 3, the factors to be considered are the duty violated, the lawyer's mental state, the potential or actual injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct, and the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"34.\n   <em>\n    Duty Violated\n   </em>\n   .

The Kansas Supreme Court admitted the respondent to practice law in the State of Kansas in 1991.

Mitigating circumstances are any considerations or factors that may justify a reduction in the degree of discipline to be imposed. In reaching its recommendation for discipline, the hearing panel, in this case, found the following mitigating circumstances present:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Absence of a Prior Disciplinary Record\n   </em>\n   . While the respondent has previously been disciplined in Missouri and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, the underlying misconduct is the same as the underlying misconduct in this case. Thus, prior to the misconduct in the federal appeals, the respondent had not previously been disciplined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Absence of a Dishonest or Selfish Motive\n   </em>\n   .

The disciplinary administrator recommended that the respondent be suspended for a period of one year. The disciplinary administrator further recommended that the respondent's request for probation be granted and that he be allowed to again practice law in Kansas after he satisfies the administrative requirements to maintain a license to practice law. The disciplinary administrator recommended that the term of probation be two years. Finally, the disciplinary administrator suggested that additional conditions be added to the respondent's probation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \"41.

The respondent did not file exceptions to the panel's final hearing report. As such, the findings of fact are deemed admitted. Supreme Court Rule 212(c) and (d) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 255). Furthermore, the evidence before the panel establishes by clear and convincing evidence the charged misconduct violated KRPC 1.3 (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 290) (diligence), 3.2 (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 341) (expediting litigation), 5.5(a) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 361) (unauthorized practice of law), 8.4(d) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 379) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice), and 8.4(g) (engaging in conduct adversely reflecting on lawyer's fitness to practice law), and it supports the panel's conclusions of law. We adopt the panel's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The only remaining issue before us is the appropriate discipline for respondent's violations. At the panel hearing, the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended a one-year suspension from the practice of law, that respondent's request for probation be granted, that respondent be allowed to practice law in Kansas after he satisfies the administrative requirements to maintain a license to practice law, and that the term of probation be two years. The respondent recommended a two-year probation. The panel recommended a one-year suspension, that the suspension be suspended and respondent be placed on probation retroactive to the hearing date of May 24, 2017, for a period of two years and until specifically discharged by Kansas Supreme Court order, and that the terms and conditions in the final hearing report paragraph 43 be met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   At the hearing before this court, the attorney for the office of the Disciplinary Administrator recommended a one-year suspension, that the suspension be suspended, and respondent be placed on probation for two years\n   <em>\n    following\n   </em>\n   the date that respondent satisfies the administrative requirements to maintain a license to practice law in Kansas. Similarly, the respondent did not object to this recommendation and assured this court that he would satisfy those administrative requirements and emerge from his administrative suspension by no later than May 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In light of respondent's continuing administrative suspension and the uncertainty concerning when, precisely, that administrative suspension might be lifted, we are unable to precisely follow the unanimous recommended disposition of this matter. We are, however, in agreement that the recommendation is substantively appropriate. Therefore, we conclude the appropriate discipline in this matter is as follows: (1) a one-year disciplinary suspension from the practice of law; and (2) should respondent obtain relief from the administrative\n   suspension by satisfying the administrative requirements to maintain a license to practice law in Kansas, he may petition this court for an order to suspend the disciplinary suspension and the imposition of a two-year probation period consistent with the probation plan previously approved by the Disciplinary Administrator and continuing until specifically discharged by this court pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 211(g)(7) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 251).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   CONCLUSION AND DISCIPLINE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Lance M. Haley be and he is hereby disciplined by a one-year suspension from the practice of law in accordance with Supreme Court Rule 203(a)(2) (2017 Kan. S. Ct. R. 234), effective on the filing of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent is granted permission, once no longer administratively suspended, to petition this court for an order to suspend the one-year disciplinary suspension and the imposition of a two-year probation period consistent with the probation plan previously approved by the Disciplinary Administrator and continuing until specifically discharged by this court pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 211(g)(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the costs of these proceedings be assessed to the respondent and that this opinion be published in the official Kansas Reports.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
