The two had dissolved their marriage in 2008, but Pinkney had moved into Clark-Pinkney's home in 2013 after he began experiencing issues with his health. In 2014 Clark-Pinkney encouraged Pinkney to move from the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On the morning of November 7, Pinkney and Clark-Pinkney began arguing. Clark-Pinkney asked Pinkney to leave the living room where he had been sleeping on\n   the couch so that she could do some work. Pinkney refused to leave the room. When Pinkney later left the room to let his dog in the house, Clark-Pinkney sat on the couch where he had been sleeping. Pinkney became angry, started cursing at Clark-Pinkney, and went to his bedroom. Pinkney called a Veterans Affairs (VA) crisis hotline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 After about an hour, Clark-Pinkney believed Pinkney had fallen asleep, and she turned off the lights in his bedroom. Pinkney was still speaking to someone at the VA crisis hotline and yelled, \"She just came in here and turned the lights off on me.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (May 18, 2016) at 123. Pinkney believed that Clark-Pinkney knew he was still speaking on the phone when she turned off his lights. Clark-Pinkney and Pinkney dispute what happened next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 According to Clark-Pinkney, she heard Pinkney tell someone on the phone, \"I am going to kill her. I am going to kill her.\" VRP (May 18, 2016) at 125. Pinkney then ran out of his room, screamed at Clark-Pinkney and yelled, \"I am going to kill you.\" VRP (May 18, 2016) at 125. Pinkney also told Clark-Pinkney, \"I'm going to punch you in the face. I am going to put my hands around your neck, and this time I am going to kill you.\" VRP (May 18, 2016) at 127. Clark-Pinkney grabbed her phone, called Pinkney's daughter, and locked herself in a bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Pinkney admitted that he had a confrontation with Clark-Pinkney in the kitchen but denied that he had said anything to her. Pinkney stated that he had only clenched his fist near Clark-Pinkney's face and growled at her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 After receiving a call from the VA crisis hotline operator, Tacoma police officers arrived at the home to perform a welfare check on Pinkney. Pinkney told Officer Leah Mixon that \"he was at his wit's end with his ex-wife\" and that he \"was afraid he might kill her.\" VRP (May 18, 2016) at 88. After Officer Danilo Bambico spoke with Clark-Pinkney, the officers arrested Pinkney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The State charged Pinkney with one count of felony harassment based on a threat to kill. The matter proceeded to a jury trial. At trial, witnesses testified consistently with the facts as stated above. Additionally, Clark-Pinkney and Pinkney both testified about a 1998 incident in which Pinkney had been intoxicated, grabbed Clark-Pinkney by the neck, and threw her to the ground. The trial court instructed the jury on the lesser-included offense of misdemeanor harassment based on a threat of bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 On the lesser-included harassment charge, the State argued the following at closing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   If you don't find felony harassment, you are asked to consider the crime of harassment. The only difference, and you can look at the elements, is instead of a threat to kill, was a threat to cause bodily injury. That act alone, where the defendant is in that kitchen with his fist in Ms. Clark-Pinkney's face, is conduct that is a threat that is putting her in fear of physical harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   RP (May 19, 2016) at 148-49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The jury did not reach a verdict regarding the felony harassment charge and returned a verdict finding Pinkney guilty of the lesser-included harassment charge. The jury also returned a special verdict finding that Pinkney and Clark-Pinkney were members of the same family or household during the commission of the crime. Pinkney appeals from his harassment conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Pinkney first contends that the State failed to present sufficient evidence in support of his misdemeanor harassment conviction. Specifically, Pinkney contends that the State's evidence showed only that Pinkney raised his fist to Clark-Pinkney's face and that the harassment statute, RCW 9A.46.020, does not criminalize non-verbal threats. Because the term \"threaten\" as used in RCW 9A.46.020 includes non-verbal threats, evidence that Pinkney raised his fist to Clark-Pinkney's face and growled was sufficient to support Pinkney's misdemeanor harassment conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Evidence is sufficient to support a conviction if it permits any reasonable\n   juror to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt when viewed in the light most favorable to the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Condon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075689\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/182/307/#p314\">\n    182 Wash.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.3d%20357\">\n    343 P.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). A claim of insufficient evidence admits the truth of the State's evidence and all reasonable inferences that a juror can draw from that evidence.\n   <em>\n    Condon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4075689\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/182/307/#p314\">\n    182 Wash.2d at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=343%20P.3d%20357\">\n    343 P.3d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When reviewing the sufficiency of evidence in support of a conviction, we view circumstantial evidence as no less reliable than direct evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Ozuna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440912\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/184/238/#p248\">\n    184 Wash.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=359%20P.3d%20739\">\n    359 P.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Additionally, we \"defer to the trier of fact on issues of conflicting testimony, credibility of witnesses, and the persuasiveness of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9195821\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/150/821/#p874\">\n    150 Wash.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 874-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20P.3d%20970\">\n    83 P.3d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 To convict Pinkney of the lesser-included crime of misdemeanor harassment as instructed, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) without lawful authority, (2) he knowingly threatened to cause Clark-Pinkney bodily injury immediately or in the future, and (3) by words or conduct placed Clark-Pinkney in reasonable fear that the threat would be carried out. RCW 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i), (b). Pinkney challenges only the second element, asserting that RCW 9A.46.020 does not criminalize non-verbal threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Our fundamental goal in statutory interpretation is to ascertain and carry out the intent of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    State v. Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440941\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/184/843/#p848\">\n    184 Wash.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20P.3d%20740\">\n    365 P.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). In doing so, we look first to the plain language of the statute.\n   <em>\n    State v. Armendariz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3630933\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/160/106/#p110\">\n    160 Wash.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 110,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=156%20P.3d%20201\">\n    156 P.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). In determining the plain meaning of a statute based on statutory language, we examine the context of the statute, related provisions, and the statutory scheme as a whole.\n   <em>\n    State v. Conover\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793524\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/706/#p711\">\n    183 Wash.2d 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=355%20P.3d%201093\">\n    355 P.3d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). The plain meaning of an undefined statutory term can be discerned from the dictionary definition of the term.\n   <em>\n    Estate of Haselwood v. Bremerton Ice Arena, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4002044\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/166/489/#p498\">\n    166 Wash.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=210%20P.3d%20308\">\n    210 P.3d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 We hold that the plain meaning of \"threaten\" as used in RCW 9A.46.020 includes all threats, whether or not verbalized. As relevant, RCW 9A.04.110(28) defines \"threat\" in the context of RCW 9A.46.020 in the following terms: \" '[t]hreat' means to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent: (a) To cause bodily injury in the future to the person threatened or to any other person.\" In turn, the plain meaning of \"communicate\" includes non-verbal conduct. For example,\n   <em>\n    State v. Toscano\n   </em>\n   held that \" '[c]ommunication' is '[t]he expression or exchange of information by speech, writing,\n   <em>\n    gestures\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    or conduct\n   </em>\n   ; the process of bringing an idea to another's perception.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684790\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/166/546/#p554\">\n    166 Wash. App. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20P.3d%20912\">\n    271 P.3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (emphasis added) (quoting BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY at 296 (8th ed. 2004) ). Similarly,\n   <em>\n    State v. Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5883625\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/132/415/#p421\">\n    132 Wash. App. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=132%20P.3d%201095\">\n    132 P.3d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), held that defendant's physical behavior of taking a \"fighting stance\" met the statutory definition of \"threat\" under RCW 9A.76.180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Under this authority, the plain meaning of \"threaten\" as used in RCW 9A.46.020 may include non-verbal utterances or gestures. Clenching one's fist in another person's face and growling conveys to a reasonable person the intention to cause bodily harm to that person. With that, Pinkney's actions constituted a threat to cause bodily harm under RCW 9A.04.110(28) and\n   <em>\n    Toscano\n   </em>\n   , discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Thus, evidence that Pinkney raised his fist to Clark-Pinkney's face and growled was sufficient to support a jury finding that he knowingly threatened to cause her bodily injury immediately or in the future. Accordingly, Pinkney's sufficiency claim lacks merit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b618 Next, Pinkney contends that the prosecutor committed flagrant and ill-intentioned\n   misconduct by misstating the law during closing argument. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 A defendant claiming prosecutorial misconduct must show both improper conduct and resulting prejudice.\n   <em>\n    State v. Fisher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5751750\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/165/727/#p747\">\n    165 Wash.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 747,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=202%20P.3d%20937\">\n    202 P.3d 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). A prosecutor's misstatement of the law may constitute improper conduct.\n   <em>\n    State v. Davenport\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1142105\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/100/757/#p763\">\n    100 Wash.2d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20P.2d%201213\">\n    675 P.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Prejudice exists when there is a substantial likelihood that the misconduct affected the verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v. McKenzie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3005156\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/157/44/#p52\">\n    157 Wash.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=134%20P.3d%20221\">\n    134 P.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). If, as here, a defendant fails to object to the prosecutor's allegedly improper conduct at trial, the defendant waives a claim of prosecutorial misconduct on appeal unless the conduct was \"so flagrant and ill-intentioned that an instruction could not have cured the resulting prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Emery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022108\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/174/741/#p760\">\n    174 Wash.2d 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 760-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20P.3d%20653\">\n    278 P.3d 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b620 Pinkney asserts that the prosecutor misstated the law by arguing to the jury at closing argument that it could find Pinkney guilty of harassment based on his non-verbal threat of raising his fist to Clark-Pinkney's face. Pinkney contends that this was a misstatement of law because RCW 9A.46.020 does not criminalize non-verbal threats. Having rejected that contention above, Pinkney fails to show that the prosecutor committed misconduct by misstating the law at closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   III. CORPUS DELICTI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b621 Last, Pinkney contends that his conviction must be reversed because the State failed to support the corpus delicti of the crime charged with evidence independent of his confession. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 As an initial matter, the State asserts that Pinkney has waived his corpus delicti claim on appeal by failing to assert it at trial. However, after briefing was completed in this matter, our Supreme Court held that a defendant may raise a corpus delicti claim for the first time on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Cardenas-Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20Wash.%202d%20243\">\n    189 Wash.2d 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20P.3d%2019\">\n    401 P.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

As applied to Pinkney's lesser-included harassment charge, the State was required to present prima facie evidence that (1) someone's threat of bodily injury caused (2) Clark-Pinkney to reasonably fear that such threat would be carried out. Clark-Pinkney's testimony that Pinkney had threatened to kill her, punch her in the face, and put his hands around her neck, together with her testimony that she feared he would carry out\n   those threats, was prima facie independent evidence establishing the corpus delicti for the crime of harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b626 Pinkney contends that we cannot consider Clark-Pinkney's testimony about Pinkney's threats to kill her when determining whether independent evidence supported the corpus delicti of misdemeanor harassment because the jury's failure to reach a verdict on his felony harassment charge showed that it did not find Clark-Pinkney's testimony credible. However, in contrast to the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof required for a criminal conviction, evidence required to support the corpus delicti of a crime \"need not be sufficient to support a conviction or even show that the offense occurred by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because the standard of proof required to support the corpus delicti of a crime is lower than that required to support a criminal conviction, the jury's failure to reach a verdict on Pinkney's felony harassment charge is irrelevant to our determination of whether independent evidence supported the corpus delicti of misdemeanor harassment. Accordingly, Pinkney's corpus delicti contentions fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b627 The plain meaning of \"threaten\" as used in RCW 9A.46.020 includes all threats, whether or not verbalized. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support finding that Pinkney knowingly threatened to cause Clark-Pinkney bodily injury immediately or in the future. We also hold against Pinkney's other challenges and affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Worswick, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Maxa, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Pinkney also requests that we exercise our discretion to waive appellate costs in this matter. Because Pinkney's current or likely future ability to pay appellate costs may be addressed by a commissioner of this court under RAP 14.2, we defer this matter to our commissioner in the event that the State files a cost bill.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Because evidence that Pinkney raised his fist to Clark-Pinkney's face and growled at her was sufficient for the jury to find the State had proved the \"knowingly threaten\" element of misdemeanor harassment, we need not address Pinkney's argument that the jury could not consider evidence of his verbal threats to kill Clark-Pinkney in light of its failure to reach a verdict on the felony harassment charge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
