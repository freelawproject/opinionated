The proceedings in CU-05-305 culminated in the issuance of Decision No. 479. In Decision No. 479, in conjunction with and pursuant to various other findings and conclusions, some of which are disputed by HSTA, HLRB ruled in favor of HSTA, concluding: \"For the reasons discussed above, the Board denies the Complaint in its entirety, and hereby dismisses the Complaint.\" At the conclusion of the proceedings on HSTA's appeal to the Circuit Court, in the February 17, 2015 Circuit Court Order, the court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the HLRB's Decision No. 479 and Order No. 2948 are AFFIRMED,\n   <em>\n    as the Court finds that the HSTA is not an aggrieved party\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"Whether the circuit court has jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs' complaint presents a question of law, reviewable\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .

First, HSTA argues that it was aggrieved by procedural errors reflected in Order No. 2948, even though the claims against it were denied and the Complaint was dismissed, because it is possible that the HLRB might \"misuse\" its rules again in the future. This argument is without merit, as the possibility of injury is insufficient to constitute a concrete injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Pub. Workers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261602\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/376/#p380\">\n    80 Hawai'i at 380-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261602\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/376/#p380\">\n    910 P.2d at 151-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   HSTA also argues that it could have been-injured by the HLRB's erroneous factual findings if the arbitrator in the related arbitration proceedings had given those findings preclusive effect. Again, this argument is without merit, as the possibility of injury is insufficient to constitute a concrete injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12261602\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/80/376/#p380\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, it is undisputed that the arbitrator in those related proceedings preliminarily and finally concluded that no preclusive effect would be given to the HLRB's findings, thus rendering this issue moot. Thus, even if this issue was properly before the Circuit Court, it is now moot and no longer justiciable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton ex rel. Lethem v. Lethem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    119 Hawai'i 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    193 P.3d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 843 (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nevertheless, as argued by HSTA, once the Circuit Court concluded that HSTA did not have standing to bring an appeal under HRS \u00a7 91-14, it no longer had subject matter jurisdiction to determine the merits of HSTA's appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    119 Hawai'i at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310486\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/119/1/#p5\">\n    193 P.3d at 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we conclude that the Circuit Court erred in affirming the HLRB's rulings, rather than dismissing HSTA's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For these reasons, we vacate the Circuit Court Order and Judgment affirming of HLRB's Decision No. 479 and Order No. 2948 and remand with instructions to dismiss HSTA's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corboy v.
