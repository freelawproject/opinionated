Michaela Byrnes sold property to Michael and Carla Jo Harper on a contract for deed. A dispute arose over the Harpers' right to prepay the contract and Ms. Byrnes' obligation to deliver the deed, and the Harpers filed a declaratory judgment action. The district court ruled in favor of the Harpers and ordered Ms. Byrnes to pay attorney fees and costs for discovery violations. Ms. Byrnes filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   appeal from both orders. We dismiss Ms. Byrnes' appeal of the declaratory judgment ruling as untimely, summarily affirm the order awarding fees and costs for failure to present cogent argument or pertinent authority, and grant the Harpers' request for sanctions pursuant to W.R.A.P. 10.05.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] We agree with the Harpers' statement of the dispositive issues, which we restate as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Did Ms. Byrnes file a timely notice of appeal from the district court's declaratory judgment order?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Did Ms. Byrnes support her appeal from the order awarding fees and costs with cogent argument or pertinent authority?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Should the Harpers be awarded sanctions pursuant to W.R.A.P. 10.05 ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b63] Ms. Byrnes sold property in Johnson County to the Harpers on a contract for deed dated September 1, 2015. Rather than placing the deed in escrow, Ms. Byrnes retained the deed until final payment. In November 2015, the Harpers notified Ms. Byrnes that they had obtained financing and wished to pay the outstanding balance on the contract for deed. The Harpers made multiple requests that Ms. Byrnes deliver the deed to the closing agent, but Ms. Byrnes refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b64] On September 1, 2016, the Harpers filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that the contract for deed allowed early payoff and required Ms. Byrnes to deliver the deed. The Harpers also requested that the district court order Ms. Byrnes to remove her personal property from the premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 20, 2016, Ms. Byrnes filed her answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b65] The district court set the matter for a bench trial to be held on March 10, 2017. On February 27, 2017, the Harpers moved to compel Ms. Byrnes to provide discovery responses, and the district court granted that motion. On March 1, 2017, Ms. Byrnes filed a motion for peremptory disqualification, which the court denied as untimely. On March 10, the district court held the bench trial and orally announced its ruling in favor of the Harpers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b66] On April 10, 2017, the district court entered its written order granting the Harpers their requested declaratory relief. On April 20, 2017, Ms. Byrnes filed a document entitled \"Motion for Reconsideration Motion to Vacate Order Signed April 10, 2017.\" On May 3, 2017, the district court entered an order awarding the Harpers attorneys fees and costs for Ms. Byrnes' discovery violations, and on May 9, 2017, it entered an order denying Ms. Byrnes' motion for reconsideration. On May 22, 2017, Ms. Byrnes filed a notice of appeal from the district court's April 10, May 3, and May 9 orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Timeliness of Ms. Byrnes' Notice of Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b67] Whether Ms. Byrnes filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court's\n   declaratory judgment order is a determination we make\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Lokey v.

To be timely, Ms. Byrnes' notice of appeal had to be filed within thirty days from entry of the appealable order. W.R.A.P. 2.01(a). Ms. Byrnes' notice of appeal clearly was not filed within thirty days of the district court's April 10, 2017 order, and the only question is whether her motion for reconsideration tolled the time for appeal. We conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b68] A W.R.C.P. 59 motion for a new trial will toll the time for appeal. W.R.A.P. 2.02(a). \"The time for filing a notice of appeal is not tolled, however, when the title or content of a post-judgment filing reflects that it is nothing more than a request that the court reconsider a previously entered judgment or appealable order.\"\n   <em>\n    Lokey\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6795954\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/374/311/\">\n    374 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   314-15 (citing\n   <em>\n    Waldron v.

The motion therefore did not toll the time for appealing the district court's April 10, 2017 order, and we dismiss Ms. Byrnes' appeal of that order as untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Appeal of the Order Awarding Attorney Fees and Costs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b610] \"The longstanding rule of this Court is to summarily affirm 'cases or issues in cases that are not presented with cogent argument or pertinent authority.' \"\n   <em>\n    DW v.

Ms. Byrnes' opening brief does not contain a single citation to the record, and she made no argument and cited no pertinent authority in either her opening brief or reply brief to support her challenge to the order awarding fees and costs.
