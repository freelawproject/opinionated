In 2012, Arnold lost the Republican primary election for University of Colorado Regent to Brian Davidson. During the run-up to the primary election, CBF purchased a radio advertisement supporting Davidson and other radio advertisements containing messages unfavorable to Arnold. After the election, Arnold, and later CIW with Arnold as its principal officer, filed a series of complaints with the Colorado Secretary of State (Secretary) alleging violations of the Fair Campaign Practices Act (FCPA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 CIW now appeals the decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluding that no reporting violations for both billed and donated legal services had been established on the part of CBF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, CIW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   challenges CBF's spending on legal fees in 2012 and 2013, as well as donated legal services in 2013 and 2014. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the ALJ for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 CIW appeals the rejection of its fourth complaint against CBF. In the first complaint,\n   <em>\n    Arnold v. Coloradans for a Better Future,\n   </em>\n   No. OS 2012-0024 and No. OS 2012-0025 (O.A.C. Jan. 11, 2013), the ALJ imposed a penalty of $4525 for CBF's failure to report certain electioneering communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 In the second complaint,\n   <em>\n    Arnold v. Coloradans for a Better Future,\n   </em>\n   No. OS 2013-0007 (O.A.C. Dec. 26, 2013), Arnold alleged that CBF did not report in April 2013 the legal services it received to defend the first case as either contributions or expenditures. An ALJ found that Arnold did not prove any violation because there was no evidence that CBF paid for legal services as part of any express advocacy. A division of our court affirmed in\n   <em>\n    Arnold v. Coloradans for a Better Future,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20494622\">\n    2015 WL 494622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo.App. No. 14CA0122, Feb. 5, 2015) (not published pursuant to C.A.R. 35(f) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 In the third complaint,\n   <em>\n    Campaign Integrity Watchdog v. Coloradans for a Better Future,\n   </em>\n   No. OS 2014-004 (O.A.C. Feb. 25, 2015), CIW alleged that CBF failed to accurately report contributions it had received and expenses it had incurred to pay Arnold's court costs from an earlier case. The case was continued pending CBF's response to a subpoena duces tecum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 In the fourth and present case, CIW alleges that CBF did not report in April 2013, July 2013, October 2013, and January 2014 legal services it had received as either contributions or spending. An ALJ held a hearing on September 2, 2014, at which CBF did not appear. Nevertheless, the ALJ found in favor of CBF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 CBF did not file an answer brief in this appeal, but the Secretary filed a brief as amicus curiae in support of the ALJ's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II. Mootness\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 We ordered CIW and the Secretary to show cause why we should not dismiss the appeal as moot. The record indicates that CBF was terminated\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as a political organization on March 6, 2014 (before the ALJ issued his decision), and it was not clear to us that there was any practical relief that we could afford the organization if CIW were to prevail on appeal. Accordingly, we must first address whether this appeal is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 9 A political organization may only terminate by filing a termination report if the organization's TRACER\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   account has a zero balance, indicating that it has no cash or assets on hand and that there are no outstanding debts, penalties, or obligations. Dep't of State Reg. 1505-6, 8 Colo.Code Regs. 1505-6:12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 10 We normally refrain from addressing issues that have become moot because\n   any opinion would not have a practical effect on an alleged controversy.\n   <em>\n    Trinidad Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Lopez By &amp; Through Lopez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11695692\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/963/1095/#p1102\">\n    963 P.2d 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1102 (Colo.1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 CIW contends that to conclude that a political organization that had filed a termination report could not be sued would lead to the absurd result that entities which were potentially liable for violating the FCPA could escape accountability by \"terminating.\" We agree. Although CBF terminated its existence as a political organization before CIW filed its fourth complaint, we conclude the appeal is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 The primary campaign finance law in Colorado is Article XXVIII of the Colorado Constitution, which was approved by the voters in 2002. Article XXVIII imposes contribution limits, as well as reporting and disclosure requirements, and creates an enforcement process for violations of its provisions. Colorado also has the FCPA, \u00a7\u00a7 1-45-101 to - 118, C.R.S.2015, which was originally enacted in 1971, repealed and re-enacted by initiative in 1996, substantially amended in 2000, and again substantially revised by initiative in 2002 as the result of the adoption of Article XXVIII. The Secretary further regulates campaign finance practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep't of State Reg. 1505-6, 8 Code Colo. Regs. 1505-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Neither the regulations nor the Colorado Campaign and Political Finance Manual, a manual produced by the Secretary which provides guidelines for proper compliance with campaign finance laws in Colorado, permits an entity to avoid potential liability for campaign finance violations by filing a termination report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Colo. Sec. of State,\n   <em>\n    Colorado Campaign and Political Finance Manual\n   </em>\n   34-35 (rev. July 2015), https://perma.cc/D792-UDVK;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dep't of State Reg. 1505-6, 8 Code Colo. Regs. 1505-6:4.4 (issue committees); 1505-6:12.3 (committees generally); 1505-6:18 (application penalties and violations for failure to comply). While the regulations and the manual only apply the term \"terminate\" to candidates, candidate committees, and issue committees, the Secretary has applied \"terminate\" to political organizations, and we will do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 The Secretary notes that he routinely refers complaints filed against terminated entities to the Office of Administrative Courts (OAC), and the OAC typically resolves those cases on the merits. Indeed, section 9(2)(a) of article XXVIII states that \"[a]ny person ... may file a written complaint with the secretary of state no later than one hundred eighty days after the date of the alleged violation\" and makes no distinction between active entities and terminated ones. While penalties imposed against a terminated political organization may prove difficult to collect, they are not mooted by a political organization's termination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W. Spring Serv. Co. v. Andrew,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"67340\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/229/413/#p420\">\n    229 F.2d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 420 (10th Cir.1956) (under Colorado law, judgment against dissolved partnership is permissible). Concluding the appeal is not moot, we turn to the merits of the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III. Interpretation of Article XXVIII and FCPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 CIW raises two contentions on appeal: (1) the ALJ erred when he concluded that CBF did not need to report certain legal services as spending and (2) the ALJ erred when he concluded that CBF only needed to report contributions that were for the purpose of promoting a candidate's nomination or election. We disagree with the first contention but agree with the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.

Spending and Expenditures\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 The ALJ found that CBF either spent money on legal services in 2012 or 2013 for defending the previous campaign finance complaints or \"had a contractual obligation to pay [its attorney's] invoices\" during that time. CBF did not report any of this spending. However, the ALJ concluded that the FCPA did not define spending, applied the definition of expenditure, and concluded that the money spent on legal fees fell outside of that category because it followed the primary election for University of Colorado regent and therefore was not reportable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 CIW contends that the money CBF spent on legal fees was reportable. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1. Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 A political organization must disclose \"[a]ny spending by the political organization that exceeds twenty dollars in any one reporting period.\" \u00a7 1-45-108.5(1)(b), C.R.S.2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 The FCPA defines spending as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   funds expended influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any state or local public office in the state and includes, without limitation, any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything else of value by any political organization, a contract, promise, or agreement to expend funds made or entered into by any political organization, or any electioneering communication by any political organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00a7 1-45-103(16.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 24 The Colorado Constitution defines expenditure as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   any purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money by any person for the purpose of expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate or supporting or opposing a ballot issue or ballot question.

Const. art. XXVIII, \u00a7 2 (8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   2. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 25 CIW argues that because political organizations are required to report and disclose any spending in excess of twenty dollars in a reporting period, the ALJ erred in ruling that CBF did not commit any reporting violations. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 26 First, the ALJ erred in concluding that \"spending\" is not defined in the FCPA. Spending is defined as quoted above in section 1-45-103(16.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 27 CIW and the Secretary both argue that money spent by a group that is formed with the express purpose of influencing political campaigns is, by definition, unambiguously campaign related. We disagree. First, we note that neither CIW nor the Secretary attempted to define \"campaign related,\" a term not used in section 1-45-103(16.5). Second, the definition of spending has two parts. The first limits covered\n   spending to spending for a particular purpose, specifically expending funds to influence or attempt to influence \"the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any state or local public office in the state.\" \u00a7 1-45-103(16.5). Only if this purpose is met do we turn to the second part of the definition to determine if the spent funds were spent in a manner covered by the definition-that is, by \"purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything else of value by any political organization, a contract, promise, or agreement to expend funds made or entered into by any political organization, or any electioneering communication by any political organization.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10323606\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/924/517/#p522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 28 Both CIW and the Secretary misapprehend the definition of spending because they focus on the \"means\" part of the definition and disregard the \"purpose\" part of the definition. They focus on the broad language in the statute as to what constitutes spending and overlook the \"purpose\" part of the FCPA's spending definition, which establishes the parameters of that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 29 We recognize that CBF was registered as a political organization under section 1-45-103. There can be no dispute that political organizations are formed for the purpose of engaging in political speech. \u00a7 1-45-103(14.5) (A \"political organization\" is defined as one that is \"engaged in influencing or attempting to influence the ... election ... of any individual to ... public office.\"). However, while a political organization exists for the sole purpose of influencing elections, not all spending by a political organization is necessarily spent to influence or attempt to influence an election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shays v.

The funds were not \"expended influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any state or local public office in the state.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1-45-103(16.5).

Contributions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 31 The ALJ concluded that an attorney \"rendered some amount of legal service to [CBF] in January 2014 for which he did not bill[.]\" An attorney either donated legal services to CBF to prepare contribution and expenditure reports in late 2013 and early 2014 or he or she billed for, but did not collect on, legal services to CBF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying article XXVIII, section 2(5)(a)(IV), the ALJ ruled that, to prevail, CIW needed to prove that the legal services were donated for the purpose of promoting a candidate's nomination or election. The ALJ then concluded that the legal services were not reportable in-kind contributions because they were donated after the 2012 election, and thus could not have been provided with the intent to promote the election of a candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 32 CIW contends the ALJ erred when he concluded that CBF needed to report only contributions that were for the purpose of promoting a candidate's nomination or election. CIW argues that the legal services constituted reportable contributions, and CBF therefore violated disclosure and reporting requirements. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   1. Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 33 The FCPA defines \"political organization,\" as relevant here, as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   a political organization defined in section 527(e)(1) of the federal \"Internal Revenue Code of 1986,\" as amended, that is engaged in influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any state\n   or local public office in the state and that is exempt, or intends to seek any exemption, from taxation pursuant to section 527 of the internal revenue code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00a7 1-45-103(14.5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 34 Under the Internal Revenue Code, a political organization is \"organized and operated primarily for the purpose of ... influencing or attempting to influence\" an election.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20527\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1)-(2) (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 35 A political organization must disclose \"[a]ny contributions it receives, including ... each person who has contributed twenty dollars or more to the political organization in the reporting period, and ... each natural person who has made a contribution of one hundred dollars or more to the political organization[.]\" \u00a7 1-45-108.5(1)(a), C.R.S.2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 36 Contributions are defined in the Colorado Constitution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (a) \"Contribution\" means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (I) The payment, loan, pledge, gift, or advance of money, or guarantee of a loan, made to any candidate committee, issue committee, political committee, small donor committee, or political party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (II) Any payment made to a third party for the benefit of any candidate committee, issue committee, political committee, small donor committee, or political party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (III) The fair market value of any gift or loan of property made to any candidate committee, issue committee, political committee, small donor committee or political party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (IV) Anything of value given, directly or indirectly, to a candidate for the purpose of promoting the candidate's nomination, retention, recall, or election.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Colo. Const. art.

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 38 CIW argues that CBF failed to report the \"in-kind\" contribution of legal services and that the ALJ erred when he relied on one part of the constitutional definition of contribution, while ignoring the FCPA definition. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 39 The ALJ noted that the FCPA adopts the constitutional definition of contribution, and applied section 2(5)(a)(IV) of article XXVIII to conclude that the legal services were not reportable in-kind contributions. But even if the ALJ correctly concluded that subsection (a)(IV) does not apply to the legal services at issue here, we conclude the ALJ erred in not applying other applicable parts of the FCPA definition of contribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 40 As noted, section 1-45-103(6)(a) incorporates the definition of contribution set forth in article XXVIII, section 2(5). While it is true that sections 2(5)(a)(I)-(III) of article XXVIII do not by their terms apply to political organizations, sections 1-45-103(6)(c)(I) -(III) mirror sections 2(5)(a)(I)-(III), expressly applying them to political organizations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1-45-103(6)(b) further\n   explains the definition of contribution under the FCPA. Sections 1-45-103(6)(b) and (c)(I) -(III) do not include any purpose limitation, and therefore must be considered independently of any purpose limitation in section 2(5)(a)(IV).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 41 We agree with CIW that subsection (b) or (c)(I) of section 1-45-103(6) applies here. As noted above, subsection (b) covers \"a contribution for which the contributor receives compensation or consideration of less than equivalent value to such contribution, including, ... services\" and subsection (c)(I) covers \"[a]ny ... gift ... made to any political organization.\" It is undisputed that the legal services at issue here were either a gift of services for which less than equivalent value was received (if the services were billed but not paid) or they were pro bono services. Therefore, CBF received a contribution which it was required to report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   IV. Costs and Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 42 CIW requests we award it reasonable costs and fees in bringing this appeal pursuant to section 1-45-111.5(2), C.R.S.2015. However, section 1-45-111.5(2) does not apply to costs on appeal. Therefore, we deny CIW's requests for costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   V. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b6 43 We affirm the ALJ's conclusion that CBF did not need to report certain legal services as spending, reverse the ALJ's conclusion that CBF needed to report only contributions that were for the purpose of promoting a candidate's nomination or election, and remand to the ALJ for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   JUDGE J.
