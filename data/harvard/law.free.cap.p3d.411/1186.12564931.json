On appeal, Williams raises six issues: (1) that the district court abused its discretion by denying Williams' motion to sever the two robbery charges; (2) that the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument amounting to fundamental error; (3) that the district court deprived Williams of his state constitutional right to hybrid representation; (4) that the district court deprived Williams of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to a fair trial and to be free from excessive restraints during pretrial proceedings; (5) that the district court deprived Williams of his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation; and (6) that the district court erred in denying Williams' motions to suppress the evidence obtained from Williams' detention and from his hotel room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons provided below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In July 2012, a Caucasian male wearing a maroon shirt, white baseball cap, and large mirrored aviator sunglasses entered a bank in Boise, minutes after opening. The man handed the teller a note demanding money, and the man indicated that he had a gun and would shoot. The teller described the robber, who did not have a mask, as having an upturned nose. The suspect fled the bank after receiving the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2015, a 5-foot-8-inch to 6-foot Caucasian male wearing mirrored aviator sunglasses approached a teller at another branch of the same bank, shortly after opening, and demanded cash bills consisting of twenty, fifty, and one hundred dollar bills. The man wore a long-sleeved maroon windbreaker jacket, a maroon handkerchief-type mask that he snapped over his mouth and nose, and a black baseball-style hat covering his ears. He explicitly told the teller to retrieve money from two specific tills, and the man did not want any die packs or \"bait.\" At no time did he display a firearm or threaten to use a firearm. After receiving the money, he left on foot. Contrary to the robber's demand, the teller provided the man with bait\n   money and one bill affixed with a tracking device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The tracking device sent out a tone alert to law enforcement, leading officers to an intersection where the bill, affixed with the tracking device, lay in the middle of the street. Officers then contacted a nearby HVAC business which had outside video cameras recording the street where the bill was located. The HVAC video contained footage of a Caucasian man in a green compact sedan with a lime-green bumper sticker centered on the trunk. The driver, who appeared to have no facial hair and closely cropped hair, dropped something out of the driver's side window. The driver's jacket and bandana matched the description of the April 2015 robber. The investigating officer determined the vehicle was a 1997 or 1998 Chevy Malibu with customized wheels and out-of-state plates. Additionally, the investigating officer also noticed, after reviewing internal surveillance videos from the bank, a small, yet visible, raised bump the size of a pencil eraser on the back side of the robber's left hand, located between the third finger and the wrist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2015, a Caucasian male, between 5 foot 8 inches and 6 foot, entered the same bank, just after opening, as that in the 2012 robbery. The man wore a yellow long-sleeved jacket, a yellow handkerchief mask, a dark-billed hat, and mirrored aviator sunglasses. He demanded twenty, fifty, and one hundred dollar bills from two particular drawers and specifically asked for no trackers or die packs. As the teller pulled money from the drawers, the robber noticed a tracking device on one of the twenty dollar bills. After the man grabbed the bill and felt the tracking device inside, he lifted his shirt and pointed to a gun in his waistband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After investigation, which included the internal surveillance videos from the banks, the investigating officer suspected, due to noteworthy similarities, that the same individual committed all three robberies. Based on the HVAC video footage from the April 2015 robbery and still shots of the suspect from the banks' video footage during the three robberies, the investigating officer issued a bulletin to news and local police departments requesting any information on the suspect. That same day, a detective notified the investigating officer that a vehicle matching that described in the bulletin was parked at a nearby hotel. The detective took and sent pictures of the vehicle to confirm. The investigating officer requested that the detective, who was in plain clothes and an unmarked car, remain with the vehicle. The vehicle was a green, 1999 Chevy Malibu with wheels consistent with the images from the April 2015 HVAC footage. On the trunk there was a section of a bumper sticker which matched the same shape and size of the bumper sticker from the April 2015 footage. In addition, there was an adhesive residue with a greenish tint which was also consistent with the lime-green bumper sticker location seen in the April HVAC 2015 footage. The license plate also matched the April 2015 footage; a white and blue out-of-state license plate. Additionally, the rims on the wheels matched those depicted in the April 2015 HVAC photographs. Another detective confirmed with the hotel's manager that according to the hotel's records, the vehicle was registered in Williams' name and that Williams had been residing at the hotel in the same room for two weeks. Hotel staff also confirmed that Williams was the only occupant of the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The vehicle's license number was run through the Washington Bureau of Licensing. The report confirmed Williams was the sole registered owner and had been since prior to the April 2015 robbery. The investigating officer also confirmed Williams' date of birth, height, and Washington address. Williams' DMV photograph, received by the investigating officer, revealed an upturned nose and closely cropped hair, consistent with the photograph and description of the suspect from the 2012 robbery. Moreover, another detective indicated that he believed, after observing Williams entering and leaving the room registered to Williams, that Williams was the same individual on the bulletin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to determine whether Williams had an identifying bump on the back of his left hand, matching that of the suspected robber, an officer dressed as a tow truck operator stood near a tow truck as it backed up to Williams' sedan. Williams exited his room and approached the tow truck. When\n   the officer showed Williams his badge, Williams turned away and refused to speak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Law enforcement then placed Williams in handcuffs. The investigating officer confirmed that Williams' nose was similar to the description given by the witness in the 2012 robbery. Then, the investigating officer rolled Williams' left hand to the side and observed a visible bump, consistent with the one seen in the bank surveillance video. The investigating officer, believing that Williams was very likely the suspect wanted for the robberies, had a patrol car dispatched to the scene, and law enforcement placed Williams inside. The investigating officer testified that at this point he placed Williams under arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After peering through Williams' hotel room window and noticing two backpacks, the investigating officer applied for a search warrant for the vehicle and hotel room. In his affidavit, the investigating officer set out his investigation, including a description of the similarities between the three robberies and his corroborations regarding the vehicle; Williams' unique nose; and the similar bump on his left hand. Additionally, the investigating officer noted he had eighteen years of experience as a police officer in Idaho, serving as a detective for the violent crimes robbery unit for the last eight of those years. He also included photos from his investigation, including still shots from each of the three bank robberies; photos of the vehicle (both from the HVAC video and from the hotel parking lot); and Williams' DMV photo. A search warrant was issued for Williams' hotel room and the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   During the search of a backpack inside the hotel room, the investigating officer found a green lightweight coat with a green piece of sewn triangular cloth, sewing needles, a handgun, and magazines. Inside the vehicle, the investigating officer found a blue and green coat with a blue and green acid washed cloth and several large mirrored \"aviator\" sunglasses in the jacket's center pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Police also found nearly $7,000, with some of the bills bearing sequential serial numbers. Williams was indicted for one count of robbery and one count of a felon in possession of a firearm. Williams pled not guilty. Four months later, the State indicted Williams for an additional count of robbery with a firearm enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to trial, Williams made several motions, including a motion to sever the two robbery charges and two motions to suppress evidence. Williams also requested (1) to be released from the \"black box handcuffs\" during his pretrial proceedings; (2) to have substitute counsel because he was dissatisfied with his counsel's tactical decisions; (3) to have trial counsel perform voir dire, while Williams conducted the remainder of the trial pro se; and (4) to be free of restraints while representing himself during trial. The district court, after conducting hearings, denied Williams' motions. The district court determined that due to safety concerns Williams would wear the black box during pretrial proceedings. Further, the court instructed Williams he could either represent himself or have counsel, not both. Additionally, after being instructed that he would wear a leg tether during trial, Williams withdrew his request to self-represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A jury found Williams guilty of two counts of robbery, one count of a firearm enhancement, and one count of a felon in possession of a firearm. The district court entered a judgment of conviction. Williams timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Sever\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Williams first argues the district court erred in denying his motion to sever the two robbery charges. Williams argues the evidence of the two separate robbery charges would be inadmissible character evidence and that neither demonstrated a common plan, scheme, or identity. Alternatively, Williams argues that even if the evidence was admissible, the charges should have been severed because the probative value of the evidence of each offense was substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect. The State argues the evidence revealed a common plan or scheme. Further, the State argues the evidence of each separate robbery was admissible to show identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review a district court's denial of a motion to sever under an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State v.

When a trial court's discretionary decision is reviewed on appeal, the appellate court conducts a multi-tiered inquiry to determine whether the lower court correctly perceived the issue as one of discretion, acted within the boundaries of such discretion and consistently with any legal standards applicable to the specific choices before it, and reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2015). Idaho Criminal Rule 14 provides that upon the showing of unfair prejudice, the court \"may order the state to elect between counts, grant separate trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants, or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There are three potential sources of prejudice for a court to consider when considering a motion to sever based on I.C.R. 14 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) the jury may confuse and cumulate the evidence, and convict the defendant of one or both crimes when it would not convict him of either if it could keep evidence properly segregated; (2) the defendant may be confounded in presenting defenses, as where he desires to assert his privilege against self-incrimination with respect to one crime but not to the other; or (3) the jury may conclude that the defendant is guilty of one crime and then find him guilty of the other because of his criminal disposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

On appeal, Williams focuses on the third potential prejudice; where the jury could find guilt based on a perceived criminal disposition. Thus, Williams argues, the robbery charges should have been severed because evidence pertaining to one robbery led the jury to find him guilty of the other robbery based solely on a perceived disposition of criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In considering whether to grant a motion to sever based on the third potential prejudice, the court must first determine whether the evidence of the multiple alleged offenses could have been admitted in the different trials had the counts been tried separately.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4403706\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/104/865/#p867\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4403706\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/104/865/#p867\">\n    at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4403706\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/104/865/#p867\">\n    664 P.2d at 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Williams' car matched this description. The cars also had similar wheels and Williams' car had a marking that indicated there was a green sticker on the trunk, in the same location as the sticker on the car identified in the April 2015 robbery. The person in the car was a Caucasian male with closely cropped hair, as was Williams. Williams also had a bump on his hand that matched that of the robber's hand as seen in surveillance in the April 2015 robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The search warrant also yielded two long-sleeved shirts with color-coordinated handkerchiefs with a custom sewn elastic band in the back of the handkerchiefs, as well as the sewing material necessary for such a custom sew job. A similar gun displayed in the July robbery was found, as well as thousands of dollars in hundred dollar bills, some of which were sequential. Several pairs of mirrored aviator glasses were also found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Taken by itself, this evidence may not be distinctive or common; however, when the similarities are considered in their totality, it goes beyond mere coincidence. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining there was sufficient evidence to show a common scheme or plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The district court determined as well, that this same evidence supported a determination that evidence of one robbery was admissible under Idaho Rules of Evidence 404(b). Rule 404(b)\"precludes evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts ... to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.\" However, evidence is not precluded by I.R.E. 404(b) to \"prove motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Other crime evidence may be admitted if the evidence of the other crimes is so distinctive that it can be seen as a \"signature\" identifying a unique defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074853\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/148/664/#p668\">\n    148 Idaho at 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074853\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/148/664/#p668\">\n    227 P.3d at 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the question for the court then is whether the events are linked by common characteristics that go beyond merely showing a criminal propensity but instead objectively tend to establish that the same person committed all the acts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074853\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/idaho/148/664/#p668\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Markedly, the district court found the fact that each robbery was at a branch of the same bank, the comparable timing of the robberies, the identical demands for money, the similarities of the disguises used, the physical appearances of the men, and the matching markings on the hands all supported admitting the evidence to prove identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, evidence obtained by police supported the district court's determination that the evidence would be admissible in separate trials to prove identity. This included evidence obtained by execution of warrants that the car used in the April 2015 robbery was registered in Williams' name prior to the April 2015 robbery; that the left hands of the robber in April 2015 and Williams had similar bumps; that police found \"two other sets of color matching long-sleeved shirt and handkerchief\" in Williams' possession; that the handkerchiefs had an \"elastic band custom sewn into the back\"; that Williams had sewing materials consistent with having sewn in the elastic mask holders; that Williams had a handgun \"consistent with the one that was ... displayed in the July bank robbery\"; that police found \"approximately $7,000\" in hundred dollar bills, some of which had sequential\n   serial numbers; and that Williams had \"several pairs of mirrored aviator sunglasses matching the description [of glasses] used in both robberies.\" Again, while any one of the common facts might be coincidental or common to the crime of bank robbery, taken together the facts make a compelling case that the same person committed each robbery. Moreover, the majority of the evidence found upon execution of the search warrants was relevant to both of the robberies. Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that the evidence was admissible to prove identity. Because evidence of one robbery was admissible at trial for the other robbery, there would be little prejudicial effect. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Williams' motion to sever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Williams next argues the prosecution committed misconduct amounting to fundamental error based on four aspects of the State's closing argument. The first is the prosecutor's statement regarding the defense's version, in opening and closing argument, that officers attempted to \"pin\" the robberies on Williams. Williams argues the prosecutor impermissibly disparaged defense counsel by labeling these opening and closing remarks as ludicrous allegations. Second, Williams contends the prosecution improperly interjected his personal beliefs by informing the jury he was personally offended by defense counsel's actions, as well as being offended on behalf of law enforcement for the same. Third, Williams argues the prosecutor impermissibly vouched for the police officer's credibility. Finally, Williams contends the prosecutor's statements that this was an example of \"good work,\" \"a fine job,\" and \"good police work,\" which allowed them to solve the case, impermissibly vouched for the police and placed the State's prestige behind them.

Applying these standards we consider each statement to determine if misconduct occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the opening statement and closing argument the defense alluded to, and then stated, that the police were \"pinning\" the robberies on Williams and that the gun, ammunition, and magazine found in Williams' hotel room and car were not owned by Williams. Although the prosecution properly responded that the defense theory of the planted firearm and officer's attempt to \"pin\" a crime on an innocent man was unsupported by the evidence; stating that defense counsel's opening and closing remarks were ludicrous allegations, in isolation, was an improper statement. However, simply being an improper statement does not render a prosecutor's statement misconduct. Here, the prosecutor's statement that the defense's theory was ludicrous, though improper, highlighted that it was not a credible argument based on the evidence presented during trial; particularly that police did not know of Williams until they found him at the hotel with a car that matched the car used in one of the robberies and that various instrumentalities of the robberies were found in Williams' possession. Thus, this statement did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, Williams argues the prosecutor improperly interjected his personal beliefs by informing the jury he was personally offended by defense counsel's actions, as well as being offended on behalf of law enforcement for the same. While the prosecutor should have refrained from stating his personal beliefs and opinions regarding Williams' defense, the statements were based on inferences derived from evidence and testimony presented at trial. As noted above, there was adequate evidence found in Williams' possession to connect him to the robberies. Though potentially improper, the comment did not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Williams next argues the prosecution's statement impermissively vouched for the police officer's credibility. To rebut the defense's closing argument indicating that officers were trying to \"pin\" the robberies on Williams, the prosecutor stated: \"What happened is exactly what they testified to. These things were legitimately found in the defendant's possession.\" This statement is based on inferences from testimony and evidence presented at trial. Moreover, it is specifically based on the officer's testimony. The evidence and testimony showed that not only was a matching gun found in Williams' possession, but a car matching the one used in one of the robberies was located at the hotel where Williams resided. The car had matching tires and showed that a sticker had been\n   removed, matching the car from the April 2015 robbery. The car was registered to Williams and had been since prior to the April 2015 robbery. Consistent clothing, aviator glasses, and handkerchief face masks were found in Williams' possession. Accordingly, the statement did not amount to misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Williams challenges the prosecutor's statements that this was an example of \"good police work\" and \"a fine job.\" The State argues that it was proper for the State to rebut the defense's argument that the case was about bad police work, involving planting evidence and \"pinning\" a crime on an innocent man. Prior to making this statement, the State referenced the implications defense counsel alluded to during opening and closing arguments regarding potential misconduct by police. Viewed in context, this statement did not constitute misconduct. Therefore, we conclude, given the context of the prosecutor's statements, no misconduct occurred during the State's closing argument, much less any constitutional violation amounting to fundamental error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Right to Hybrid Representation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Next, Williams argues that Article I, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution required the court to provide \"hybrid representation\" upon request, in which counsel would perform voir dire and Williams would conduct the remainder of trial pro se. Williams claims that the district court's denial of his motion for what Williams terms \"hybrid representation,\" or co-counsel, constituted a violation of his state constitutional right to counsel. In support of Williams' assertion of entitlement to \"hybrid\" representation, Williams analogizes the Idaho Constitution to the Kentucky Constitution and invites us to follow the case law interpreting it. The State argues that Williams failed to assert this claim below and, therefore, did not preserve it for appellate consideration. Alternatively, the State argues that the right to counsel does not encompass a compulsory right to \"hybrid\" representation, but instead the decision to appoint counsel when the defendant elects to represent himself lies within the trial court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Article I, Section 13, of the Idaho Constitution provides: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the party accused shall have the right to ... appear and defend in person and with counsel.\" We have not addressed whether this provision mandates appointment of \"hybrid\" representation or whether the decision is discretionary. However, we have addressed an analogous issue-the right to appointment of counsel for a pro se litigant, or standby counsel, applying the Sixth Amendment. Since Williams has not provided any argument as to why our state constitution should be interpreted differently than the Sixth Amendment with respect to representation, we will rely upon judicial interpretation of the Sixth Amendment in rendering our decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The morning of trial, the district court held a hearing regarding whether restraints were still necessary and what restraints were appropriate. The sergeant testified that Williams potentially posed a flight risk based on a conversation prior to the suppression hearing wherein Williams asked the sergeant whether the sergeant and other officers would shoot Williams if he tried to escape. Based on the evidence presented, the trial court ruled the\n   security risks that Williams posed did not vanish when Williams invoked his right to self-representation and that the same precautions were necessary. The district court, however, determined Williams would wear a leg tether that was secured to the ground instead of the \"black box shackles.\" Additionally, the chain would be wrapped in bicycle tubing so that no noise would be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on the record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that restraints were necessary. Williams posed a legitimate security risk. The district court made every attempt to preserve Williams' right to self-represent within the limits of public safety. Further, the court made all effort to avoid prejudice by concealing the visibility of the restraints from the jury's view as best as possible. While the tether would not allow Williams to walk as freely as he would have liked, it did not entirely limit Williams' movement. Williams would still have freedom of arms and body; the only restraint would be that Williams would be unable to move away from the desk. Even so, Williams could ask questions from his table and could face the jury when addressing them. Additionally, while the jury potentially may not have been able to see Williams' hand during opening remarks, as he would have liked, because he would be unable to move from his table, Williams would be capable of showing the jury his hand during the presentation of evidence. Accordingly, the restraints did not violate Williams' right to self-represent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Motions to Suppress\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, Williams argues the district court erred by denying both motions to suppress evidence because the evidence was obtained through illegal means. First, Williams argues he was arrested without a warrant and without probable cause. Second, Williams argues the warrant to search his hotel room was issued on stale evidence lacking any nexus between the crime evidence sought and the location to be searched.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that Williams was not arrested, but only detained, and therefore neither probable cause nor a warrant was required.

In determining that there was reasonable suspicion to detain Williams to investigate possible criminal activity, the district court relied on the testimony from the investigating officer of the April 2015 and July 2015 robberies. The district court made specific findings of fact regarding the similarities between the robberies that surmounted to reasonable suspicion that Williams may have been involved. These findings are supported by substantial evidence, and we will not disturb them on appeal. These findings include: (1) the robberies were all at branches of the same bank in Boise; (2) the robberies all occurred within thirty minutes of the banks' opening; (3) the suspect in each was described as a Caucasian male between 5 foot 8 inches and 6 foot in height wearing a baseball hat and mirrored aviator sunglasses; (4) the suspect in both wore a color-coded windbreaker and a bandana-type mask; (5) the suspect in both made the same demand for money; (6) the suspect in both quickly and easily located the tracker bills and disposed of them. Further, the discovery of certain evidence tied the robberies together, including (1) a similar vehicle as that captured on video from the April 2015 robbery was located in the hotel parking lot and registered to Williams; (2) the wheels and license plate of the vehicle also matched video footage of the April 2015 robbery; and (3) Williams approximately matched photos and eyewitness descriptions of both robbers. Objectively viewed, the officers had information sufficient to qualify as specific articulable facts justifying suspicion that Williams was the suspect involved in the robberies. The above commonalities justified the investigating officer in stopping Williams temporarily to investigate whether he had been involved in the robberies-specifically to determine whether Williams had a bump on his left hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Next, we consider whether Williams' detention was reasonable. The determination of whether an investigative detention is reasonable requires a dual inquiry-whether the officer's action was justified at its inception and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, the relevant information gathered the day of the application of the warrant cured any staleness relating to the information pertaining to the 2012 robbery. As noted above, the perpetrators of the most recent robberies, April 2015 and July 2015, had many commonalities. Further, on August 8, Williams registered at the hotel. At the time the search warrant was issued, Williams had been staying at the hotel for twelve days. Parked outside that hotel was a car matching the description of the vehicle involved in the April 2015 robbery. The green adhesive on the trunk of the car in the hotel parking lot was located in the same location as the green sticker on the car in the surveillance video of the April 2015 robbery. The car was registered in Williams' name. Williams' was an out-of-state resident. Several bags were inside the hotel room. Finally, Williams' had physical attributes that matched eyewitness descriptions of the bank robbers. Taken collectively, the district court did not err in ruling the information was not stale considering the continuing nature of the three bank robberies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Probable cause to search also requires a nexus between criminal activity and the item to be seized and a nexus between the item to be seized and the place to be searched.

First, there were sufficient facts to give rise to a reasonable inference that Williams was the sole occupant of the hotel room. According to hotel records, Williams had been staying at the hotel since August 8, 2015. Further, hotel staff informed officers that the person who registered the car at the hotel and registered for the room gave the name Kent Glen Williams. There is no indication that staff or officers observed any other guests coming or going from the room on a regular basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Moreover, the affidavit provided sufficient factual links between the robberies and the hotel room. The robberies all occurred in different branches of the same bank, within the first half hour of the bank's opening. In both 2015 robberies, the man was described as a Caucasian male, between 5 foot 8 inches and 6 foot. The man wore a \"color-coordinated\" long-sleeved jacket and handkerchief masks in both robberies. The man in each robbery wore mirrored aviator sunglasses. The man in both robberies used a \"binding system\" to hold up the handkerchief over his mouth and nose. The man in each robbery demanded that the cash be taken from two teller drawers that were hidden from regular customers. In both robberies, the man specifically asked for the money to be in denominations of twenty, fifty, and one hundred dollar bills. The man in both instructed the tellers to omit any dye, bait, or trackers. In both,\n   the man quickly and easily identified the electronic tracker hidden inside the bills. A car matching the description of the one used in the April 2015 robbery was located at a parking lot of a hotel. The car was registered in Williams' name and had been prior to the April robbery. Williams had been staying at the hotel for approximately two weeks. Further, backpack-style bags were visible inside the hotel room. Williams matched the description of the man in both robberies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The affidavit also stated the officer believed all three robberies were committed by the same person because of the similarities in (1) the suspect's description; (2) the suspect's clothing; and (3) the timing of the robberies. Further, the vehicle parked at the hotel was consistent with the vehicle described in the bulletin. Moreover, the vehicle from the April 2015 robbery and the vehicle, registered in Williams' name and parked at the hotel where Williams was registered shared similarities including (1) the make and model; (2) the wheels; (3) the license plate color; and (4) the location of the sticker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Moreover, the investigating officer included photographs in his affidavit to support the basis for his belief that the same individual committed the three robberies. Additionally, the investigating officer knew that Williams had been staying at the hotel since August 8, 2015, and that items remained in that room. Though unable to see any item directly linking the contents of the hotel room with the crimes, the investigating officer could also see two backpack-style bags inside the room which appeared to contain property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The record reflects there was probable cause to believe Williams would still have cash, articles of clothing, or the gun used in the robberies. Additionally, there was probable cause that evidence of the robberies would be located in the place which Williams had been staying in for the previous twelve days-his hotel room. Further, there was no reason to believe that Williams had disposed of all incriminating evidence in the days since the last robbery or that he stored it elsewhere such that there was no longer a valid belief it could be in his hotel room. Accordingly, the evidence supporting the warrant was neither stale nor lacked a nexus. Therefore, the district court did not err in determining there was probable cause to issue a warrant to search Williams' hotel room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Considering each issue independently, we conclude the district court did not err in denying Williams' motion to sever and motions to suppress. Further, the prosecutor did not commit misconduct in his closing argument amounting to fundamental error. Additionally, Williams' state constitutional right to counsel and statutory right to be free from excessive restraints were not violated nor were his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment United States constitutional rights to a fair trial, to counsel, and to self-representation.
