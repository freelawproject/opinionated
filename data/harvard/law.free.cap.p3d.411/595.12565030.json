INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A jury found a criminal defendant guilty of escaping from a halfway house, and the court of appeals affirmed his conviction. We granted a petition for hearing on the issue of whether the conviction should be overturned because of the invalidity of the grand jury's indictment. The defendant argues that the indictment was based on inadmissible hearsay evidence-an incident report prepared by a staff member at the halfway house, relaying another resident's description of the defendant's conduct and introduced to the grand jury through the testimony of an uninvolved supervisor. The State counters that the incident report falls under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, and that even if it is inadmissible hearsay the conviction should not be reversed because any error in the grand jury proceeding was later made harmless by the error-free trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We hold that the incident report does not fall under the business records exception to the hearsay rule and should have been excluded. Because the evidence was otherwise insufficient to support the grand jury's decision to indict, the indictment was invalid and the conviction must be reversed. We decline the State's invitation to overrule our precedent requiring this result. We therefore reverse the court of appeals' decision affirming the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early 2010 Alvin Wassillie was serving out the remainder of a felony sentence at the Parkview Center halfway house in Anchorage. On February 19 he left Parkview on a pass to look for a job. Around the time of his return that afternoon a staff member saw someone toss a white bag through an open window into an upstairs room. Other staff members searched the room and found a white bag with a bottle of vodka in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Parkview's security manager, Joshua Henry, reviewed footage from security cameras and identified Wassillie as the person who threw the bag (and presumably the vodka) into the building. Bringing alcohol into the facility is a violation of its rules, so Henry told Wassillie to wait in the lobby while he prepared a report and contacted the Department of Corrections (DOC) to take Wassillie back to jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After waiting several hours in the lobby, Wassillie walked out of the facility. Another inmate, Jason Lavin, reported Wassillie's departure to a staff member, and the staff confirmed from security videos and two headcounts that Wassillie had left without signing out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Staff member Eric Dulany filled out the \"Incident Report\" form that is central to this case. The report related Lavin's statement that Wassillie had walked out of the facility and briefly described the staff's commencement of Parkview's escape procedures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Parkview staff also completed an absence report, in which they initialed and time-stamped a series of actions taken as part of the standard escape procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Police found Wassillie a few miles away several hours after he left and took him into custody. He was taken to jail and later charged with second-degree escape.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A grand jury considered the charges in March 2010 and heard from two witnesses,\n   neither of whom had first-hand knowledge of Wassillie's conduct. A probation officer testified that Wassillie had been serving a felony sentence while at Parkview. Parkview's director, Robert Graber, testified that when an inmate goes missing Parkview staff complete \"a discharge summary report and a[n] escape report and an incident report which tells about the escape ... within two hours of the ... notice that a resident is missing.\" He testified that copies of the reports are sent to the Department of Corrections and that the originals are placed in the inmate's Parkview file, which is kept for five years. Graber testified that Parkview \"regularly keep[s] and maintain[s] these [forms].\" With this foundation, the State presented to the grand jury the \"resident discharge summary, incident reports, intake packet paperwork, [and an] escape report.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Graber testified about Wassillie's escape from the facility based on the information he had obtained from the reports. After considering this evidence the grand jury indicted Wassillie for second-degree escape, a felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Wassillie was tried in December 2010, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict, and the superior court declared a mistrial. A month later Wassillie moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing in part that the prosecutor had improperly relied on inadmissible hearsay at the grand jury proceeding. The court denied the motion without comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wassillie was tried again in April and May 2011. The jury heard testimony from Dulany, the Parkview employee who had prepared the incident report, and several other staff members with first-hand knowledge of Wassillie's departure from the facility. The second jury returned a guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Wassillie appealed. He argued to the court of appeals that it was error to deny his motion to dismiss the indictment because the indictment was based on Dulany's incident report, which was inadmissible hearsay. The court of appeals held, however, that the report \"was presumptively admissible under the business records hearsay exception\" and affirmed Wassillie's conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Wassillie petitioned for hearing. We granted his petition so we could consider two questions: first, whether the incident report was admissible as a business record under Alaska Evidence Rule 803(6) ; and second, if it was not, whether the presentation of the incident report to the grand jury was necessarily harmless because of Wassillie's subsequent conviction following an error-free trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"When the admissibility of evidence 'turns on a question of law, such as the \"correct scope or interpretation of a rule of evidence,\" we apply our \"independent judgment.\" ' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We apply the same standard of review to \"constitutional issues of law,\" such as the scope of a party's right to indictment by grand jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In exercising our independent judgment on such issues \"we will adopt 'a reasonable and practical interpretation in accordance with common sense based upon \"the plain meaning and purpose of the provision and the intent of the framers.\" ' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in determining the appropriate remedy for an error in a grand jury proceeding, we will \"adopt the rule of law that is most persuasive in light of precedent, reason, and policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Wassillie first challenges the evidence on which the grand jury decided to indict him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Of the evidence presented to the grand jury, only the incident report describes Wassillie's departure from Parkview and contains enough information, if admissible, to apprise the jury of the facts of his alleged offense; our discussion therefore focuses on this one-page document.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wassillie argues that the incident report was inadmissible hearsay; that without it the evidence was insufficient to support an indictment; and that because the indictment was invalid his conviction must be reversed under the rule we applied in\n   <em>\n    Adams v. State\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The State disagrees. It argues that the incident report was admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   it also argues that even if the incident report contained inadmissible hearsay, we should not reverse Wassillie's conviction because any error in the grand jury proceeding was made harmless by his subsequent conviction by a petit jury in an error-free trial. To reach this result the State asks that we overrule contrary holdings in both\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taggard v. State\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We conclude that the incident report was not admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Because without the report the evidence before the grand jury was insufficient to support an indictment, we go on to consider whether this error was rendered harmless by Wassillie's later conviction in an error-free trial. We decide that the error was not rendered harmless; our precedent, which we decline to overrule, requires that the conviction be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Incident Report Was Not Admissible Under The Business Records Exception To The Hearsay Rule.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a general rule hearsay statements are inadmissible at trial unless they fall under an enumerated exception or exclusion;\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the same general rule applies to grand jury proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The only hearsay exception the State argues applies here-the business records exception\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   -requires that a record satisfy five requirements in order to be admitted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   first, the record must be of a \"regularly conducted business activity\"; second, the record must \"be regularly kept\"; third, the source of information \"must be a person who has personal knowledge\"; fourth, the information must have been \"recorded contemporaneously with the event or occurrence\"; and fifth, \"foundation testimony by the custodian of the record\" must be provided.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Wassillie contends that the Parkview incident report lacked the trustworthiness of reports prepared as part of a \"regularly conducted business activity.\" He argues that \"[r]eports of this character are not routine, ministerial, objective, or created in a nonadversarial setting.\" He also argues that the incident report was prepared in anticipation of litigation, further undermining its trustworthiness. For the reasons that follow, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The principles behind the business records exception\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The tradition of excepting business records from the hearsay rule derives from the \"unusual reliability of business records ... supplied by systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Traditionally, business records are \"routine reflections of the day to day operations of a business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   It follows that routinely prepared records such as \"payrolls, accounts receivable, accounts payable, bills of lading,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   inventory property listings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   medical records,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and social security records\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   are ordinarily admissible under the business records exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Whether a report has been prepared in the regular course of business is measured by whether the circumstances of its preparation give the report \"the reliability business records are ordinarily assumed to have.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   A court considering the record's admissibility may take into account \"such factors as ... the purpose for which the record was prepared,\" \"any possible motive to falsify including whether the record's use in prospective litigation was a motive for its preparation,\" \"how routine or non-routine the record is,\" and \"how much reliance the business places on the record for business purposes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To apply these principles to the facts of this case, we are helped by the landmark case of\n   <em>\n    Palmer v. Hoffman\n   </em>\n   , in which the United States Supreme Court considered whether an accident report prepared by a railroad engineer was a business record under the analogous federal rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Concluding that it was not, the Court held that \"the fact that a company makes a business out of recording its employees' versions of their accidents does not put those statements in the class of records made 'in the regular course' of the business within the meaning of\" the business record exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" '[R]egular course' of business must find its meaning in the inherent nature of the business in question and in the methods systematically employed for the conduct of the business as a business.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   the accident report's \"primary utility [wa]s in litigating, not in railroading\"; accordingly, that kind of report, even if regularly prepared, lacked \"the character of [business] records and their earmarks of reliability acquired from their source and origin and the nature of their compilation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Factors affecting the reliability of certain kinds of reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A number of federal and state courts have held that investigative reports such as\n   police reports\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   and correctional facility incident reports\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   are inadmissible because of reliability concerns. The Alaska\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   records exception\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   to the hearsay rule similarly exempts all \"investigative reports by police and law enforcement personnel\" from the exception \"because they are often unreliable\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   it also states that \"investigative reports prepared by or for a government, a public office or an agency when offered by it in a case in which it is a party\" do not fall within the public records exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   But investigative reports from state agencies that are not admissible under the\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   records exception may be admissible under the\n   <em>\n    business\n   </em>\n   records exception when the agency \"has no motive to attempt to affect the outcome in a particular case\" and the report meets the other elements of the business records exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is because a reporter with \"no knowledge of a specific case\" is presumed to have \"no incentive to misrepresent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   For instance, a breathalyzer certification by a state official at the Department of Health and Social Services who has \"no knowledge of a specific case\" is reliable enough to be admissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   And \"routine and unambiguous\" records-such as arrestees'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   fingerprints and photographs-usually allow the reporter \"[n]either motive [n]or opportunity to fabricate or falsify\" them, thereby justifying their admissibility under a hearsay exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast, investigative reports prepared by a participant or observer to the incident being investigated raise concerns about the reporter's \"motivations to misrepresent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   A reporter involved in the incident may wish to hide evidence of her own mistakes or misconduct or inflate evidence more likely to lead to her desired outcome. Such reports may take on an \"adversarial nature,\" in which the reporter targets an individual and accuses him of misconduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   This kind of report thus has an elevated risk of unreliability; it is possible that the reporter's biases about the accused have compromised the report's accuracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   These reliability concerns are particularly acute when reports have been prepared in anticipation of litigation in a particular case, as \"many of the normal checks upon the accuracy of business records are not operative\" in such circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Accordingly, \"an ordinary police accident report\" is not admissible because the officer's report may be \"colored\" by circumstances surrounding the investigation, including \"opinions gathered from second-hand sources who have a stake in pending litigation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   And documents reporting on a prisoner's escape-at least according to a Texas appellate court-are inadmissible for similar reasons: \"The objectionable statements contained in these documents were not merely made as a result of ministerial objective observations, but rather, had the features of statements made in an adversarial setting, since they resulted from the criminal investigation of the escape.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The incident report presented to the grand jury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Parkview incident report presented to the grand jury in this case lacks many of the hallmarks that make other business records so \"unusual[ly] reliab[le]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   as to warrant admissibility under an exception to the hearsay rule. The report was prepared by someone who knew Wassillie and who therefore could have been, consciously or unconsciously, swayed by pre-existing opinions of him. And the reporter, Dulany, a\n   Parkview staff member, was an active participant in an investigation that resulted in a determination that Wassillie had violated Parkview's rules on alcohol and then committed a criminal escape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The report also may have been \"colored\" by \"opinions gathered from [a] second-hand source[ ] who ha[d] a stake in pending litigation\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   -inmate Lavin, who first reported Wassillie's escape to Dulany. According to the report, Dulany \"approached [Lavin] about him wanting to fight someone\"; Lavin told Dulany that Wassillie was the one who threw the vodka through the window \"in an attempt to get [Lavin] in trouble\" and that Wassillie had \"just left through the front door.\" When Lavin described these events to Dulany, Lavin was not \"under a duty of accuracy\" or \"acting routinely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   He may have had a motive to be untruthful in some or all of his statement, as he had been accused of scheming with Wassillie to bring alcohol into Parkview; he may also have had a motive to deflect attention away from himself, as the reason Dulany approached him was apparently Lavin's announced desire \"to fight someone.\" Reliance on a source who is not under a \"duty of accuracy\" takes a business record outside the scope of the business records exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is also relevant to our analysis that the incident report accuses Wassillie of escape-a violation of 22 Alaska Administrative Code (AAC) 05.400(b)(3) and a felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dulany evidently expected the conduct he reported to have punitive consequences. The form on which the incident report appears provides two boxes that allow the reporter to designate the \"Course of Action\" to be taken on the basis of the report, \"Disciplinary\" and \"Information\"; Dulany checked \"Disciplinary.\" And not only are incident reports \"a basis for returning [a furloughed inmate like Wassillie] to custody,\" as the probation officer testified at trial, they also must be sent to the DOC's assistant superintendent and to the district attorney for possible criminal prosecution, as happened here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Overall, the incident report in its lack of assured neutrality resembles police reports, which are not admissible under any exceptions to the hearsay rule. The information contained in the report could foreseeably be used against a particular individual in a particular criminal case, and the report could be influenced by the reporter's incentives to misrepresent, including a \"motive to attempt to affect the outcome in a particular case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the incident report cannot be accorded the presumption of accuracy that Evidence Rule 803(6) recognizes in business records, and we therefore reverse the court of appeals' holding that the report was admissible under the business records exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Error In The Grand Jury Proceeding Requires Reversal.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the incident report was inadmissible, and because it was the grand jury's only source for the facts essential to the escape charge, we next need to consider the effect this error in the grand jury proceedings has on the validity of Wassillie's subsequent conviction. The State urges us to hold that if there was an error, \"the later error-free trial rendered the earlier error harmless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Grand jury indictment is a critical part of Alaska's constitutional framework.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We begin by emphasizing the grand jury's importance as a preliminary step in felony prosecutions. The Alaska Constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   We have repeatedly recognized the importance of this right, emphasizing that \"an accused is entitled, under Alaska law, to a decision\n   <em>\n    by a grand jury\n   </em>\n   that there is probable cause to hold him for trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Alaska's retention of the criminal grand jury followed spirited debate on the subject at the Constitutional Convention. The Committee on the Preamble and the Bill of Rights introduced a proposal that would allow prosecutors to proceed in any case by either indictment or information; it read, in pertinent part, \"No person shall be prosecuted criminally for [a] felony other than by indictment or information, which shall be concurrent remedies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Delegate Dorothy Awes, the committee's chair, described the \"unanimous feeling of the Committee that the grand jury should be preserved for [the] purpose [of returning indictments],\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   but her explanation cast the grand jury in a secondary role behind the more common practice of charging by information: \"By retaining the grand jury and the indictment, if you should have a district attorney, say, who is bringing in too many informations and acting in a pre-emptory matter [sic], then the governor has the right to call the grand jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The next day Delegate Edward Davis introduced an amendment reflecting what he understood to be prevailing Territorial practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amendment eliminated the concept of \"concurrent remedies\" and required indictment by a grand jury in all felony cases unless the defendant waived it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Delegate Davis explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   In my practice it appears to me that the grand jury serves a useful purpose.

Certainly under those circumstances it can't be said that the grand jury serves no useful purpose. It serves a distinctly useful purpose, and not[,] as Mr. Hellenthal said, only to persons evilly disposed.

But the potential for \"perceived injustice\" cannot outweigh the need for actual procedural justice in the individual case. The Alaska criminal justice system includes a constitutional right to indictment by grand jury, and Alaska's legislature and courts take that right seriously enough to impose standards on the evidence the grand jury may consider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   held that protecting the legitimacy and integrity of the grand jury was a critical concern; it concluded that reversal was required because to hold otherwise would render the right to indictment by a grand jury \"a nullity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   This reasoning was not originally erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State also argues that\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   -in emphasizing the grand jury's function \"as a check upon the district attorney's power to initiate prosecution\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   -erroneously \"assume[d] that prosecutors will intentionally disregard Criminal Rule 6(r) and that trial courts will look the other way when they do.\" But \"overzealous prosecutors,\" though perhaps a rarity, were a repeated concern of the constitutional framers, and that concern shaped our constitutional right to a grand jury indictment. And the fact that prosecutors adhere to the rules of evidence and criminal procedure in most\n   cases does not obviate the need for a remedy in the unusual case. Though errors may be rare they do occur, and they do occasionally slip past trial courts; in\n   <em>\n    Adams, Taggard\n   </em>\n   , and this case, a trial court failed to dismiss an invalid indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the infrequency with which a grand jury error requires a post-conviction remedy does not negate the need for a remedy. The remedy should match the severity of the violation-it should realistically account for the fact that the indictment was invalid. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he indictment is the foundation underlying a criminal prosecution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   Only by reversing a conviction based on an invalid indictment can we safeguard the grand jury's role as a check on overzealous prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The State also suggests that in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   we mischaracterized the nature of the defect in an indictment based on inadmissible hearsay evidence. The State asks us to draw a line between jurisdictional defects in indictments (such as the failure to allege an essential element of the offense)-which the State concedes warrant reversal-and nonjurisdictional defects (such as the hearsay rule violation at issue here)-which the State argues are rendered harmless by an error-free trial. The errors in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   , according to the State, were not jurisdictional and thus, as here, did not merit reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   But we are unpersuaded that we should draw the line, as the State suggests, between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional errors. We draw the line instead between errors that have the effect of invalidating an indictment and those that do not. Indictments may be invalid because of a nonjurisdictional error if the error \"contributed in some way to the return of th[e] indictment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   And an invalid indictment-whether the error that made it invalid was jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional-requires a remedy. None of the State's arguments against reversal as a remedy overcome the concern we expressed in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   that affirming a conviction based on an invalid indictment would render the right to indictment by grand jury a \"nullity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nor do the State's arguments show that we were incorrect in\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   to conclude that dismissal of an indictment subsequent to conviction need not result in injustice; after all, we said, defendants can be reindicted and retried \"on a record not tainted with irregularity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   we acknowledged the \"unfortunate\" consequence \"that, at this stage of the proceedings, after a conviction has been properly obtained on sufficient evidence, the indictment must be dismissed because of the ... failure to present sufficient evidence to the Grand Jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   We held nevertheless that a valid conviction could not be obtained on an invalid indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    133\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, we are not convinced that this original conclusion was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The \"intervening changes\" requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As an alternative to proving that the precedential decisions were erroneous when decided, the State could instead make a \"clear and convincing showing that the decision is no longer sound because conditions have changed\"-for instance, \"if 'related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine, [or] facts have so changed or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    134\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The State contends that in\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   our \"sole rationale for requiring reversal of the conviction after an error-free trial was that other courts have done so,\" and it notes that \"other courts now rarely overturn convictions after an evidentiary error in the indictment.\" However, we do not follow other courts blindly, but rather because we find their opinions persuasive \"in light of precedent, reason, and policy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State \"bears a heavy threshold burden\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   to move us from our earlier considered position. The fact that other courts-applying different evidence rules to grand jury proceedings-have drawn different conclusions about whether evidentiary errors invalidate indictments or warrant reversal of convictions does not convince us that our existing framework is unsound.\n   <footnotemark>\n    137\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The State also argues that the criminal justice system's increased emphasis on victims' rights makes the\n   <em>\n    Adams / Taggard\n   </em>\n   rule outdated. But \"[a] victim's right to a timely disposition of a criminal case is satisfied if the proceedings take place in a timely manner, even if an appellate court later concludes that the proceedings were flawed and must be repeated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    138\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the State does not show that the victim's interest in being spared a new trial outweighs the defendant's constitutional right to a valid indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finally, the State argues that dwindling government resources counsel against using reversal as the remedy for grand jury error. The State suggests that a more efficient and less costly remedy already exists in the form of interlocutory appeals from denials of motions to dismiss, and the dissent endorses that remedy as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    139\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the State does not show us that the\n   <em>\n    Adams / Taggard\n   </em>\n   rule has caused any significant burden over the decades it has been the law of Alaska. Approximately five percent of felony defendants are convicted after trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    140\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the percentage of those who raise timely, colorable objections to error in the grand jury proceedings is surely smaller still. Once identified, the grand jury error results in dismissal of a conviction only if the superior court failed to recognize the error when it was raised, the case went to trial, and the defendant was convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    141\n   </footnotemark>\n   It seems that very few cases are likely to require retrial because of a grand\n   jury error. The cost of this rare consequence, even in light of the State's newly dire finances, is not a \"changed condition\" that compels us to reconsider our long-standing precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Because we are not \"clearly convinced\" of the first element required for overruling the\n   <em>\n    Adams / Taggard\n   </em>\n   rule-that the rule \"was originally erroneous or is no longer sound because of changed conditions\"-we decline to overrule it. We therefore need not reach the second element, whether \"more good than harm would result from a departure from precedent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    142\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We REVERSE the court of appeals' decision that the incident report was admissible under the business records exception. Because the indictment of Wassillie was invalid, we REVERSE his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   BOLGER, Justice, with whom STOWERS, Chief Justice, joins, dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   BOLGER, Justice, with whom STOWERS, Chief Justice, joins, dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I agree with the court's conclusion about the grand jury error in this case. The incident report was probably not admissible as a business record. So the grand jury presentation was based on hearsay presented without compelling justification in violation of Alaska Criminal Rule 6(r).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   But I disagree with the court's conclusion that Wassillie's conviction must be reversed. The prosecution presented the same basic evidence at trial through the live testimony of the Parkview staff members. The trial jury then determined that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Wassillie had committed the crime of second-degree escape. This factual determination \"necessarily means that there [was] probable cause to believe\" that Wassillie had committed that crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, if the same evidence had been submitted to the grand jury, then the grand jury would have been required to return the same indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The court's opinion on this issue is inconsistent with the way we have treated other issues involving preliminary proceedings. Recently we addressed a case where the superior court ruled that even though the police had violated the defendant's\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, the prosecution could use the police interview if the defendant took the stand at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the defendant chose not to testify at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We declined to review his claim that the superior court's ruling was incorrect, in part because he could not establish that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   error had affected the trial court proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    McConnell v. State\n   </em>\n   , we stated that \"[i]t is well-established that an illegal arrest or detention does not bar the state from prosecuting criminal conduct or void a subsequent conviction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Likewise, in a civil case, we generally decline to review on appeal an order that denies a defendant's motion for summary judgment on factual grounds, even when the defendant argues that there were no genuine factual issues for trial. The reason is that appellate review of such orders \"serves no purpose after a case is tried and a trial record has been developed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And in a close analogy, we\n   have recognized that errors in a probable cause hearing are generally cured by an error-free trial on a petition to adjudicate a child in need of aid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   I believe that we should follow the logic of these cases and hold that an evidentiary error at the grand jury presentation can be cured if the defendant is convicted after an error-free trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In declining this rule, the court's opinion relies on our prior opinions in\n   <em>\n    Taggard v. State\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Adams v. State\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But I believe that both these decisions were incorrect at the time they were decided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   , we held that hearsay evidence presented to the grand jury lacked sufficient reliability to support the indictment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We decided to reverse the defendant's conviction based on the recognition that other courts had done so when a defect in the indictment is substantial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the cases this court relied on for this proposition did not involve any defect in the\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   presented to the grand jury. The cases that the\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   court relied on were based on fundamental defects in the\n   <em>\n    text\n   </em>\n   of the indictment or information-these charges failed to allege an essential element of the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   This type of defect implicates the defendant's right to notice of the charge, a right that undoubtedly has an impact on the trial proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   court mistakenly relied on these cases involving a pleading error to reverse an evidentiary error that easily could be corrected at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that if an error-free trial \"could validate an otherwise invalid indictment, the right to indictment by a grand jury would become a nullity and the grand jury would cease to operate as a check upon the district attorney's power to initiate prosecution.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this conclusion ignored the defendant's right to file a pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment based on the grand jury presentation, and the trial court's obligation to grant such a motion if the indictment is not properly supported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the trial court improperly denies such a motion, then the defendant is entitled to petition for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Though interlocutory review is 'not a matter of right,' such review is particularly appropriate in a case such as this, involving constitutional issues that would otherwise evade review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   These pretrial remedies establish that the\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   court erred when it concluded that post-trial review was necessary to protect the right to a grand jury indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, the circumstances have changed since we decided\n   <em>\n    Taggard\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mechanik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   the United States Supreme Court addressed a similar issue. In that case two law enforcement agents were sworn together and questioned before the grand jury in tandem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   This procedure violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(d), which generally allows only specified persons to be present, including \"the witness under examination.\" But the Court concluded that the guilty verdict returned at trial rendered this grand jury error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court recognized that there was no way to restore a defendant to the position he would have been in if the indictment had been dismissed before the trial: \"He will already have suffered whatever inconvenience, expense, and opprobrium that a proper indictment may have spared him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Court recognized that \"reversal of a conviction entails substantial social costs: it forces jurors, witnesses, courts, the prosecution, and the defendants to expend further time, energy, and other resources to repeat a trial that has already once taken place; victims may be asked to relive their disturbing experiences.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Balancing these interests, the Court concluded that \"the societal costs of retrial after a jury verdict of guilty are far too substantial to justify setting aside the verdict simply because of an error in the earlier grand jury proceedings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   I believe that the rule adopted in\n   <em>\n    Mechanik\n   </em>\n   is much better than a rule that encourages the defendant to rely on post-trial review. This case is a good example. The error in the grand jury presentation was committed seven years ago, and the order denying Wassillie's motion to dismiss was entered more than six years ago. If Wassillie had an incentive to pursue a petition for review, then the error could have been corrected at that time, and both parties would have avoided the time, expense, and anxiety of an intervening jury trial. If the issue had been decided at that time, then the State would have had a reasonable chance to make a proper presentation to both the grand jury and the trial jury-a chance that is likely foreclosed by the passage of time. And if the State did not seek another indictment, then Wassillie could have avoided the six-year prison sentence that he has now likely completed. Thus both parties would have benefitted from a pretrial determination of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In my opinion, the better rule is to view this type of grand jury error as harmless if the defendant is convicted following an error-free trial. I would affirm the court of appeals on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    We commend both parties' counsel for the excellence of their briefs and arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The entire narrative of the incident report is as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n    Wassillie Alvin was reported missing to myself when I approached Lavan [sic] Jason about him wanting to fight someone at 1930.
