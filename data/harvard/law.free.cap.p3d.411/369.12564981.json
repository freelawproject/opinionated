Stephens Production Company and Stephens Production Company Continental Properties, LLC (SPC) were the owners and operators of the well. Upon arrival at the well, Mr. Chambers worked on or around a device known as a \"heater treater.\" During this work, Mr. Chambers suffered severe burns, which\n   eventually led to his death.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Glory Strickland, Mr. Chambers' surviving daughter and Special Administrator of the Estate, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against SPC and others in the District Court of Oklahoma County,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging negligence for failure to properly operate, maintain, and inspect the well, and failure to properly warn of dangerous conditions at the well site.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 SPC filed a motion to dismiss, claiming immunity under the exclusive remedy doctrine found in \u00a7 5 of the Oklahoma Administrative Workers' Compensation Act (OAWCA), which provides in part that \"any operator or owner of an oil or gas well ... shall be deemed to be an intermediate or principal employer\" for purposes of extending immunity from civil liability. As the owner and operator of the well, SPC argued it was statutorily immune from suit in the district court. Strickland responded to the motion to dismiss and argued that \u00a7 5 was an unconstitutional special law. Strickland also argued that the Legislature's factual determination that all oil and gas well owners and operators are principal or intermediate employers, for purposes of immunity from civil liability, violated the constitutional principle of separation of powers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The district court denied the motion to dismiss and found that \u00a7 5 is an unconstitutional special law prohibited by Art. 5, \u00a7 46 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The court found \"no distinctive characteristics or reasonable basis\" to justify the different treatment afforded by \u00a7 5 to oil and gas well owners and operators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court specifically found, however, that SPC was not precluded from rearguing exclusive remedy protections pending further discovery and submission of additional facts on the issue of whether SPC was actually Mr. Chambers' principal employer at the time of his injuries. The district court certified the order denying the motion to dismiss for immediate interlocutory appeal. SPC filed a Petition for Certiorari to Review the Certified Interlocutory Order. We granted certiorari on February 6, 2017, and briefing was completed on May 19, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 4 At issue in this case is the constitutionality of 85A O.S.

However, under previous versions of the workers' compensation statutes, principal employers, or statutory employers as they were known, were secondarily liable to an injured worker for workers' compensation benefits and immune from tort liability in the district court if a statutory employment relationship existed between the injured worker, his immediate employer, and the principal employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   To determine whether a statutory or vertical employment relationship existed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   this Court applied a three-tiered test which asked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [W]hether the work being performed by the independent contractor is specialized or non-specialized.

If the work normally gets done by independent contractors, then the hirer is not the statutory employer of the independent contractor. If the work is normally performed by employees, the third tier focuses on the moment in time the worker was injured, and asks whether the hirer was engaged in the type of work being performed by the independent contractor\n   <em>\n    at the time the worker was hurt.\n   </em>\n   If not, then the hirer is not the statutory employer of the independent contractor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 6 This test, commonly referred to as the necessary and integral test, was codified in 2011 when the Legislature enacted the\n   Workers' Compensation Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2011, the Legislature also determined, by statutory enactment, that all oil and gas well owners or operators were principal employers for purposes of immunity from civil liability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2014, with the enactment of the OAWCA and the repeal of the Workers' Compensation Code, the Legislature removed the provision found in the 2011 Code that codified the necessary and integral test, but kept the provision from the 2011 Code that determined all oil and gas well owners or operators are intermediate or principal employers for purposes of immunity from civil liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   85A O.S. Supp. 2013 \u00a7 5(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 7 The term \"principal employer\" only appears twice in Title 85A-in \u00a7 5(A), referred to above, wherein oil and gas owners and operators are deemed principal employers, and \u00a7 5(E), which states that immunity does not extend to other employers on the same job site as the injured worker \"if such other employer does not stand in the position of intermediate or principal employer to the immediate employer of the injured or deceased worker.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   85A O.S. Supp. 2013 \u00a7 5(E). Absent those exceptions, the Legislature substituted the term \"prime contractor\" for principal employer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The term \"prime contractor\" appears in \u00a7 5(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   85A O.S.

The term \"prime contractor\" also appears in \u00a7 2(43) in the definition of \"subcontractor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   85A O.S. Supp. 2013 \u00a7 2(43) (\" 'Subcontractor' means a person, firm, corporation or other legal entity hired by the general or\n   <em>\n    prime contractor\n   </em>\n   to perform a specific task for the completion of a work-related activity[.]\") (emphasis added). \"Primary Contractor Liability\" is discussed at length in \u00a7 36, which lays out a vertical liability structure similar to that pertaining to principal employers found in previous laws.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 85A O.S.

Thus, we must assume that when the Legislature enacted Title 85A it was \"familiar with the extant judicial construction [of those terms] then in force.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" 'Unless a contrary intent clearly appears or is plainly expressed, the terms of amendatory acts retaining the same or substantially similar language as the provisions formerly in force will be accorded the identical construction to that placed upon them by preexisting case law.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question then\n   becomes whether the Legislature can statutorily determine that certain employers, namely owners or operators of an oil or gas well, are principal employers for purposes of extending immunity from civil liability regardless of the actual employment relationship between the operator or owner, the immediate employer, and the injured employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 9 Article 5, \u00a7 59 of the Oklahoma Constitution provides that \"[l]aws of a general nature shall have uniform operation throughout the State, and where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   To determine whether a statute is a prohibited special law under Art. 5, \u00a7 59, we ask: (1) Is the statute a special or general law?

Section 5(A) operates uniformly on all employees and employers, but for the last sentence.
