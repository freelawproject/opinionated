Prosecutor's Office, 3000 Rockefeller Ave., Everett, WA, 98201-4046, for Respondent.\n </attorneys>\n <p id=\"p-7\">\n  PUBLISHED OPINION\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Dwyer, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b61 After a stipulated bench trial, Kenneth Butler was found guilty of one count of possession of a controlled substance. He appeals, contending that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence of methamphetamine and heroin discovered in his possession upon his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 To resolve this matter, we must address whether Butler was unlawfully seized when a police officer commanded him to stop leaving the scene near a traffic stop, whether Butler's disregard of the police officer's show of authority terminated the seizure, and whether Butler was unlawfully seized when, soon thereafter, he was approached by a second police officer, accompanied by a tracking dog, who had been looking for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 The state of both the briefing and the decisional law require that we analyze Butler's interaction with the police both as one continuous law enforcement contact with him and as two separate such contacts. We conclude that, under either circumstance, Butler was unlawfully seized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Accordingly, we reverse both the trial court's order denying the suppression motion and the judgment of guilt entered against Butler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Officer David Allen was in his patrol vehicle parked on the side of a two-lane road when he noticed a pickup truck driving erratically toward a roundabout. Officer Allen observed the truck cross over a solid double-yellow line into oncoming traffic and nearly cause several collisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Officer Allen activated the emergency equipment on his marked police vehicle and initiated a traffic stop of the truck. In response, the driver of the truck pulled over to the side of the road. A few car lengths ahead of where the truck parked, a passenger vehicle also pulled over to the side of the road and parked. This vehicle had not been pursued by Officer Allen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Officer Allen spoke with the driver of the truck. The driver stated that he was driving erratically because the passenger vehicle that had parked up ahead had hit his truck and then driven away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Officer Allen began to approach the passenger vehicle and called out to its driver to see if anyone was injured. As Officer Allen approached, he observed that there were two other occupants in the passenger cabin, a man and a woman. When Officer Allen was three car lengths away from the vehicle, the two passengers emerged from the vehicle. The man began to slowly jog in the opposite direction of Officer Allen. The woman followed after the man at a walking pace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Officer Allen commanded the man and woman to stop. They did not comply. The man entered a nearby forested area to his right, while the woman continued walking down the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Officer Allen did not pursue either individual. Instead, he asked the driver of the passenger vehicle why the two may have fled, inquiring as to whether they might have had outstanding warrants for their arrest. The driver of the passenger car speculated, \"[Y]eah, probably.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 In response, Officer Allen announced over his police radio that a man and a woman had \"fled\" the scene of a traffic stop. Officer Allen's broadcast described the man as a Caucasian male wearing a gray jacket with a red stripe. Based on the information obtained from the car's driver, Officer Allen further announced that there were \"probable warrants\" outstanding for the man and the woman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612 Shortly thereafter, while investigating the traffic incident, Officer Allen observed the male passenger walk out of the woods. The man noticed that his movements were being watched by Officer Allen. The man proceeded to walk across the two-lane road, heading away from the scene of the traffic stop. Officer Allen updated his radio broadcast by announcing the direction in which he saw the man walking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b613 Officer Derek Oates, a K-9 officer with a tracking dog in his patrol vehicle, was parked nearby. Officer Oates heard Officer Allen's radio broadcasts regarding a fleeing\n   suspect with a \"probable warrant\" and drove to Officer Allen's location. At the scene of the traffic stop, he spoke with Officer Allen and they agreed that, in lieu of deploying the tracking dog, Officer Oates would drive around looking for the \"suspect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b614 While driving his patrol vehicle in the nearby area, Officer Oates observed a man who matched the description given by Officer Allen standing on the porch of a house, about to knock on an entry door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b615 Officer Oates parked his vehicle in front of the house. He exited his patrol vehicle and yelled out to the man, \"[H]ey, come talk to me, buddy.\" The man complied, leaving the porch and approaching Officer Oates. Officer Oates asked the man for identification, which he provided. The man was Kenneth Butler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b616 Around this time, Officer Christopher Farley and another police officer arrived to assist Officer Oates. They parked their patrol vehicles in front of the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b617 Officer Oates provided Butler's identifying information to police dispatch. The dispatcher advised Officer Oates that Butler had an outstanding arrest warrant. However, because Officer Oates had a police dog in his patrol vehicle's passenger cabin, he could not transport Butler from the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b618 Consequently, Officer Farley arrested Butler on the outstanding warrant. In a search of Butler's clothing following his arrest, Officer Farley discovered a syringe along with substances that were later determined to be methamphetamine and heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b619 Butler was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b620 At a subsequent suppression hearing, Butler moved to exclude all evidence obtained after his arrest, arguing that he had been unlawfully seized during his encounter with the police. The trial court denied Butler's motion. The trial court concluded that Butler was unlawfully seized when Officer Allen commanded him to stop but that the unlawful seizure had ended when Butler left the scene and was no longer in the presence of a law enforcement officer. The trial court further concluded that Officer Oates's interaction with Butler was a second, independent police contact and that Officer Oates's exchange with Butler, prior to the confirmation of the arrest warrant, was a social contact, rather than a seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b621 Butler agreed to a bench trial on stipulated evidence. He was found guilty as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b622 Butler contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence obtained after his arrest because the search of his person following his arrest was the result of an unlawful seizure. The trial court erred, Butler avers, because he was either unlawfully seized by Officer Allen when he was told to stop leaving the scene near the traffic stop (and remained seized thereafter) or was unlawfully seized by Officer Oates when he was commanded to leave the porch and approach Oates's police vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 To resolve these claims, we must determine whether Butler was seized, when he was seized, and whether the seizure was lawful. \"Whether police have seized a person is a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The \"totality of the circumstances\" approach mandated by case law requires that we view the situation in light of the circumstances of Butler's minutes-old encounter with Officer Allen. These circumstances were unquestionably part of the totality of the circumstances on the minds of both Butler and Officer Oates at the time they first became aware of one another's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   \u00b658 Taken in its totality, the circumstances herein would cause a reasonable, innocent person to believe that ignoring the officer's words or leaving the scene of the encounter were not viable options. A reasonable, innocent person in Butler's position would know that he had-only minutes before-acted in lawful disregard of an officer's unlawful command to stop. The appearance of Officer Oates and the tracking dog would not appear to be a mere coincidence to a reasonable,\n   innocent person. Instead, an objective viewer would conclude that the disregard of the first officer's command had led directly to the appearance of the second officer and the tracking dog. The officer's action in stepping from his vehicle and his verbalization of the words, \"[H]ey, come talk to me, buddy,\" would not-objectively viewed-appear to be idle social prattle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b659 To the contrary, under the prevailing circumstances, a reasonable, innocent person would believe that his confrontation with the police was escalating and that standing on his rights again might bear injurious consequences. Indeed, a reasonable, innocent person would be aware that tracking dogs are trained to pursue people who ignore police commands to stop and that such a police dog has the very real capacity to cause such a person physical harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b660 In light of Butler's earlier encounter with law enforcement and the circumstances unfolding before him, a reasonable, innocent person would feel as if he were being pursued in response to ignoring Officer Allen's earlier command to stop. A reasonable, innocent person would recall Officer Allen visibly tracking his movements even after he walked away, would know that police officers have the ability to communicate with one another other via radio, and would conclude that it was no coincidence that he was approached by another officer while he was on the porch of a nearby house, minutes after he had disregarded the first police officer's command.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, at that point, a reasonable, innocent person would deduce that the officer was specifically searching for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b661 At that moment, a reasonable, innocent person would not feel free to leave or to disregard the officer's directive. Accordingly, Butler was, at that time, seized by Officer Oates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b662 The next question is whether Officer Oates's seizure of Butler was lawful. The State contends that Officer Oates had a lawful basis on which to detain Butler because, pursuant to the fellow officer rule, Officer Oates could benefit from information obtained by Officer Allen to justify the later investigative detention of Butler. The State is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b663 The fellow officer rule\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \"provides that an arresting officer who does not personally possess sufficient information to constitute probable cause may still make a warrantless arrest if (1) he acts upon the direction or as a result of a communication from a fellow officer, and (2) the police, as a whole, possess sufficient information to constitute probable cause.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Yet, at the same time, the State argues that Butler's interactions with Officers Allen and Oates constituted two separate police encounters. The State's arguments are irreconcilable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b665 The fellow officer rule allows for the use of \"the information possessed by the police as a whole\n   <em>\n    when they\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    are acting in concert.\"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maesse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1824181\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/29/642/#p646\">\n    29 Wash.

Thus, to accept the State's invocation of the fellow officer rule, we must conclude that the officers in question were acting in concert. But, if they were acting in concert, their interaction with Butler could not, of course, constitute two\n   <em>\n    independent\n   </em>\n   police contacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b666 Conversely, if Officers Allen and Oates were acting independently of each other, then they were not acting in concert and the fellow officer rule does not apply. Accordingly, the trial court's ruling that these were two separate encounters forecloses resort to the fellow officer rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b667 Thus, in the \"two separate encounters\" scenario, Officer Oates's decision to seize Butler must be justified by information premised solely on his own first-hand knowledge. The State is thus left to defend Officer Oates's seizure of Butler by citing information acquired solely by Officer Oates's own observations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b668 Officer Oates's first-hand knowledge of Butler at the time of the seizure was as follows: a person unknown to him in a jacket was standing on the porch of a home about to knock on an entry door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b669 Nothing of which Officer Oates had first-hand knowledge justified a belief that Butler had engaged in or was about to engage in criminality. Officer Oates did not have a lawful basis to seize Butler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   \u00b670 And why not one final nail in the State's analytical coffin? Even if Officer Oates was afforded the benefit of the fellow officer rule, the information given to him by Officer Allen was insufficient to justify Butler's seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00b671 Officer Allen learned of a possible warrant for Butler's arrest from the driver of the vehicle in which Butler had been a passenger. However, Officer Allen acknowledged at the suppression hearing that the information regarding Butler's outstanding arrest warrant was speculative.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   Q.
