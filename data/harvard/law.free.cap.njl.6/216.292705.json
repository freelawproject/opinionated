The facts, as they appeared by the certificate of the proceedings sent up by the two justices, were these: William Blaine, a pauper, whose legal settlement was in the township of Tewksbury, removed into the township of Washington, and became sick, and a charge upon the township. The overseers of Washington gave notice to those of Tewksbury of the circumstances and condition of the said pauper, and requested them to relieve and maintain him during his illness, and to remove him. This the overseers of Tewksbury neglected to do. The overseers of Washington were, therefore, obliged to maintain Blaine, the pauper, until he was in a situation to be removed. To recover the amount of their expenses for maintaining the pauper during his sickiiess, and previous to his removal, the overseers of Washington applied to two justices of the peace of the town\u00e1hip of Tewksbury, in the county of Hunterdon, to issue their warrant of distress against the overseers of Tewksbury, as by the ninth section of the act \u201cfor the settlement and relief of the poor <em>\u201d (Pat. N. J. Laws </em>29) they are authorized to do. The said justices accordingly issued their distress warrant to levy the amount of the said expenses out of the goods and chattels of the overseers of Tewksbury. But it did not appear upon the face of the proceedings of the two justices, that the overseers of Tewksbury had any notice of the application for the distress warrant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-5\"><em>.Ewing </em>now moved to quash the order of the justices</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Al\">for issuing a distress warrant, upon the ground that it had been made, and the distress warrant issued, without giving any notice to the overseers against whom it was issued of the application for the same.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b225-6\">Kirkpatrick, G.
