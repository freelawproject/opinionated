At the third term, after the coming in of the appeal, a motion was made on behalf of Thompson, the appellee, to dismiss the appeal, because the transcript of the justice\u2019s docket, sent up with the appeal, had no seal affixed thereto. The justice, in his certificate, had said, that the transcript was under his hand and seal, but there was no appearance of a wax or wafer to it. The court refused the motion of the appellee, and permitted the justice, who wras in court at the time, to affix his seal to the said transcript; and at a subsequent term proceeded to try the appeal, and gave judgment against Thompson, whereupon he brought this <em>certiorari.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-8\"><em>Vroom </em>now moved to reverse the judgment of the Common Pleas,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYy\">because they proceeded to take cognizance of the appeal when there was no record before them. The transcript without a seal was of no validity. The Court of Common Pleas had no right to permit the justice to affix his seal at the time he did.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-9\">Kirkpatrick, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aox\">We send down records to the inferior courts to be perfected, every day, and why cannot the Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Vroom. </em>I believe no amendment or alteration can be made, unless a rule is taken for that purpose at the term to which the appeal is returned.</p>\n<author id=\"b278-5\">Kirkpatrick, 0.\u2018 J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_n\">The omission of the seal is a mere mistake, which, I think, may be amended. The ground of the rule, that the amendment should be made the first term, is merely to prevent delay. Here no delay was occasioned. There is no principle of law against the Common Pleas making a rule to amend, either the second or third term. We place it at the first term, in order to prevent delay. I see no injustice in allowing the amendment, and think it would be too rigid to reverse for that.</p>\n<author id=\"b278-6\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APX\">I believe these amendments depend upon the rules of the Courts of O'ommon Pleas, and they have often admitted them to be made <em>instanter, </em>when the justice was present in court, and no delay would take place.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Rossell, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
