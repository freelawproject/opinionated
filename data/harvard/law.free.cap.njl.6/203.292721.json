The writ only summoned him \u201c <em>to appear before the Justices of the Supreme Court,\u201d </em>without saying at Trenton, or designating any place of appearance.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-9\"><em>Ewing </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaJ\">contended, that the writ ought not to he quashed for this error; that the place of appearance was certain enough; the defendant is summoned to appear before the justices of the Supreme Court; and their sitting was by law fixed at Trenton, and according to the maxim, <em>id eertum esi quod cerium reddi protest, </em>it was sufficient.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b211-10\">Kirkpatrick, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3fk\">Might you not as well say that you need not put in the writ, that the defendant must appear \u201cbefore the justices of the Supreme Court,\u201d because by law there must be justices of the Supreme Court ?</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\"><em>Ewing. </em>I think I can find authorities to shew that defects as great as this have been amended.</p>\n<author id=\"b211-12\">Kirkpatrick, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdM\">Has there been any appearance entered ?</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\"><em>Ewing. </em>No, sir.</p>\n<author id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Kirkpatrick, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGA\">Take a little time to look into it.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At a subsequent day in term, <em>Swing </em>moved to amend the writ, and laid before the court the following cases, in which he said, amendments had been made of as much importance as the one he now applied for. 5 <em>John. </em>233, <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Waggoner. 1 Sel. Prac. </em>100. <em>1 Black. Rep. </em>454. 2 <em>Ib. </em>918. <em>Com. Dig. title Amendment </em>46.</p>\n<author id=\"b212-8\">Kirkpatrick, 0. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKV\">We have uniformly held that writs issued out of this court are. original writs, and that they cannot be amended, for there is nothing to amend by. We have nothing in our practice analagous to the bill of Middle-sex in England ; the process there is under the discretion of the court. The place of appearance is a pretty substantial thing.</p>\n<author id=\"b212-9\">Rossell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ame\">I am for allowing the amendment; the place of return is fixed by law, and might be amended by the law itself.</p>\n<author id=\"b212-10\">Ford, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADo\">This is a pretty strong error. If there was an appearance entered in the cause I should not be so averse to amending, but I rather think the precedent would establish a loose practice; therefore take nothing by your motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">Let the writ be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
