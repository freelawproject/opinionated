At a subsequent day in term, <em>Mr. Ewing </em>cited the following cases, which had been affirmed in the Court of Errors, the execution remitted and execution issued, without any application to this court, <em>viz., Joseph Wall </em>v. <em>John Den ex dem.; Samuel Stevenson, </em>in ejectment for lands in Bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>lington, in 1789, Messrs. Paterson and Leake attorneys; <em>Den ex dem. John Pearis and Andrew Pearis </em>ads. <em>Mary Paterson, </em>in ejectment for lands in Sussex, in 1795; <em>Barnt De Klyn, </em>plaintiff in error, v. <em>Robert E.

These cases, he said, shewed what had been the uniform practice in this state, and the practice in England appeared to be the same. In 2 <em>Tidd\u2019s Practice </em>1135, it is said: \u201c After affirmance in exchequer chamber, the defendant in error, after\u2019four days, may take out execution; but where the judgment is affirmed in the exchequer chamber, or house of lords, it is necessary that the transcript should be remitted to the Court of King\u2019s Bench before the execution is issued, or, at least, before it is returnable.\u201d And in 2 <em>Saund. </em>101, <em>x. </em>it is said: \u201c After affirmance, &amp;c., defendant in error may take out execution for the <em>snni </em>recovered in the original action.\u201d Again, \u201c But where a judgment is affirmed in the exchequer chamber, or house of lords, the transcript should \u2019 be remitted before the issuing of the execution, at least before it is returnable; \u2019\u2019 but it is no where said in these books, that there must be an application to the court below for leave to issue execution.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b235-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Kirkpatrick, C.
