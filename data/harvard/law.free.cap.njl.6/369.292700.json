Upon this second return, the-indictment against the defendant, a plea of guilty, and the judgment of the court below assessing a fine upon him, were brought up ; but it did not certainly appear whether the confession had been made, and the fine imposed before or after the <em>certiorari </em>was served on the justices of the Sessions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-5\">The <em>Attorney General </em>and <em>Leake,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArqS\">had moved the court to quash the plea of the defendant below, and the judgment of the Sessions assessing the fine, on the ground that the <em>certiorari </em>was presented to the court below, before the confession was recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-6\">They argued that the authority of the Sessions, to proceed in the case, was superseded by the <em>certiorari </em>from the Supreme Court, and that everything subsequently done was void. <em>Fitz William's case, Cro. El. </em>915; 1 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>570-1; 2 <em>Hawk. </em>418, <em>c. </em>27, <em>sec. </em>64; 12 <em>Mod. </em>384; 2 <em>Com. Dig. </em>196, <em>\u201c Certiorari,\u201d letter E.; Crosse </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>12 <em>Mod </em>643.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-7\"><em>JR. Stockton, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANP\">admitted there was no question as to the law, the cases cited were not disputed; but he contended that it did not appear from the return, at what time the <em>certiorari </em>was presented. There was nothing before the court, from which they could presume that the <em>certiorari </em>was delivered before the plea or judgment, and he therefore prayed that a <em>procedendo </em>might issue upon the authority of the case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Gwynne, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>749.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-8\">The <em>Attorney-General </em>admitted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGI\">that upon this second return it did not appear at what stage of the proceedings the indictment was removed by the <em>certiorari. </em>He offered, in order to supply this defect in the return, to read the return which had been first filed to the <em>certiorari, </em>from which it was apparent that it was presented before the confession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">This was objected to on behalf of the defendant, and it was urged that the first return being adjudged incomplete; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>became an absolute nullity; that another return had been actually made by tlie Sessions, which was now before the court, and which alone could be resorted to for the facts.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-5\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"Aeh\">were of this opinion, and refused to hear the first return read, considering it as a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The <em>Attorney-General </em>then applied for permission to enter a rule upon the Sessions, requiring them to amend their return in this particular, by certifying the time when, &amp;c., which was opposed by <em>Stockton, </em>on the ground that it was too late, this return having been filed so long ago as September term last.</p>\n<author id=\"b379-7\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AZAW\">If any fact of importance in the case appears doubtful on the return, the <em>Attorney-General </em>ought to have leave to suggest it on the record, and to have the ambiguity removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Eule granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
