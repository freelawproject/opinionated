The same argument might, also, be applied to the District Court of the United States, which constantly exercised the right of granting new trials.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b189-5\">Per <em>curiam.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AHH\">It has been so long the practice of the Courts of Common Pleas and Quarter Sessions to grant new trials, that it is deemed inexpedient at this time to deny their right so to do, even if it might have been questionable at first.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Rule for a <em>mandamus </em>refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
