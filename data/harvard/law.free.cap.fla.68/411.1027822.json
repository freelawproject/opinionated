Dodge, its attorney, for pleas to -the declaration of the plaintiff herein and each count thereof, says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">First: That it never was indebted as alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">Second: That it never promised as alleged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">Third: That defendant is ngt liable for the payment of a tas of two per cent of the gross amount of receipts received from its policy holders in the State of Florida as alleged in said declaration, for that Chapter 5597 of the Acts of the Legislature of the State of Florida, approved June 1st, 1907, is invalid, null and void, wherein and whereby it is provided that an insurance company such as the defendant herein, shall, on the first day of January after the passage of said Act and on the first day of each succeeding January thereafter, pay to the State Treasurer two per cent of the gross amount of receipts of premiums from policy holders in the State of Florida, under which said Act the plaintiff herein sues the defendant ; and the defendant alleges that said Act of the Legislature of the State of Florida, (Chapter 5597) is in direct conflict with and in violation of the Constitution of the United States, Section 1 of Articlel4, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Unitec/ States, in that the said Act of the Legislature of the State of Florida denies to this defendant and the stockholders of defendant, the equal protection of the laws of the land and deprives the defendant and its stockholders of its and their property without due process of law; and the defendant alleges that the said Act of the Legislature of the State of Flor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ida, under and by virtue of which the plaintiff herein bases its action, is class legislation and a discrimination as against this defendant, in that the said Act of the Legislature imposes an unreasonable and license tax against this defendant, which license tax is a discrimination as against this defendant by reason of the fact that defendant is an insurance company and the said license tax so sought to be imposed under and by virtue of said Act of the Legislature of Florida, is unreasonable, arbitrarily and disproportionately imposed upon this defendant where said license tax is considered in relation to the taxes assessed or levied or imposed, whether as license taxes or otherwise, upon the real and personal property in the State of Florida and upon occupations and businesses required to pay a license tax that said Act of the Legislature of the State of Florida imposing a license tax against Insurance Companies as provided therein, did require the payment by Insurance Companies for the years 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911 and 1912, license fees amounting to between twenty-five and forty per cent of the total amount of all license taxes, required under the laws of the State of Florida; that attached hereto and made a part hereof, the same as though fully set forth herein, and marked \u2018Exhibit A\u2019 is a statement showing the total amount of insurance taxes and the total amount of other license taxes and the total amount of direct taxes upon real and personal property in the State of Florida, and the total receipts from the general revenue fund, one mill school fund, State Board of Health fund and the pension tax fund; and the defendant alleges that one-twelfth of the entire said taxation is derived from license taxes upon Insurance Companies in addition to the municipal tax which insurance companies may pay and the taxes on real estate and per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>sonal property and the amount so required to be paid by Insurance Companies as a class shown to be by said statement hereto attached, (Exhibit A) h discrimination against Insurance Companies and an unreasonable and disproportionate tax of said companies; that said tax is unnecessary as against Insurance Companies to meet any reasonable or legitimate expense for the supervision or regulation of Insurance Companies in the State of Florida, and the said State of Florida does not and has not expended for the purpose of supervision and regulation of Insurance Companies, more than 10 per cent of the total amount of license tax collected from Insurance Companies and in pursuance of said Act of the Legislature of Florida, under which plaintiff herein sues. And defendant alleges that the said license tax sought to be recovered by the plaintiff is such that the amount of fee or charge sought to be exacted is largely and unreasonably in excess of the necessary expenses of issuing a license and the additional labor of officers and other expenses imposed or resulting from the business of defendant and insurance companies or persons enumerated in said Act and subjected to said license tax; that the amount of fee or charge exacted under said Act of the Legislature of the State of Florida from said insurance companies is far beyond the limit of the expenses of issuing a license, the labor of officers and other expenses imposed by the business sought to be taxed as aforesaid; and defendant further alleges that the license tax sought to be exacted of defendant is exorbitant as compared with other license taxes, and the same is an unjust and arbitrary license tax as a discrimination against insurance companies as a class compared with other classes of which license taxes are exacted; that the equal protection of the laws of the land is denied to the class of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>insurance companies or persons taxed as set forth in said Act of the Legislature of the State of Florida under which plaintiff seeks to maintain this action against this defendant; that the said license tax sought to be recovered is as to the amount thereof, and the fee exacted, as to the class of insurance business specified in said act, of which class this defendant is a member, a classification without any reasonable basis and purely arbitrary, and the said classification of-insurance business does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary; and the defendant alleges that the license tax imposed under said classification and sought to be recovered by the plaintiff is a license tax imposed under a classification made by said act of the Legislature of the State of Florida, which classification is, and at the time the law was enacted, without any reasonable basis and purely arbitrary, and said classification does not, and at the time the law was enacted did not rest upon any reasonable basis but is,- and at the time the law was enacted was, essentially arbitrary; that this defendant alleges that the license taxes as collected by the State of Florida showr the matters and things as herein alleged, all of which the defendant stands ready to prove.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\"

Co. v. State, 61 Fla. 376, 55 South. Rep. 398. The contention is that the statute so arbitrarily discriminates against insurance companies as a class, in imposing license taxes, that such companies and their stock holders are thereby denied the equal protection of the laws in violation of the U. S. Constitution. As the license is imposed for revenue as well as police purposes, it is not necessary to consider the averments of the third plea that said tax \u201cis unnecessary as against insurance companies to meet any reasonable or legitimiate expense for the supervision or regulation of insurance companies;\u201d that for such supervision and regulation the State has not expended more than ten per cent of the total license tax collected from insurance companies, and that the license tax here sought to be exacted \u201cis- largely and unreasonably in excess of the necessary expenses of issuing a license and the additional labor of officers and other expenses imposed or resulting 'from the business of defendant and insurance companies.\u201d The plea avers that the quoted statute \u201cdenies to this defendant and the stockholders of defendant, the equal protection of the laws of the land and deprives the defendant and its stockholders of its and their property without due process of law,\u201d in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, in that the statute \u201cis class legislation and a discrimination as against this defendant.\u201d Averments of conclusions are not admitted by the demurrer where the act assailed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the facts stated do not sustain the asserted conclusions. The act does not on its face appear to be invalid as being in conflict with organic laiy, and the facts do not warrant the asserted conclusions that the license tax exacted of the defendants is \u201cexorbitant as compared with other license taxes\u201d or that it is arbitrary and a discrimination against insurance companies as a class or that the classification is unreasonable and purely arbitrary. A comparison of the terms of this provision with other statutory provisions imposing license taxes does not show an unlawful discrimination. It is also averred that the license tax \u201cis unreasonably, arbitrarily and disproportionately imposed upon this defendant where said license tax is considered in relation to the taxes assessed or' levied or imposed, whether as license taxes or otherwise upon real and personal property in the State of Florida and upon occupations and businesses required to pay a license tax;\u201d that the statute \u201cdid require the payment by insurance companies for the years 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911 and 1912, license fees amounting to between twenty-five and forty per cent, of the total amount of all license taxes required under the laws of the State of Florida; * * that one-twelfth of the entire said taxation is derived from license taxes upon insurance companies in addition to the municipal tax which insurance companies may pay and the taxes on real estate and personal property, and the amount so required to be paid by insurance companies as a class is shown by an attached statement to be a discrimination against insurance companies and an unreasonable and disproportionate tax of said companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">No question of interstate commerce arises in this case. License \u2019 taxes are not required to be equal or uniform, but they cannot lawfully be imposed so as to deny the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>equal protection of tlie law. The State has a wide discretionary power in imposing license taxes, and unless there can be no substantial basis for discriminations made in classifications and in fixing the amount of license taxes so that such discriminations must be regarded as purely arbitrary and unreasonable under every conceivable condition in practical affairs, the courts will- not interfere with legislative regulations of such matters. Ferguson v. McDonald, 66 Fla. 494, 63 South. Rep. 915; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, 233 U. S. 304, - Sup. Ct. Rep. -; Ohio River and Western Railway Co. v. Dittey, 232 U. S. 576,-Sup. Ct. Rep.-; Metropolis Theater Co. v. City of Chicago, 228 U. S. 61, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 441; Bradley v. City of Richmond, 227 U. S. 477, 33 Sup. Ct. Rep. 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The burden is on one who complains that he has been denied the equal protection of the laws to sustain the complaint. The averments of the plea that the license tax imposed on insurance companies is disproportionate to the taxes paid upon other occupations or- businesses do not show a denial of equal protection of the laws, since others who pay license taxes are not similarly conditioned. It may well be that the insurance companies pay very little property tax and make large profits on premiums collected in the State which would be a proper basis for the license tax compl\u00e1ined of. The plea does not negative this as a valid basis for classification or for the amounts of the taxes. The volume of the defendant\u2019s business, its profits, its tax burdens and its corporate and business advantages when considered separately or with other occupations and businesses are not stated, if that would tend to show arbitrary and unjust discriminations and hostile exactions of taxes. The figures showing collections of license and other taxes by the State do not show arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>and hostile exactions of the defendant or of insurance companies as a class to which the defendant belongs. The business and governmental conditions of the State may warrant the classifications made and the license taxes imposed, and nothing stated in the plea removes the presumption in favor of the statute. Similar and additional license taxes are imposed by statute upon sleeping and parlor car companies doing business in this State, and such exactions have been sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the Pullman Co. v. Knott, decided November 2, 1914. See Afro-American Industrial &amp; Benefit Ass\u2019n. of the United States v. State, 61 Fla. 85, 54 South. Rep. 383; Peninsular Industrial Ins. Co. v. State, 61 Fla. 376, 55 South. Rep. 398; Brown v. Pittsburgh Life &amp; Trust Co., \u2014 Ala. \u2014, 65 South. Rep. 699. Express companies are required to pay two per cent, upon their gross intrastate receipts. Chap. 6421, Acts 1913. The reasonableness of the statute is deter mined in its enactment so \u00e1s to- preclude review by the courts unless the act or its application is so unreasonable and arbitrary as to deny an organic right.
