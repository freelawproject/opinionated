They contend that the judge 1) \u201cmisapplied\u201d the Security Deposit Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-19 to -26 (the SDA); and 2) erred in concluding their landlord, defendant Marc Weiss, had met \u201chis burden of proof\u2019 regarding the costs of repairs required as a result of damage caused by plaintiffs to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>leased premises. We have considered these arguments in light of the record and applicable legal standards. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for the entry of a modified judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Special Civil Part Small Claims Division seeking $5000 in damages, alleging they paid defendant $3562.50 as a security deposit pursuant to a written lease for the second-floor apartment located at 280 Claremont Avenue, Montclair.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claimed that they vacated the premises on January 3, 2008, that more than thirty days had elapsed, and that defendant had not returned their deposit. Although plaintiff\u2019s claim, if successful, would have exceeded $5000, they submitted the dispute to the limited jurisdiction of the Small Claims Division by waiving any possible excess recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Represented by counsel, both plaintiffs testified at trial, identifying the lease for the apartment, which commenced on August 1, 2007, at a monthly rent of $1425, and terminated on July 31, 2008. Although the lease prohibited the keeping of pets, the parties initialed a handwritten modification permitting \u201c[two] cats [to] be kept unless an issue arises.\u201d Plaintiffs testified they tendered $3562.50 as a security deposit, \u201ca month and a half [of rent] plus a pet deposit, an extra month.\u201d Problems arose between plaintiffs and defendant, and plaintiffs moved out of the premises, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>mutual consent, on January 31, 2008, never receiving any of their deposit monies from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Defendant appeared pro se and testified that on February 28, 2008, he corresponded with plaintiffs\u2019 attorney. The letter indicated that plaintiffs had not \u201cprovided a forwarding address upon departure to send their [r]ent [sjecurity [djeposit reconciliation to.\u201d Attached to the letter were various bills and estimates from contractors and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas Co. indicating utility expenses left unpaid by plaintiffs, and repair costs occasioned by plaintiffs\u2019 damage to the property. In short, defendant claimed that the entirety of plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit, which had accrued interest and was now $3577.56, was insufficient to defer the combined costs for the expenses and repairs. Defendant claimed plaintiffs owed him $58.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Defendant testified using photographs 1) depicting stains on the floors caused by plaintiffs or their pets which required the apartment to be re-carpeted; and 2) showing damage caused by plaintiffs\u2019 smoking in the apartment\u2014something prohibited by the lease\u2014requiring it to be re-painted. He testified that plaintiffs also broke a storm window that needed to be replaced. Defendant acknowledged that the actual costs for the painting was $245.96 less than the amount contained in his February 28 letter. On rebuttal, plaintiffs again testified and claimed they had not caused any of the damages of which defendant complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The judge determined that plaintiffs had caused the broken storm window, \u201csmoke damage,\u201d and damage to the carpets. Noting that the calculations contained in defendant\u2019s February 28 itemization letter needed to be redone \u201cdue to the overestimate of the amount that it would cost to paint,\u201d the judge concluded that in fact defendant had \u201cwrongfully withheld\u201d $187.57 of plaintiffs security deposit. Pursuant to the SDA, she doubled that amount and entered judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor for $375.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected. She argued that pursuant to <em>Chatterjee v. Iero, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 880 A.2d 496 (Law Div.2005), it was unlawful for defendant to have \u201csubdivided\u201d the security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>deposit required from plaintiffs, i.e., \u201ccalling one month[\u2019s] [amount] a pet deposit and one and a half times the monthly rent [a] security deposit.\u201d She argued that \u201c[defendant was] holding two and a half times the monthly rent, when the [SDA] only allows for one and a half times the monthly rent.\u201d Plaintiffs claimed that while the SDA permits any security in excess of the statutory limit to be applied to a tenant\u2019s monthly rental obligation, in this case, because they had already vacated the premises, the proper remedy was to view the excess security deposit as \u201cwrongfully held security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The judge responded, \u201cYou have my findings of fact for the record. Why don\u2019t you leave me the law, because I\u2019m not following you at all, and I will look into it and I will mail out the order.\u201d However, after a pause, the proceedings continued. In apparent reference to <em>Chatterjee, </em>the judge noted, \u201c[i]t\u2019s Law Division. It\u2019s not binding on me . . . . So, I\u2019m going to stick with my original order, which was $875.14.\u201d The judge continued, \u201cI don\u2019t see that there\u2019s any reason why if the landlord charged too much security deposit, and the tenants are getting <em>the </em>full ... benefit of it, that there\u2019s a penalty barring any nefarious purpose by the landlord.\u201d She entered the order under review, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Plaintiffs contend that defendant \u201cfailed to meet his burden\u201d of demonstrating that any damage to the unit was caused by them during their tenancy, and they are entitled to the full amount of damages sought by their complaint because the entire security deposit was \u201cwrongfully withheld.\u201d Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that the judge misapplied the SDA, and because defendant required them to post an amount of security that exceeded the statutory limits, the judge \u201cshould have found that [defendant] was required to return to [plaintiffs] this additional amount of security, subject to doubling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">We can quickly dispatch with plaintiffs\u2019 initial contention. Our review of the factual findings made by the trial judge in a non-jury trial is quite limited. <em>Estate of Ostlund v. Ostlund, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 400, 918 A.2d 649 (App.Div.2007). \u201c \u2018[W]e do not weigh the evidence, assess the credibility of witnesses, or make conclusions about the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mountain Hill, L.L.C. v. Township of Middletown, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 498, 945 A.2d 59 (App.Div.2008) (quoting <em>State v. Barone, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>599, 615, 689 A.2d 132 (1997)). In general, the judge\u2019s factual \u201cfindings ... should not be disturbed unless they are so wholly insupportable as to result in a denial of justicef.]\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In this case, the trial judge had the opportunity to hear the testimony of all parties to the lease. She was able to consider the documentary and photographic evidence supplied by defendant. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, she had the opportunity to assess the demeanor of the witnesses and judge their credibility as to the critical issue in the case, i.e., did plaintiffs cause the damage as alleged by defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">We find no basis to reach a different conclusion to that essential question than did the trial judge. She found plaintiffs had indeed damaged a storm window in the apartment, requiring its repair at the cost of $27.82. She further found that plaintiffs or their pets had caused damage to the carpet in the apartment requiring its replacement at a cost of $1975.65. The judge accepted defendant\u2019s contention that $107.48 of the January utility bill for the premises reflected plaintiffs\u2019 responsibility. And, finally, she concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 smoking in the apartment, as well as a toilet blockage that damaged the ceiling of the apartment below, justified defendant\u2019s decision to paint the premises at a cost of $1279.04. In sum, we accept the judge\u2019s finding that plaintiffs were responsible to defendant for unpaid expenses and damages in the amount of $3389.99, thus rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the entirety of their security deposit was wrongfully withheld by defendant when they vacated the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">We turn now to the more problematic issue plaintiffs raise. In order to properly consider the argument, we note some additional factual findings implicitly made by the trial judge and undisputed by the parties. First, at the initiation of the lease, plaintiffs tendered and defendant accepted $3562.50, an amount equal to two-and-one-half times the monthly rent. Second, as of February 28, 2008, when defendant sent the security deposit reconciliation letter to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the deposit had increased because of accrued interest to $3577.41. Plaintiffs contend that defendant violated the SDA by demanding a deposit that exceeded the statutory amount by $1425. They argue that they are entitled to double that amount plus attorneys fees pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 because these were monies \u201cwrongfully withheld\u201d by defendant. <em>Yi v. Re/Max Fortune Properties, Inc., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 538, 770 A.2d 738 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>610, 782 A.2d 428 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">It is not entirely clear from the judge\u2019s brief comments what reasoning she employed in rejecting this argument. We assume by indicating that even \u201cif the landlord charged too much security [ ],\u201d plaintiffs were \u201cgetting the full ... benefit of it,\u201d the judge viewed the situation as one in which defendant was making a claim for damages, and plaintiff\u2019s tendered security deposit was being applied as an offset. We further assume that since the judge found there was no \u201cnefarious purpose\u201d behind defendant\u2019s actions, she concluded the additional security deposit was not \u201cwrongfully withheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">We begin our analysis by noting that the SDA limits the amount of security any landlord can require from a tenant to one and one-half times the monthly rent. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.2. It is undisputed that defendant required plaintiffs to pay two and one-half months\u2019 rent as security. Although the lease itself never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>provided for a separate \u201cpet deposit,\u201d the parties understood an increased security deposit amount was attributable to defendant\u2019s concession to plaintiffs\u2019 desire to keep their two cats. Landlords, however, cannot \u201c[s]ub-divid[e]\u201d a tenant\u2019s funds into refundable pet deposits, not subject to the SDA, and other general security deposits that are subject to the SDA. <em>Chatterjee, supra, </em>380 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 54, 880 A.2d 496. If the combined amount of all such deposits exceeds the statutory limit of the SDA, permitting such practice \u201cwould be an end run and would make a sham of the [SDA] and thwart the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the lease did not contain any express waiver of the SDA\u2019s provisions, if it had, such a waiver by plaintiffs would have been void. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-24 (\u201c[a]ny provision of [ ] a[ ] lease ... whereby a person who so deposits ... money waives any provision of [the SDA] is absolutely void\u201d). Thus, we must conclude that defendant violated the SDA. The only question that remains is what is the appropriate remedy for defendant\u2019s statutory violation in light of the judge\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs actually caused $3389.99 worth of damages to the premises during their brief leasehold?</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The SDA provides a specific remedy for the breach of some of its statutory obligations. For example, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-19, a landlord must place a tenant\u2019s security deposit in an interest bearing account, must notify the tenant where that account is located, and must annually pay over to the tenant, or credit his rent account, with any interest earned on the deposit. If the landlord \u201cfails to invest or deposit the security money in the manner required ... or to provide the notice or pay the interest to the tenant as required,\u201d the tenant \u201cmay give written notice ... that such security money plus an amount representing interest at the rate of seven percent per annum be applied on account of rent[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Frontenac Associates v. Fauerbach, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 379, 372 A.2d 683 (Dist.Ct.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 requires the landlord to return the tenant\u2019s security deposit and interest accrued \u201c[w]ithin 30 days after the termination of the [ ] lease ... less any charges expended in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>accordance with the terms of [the] lease[.]\u201d Any deductions the landlord makes must be \u201citemized,\u201d and notice must be forwarded to the tenant. <em>Ibid. </em>If the landlord violates this section of the SDA, the tenant may bring suit, and \u201cthe court upon finding for the tenant ... shall award recovery of double the amount of said moneys, together with full costs of any action and, in the court\u2019s discretion, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">However, even violations of these provisions of the SDA do not accord the \u201cdoubling\u201d remedy provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 if in fact the tenant has violated his obligations under the lease. For example, in <em>Penbara v. Straczynski, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 157-58, 789 A.2d 134 (App.Div.2002), the landlord sought \u201ca declaration that he was entitled to retain the tenant\u2019s security deposit after the tenant vacated the leased premises, and damages [were] allegedly caused to the premises in excess of the amount of the security deposit.\u201d He acknowledged that he had not placed the tenant\u2019s security in an interest-bearing account, thus violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-19, and that he had failed to comply with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 in that he had not sent the tenant an itemized statement of deductions from the deposit. <em>Penbara, supra, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 159, 789 A.2d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The trial judge concluded that these statutory violations required the dismissal of the landlord\u2019s complaint, and the return of double the tenant\u2019s security deposit. <em>Id. </em>at 159-60, 789 A.2d 134. However, in reversing, we noted that any violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-19 \u201cd[id] not mandate forfeiture of [the] security deposit[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161, 789 A.2d 134. Instead, \u201cthe tenant\u2019s remedy, in this context, [wa]s to have the security deposit, and the interest that should have been earned thereon, applied\u201d to his outstanding obligations. <em>Ibid. </em>We further noted that as to any violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1, the tenant was limited to recovery of double \u201cthe net amount \u2018wrongfully withheld,\u2019 not double the amount of the initial deposit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 789 A.2d 134 (quoting <em>Yi, supra, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 539, 770 A.2d 738 (citing <em>Jaremback v. Butler Ridge Apartments, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 89 n. 1, 398 A.2d 1339 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>(App.Div.1979))). In short, despite the landlord\u2019s admitted statutory violations, the judge was required to \u201cdetermine the amount of th[e] offsets and, if they [wejre greater than the security deposit withheld, there [wa]s no deposit to return to the tenant and no valid basis for enforcing the notification requirement of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160-61, 789 A.2d 134 (citing <em>Jaremback, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 87-88, 398 A.2d 1339).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">We reached a similar result in <em>Lorril Co. v. La Corte, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 800 A.2d 245 (App.Div.2002). There, the landlord sued his tenants for double the rent alleging they had unlawfully held over after the expiration of their lease. Id. at 435, 800 A.2d 245; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-5. The tenants claimed that they were entitled to double the return of their security deposit based upon the landlord\u2019s violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1\u2014-he failed to provide notice and itemized deductions\u2014and the judge agreed. <em>Id. </em>at 437, 800 A.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">However, we reversed. We concluded that the tenant was not entitled to double the amount of the security deposit as an offset to monies otherwise due the landlord because of the unlawful holding over. <em>Id. </em>at 441, 800 A.2d 245. \u201c[B]ecause the tenants remaining rent obligation exceeded the security deposit, nothing was unlawfully withheld and nothing remained of the deposit to be doubled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 800 A.2d 245; <em>see also Truesdell v. Carr, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 321, 798 A.2d 153 (Law Div.2002) (observing that \u201c[i]n posting the security deposit, the tenant is thus on notice that, prior to any return of the money, the deposited sums may be applied to appropriate costs incurred by the landlord as a result of the tenancy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The SDA, however, fails to provide a specific remedy for violations of its limit upon the amount of security that a landlord may demand. <em>Brownstone Arms v. Asher, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>401, 406, 297 A.2d 219 (Dist.Ct.1972). We have no doubt that had plaintiffs in this case sought to apply the $1425 they deposited in excess of the statutory limit to their rent obligations during their tenancy, such a result would necessarily have been mandated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Although not specifically provided for by the SDA, such a remedy was recognized in <em>Brownstone Arms, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 406, 297 A.2d 219. Clearly, in those circumstances, if applied to the current rent obligation, the prohibited excess deposit would not be \u201cwrongfully withheld\u201d at the termination of the leasehold, and thus not subject to the doubling provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">However, we do not believe the same result should occur under the circumstances presented here, i.e., where the landlord has accepted an amount of security that exceeds the statutory limit and does not return it to the tenant at the termination of the lease. Under these circumstances, to the extent it exceeds the permissible statutory limit, plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit has been \u201cwrongfully withheld\u201d by defendant and the remedy provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.2 is appropriate. Thus, prior to considering any credits due defendant for damage to the leasehold caused by plaintiffs, the judge was required to give them the benefit of the statutory remedy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We reach this conclusion for a variety of reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">We recently noted that the SDA \u201c\u2018recognizes that the security deposit remains the tenant\u2019s money, although it is designed to provide some protection from loss to the landlord.\u2019\u201d <em>Hale v. Farrakhan, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 342, 915 A.2d 581 (App.Div.2007) (quoting <em>MD Assocs. v. Alvarado, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>583, 586, 695 A.2d 760 (App.Div.1997)). The legislature has clearly spoken as to the amount of protection afforded the landlord\u2014no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>more than one and one-half months\u2019 rent. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.2. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 was specifically \u201cintended to protect tenants from overreaching landlords who seek to defraud tenants by diverting rent security deposits to their own use.\u201d <em>Jaremback, supra, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 87, 398 A.2d 1339 (citing <em>Watson v. Jaffe, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>213, 214, 296 A.2d 537 (App.Div.1972)). \u201cThe statute establishes the landlord\u2019s obligations <em>in </em>unmistakable and definite terms, and clearly provides a mandatory remedy for default.\u201d <em>Yi, supra, </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 538, 770 A.2d 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">If we were to permit a landlord to do what the trial judge permitted this landlord to do, we would in essence be turning a blind eye to the obvious statutory violation. The judge believed that by according plaintiffs an offset credit for the total amount of their security deposit, they were obtaining the \u201cfull benefit\u201d of that deposit. This was undoubtedly true, however, this reasoning ignored the fact that defendant was not entitled to demand that amount of security from plaintiffs in the first instance. As a result, defendant, who violated the statute, suffered no consequence. As we noted in a different context in <em>Yi, </em>\u201c[mjuch mischief would ensue if landlords or courts were permitted to manipulate the express provisions of the statute.\u201d 338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 538, 770 A.2d 738. Similar concerns arise here.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In addition, we find a qualitative difference between a landlord\u2019s violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.2, and the more technical violations of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-19 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 discussed in the cases we have cited above. In those situations, the landlord rightfully acquired the full amount of the security on deposit. The only issue presented was whether a violation of those portions of the SDA resulted in monies \u201cwrongfully withheld\u201d at the termination of the leasehold. We therefore acknowledged in those cases that damages suffered by the landlord as a result of violations of the tenant\u2019s obligations to perform in accordance with the lease were properly deducted from the security deposit before determining whether any amount was \u201cwrongfully withheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Here, however, defendant was never entitled to hold plaintiffs\u2019 extra month of security. The Legislature has strictly prohibited him from doing so. Having never had a rightful claim to the money, we are hard-pressed to see how defendant should nevertheless obtain the full benefit of it without any penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Lastly, to the extent the trial judge found that defendant had no \u201cnefarious\u201d purpose in retaining a prohibited amount of security, and utilized that in reaching her decision, we note that such considerations are irrelevant if a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 is proven. \u201cA court may not withhold the statutorily mandated doubling of a wrongfully retained security deposit based on its view that the landlord\u2019s violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1 was de minimus or other equitable considerations.\u201d <em>Hale, supra, </em>390 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 343, 915 A.2d 581. Thus, we conclude that to the extent plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit exceeded the SDA\u2019s permitted limit, that amount was wrongfully withheld when the leasehold terminated, and plaintiffs were entitled to the statutory remedy of double the amount, $2850, and, in the judge\u2019s discretion, attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Having said that, however, we can discern no principled reason why, in light of the extensive testimony and well-supported factual findings made by the judge, the result we have reached should now require further proceedings. Defendant should be entitled to obtain the benefit of what he has already proven. In other words, even though defendant never filed a claim for the full amount of damages he alleged, we believe it is both impractical, since factual determinations have already been made, and unwise, from the standpoint of judicial economy, to force him to do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In <em>MD Assocs., </em>the situation was the converse of that presented in this case. There, the landlord was the plaintiff seeking compensation for damages that exceeded the security deposit on account, and rent due based upon the tenant\u2019s alleged improper termination of the lease. <em>MD Assocs., </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 585, 695 A.2d 760. The tenant/defendant did not file any counterclaim, but instead alleged that he had properly terminated the tenancy, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the landlord\u2019s insistence, and that some of the charges for alleged damage were improper. <em>Ibid. </em>The trial judge believed the tenant, made an award in his favor, and doubled it under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8\u2014 21.1, despite the tenant\u2019s failure to have filed any affirmative request for the relief. <em>Ibid. </em>In affirming that decision, \u201cwe reeognize[d] the inherent and express authority of a judge hearing a case in the Small Claims section to recognize defenses to the claim asserted in the complaint and in appropriate cases to fashion a counterclaim.\u201d <em>MD Assocs., supra, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 587, 695 A.2d 760; <em>accord Fanarjian v. Moskowitz, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 399-400, 568 A.2d 94 (App.Div.1989). We conclude that in this case, similar reasoning permits the following result.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">That portion of plaintiffs\u2019 security deposit that exceeded the limit of the SDA, $1425, and was thus wrongfully withheld, should be doubled pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1. All of the security deposit otherwise properly held by defendant, $2125.41, was exhausted by defendant\u2019s proven claim for $3389.99 in damages and expenses, leaving a balance of $1237.58 due to defendant. Subtracting this amount from the $2850, plaintiffs are entitled to judgment in their favor in the amount of $1612.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We remand the matter to the trial court for entry of an amended judgment in favor of plaintiffs in that amount. We further direct the trial judge, in the exercise of her discretion, to consider whether attorney\u2019s fees should be awarded to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Affirmed in part; reversed in part; remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\"> The complaint erroneously listed the amount of the deposit as $3625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\"> The SDA permits a prevailing tenant to recover \"double the amount of [the deposit] together with full costs of any action and, in the court\u2019s discretion, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.1. It also grants jurisdiction over any actions \"for the return of all or a part of a security deposit in which the amount in dispute, including any applicable penalties, does not exceed the sum of $5,000, exclusive of costs[,]\u201d to the Small Claims Division. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-21.4. Plaintiffs' potential recovery, $3562.50 doubled, or $7135, exceeded the jurisdictional limit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> Because the issue is not presented, we need not decide whether some other penalty ought to be imposed upon the landlord for this violation of the statute under those circumstances. For example, the landlord might also be obligated to credit the tenant with some amount of interest earned on the illegal excess deposit similar to that required for a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>46:8-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\"> To the extent a contrary result occurred in <em>Alston v.
