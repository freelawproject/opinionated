LAPLANTE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b94-17\">A jury in this court convicted defendant Robert Joubert of three counts of sexual exploitation of children, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), and one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5). Prior to the jury trial, Joubert moved to suppress evidence seized during the execution of a search warrant at his residence, including VHS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>recordings that figured prominently in the counts of conviction. The motion argued that the affidavit that Sean Ford, a detective with the Concord Police Department, submitted in support of the warrant application failed to establish probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at Joubert\u2019s residence or on the VHS recordings. Citing <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), the motion also argued that Detective Ford deliberately or recklessly omitted several material facts from his affidavit that would have negated probable cause had they been included.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The court held a hearing on the motion, at which Detective Ford testified and was cross-examined by Joubert\u2019s counsel. The court then issued, on the record at the hearing, an oral order concluding that the warrant affidavit established probable cause and that Detective Ford\u2019s purported \u201comissions\u201d from the affidavit were immaterial, and thus denying Joubert\u2019s motion. As Joubert has appealed his conviction, the court now issues this written order memorializing its findings and conclusions for the benefit of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">I. Background<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On June 27, 2012, Detective Ford- submitted a search warrant application to the 6th Circuit Court, District Division, in Concord, seeking issuance of a warrant to search Joubert\u2019s residence at 144 Fairmont Avenue in Manchester. The application sought authority to search for, seize, and analyze fifteen categories of evidence, including (as is pertinent here) \u201c[a]ny and all computers or related electronic storage devices and media\u201d; \u201c[a]ny and all cameras ... including cassette tapes, VCR/ VHS tapes, CD\u2019s, memory cards, and developed or undeveloped film\u201d; and \u201c[a]ny and all photographs, electronic images, and video of minors/juveniles/youth/youth groups that Robert Joubert has or may have had contact with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Detective Ford\u2019s application included a 14-page affidavit detailing the investigation up to that point. The affidavit explained that earlier that year, the police department in York, Maine, had received an e-mail warning of Joubert, who at that time was operating the Seacoast Baseball Academy in York. The email, the affidavit related, had been sent by a woman in Concord who claimed that her then-juvenile son \u201cKC\u201d had formerly had a relationship with Joubert, and identified Joubert as a \u201cpedophile\u201d with a history of \u201cpolice investigations and restraining orders in relation to young boys.\u201d The affidavit then listed several of those \u201cpolice investigations,\u201d including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">\u2022 Joubert\u2019s 1994 arrest for sexual assault, arising out of a 12-year-old boy\u2019s accusation that, while sleeping over at Joubert\u2019s house, he awoke to find Joubert placing the child\u2019s hand on his (Joubert\u2019s) penis;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">\u2022 Joubert\u2019s 1999 arrest for sexual assault, arising out of a 17-year-old girl\u2019s accusation that Joubert had forcible intercourse with her while she was sleeping over at his apartment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u2022 Joubert\u2019s 2004 arrests for, respectively, violation of a civil protective order and contempt of a civil protective order, both arising out of \u201cJoubert\u2019s reportedly harassing behavior\u201d toward KC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Although none of these charges resulted in a conviction, the affidavit did not expressly mention that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">After receiving the e-mail, the affidavit explained, the York police and the FBI then proceeded to interview various individuals associated with Joubert. The affidavit reported that the owner/operator of a baseball training facility in Newington, New Hampshire confirmed that Joubert was employed there as a youth baseball instructor from late 2006 through mid-2009, but had been terminated due to complaints from parents that he had photographed players at a swimming pool during a trip to Florida and had showed up at a juvenile player\u2019s home while the child\u2019s parents were not there. That same person, according to the affidavit, reported that Joubert had \u201cquestionable contacts\u201d with one boy in particular, \u201cEZ,\u201d while working at the facility. The affidavit also claimed that two later interviewees\u2014 whose juvenile son had, like EZ, been coached by Joubert in Newington\u2014made similar allegations (of inappropriate videotaping, visiting a child\u2019s home while the child\u2019s parents were not present, and close contact with EZ) against Joubert.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Based upon these allegations, the affidavit explained, the investigators spoke to both KC and EZ, the latter of whom stated that he was involved with Joubert from the ages of 9 to 11, during which time he had \u201cnumerous unsupervised contacts\u201d with Joubert. According to the affidavit, EZ claimed that he had \u201cquestionable physical contact\u201d with Joubert, which EZ characterized as Joubert \u201cmaking a pass at him.\u201d The affidavit related claims by EZ that Joubert had performed upper-body massages on him while EZ was shirtless, and that on one occasion, Joubert had taken EZ into a back room at the Newington facility and \u201crepeatedly tried to touch [his] crotch area.\u201d The affidavit further stated that KC, for his part, \u201cdisclosed several instances of sexual abuse against him by Joubert\u201d in 2004, when Joubert was coaching him in youth baseball.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The affidavit also recounted the interviews of several other individuals who claimed that Joubert had sexually abused them, or otherwise had inappropriate physical contact with them, while they were minors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">\u2022 \u201cNT\u201d claimed that Joubert had sexually abused him in 1994, when NT was 12 years old (an incident that was the basis for Joubert\u2019s 1994 arrest for sexual assault, mentioned above).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">\u2022 \u201cKH\u201d claimed that one night someT time in the time period of 1998-2000, when he was between the ages of 7 to 9, he slept at Joubert\u2019s apartment in Concord after Joubert had brought him to a baseball game, and awoke to find Joubert sucking on his big toe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-12\">\u2022 \u201cMT\u201d claimed that during a three- to four-year period from 1994-1998, when he was between the ages of 8 and 12, Joubert sexually abused him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>two to five times a week, and \u201chundreds of times\u201d in total. These incidents, which occurred while MT was living with or near Joubert in Concord, and on one occasion when Joubert transported MT to Cooperstown, New York, primarily involved MT masturbating Joubert. According to MT, Joubert \u201ctook pictures of him playing sports, fishing, and at the beach and other locations.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">\u2022 Joubert\u2019s adult son, \u201cSJ,\u201d claimed that Joubert had sexually abused him twice, around 1984 and 1986, when SJ was 9 and 11 years old. According to the affidavit, these incidents were \u201cmasterbatory <em>[sic] </em>in nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Much of the information conveyed in the affidavit dealt with SJ. The affidavit related that SJ had delivered a computer tower to the Concord police, asserting that the tower belonged to Joubert and that \u201che suspected that the hard drive contained incriminating information.\u201d According to the affidavit, SJ claimed that he had recently assisted Joubert in moving to the Fairmont Avenue property and that Joubert, who \u201cwas anxious because he was being investigated by the FBI,\u201d \u201ctore apart the computer tower, trying to remove the hard drive\u201d and asked SJ how to destroy the hard drive. SJ also claimed, according to the affidavit, that Joubert said he had \u201cclient and financial information\u201d on the hard drive \u201cthat he did not want getting out,\u201d and that he had recently had the hard drive \u201ccleaned\u201d but believed this may not have erased everything.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The police recorded and transcribed their interview with SJ when he delivered the computer tower to them. The transcript of this interview reveals that SJ professed to believe \u201cthat there is probably child pornography on that computer,\u201d but admitted that he \u201cnever saw any\u201d child pornography on the computer or in magazines at Joubert\u2019s house, and that the likelihood that there was child pornography on the computer was \u201cpurely an assumption on my part.\u201d In recounting this interview, the affidavit stated that \u201cSJ strongly suspected, based on [Joubert\u2019s] actions, demeanor, and past history with NT and himself, that there was child pornography or some other incriminating information in the computer.\u201d The affidavit did not expressly recount SJ\u2019s admission that his opinion about the presence of child pornography on the computer was \u201cpurely an assumption,\u201d nor did it state that SJ said that he had never seen any magazines depicting underage sexual images at Joubert\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The affidavit also mentioned that SJ had agreed to record a meeting with Joubert about a week after delivering the computer to the Concord police. The transcript of the recording, which was not submitted with the warrant application, reveals that Joubert vehemently denied the allegations of sexual abuse made by NT and KC. The transcript further reveals that SJ segued from discussing NT\u2019s allegations against Joubert into SJ\u2019s own allegations of sexual abuse against Joubert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">S <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> [What NT claimed is] awfully similar to what happened to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">R No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>S Really?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">R No. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">R Well, see, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to\u2014 that\u2019s what going to be the deciding factor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">R [I] know I\u2019ve done some things\u2014[SJ interjects]\u2014and I know I\u2019ve done some wrong things.

Nothing. Nothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-19\">With respect to this conversation, Detective Ford\u2019s affidavit noted only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-20\">SJ met with his father at 144 Fairmont Ave in Manchester, NH and the conversation was recorded. They discussed previous allegations against Robert Joubert and his abuse of SJ. In regards to the sexual abuse of SJ, Robert Joubert made no denials, apologized and became emotional. He then denied allegations made by others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-21\">The affidavit further related that SJ had informed Detective Ford that Joubert was residing at the Fairmont Avenue property, and that Joubert \u201chad access to the entire residence\u201d and had \u201cnumerous boxes, bags, and containers\u201d that were \u201cstrewn about the residence and on the enclosed porch.\u201d SJ is the sole source of evidence concerning Joubert\u2019s residence at the Fairmont Avenue property listed in the affidavit. While SJ has a lengthy criminal record that includes a 1996 conviction for forgery, no information concerning SJ\u2019s criminal record is listed in the affidavit. At oral argument on Joubert\u2019s motion, Detective Ford testified that he was aware that SJ had a criminal record, but could not recall if he had looked at SJ\u2019s criminal record prior to applying for the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-23\">Detective Ford closed the affidavit by attesting that, based upon his training and experience (related at the beginning of the affidavit), he knew \u201cthat persons engaged in the molestation and exploitation of ... minors often maintain possession and/or control of physical or electronic documents pertaining to their victims and other juveniles.\u201d Detective Ford stated his belief that Joubert was in possession of evidence of the crime of felonious sexual assault, in the form of physical and electronic documents which could confirm or dispel \u201cthe allegations made against [Joubert] involving juveniles, his travels, [and] his relationship^) with minors/juveniles and the victims mentioned in this affidavits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-24\">Relying on the information conveyed in the affidavit, a Circuit Court judge issued a warrant authorizing a search of the Fairmont Avenue property for evidence of the crimes of sexual assault, and further authorizing the seizure for analytical purposes of the fifteen categories of evidence previously mentioned. The warrant was executed the following day. During the search, law enforcement seized, among other things, the VHS recordings that formed the basis of the counts of which Joubert was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-25\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-26\">A. Existence of probable cause in warrant affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b99-27\">The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects \u201c[t]he right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d and provides that \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const. Am. IV. Generally, then\u2014-with some exceptions that have no applicability here\u2014the Fourth Amendment \u201crequires police officers to secure a search warrant supported by probable cause prior to effecting a search or seizure.\u201d <em>United States v. Gifford, </em>727 F.3d 92, 98 (1st Cir.2013). \u201cInformation supporting probable cause for a warrant is often set forth in an affidavit provided by a law enforcement officer, as happened here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That affidavit \u201cmust demonstrate probable cause to believe that: 1) a crime has been committed, and 2) enumerated evidence of the offense will be found at the place to be searched\u2014the so-called \u2018nexus\u2019 element.\u201d <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>575 F.3d 130, 136 (1st Cir.2009) (some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Joubert\u2019s motion appears to concede that Detective Ford\u2019s affidavit demonstrated probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed (and Joubert\u2019s counsel made no argument to the contrary at oral argument). That is a wise concession: as discussed in the previous section, the affidavit related that several individuals accused Joubert of sexually abusing them while they were underage, while other individuals described conduct suggesting that Joubert had an unusual interest in children (certain accusers included), buttressing the abuse accusations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In asserting that the affidavit did not establish probable cause to search his residence, Joubert instead argues that there was no reason to believe, based upon the allegations in the affidavit, that evidence of any crime would be found there. In Joubert\u2019s view, the affidavit \u201cfail[ed] to establish the requisite temporal and geographical nexus linking [the] allegations [of sexual abuse and inappropriate conduct with minors] to whatever might exist on June 28, 2012 at 144 Fairmont Avenue in Manchester and to the VHS tapes here at issue.\u201d Mot. to Suppress (document no. 12) at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The court cannot agree. The basis for Joubert\u2019s argument is the absence of any allegations in the affidavit that he \u201cever engaged in any sexual or other misconduct at 144 Fairmont Avenue or anywhere else in Manchester,\u201d that he \u201crecorded any sexual contact by or toward anyone,\u201d including children, that he ever \u201cviewed, possessed, or collected child pornography,\u201d or that he \u201csexually assaulted or tried to sexually assault anyone anywhere after 2004.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 5. Yet there is little signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>canee to these facts. As the court explained in its oral ruling, the absence of any allegations that any sexual abuse occurred at the Fairmont Avenue property is immaterial, because the relevant question is not whether crimes have taken place at the property to be searched, but whether evidence of a crime might be found there. <em>See Hicks, </em>575 F.3d at 136. Similarly, the absence of allegations that Joubert had ever produced or viewed child pornography is immaterial, because\u2014as the court also noted at oral argument\u2014it was not evidence of the crime of producing or possessing child pornography that was sought, but evidence of the crime of felonious sexual assault, in the form of photographs, documents, or other evidence, that could corroborate or disprove the allegations that had been made against Joubert.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Joubert\u2019s claim that there are no allegations that he had \u201csexually assaulted or tried to sexually assault anyone anywhere after 2004\u201d is simply inaccurate. As discussed in the preceding section, EZ alleged that at one point some time between 2006 and 2009, when he was between 9 and 11 years old, Joubert \u201cmade a pass at him\u201d and \u201crepeatedly tried to touch [his] crotch area.\u201d But even if Joubert were correct, the absence of allegations of post-2004 abuse would be only marginally significant. To be sure, the passage of a significant amount of time between the date of alleged criminal activity and the date of the warrant application might, in some cases, reduce the likelihood that a search will turn up evidence of the crime. Courts confronted with suppression motions, however, \u201cdo not measure the timeliness of collected information mechanistically, merely counting the number of days elapsed.\u201d <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>87 F.3d 562, 568 (1st Cir.1996). \u201cRather, a number of integers must be factored into the calculus\u2014e.g., the nature of the information, the nature and characteristics of the supposed criminal activity, the nature and characteristics of the place to be searched, the nature of the items delineated in the warrant\u2014and the likely endurance of the information must be gauged on that basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Here, the nature of the items delineated in the warrant\u2014including photographs and other documents connecting Joubert to his accusers and to the sites of alleged abuse, such as Cooperstown, New York\u2014made it likely that those items would still be in existence and in Joubert\u2019s possession several years after the alleged incidents of abuse. As the court observed at the suppression hearing, the warrant affidavit included allegations that Joubert had taken numerous photographs or videos of a number of youths, including at least one of the alleged victims, and it is common for people to maintain copies of photographs and videos not only for years, but for decades. The likelihood that Joubert would have kept such materials in his possession for years after they were taken is only heightened by witness statements regarding Joubert\u2019s unusual interest in children. It is common, moreover, for people to keep personal materials such as photographs and videos at their home, which was the exact place the warrant sought to search.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The court therefore concludes that the affidavit, as submitted to the Circuit Court, established probable cause to believe that a crime had been committed and that evidence could be located at Joubert\u2019s residence in Manchester.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">B. Alleged omissions from the affidavit</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The court\u2019s conclusion that the affidavit established probable cause does not entirely resolve Joubert\u2019s motion. As noted at the outset, Joubert also argues that Detective Ford ran afoul of <em>Franks v. De</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>laware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), by intentionally or recklessly omitting material information from his affidavit. In that case, the Supreme Court observed that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s demand for \u201ca factual showing sufficient to comprise probable cause\u201d assumes \u201cthere will be a <em>truthful </em>showing ... in the sense that the information put forth is believed or appropriately accepted by the affiant as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164-65, 98 S.Ct. 2674 (emphasis in original; quotation marks omitted). Thus, where an affiant\u2019s \u201cperjury or reckless disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and, with the affidavit\u2019s false material set to one side, the affidavit\u2019s content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 98 S.Ct. 2674. This reasoning \u201clogically extends, as lower courts have recognized, to material omissions\u201d from the application. 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment </em>\u00a7 4.4(b), at 543-45 (4th ed. 2004); <em>see also, e.g., United States v. Castillo, </em>287 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Charles, </em>213 F.3d 10, 23 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Joubert charges that Detective Ford either intentionally or recklessly omitted four pieces of information from his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">\u2022 the fact that Joubert\u2019s 1994, 1999, and 2004 arrests did not result in criminal convictions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u2022 SJ\u2019s statement, during the interview that occurred after he delivered Joubert\u2019s computer to the police, that his belief that there was \u201cprobably\u201d child pornography on the computer was \u201cpurely an assumption on my part,\u201d and not based on his personal observation of child pornography in Joubert\u2019s possession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u2022 the fact that, during the recorded conversation with SJ, Joubert stated that \u201cnothing has happened with anyone\u201d and responded to SJ\u2019s statement that NT\u2019s accusation against Joubert was \u201cawfully similar to what happened to me\u201d with \u201cNo. No,\u201d both of which Joubert contends were denials that he had sexually abused SJ, contrary to what the affidavit claimed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u2022 SJ\u2019s 1996 conviction for forgery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">As the court explained in its oral ruling, it does not view the first three alleged \u201comissions\u201d as omissions at all, let alone intentional or reckless omissions. No extensive analysis is necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">\u2022 Where the affidavit did not identify the disposition of Joubert\u2019s arrests, no reasonable magistrate would conclude that those arrests had resulted in a conviction. To the contrary, the far more reasonable reading of the warrant affidavit is that the arrests had not resulted in convictions, an inference drawn from the absence of any allegation in the affidavit that Joubert had been convicted of any crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">\u2022 Along the same lines, where the affidavit did not state that SJ claimed to have seen child pornography in Joubert\u2019s possession, no reasonable magistrate would conclude that SJ\u2019s professed belief that Joubert\u2019s computer contained child pornography was anything other than \u201cpurely an assumption.\u201d In fact, the affidavit stated as much, noting that SJ said only that he \u201cstrongly suspected\u201d that there was child pornography on the computer \u201cbased on [Joubert\u2019s] actions, demeanor, and past history.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u2022 The affidavit\u2019s statement that \u201cin regards to the sexual abuse of SJ, Robert Joubert made no denials, apologized, and became emotional\u201d accurately characterizes the exchange between Joubert and SJ, which is excerpted in relevant part in Part I, <em>supra. </em>When read in the context of the entire conversation, Joubert\u2019s negative response to SJ\u2019s statement that NT\u2019s accusation was \u201cawfully similar to what happened to me\u201d and his statement that \u201c[Nothing has happened with anyone\u201d can only be understood as denials of accusations of sexual abuse made by other individuals, and not of SJ\u2019s accusation of sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The affidavit\u2019s treatment of these subjects was in no way untruthful or likely to mislead the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The court does agree with Joubert that the affidavit should have mentioned SJ\u2019s forgery conviction. While Detective Ford\u2019s omission of this information does not appear to be intentional, it was quite possibly reckless. As this court has previously explained, \u201c\u2018 recklessness may be inferred\u2019 \u201d if the omitted information \u201cconsisted of \u2018facts that any reasonable person would know that a judge would want to know when deciding whether to issue a warrant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Tanguay, </em>907 F.Supp.2d 165, 177 (D.N.H.2012) (quoting <em>Burke v. Town of Walpole, </em>405 F.3d 66, 82 (1st Cir.2005)). A conviction for a crime of dishonesty such as forgery \u201cis unquestionably a fact that any reasonable officer would consider critical\u201d to determining an informant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Indeed, Detective Ford testified at the suppression hearing that he would ordinarily inform the magistrate of an informant\u2019s forgery conviction when applying for a warrant (although he was less sure that he would include such information in a warrant affidavit), demonstrating his awareness that a magistrate would want such information. He offered no explanation for his failure to do that in this case, apart from speculating that\u2014despite his awareness that SJ had a criminal record\u2014 he had either not viewed that record before swearing out his affidavit, or simply \u201cbrowsed\u201d it. In such circumstances, Detective Ford\u2019s failure to apprise the magistrate of the forgery conviction might well be characterized as reckless (although that is not necessarily a foregone conclusion, <em>of id. </em>at 182-83 (rejecting argument that officer acted recklessly by not performing criminal records check on informant and including results in her warrant affidavit)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Even if the omission of SJ\u2019s forgery conviction from the affidavit was reckless, however, suppression of the fruits of the search is not warranted. Where information has been recklessly omitted from a warrant affidavit, \u201csuppression should be ordered only if the warrant application, ... clarified by disclosure of previously withheld material, no longer demonstrates probable cause.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>v. Stewart, </em>337 F.3d 103, 105 (1st Cir.2003). Here, even if the fact of SJ\u2019s forgery conviction had been disclosed to the magistrate, as it should have been, the warrant affidavit would still demonstrate probable cause for the search. Joubert suggests otherwise, arguing that the forgery conviction so undermines SJ\u2019s credibility that his claim that Joubert lived at the Fairmont Avenue property\u2014in Joubert\u2019s telling, the sole \u201cnexus\u201d between Joubert and that address\u2014could not be believed, thus depriving the magistrate of probable cause to believe that evidence would be found there. But, as the court noted at oral argument, at least one other fact related in the affidavit established Joubert\u2019s presence at the Fairmont Avenue property, namely, that the recorded conversation between SJ and Joubert took place there.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">That SJ and Joubert met and conversed at that property also bolstered SJ\u2019s credibility, insofar as it provided some objective verification of one of SJ\u2019s claims. <em>See United States v. Zayas-Diaz, </em>95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996) (identifying \u201cwhether some or all of the informant\u2019s factual statements were corroborated wherever reasonable and practicable\u201d as a factor affecting the probable cause determination). The affidavit also indicated that law enforcement corroborated several other factual claims that SJ had made, including that (1) Joubert\u2019s parents owned the Fairmont Avenue property, (2) Joubert had previously lived in Concord with MT\u2019s mother, and (3) Joubert \u201cspent a lot of time with\u201d MT. That these facts could all be independently verified also made it more probable than not that SJ was being truthful that Joubert was, at that time, living at the Fairmont Avenue property. Also enhancing SJ\u2019s credibility is the fact that he made no attempt to conceal his identity from the police, and in fact allowed them to record his conversation with Joubert while asking nothing in return. <em>See United States v. Croto, </em>570 F.3d 11, 14 (1st Cir.2009) (where witness identifies himself to law enforcement, that \u201cin itself bolsters [his] credibility because it opens [him] up for charges related to making a false report,\u201d particularly where witness \u201cwillingly provided the information and received nothing in return\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Given these indicia of reliability, inclusion of SJ\u2019s sixteen-year-old conviction for forgery in the affidavit would not have undermined the credibility of his claim that Joubert lived at the Fairmont Avenue property. The omission of the fact of that conviction from the affidavit did nothing to undermine the ample probable cause, discussed in the foregoing section, to believe that evidence of a crime would be found at that address. Joubert\u2019s motion must, therefore, be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Because the application for the warrant to search Joubert\u2019s residence and the VHS tapes therein, even when clarified by the facts that Detective Ford omitted, established probable cause to believe that evidence of a crime would be found in those locations, the court DENIED Joubert\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found during those searches.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-8\">. <em>See In re Mosley, </em>494 F.3d 1320, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (\"[A] lower court has jurisdiction to reduce its oral findings to writing even if a party has filed a notice of appeal in the interim.\u201d); 16A Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 3949.1, at 58-59 (4th ed. 2008) (after a notice of appeal is filed, a district court \u201cmay reduce to writing an earlier oral decision\u201d so long as it does \u201cnot alter the substance of the decision\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-15\">. The court relates here only those facts, and allegations in the warrant affidavit, that are relevant to its ruling on Joubert\u2019s motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. The affidavit also related that other interviewees familiar with Joubert due to his involvement in youth baseball had expressed concerns about Joubert's behavior, asserting, among other things, that Joubert had asked children to go camping and other places with him, alone; had attempted to contact 9- and 11-year-old boys on Facebook; had shown up uninvited at residences and events; and that, as late as 2008 and 2009, Joubert had been observed photographing juvenile players at baseball fields and tournaments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. Detective Ford\u2019s affidavit also related that MT\u2019s mother confirmed that she had been in a relationship with Joubert in the mid- to late 1990\u2019s, but claimed to have ended that relationship because Joubert was \"way too close\u201d with MT and she suspected that Joubert molested him. According to the affidavit, Joubert's adult son also stated that Joubert \"spent a lot of time with MT.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b97-14\">. The transcript of the recorded conversation uses \u201cS\u201d to refer to SJ, and \"R\u201d to refer to Joubert.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b100-5\">. Joubert did not contest the credibility of most of his accusers, so the court did not address that in its oral ruling. The court notes, however, that several factors contributed to the accusers\u2019 credibility. Among other things, the accusers, who were many different ages at the time they were interviewed by law enforcement\u2014ranging from 14 to 36-\u2014all claimed that Joubert had abused (or attempted to abuse) them when they were between the ages of 8 and 12. The incidents reported by several of the accusers were very similar in nature, insofar as they consisted of Joubert causing the alleged victims to masturbate him. In addition, other individuals corroborated certain details of the accusers\u2019 stories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">. Joubert also decries the manner in which Detective Ford's affidavit (1) characterizes Joubert\u2019s answers during an interview with law enforcement as \"evasive, confrontational, vague, and unresponsive\u201d and (2) suggests that Joubert \"inflated his history as a coach and an athlete.\u201d Mot. to Suppress (document no. 12) at 4. The court agrees with Joubert that these allegations add little, if anything, \"to the probable cause equation,\u201d <em>id.., </em>but even if they are disregarded entirely, that does not change the likelihood that evidence might be found at Joubert\u2019s residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\">. The court should note that Joubert\u2019s motion also mentions that SJ has a raft of other criminal convictions. None of those other convictions, however, was for a crime of dishonesty, and the Court of Appeals has held that \"[a] criminal record, no matter how lengthy, does not necessarily impugn one\u2019s veracity.\u201d <em>United States v. Rumney, </em>867 F.2d 714, 720-21 (1st Cir.1989). SJ\u2019s other convictions, then, are not the type of fact that \"any reasonable person would know that a judge would want to know when deciding whether to issue a warrant,\u201d and Detective Ford did not act recklessly, or even negligently, by omitting them from his affidavit. <em>See United States v. Adams, </em>305 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir.2002) (observing that an informant\u2019s crimes not involving false statements \u201chad at most a remote bearing on [his] credibility\u201d so that their omission from a warrant application did not support a <em>Franks </em>challenge).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b104-11\">.
