This suit was begun before a justice of the peace and taken to the Superior Court by appeal. In that court it was tried by a jury on a day of the December term, 1905, in the absence, of the defendant and his counsel, and a verdict rendered for the plaintiff for $58. Judgment was at once entered upon the verdict, and thereupon the defendant entered his motion to set aside the verdict and judgment, which motion was continued to the next term of the court. At the January term of the court the motion was denied, and from the judgment the defendant prayed for and was allowed an appeal to this court, which was duly perfected.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-5\" pgmap=\"376\">The only evidence given upon the trial was the testimony of the plaintiff, which was as follows:</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-6\" pgmap=\"376\">\u201cI went into the place of business of the defendant, a restaurant, on Madison street, near Fifth avenue, this city, on Sunday evening in the latter part of January, about 6 o\u2019clock. As I walked in one of the head waiters took my overcoat and hat and hung it some place, I don\u2019t know where, and showed me to a seat. I was in company with G. C. Strauss and we took dinner there. After dinner, when we were about ready to leave, one of the waiters looked for my overcoat and couldn\u2019t find it. The man who took my overcoat looked for it, and couldn\u2019t find it. There was an overcoat lost, and in it a pair of gloves, muffler and my hat.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-7\" pgmap=\"376\">The Court.

The judgment was not a \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d in the technical sense, until that motion was determined. The motion was not disposed of until the next ensuing term, the January term, 1906. The \u201cfinal judgment\u201d was therefore entered at the January term and the appeal taken at that term brings before us, not only the order denying the motion to set aside the judgment, but the judgment also. Hearson v. Graudine, 87 Ill., 115.</p> <p id=\"b376-13\" pgmap=\"376(12) 377(61)\">There was no written motion for a new trial, hut the bill of exceptions shows that such motion was made, denied and an exception taken hy the defendant, and this brings before us for review the question whether, upon the evidence, the motion for a new trial should have been granted.

Willard v. Petitt, 153 Ill., 663.</p> <p id=\"b377-5\" pgmap=\"377\">The plaintiff, according to his testimony, went to the restaurant of defendant to dine; as he entered the place, one of the head waiters of defendant took his hat and overcoat, plaintiff did not know what the waiter did with them, and after dinner the coat could not be found.</p> <p id=\"b377-6\" pgmap=\"377\">Upon this evidence, two questions arise: first, does it warrant and support a finding by the jury that the defendant was the bailee of the coat for the mutual benefit of the plaintiff and the defendant; and second, if he was such bailee, does the evidence warrant and support a finding by the jury that he was guilty of negligence owing to a want of reasonable care? We think the first question must be determined in favor of the plaintiff. It was so held in Ultzen v. Nicols (1894), 1 Q. B., 92, and Appleton v. Welch, 20 Misc., 343, 20 N. Y. S., 751, as between customer and restaurant keeper as to clothing delivered to a waiter; in Bunnell v. Stern, 122 N. Y., 539, as between customer and shopkeeper, as to a cloak laid on the counter by a customer, in order to try on a garment offered for sale by the shopkeeper; in Dilberto v. Harris, 95 Ga., 571, as between customer and owner of a barber shop, as to a hat placed by the customer on a hat rack while he was being shaved.

I. D. &amp; W. R. R. Co. v. Cohoon, 95 Ill. App., 92; Meisel v. Roos Company, 107 Ill. App., 179.</p> <p id=\"b378-8\" pgmap=\"378(244) 379(28)\">In the \u201cStatement\u201d in his brief, appellant urges, as a ground of reversal, that upon the affidavits; submitted after judgment, the court should have vacated the judgment and set aside the verdict, but this objection is not stated or referred to, either under the head of \u201cPoints and Authorities\u201d or \u201cArgument\u201d in the brief. The question is raised by the fourth assignment of error, and although argued only in the \u201cStatement,\u201d we think, must be treated as argued by appellant in his brief, and before us for determination. Upon a motion by the defendant to vacate a judgment and set aside a verdict, the affidavits must set out facts which, if true, constitute a defense to this action. The facts set out in the affidavit of defendant, which it is claimed constitute a defense to the action, are: that defendant had in his restaurant, hooks near the tables, on which guests could and should hang their hats and coats; that he had posted in his restaurant the following notices, printed in large letters: \u201cHot responsible for hats, coats and umbrellas\u201d; that affiant did not take possession of plaintiff\u2019s hat or coat, nor authorize his head waiter or any other waiter to accept hats or coats from guests; that he has not been able to find that any coat or hat was actually lost on his premises; that he has been unable to find any waiter who took possession of said coat or hat, and that defendant expects to prove that neither the head waiter nor any other waiter took said hat or coat from the plaintiff, as alleged..</p> <p id=\"b379-4\" pgmap=\"379\">The fact that the defendant had the notices mentioned in his affidavit, in his restaurant, is immaterial unless the plaintiff had knowledge or notice of such notices, and that he had such notice or knowledge is not stated in the affidavit. Again, if the defendant, through his servants, took possession and charge of plaintiff\u2019s coat and became a bailee thereof, his responsibility therefor could not be limited or affected by such notices, in the absence of proof that plaintiff consented to the terms stated in such notices.</p> <p id=\"b379-5\" pgmap=\"379\">The affidavit states that defendant did not authorize his head waiter or any waiter to accept hats or coats from guests, but does not state that he did not permit them to do so. For all that appears, it was the custom of waiters in defendant\u2019s restaurant,- as it is in other restaurants of the high class to which defendant\u2019s belongs, to take charge of the hats and wraps of guests when they entered the restaurant.</p> <p id=\"b379-6\" pgmap=\"379\">The fact that the defendant had not been able to find any waiter who took possession of plaintiff\u2019s coat, and his statement that he expected to prove that no waiter took said hat or coat, did not meet plaintiff\u2019s testimony that a waiter took his hat and coat as he entered the restaurant.</p> <p id=\"b379-7\" pgmap=\"379\">We think that the facts set out in defendant\u2019s affidavit do not constitute a defense to the action, and that therefore the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and set aside the verdict upon the affidavits filed.</p> <p id=\"b379-8\" pgmap=\"379\">The judgment of the Superior Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b379-9\" pgmap=\"379\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
