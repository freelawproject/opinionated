There is no bill of exceptions, nor any thing in the record from which we can learn what the subject matter of the suit was, or for what cause it was dismissed. We are therefore of opinion that the Circuit Court erred in giving judgment against the defendant below, for costs. If the cause was dismissed for the want of jurisdiction in the Court, it should have been dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff; or if it was on the plaintiff\u2019s own motion, that his cause was dismissed, it ought to have been done at his costs.</p> <p id=\"b327-4\" pgmap=\"327\">The judgment below is therefore reversed at the costs of the appellee.</p> <p id=\"b327-5\" pgmap=\"327\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
