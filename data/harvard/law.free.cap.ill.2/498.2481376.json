It appears from the record, that there were several pleas upon which issue to the country was taken, and that the sixth plea, mentioned in this assignment, was a plea of release of the action mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. To this plea the plaintiff below replied that the release mentioned in the plea was not his deed, and tendered an issue to the country. After filing the demurrer, the record states, that the parties then agreed that both matters of law and fact arising in this cause, may be tried by the Court, and after hearing the evidence and arguments of counsel, the Court gave judgment for the plaintiff below, for his damages, without expressly overruling the demurrer. Was this omission error ? The replication was clearly a sufficient answer to the defendant\u2019s plea, and the demurrer was improperly interposed. The Circuit Court, doubtless, so considered it, and treated it as a nullity. By so doing, the defendant has sustained no possible injury, and the only effect of reversing the judgment below and remanding the cause, would be to require the Circuit Court to decide a demurrer which this Court perceives must be overruled. To reverse a judgment for such trifling informalities, where no possible injury can result to the party, would be a perversion of judicial proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b499-4\" pgmap=\"499\">The judgment below is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b499-5\" pgmap=\"499\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b499-6\" pgmap=\"499\">Note.
