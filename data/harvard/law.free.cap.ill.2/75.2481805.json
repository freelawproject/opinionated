On the trial before the Court of Probate, the administrator exhibited his account current, showing a balance in his hands, of $190,63f, belonging to the heirs. The plaintiffs then proved that in addition to said balance of $&gt;190,63f-, McBride, as administrator, had obtained three notes made to said Wilson, the intestate, in his lifetime, by one John Kingley, of Washington county, Virginia, and amounting, with interest, to more than $800, and that said McBride, through his agent, one Charles Tate, had collected said notes, and that said Tate had appropriated the money to his own use, and that he, Tate, was insolvent, and unable to pay the amount to McBride. That McBride acted honestly, and in good faith, in sending said notes to said Tate; and before he sent them, he consulted with William C. Greenup, clerk of the County Commissioners\u2019 Court of Randolph county, and was by him advised to send the notes to Tate for collection, but that he had no personal knowledge of said Tate. That Tate, when the notes were sent \u2022 to him, or about the time, was reputed to be in solvent circumstances, and had been, or was then, sheriff of Washington county. The Court of Probate, on this state of facts, decided that McBride was not liable for any part of this money so collected by Tate, to the heirs and distributees of said Wilson, deceased. To which opinion, a bill of exceptions was tendered by said Christy and wife, and signed, and an appeal taken to the Circuit Court of Randolph county, where said judgment of the Court of Probate was affirmed, and a bill of exceptions tendered and signed, and the case brought to this Court by appeal. The cause was heard in the Circuit Court before the Hon. Theophilus W. Smith, at the September term, 1831.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-5\" pgmap=\"76\">S.

The administrator would be liable, without doubt, if he had gotten this money into his own possession, and the case is not altered by its being in the possession of a person of his own selection, who proves dishonest.

The loss of the money having happened by the act of the administrator, who ought to have used more than ordinary caution, it is more conformable to the principles of right and justice, that he should lose, than that the heirs and distributees should incur \u2022 a loss, though he may not have been guilty of fraud.

The evidence shows that McBride did not take the same care, or use the same caution, in regard to the notes, that a moderately careful man takes of his own affairs, and he is therefore liable for ordinary neglect.

The only cases known to the law, where an executor or administrator is discharged for losses, are, where he may be robbed, or where the stock falls, or funds fail, in which he, with good faith, has invested the funds of the estate, or where, acting in compliance with law, a loss inevitably happens. 1 Dane\u2019s Abr. 270, 271; 4 Caines\u2019 Cas. in Error 96; 5 Vesey, Jr. 794, 800.</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\" pgmap=\"77\">11.

Administrations,-though they may be trusts coupled with an interest, are in some sense agencies, and are more like other agencies under our laws than they were formerly under the laws of England, or now are. These trusts, for the purposes of argument, and so far as the- present case is considered, may be regarded as agencies with discretionary power. The law is, that \u201cif a discretionary power be allowed to an agent, he is bound to act according to the best of his judgment for the benefit of his employer.\u201d 1 Wash. C. C. R. 455.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-6\" pgmap=\"78\">\u201c A factor is bound to ordinary diligence in relation to the property confided to him; where his orders leave the management of the property to his discretion, he is bound only to good faith and reasonable conduct.\u201d 2 Gallis. 13.</p> <opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b78-7\" pgmap=\"78\">Smith, Justice,</author> <p id=\"Acp\" pgmap=\"78\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b78-8\" pgmap=\"78\">In this case the only question to be determined is the liability of the administrator for the amount of the notes collected of the debtor of the intestate, (who resided in Virginia,) through his agent, and the misapplication of those funds by the agent, after collection. It is contended, by the appellants, that by law an administrator is responsible if his agent embezzle the assets of the estate; and that the funds being used by Tate, who afterwards became insolvent, is equivalent to an embezzlement; and that therefore the administrator, in the present case, is liable. The case cited in support of this principle, and referred to in Toller, and in Dane\u2019s Abridgment, is not borne .out in the case in 6 Modern, to which they refer. The only question decided by the Court, and the only one before them, was a question of costs; and as the party might in that case, have sued, without describing himself as administrator, it was held he should pay costs. It is admitted, and the facts in this case show, that the administrator has acted prudently and honestly; that his agent at the time he was employed, was a person of reputation and property; and although he became afterwards insolvent, and used the money collected, there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the administrator in the use of the proper means to collect the money of his agent. If an administrator has acted for the benefit of the estate, used proper diligence, and acted with ordinary care and circumspection in the discharge of his trust, he ought not to be held answerable for losses which could not have been foreseen, and which ordinary precaution may not guard against. The general principle which seems to run through all the authorities, as to his liability, recognise the doctrine, that if he acts honestly and prudently, though there be a loss to, or diminution of, the testator\u2019s estate or rights, he will not be liable.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b79-3\" pgmap=\"79\">Where there is manifest fidelity and ordinary diligence displayed, the rigid rules of law will be reluctantly enforced.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Another view might be taken of the case: the administrator could not, in his fiduciary character, have sued these notes unless he had taken out letters of administration in Virginia. It no where appears that he did so; but the case shows, on the contrary, that the debt must have been collected in the name of the agent. Until the administrator had received the money, could it be considered as assets in his hands ? and is he chargeable at all, in his representative character, until this appears ? Whether he would be personally liable under a supposed interference with the collection of debts not warranted by his character of administrator, out of this State, it is not proper now to deter-. mine. But we very much doubt whether he was legally bound to have made the collection of the notes in Virginia; and if not compellable so to do, may not the parties, in the present instance, have mistaken their remedy ?</p> <p id=\"b79-6\" pgmap=\"79\">On a review of the whole case, and considering the powers of the Probate Court to adjust settlements like the present, upon the broad principles of equity, we are of opinion that the Circuit Court did not err in affirming the judgment of the Court of Probate, and that the judgment of the Circuit Court be affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b79-8\" pgmap=\"79\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b78-9\" pgmap=\"78\"> 1 Dane\u2019s Abridg. 590; Toller\u2019s Ex. 481; 1 P.
