The seal to the summons was omitted by mistake. The summons was returned by the sheriff, with the following endorsement: \u201c Executed October 23d, 1837. J. Stockwell, Shff.\u201d The defendant in the Court below moved to quash the summons because it was not under seal. This motion was overruled by the Court, and judgment rendered for the appellee, for want of a plea, for $175 and costs. The appellant excepted to the opinion of the Court overruling his motion, and tendered a bill of exceptions which was signed and sealed by the Court.

This motion the Court overruled, and the defendant making no further defence, judgment by default was rendered against him.</p> <p id=\"b395-12\" pgmap=\"395\">The statute authorizing a summons to issue in a case like the present is explicit, as to the manner of its authentication. It declares in express terms, that it shall be under the seal of the Court; and as the defendant did not by his appearance or otherwise, dispense with this requisite of the statute, and the defect appearing upon the face of the process, the Court should have sustained the motion and quashed the summons.</p> <p id=\"b395-13\" pgmap=\"395\">The judgment of the Court below, is therefore reversed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b395-14\" pgmap=\"395\">Judgment reversed.</p> <p id=\"b395-15\" pgmap=\"395\">Note.
