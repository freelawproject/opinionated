On the trial of the cause, the plaintiffs offered in evidence, to prove the existence of the corporation, a paper purporting to be a copy of their, charter, to which was appended,\u2014 first, a certificate by B. Hinkson, Secretary of State, declaring that the foregoing act is a correct copy of the original roll thereof remaining on file in the office of the Secretary of State, at Columbus, in Ohio; secondly, a certificate of Robert Lucas, Governor of the State of Ohio, declaring that B. Hinkson, by whom the act thereto attached, appears to have been certified, was at the date of the certificate, the acting Secretary of State in and for the. State of Ohio, and that his official acts are entitled to full faith and credit; to which latter certificate is attached the Great Seal of the State of Ohio.</p> <p id=\"b425-15\" pgmap=\"425\">To the introduction of this paper thus certified, as evidence, the defendant objected, and the Court sustained the objection.</p> <p id=\"b425-16\" pgmap=\"425\">The plaintiffs now assign the exclusion of this paper from the jury for error.</p> <p id=\"b425-17\" pgmap=\"425(45) 426(200)\">In considering the correctness of this decision, it is proper to look at the act of Congress directing in what manner the acts of the legislatures of the several States shall be authenticated. This act has declared that these acts shall be authenticated by having the seal of their respective States affixed thereto. The paper offered in evidence is not so authenticated. The seal of the State, it appears, by this certificate of the Governor, is affixed for the purpose only of adding verity to the fact declared in his certificate, that B. Hinkson is Secretary of the State of Ohio, and that full faith and credit are due to his official acts; not that the facts declared in the Secretary\u2019s certificate, are true. This is not a compliance with the proA\u00dasions of the act of Congress, which manifestly intended that the seal should be affixed, for the purpose of authenticating the act, and that the transcript thereof was an exact copy of the laAv passed by the State legislature. However much it may be regretted that objections, technical in their nature, are to prevail in cases like the present, the Court cannot depart from the plain and obvious provisions of the law. It has no discretion to dispense with the forms prescribed; and parties who offer testimony, the manner of authenticating which is thus provided, must conform to the mandates of the law. The Court below properly rejected the paper offered.</p> <p id=\"b426-5\" pgmap=\"426\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b426-6\" pgmap=\"426\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b426-7\" pgmap=\"426\">The plaintiffs in error filed the following petition for a rehearing:</p> <p id=\"b426-8\" pgmap=\"426\">To the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, December term, 1837.</p> <p id=\"b426-9\" pgmap=\"426\">The President, Directors, &amp; Co. of the La Fayette \\ Bank of Cincinnati v.

That the evidence presented does in fact show a compliance with the law'of the United States, and the decisions of the Courts thereupon. 1 Laws U. S. 102; Gordon\u2019s Digest 142 note a; 2 Peters\u2019 Cond. R. 30, in notes; 3 Idem. 305 notes; Amadey v. U. S., 6 Peters\u2019 Cond. R.; 1 Blackford 159.</p> <p id=\"b426-14\" pgmap=\"426\">3. That the appending the Great Seal is not invalidated by the cumulative certificates, and the verification of additional facts, besides the truth of the record.</p> <p id=\"b426-15\" pgmap=\"426\">3. That one of the facts certified by the Secretary, is, that the exemplification is a correct copy of the roll on file in his office.</p> <p id=\"b426-16\" pgmap=\"426(12) 427(24)\">4. That by the constitution of Ohio, the Governor is the keeper of the Great Seal, and his affixing of it to the certificate, is intended, and does in fact, verify all that is certified.</p> <p id=\"b427-5\" pgmap=\"427\">5. That the evidence was admissible by the rules of the common law.</p> <p id=\"b427-6\" pgmap=\"427\">6. That the judgment below is erroneous for matter apparent on its face, besides the rejection of the testimony. 1 Chitty 405.</p> <p id=\"b427-7\" pgmap=\"427\">For these and other reasons that might be urged we pray a re-hearing.</p> <p id=\"b427-8\" pgmap=\"427\">Alfred Cowles.</p> <p id=\"b427-9\" pgmap=\"427\">S.

And such records and judicial proceedings, so authenticated, shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States, as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from whence the said records are, or shall be taken.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> 1 Story\u2019s U.
