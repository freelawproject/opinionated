Deal. That affiant understood and believed that the suit was commenced by Compher and Deal, of which firm Philip G. Deal was a partner, and with which firm he had had dealings, and against whom he had a set-off. That affiant never had any transactions with Deal individually, and owed him nothing. That the affiant left the State, on business, before the session of the April term of the Court, 1835, to which the summons in said suit \u00bbwas returnable, and did not return until after said term had passed. That he employed an attorney residing at Peoria, to attend to his defence in the suit of Compher and Deal against him, but the said attorney, in consequence of the mistake in the title of the cause, or for some other reason unknown to the affiant, neglected to attend to his defence. That before affiant left, he filed a statement of his set-off against Compher and Deal, with the clerk of the Peoria Circuit Court, and made affidavit of its correctness. That at the said April term of said Court, a judgment was rendered by default against him in said cause of Deal against him, for $239,83j. That Compher and Deal are insolvent. That an injunction had been granted, staying the proceedings on said judgment; but, owing to some informality in the bond, said injunction had been dissolved by the Peoria Circuit Court. That affiant was indebted to Compher and Deal in the sum of #28,79j, upon the same account upon which judgment was recovered by Deal, and no more; and that said judgment is unjust, except for the sum of #28,7 9; and moved the Court to set aside the default in said cause, and vacate said judgment in the Peoria Circuit Court.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b327-11\" pgmap=\"327\">E.
