On the return of the summons, the parties appeared, and by agreement the cause was continued for a few days, at the expiration of which the justice rendered judgment for the plaintiff for $86,81 and costs. The defendant appealed to the Circuit Court, and at the April term, 1839, the Hon. John Pearson, presiding, the defendant moved the Court to dismiss the suit and reverse the judgment of the justice of the peace, for want of jurisdiction in the justice. The motion was resisted by the plaintiff, but sustained by the Court, and the cause dismissed, and a judgment for costs rendered against the plaintiff, who excepted to the opinion of the Court, and tendered his bill of exceptions, which was signed and sealed by the Court. The cause was brought to this Court by writ of error.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-5\" pgmap=\"576\">J. Y.

The plaintiff, Hugunin, excepted to the opinion of the Court in dismissing the suit, and assigns for error the dismission of the suit, and giving judgment for costs for the defendant. The summons issued by the justice, was to answer for a failure to pay the plaintiff a demand not exceeding one hundred dollars. The transcript of the justice shows an account of debits amounting to @909,00, and credits to the amount of @833,19, and a balance of @86,81 struck in favor of the plaintiff. The words of the statute of 2d March, 1833,<footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> are \u201c although said debt or demand may have been originally over one hundred dollars and reduced below that sum by fair credits \u201d &amp;c. It appears, in this case that the demand far exceeded one hundred dollars, but was reduced by credits appearing on the account, to a sum within the jurisdiction of the magistrate. No evidence was adduced showing that the credit was given solely for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction, as appears by the bill of exceptions. We are to presume the credits were fair, until the contrary is shown, which has not been. The judgment of the Circuit'Court of Cook County is reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to the Circuit Court to be tried de novo.</p> <p id=\"b576-10\" pgmap=\"576\">Judgment reversed.</p> <p id=\"b576-11\" pgmap=\"576\">Note.
