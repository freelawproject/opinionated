A legal conclusion of the suit must be shown.

Gay. The declaration originally contained but one count, which averred that the plaintiff in error, \u201c as agent of John H. Gay,\u201d on the 16th day of January, 1832, complained maliciously, and without any probable cause for so doing, before the clerk of the Circuit Court of Marion county, that the defendants in error were indebted to said John H. Gay, in the sum of @600, and were about to depart from this State, with the intention of having their effects and personal estate removed without the limits of the same, and thereby obtained a writ of attachment against them, &amp;c., and by virtue of which the sheriff of said county attached sundry articles of personal property of the defendants in error, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and that afterwards, to wit, at the following March term of said Court, said attachment was quashed, &amp;c. The plaintiff in error demurred to the declaration, and the demurrer was overruled by the Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-11\" pgmap=\"30\">The defendants in error then amended their declaration by adding another count, like the first, except that the words \u201c as agent of John H. Gay,\u201d were not inserted. To this second count, the plaintiff in error pleaded not guilty. The cause was tried at the September term, 1832, of the Marion Circuit Court, before the Hon. Thomas C. Browne and a jury, and judgment rendered against the plaintiff in error for fifty dollars and costs. From this judgment he prosecuted a writ of error to this Court.</summary><summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-12\" pgmap=\"30\">On the trial in the Court below, the record of the suit of John H.

Gay, and suing out of said Court an attachment against their goods and chattels. The summons in this cause was issued on the 16th Jan., 1832. The declaration states that the attachment was issued on the 16th Jan., 1832, and that afterwards, at the March term, 1832, of said Circuit Court, the attachment was quashed and dismissed, being found \u201cto be causeless, vexatious, and sued without any colour of law to warrant the same.\u201d On the trial of the cause, the plaintiff below offered in evidence the record in the suit of John H. Gay against the defendants, to prove the making of the complaint, the issuing of the attachment, and the dismissal of the same; to the introduction of which record, the defendant below objected; but the Court overruled the objection, and suffered the record to be given in evidence to the jury. To the reception of which testimony, the defendant below excepted, and the cause is brought into this Court by agreement of the parties.</p> <p id=\"b32-5\" pgmap=\"32\">Although other questions were raised in the Court below, yet it is necessary only to decide whether the record given in evidence to the jury was admissible. On this point the doctrine is well settled, that an action for malicious prosecution cannot be brought before the first suit has been legally determined; and it must be averred, that the former suit terminated in the present plaintiff\u2019s favor, and a legal conclusion of the suit must be shown; and if the suit be not proved to have been determined in the manner alleged, it is a ground of nonsuit.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The issuing of a summons is the commencement of a suit; and, consequently, the record received in evidence, was inadmissible, as it would, if it were the record of the proceedings mentioned in the declaration, prove the termination of the former suit to have been long after the commencement of this suit. Such a fact could not contribute to support the action, and consequently the record ought to have been rejected. For this error the judgment must be reversed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b32-6\" pgmap=\"32\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b32-12\" pgmap=\"32\"> See notes to 2 Chitty 603, and the authorities there cited.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
