He thereupon pleaded not guilty, and the jury found him \u201c guilty of an assault and battery.\u201d The defendant then moved to be discharged, \u201cfor the reason that the jury did not assess the fine.\u201d This motion was overruled.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-10\" pgmap=\"286\">The Court then sentenced him to pay a fine of $20, and to be imprisoned twenty days, and to pay the costs of the prosecution, and to be committed until the said fine and costs should be fully paid.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-11\" pgmap=\"286\">On the trial, the following bill of exceptions was taken :</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-12\" pgmap=\"286\">\u201c Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, the Attorney General, in behalf of the People, called a witness, who was sworn, and among other things stated that the defendant threw a stone or brickbat at him; to which statement going to the jury in evidence, the defendant by his attorney objected, which objection was overruled by the Court, to which opinion of the Court the defendant excepts. The defendant by his attorney also asked the Court to give to the jury the following instructions:</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b286-13\" pgmap=\"286\">1. That they must believe that the proof corresponds with the allegations of the indictment, strictly, in every material point, otherwise they must acquit.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-4\" pgmap=\"287\">2.

The indictment should have been quashed,</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-11\" pgmap=\"287\">1. Because the offence is an attempt to commit a felony, and the indictment does not allege it to have been done unlawfully and feloniously.</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-12\" pgmap=\"287\">The criminal intent must accompany the act, and from the intention alone is it determinable whether the act be criminal or innocent: it is alone punishable, being the very gist of the charge, and certain technical words alone express that intention, according to the different degrees of guilt, and they cannot be supplied by any circumlocution. 1 East\u2019s C. L. 446-7; 1 Chit. C. L. 231, C; Curtis v. The People, Breese 197; and brief in case of Reuben Clark v. The People, and the authorities there cited.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-13\" pgmap=\"287\">In precedents of indictments for this offence, it is charged to have been done unlawfully and feloniously. Chit. C. L.</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-14\" pgmap=\"287\">2. Because there is uncertainty in describing the offence committed, and the manner of its commission.</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-15\" pgmap=\"287\">With the single exception that an indictment cannot be amended, all the rules that apply to civil pleadings, apply with increased force and greater strictness, to criminal; and an indictment should\u2019 be as certain, clear, and explicit, as a declaration. 1 Sand. 250 and n. 1; 1 Chit.

The Court erred in permitting evidence to be given to the jury, that the defendant threw stones and brickbats at Jacob C. Bruner, and struck him therewith, under the indictment, which charged that he struck B. with a certain stone and brickbat, which he held in his right band.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-5\" pgmap=\"288\">I.

The Court had no right to give judgment against the defendant, on a conviction of assault and battery, and should have discharged him.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-7\" pgmap=\"288\">1. Justices of the peace have exclusive original jurisdiction in such cases. R. L. 410 \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-8\" pgmap=\"288\">2. The Common Law of Great Britain with regard to criminal matters, is not in force in this State. R.

The courts of this State cannot obtain jurisdiction by common law, directly or indirectly, of any matter of which their jurisdiction is taken away by statute. R. L. 410 \u00a7 178.(1)</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-10\" pgmap=\"288\">IV. The Court erred in giving a judgment of fine and imprisonment against defendant, and that he should stand committed until fine and costs were paid.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-11\" pgmap=\"288\">1. The offence is defined by the Criminal Code, and should have been punished as therein provided. R. L. 180<footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark> \u00a7 51, 52, and 53; R. L. 209 \u00a7 159.<footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> </p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-12\" pgmap=\"288\">2. If the Court had no jurisdiction in this case by the common law, they had no power to sentence defendant to imprisonment until fine and costs were paid. R. L. 239 \u00a7 163.<footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark> </p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-13\" pgmap=\"288\">3. The whole course of legislation in this State, shows that imprisonment never was intended to be inflicted as a portion of the penalty for assaults and batteries. R. L. 402, 411 \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark> </p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-14\" pgmap=\"288\">V. The/wry, in finding a person guilty of assault and battery, should assess the fine, and in such cases the Court has no discretionary power. R. L. 403<footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark> \u00a7 6, 411<footnotemark>(11)</footnotemark> \u00a7 12. The Court therefore erred in this case in fixing the amount of fine, which should have been assessed by the jury, if they had the power to find the defendant guilty of the offence.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-15\" pgmap=\"288\">The legislature, in providing punishments for crimes, seem to have intended, in most cases, that the measure of punishment should be determined by the jury.

On the trial the defendant was convicted of an assault and battery; and the Court below gave judgment. The only point necessary to be decided, is, whether the indictment is sufficient. In the case of Henry Curtis v. The People,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> this very point was made, and it was held that it was necessary \u201c That the intent should not only be charged to be in itself malicious and unlawful, but that the felonious design and extent of the crime intended to be perpetrated, should be distinctly set forth, otherwise the inference would be, that the assault might be excusable or justifiable.\u201d For this defect in the indictment, the judgment below must be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b289-5\" pgmap=\"289\">Judgment reversed.</p> <footnote label=\"(1)\"> <p id=\"b289-14\" pgmap=\"289\"> Breese 197.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
