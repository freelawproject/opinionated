Judgment was rendered by the justice in favor of the plaintiffs, the defendants in this Court. The defendant appealed to the Circuit Court, where the cause was tried, and the judgment affirmed, at the June term, 1839, for @35,26 and costs, the Hon. Samuel H. Treat presiding. The cause was brought to this Court by writ of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-12\" pgmap=\"577\">Upon the trial in the Court below, the following bill of exceptions was taken:</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-13\" pgmap=\"577\">\u201c Be it remembered, that on the trial of this cause, the plaintiffs produced a witness who testified that when the goods were bought, a memorandum of the transaction was made upon the plaintiffs\u2019 books, and the clerk of the plaintiffs then produced a copy of the memorandum, which was filed, and is herewith made a part of the record in this cause:</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-14\" pgmap=\"577\">(P.

The defendants then moved the Court to dismiss the suit, and reverse the judgment below, because the contract appeared to have been made between the defendant in connection with P. M. Brown, and the credit was given to the two, and not to either one of them, and because the plaintiffs appeared to be a party to the original bet or contract; all of which motions were overruled by the Court, and the Court proceeded to render judgment for the plaintiffs for the amount of the judgment below: To all of which opinions of the Court, the defendant, by his attorney, excepts, and prays that this, his bill of exceptions, may be signed, sealed, and made part of the record in this cause, and which is ordered to be done.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\" pgmap=\"578\">Saml.

The Court erred in deciding that the plaintiff could sustain a suit against Lurton upon the contract proven, without joining Brown as co-defendant.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-10\" pgmap=\"578\">3d. The Court erred in rendering judgment upon the contract proven, the same being against good policy, unlawful and void, being a bet to which both plaintiff and defendant were parties.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-11\" pgmap=\"578\">4th.

That Brown and Lurton should have been joined in the action, the credit being joint.</p> <p id=\"b578-19\" pgmap=\"578\">2d. That the defendants in error were parties to an illegal contract.</p> <p id=\"b579-4\" pgmap=\"579\">3d. That the evidence offered to prove the result of the election, being the State paper, was inadmissible as evidence.</p> <p id=\"b579-5\" pgmap=\"579\">4th. That the addition of interest to the principal, ought not to have been allowed.</p> <p id=\"b579-6\" pgmap=\"579\">The first objection is not good. If the parties were only jointly liable, the plaintiff in error should have pleaded that matter in abatement. But the contract was manifestly in severalty.</p> <p id=\"b579-7\" pgmap=\"579\">From the facts disclosed by the bill of exceptions, it appears that the contract for the cloth, although a contingent one as to the ultimate liability of the one or the other of the parties, was to be absolute, as to the party who should lose the bet. The purchase was made and the credit given, after the consummation of the bet.</p> <p id=\"b579-8\" pgmap=\"579\">It does not appear that the defendants in error were in any way parties to the bet, or encouraged it; and we do not perceive that their contract for the sale and delivery of the cloth, was tainted with a participation in the original agreement between the parties. Their mere knowledge of it could not certainly connect them with it; and having parted with their property under the arrangement, common honesty surely requires that the party at whose instance it was delivered, conformably to his agreement, should be held answerable for the value of the mer-' chandise delivered. Money loaned to be used in gaming, could heretofore have been recovered back at common law, but it is now prohibited by the statute against gaming.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b579-9\" pgmap=\"579\">It is not now necessary to go into the various reasons given for the decisions which have prevailed in courts, relative to gaming contracts, because this contract cannot be considered contra bonos mores, or against sound policy. The case in 4th Johnson, of Bum v. Rucker, has no affinity to the present action. The State Register, being made by law the public paper in which the official acts of the Governor required to be made public, are to be published, was evidence of the existence of the Proclamation, and the facts stated in it, until the contrary was shown. On the question of interest, we are of opinion that it was properly allowed. The statute giving interest on all liquidated accounts, embraces the case directly.</p> <p id=\"b579-10\" pgmap=\"579\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p> <p id=\"b579-11\" pgmap=\"579\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b579-12\" pgmap=\"579\">Note.
