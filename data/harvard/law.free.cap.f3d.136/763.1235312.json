Young, </em>115 F.3d 834, 836 (11th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 727, 139 L.Ed.2d 666 (1998). This Court reviews the application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>51 F.3d 1004, 1011 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 900, 116 S.Ct. 258, 133 L.Ed.2d 182 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs, sentencing transcript, PSI, and other relevant portions of the record, and consideration of the arguments of the parties, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Although this court has not specifically addressed enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3), it has held that an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(l) for possession of material involving a minor who is prepubescent or under the age of 12 requires the government to show that the defendant intended to receive such material. <em>United States v. Cole, </em>61 F.3d 24, 24 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Saylor, </em>959 F.2d 198, 200 (11th Cir.1992))).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">The Fifth Circuit has found that enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) has an intent requirement. In <em>United States v. Kimbrough, </em>69 F.3d 723, 734 (5th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>517 U.S. 1157, 116 S.Ct. 1547, 134 L.Ed.2d 650 (1996), the court found that pictures of a minor female in bondage downloaded onto the defendant\u2019s computer were sufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant had intentionally ordered and possessed pornography that depicted sadistic or masochistic conduct. In <em>United States v. Canada, </em>110 F.3d 260, 264 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 195, 139 L.Ed.2d 133 (1997), the court found an enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) was supported by evidence of sadistic material and active trading in child pornography was found on the hard drive of the defendant\u2019s computer.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">We adopt the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit and find that intent is a necessary requirement of a \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) enhancement, and find that there was sufficient evidence that Tucker intended to possess material depicting minors involved in sadistic, masochistic, or other violent acts. Tucker concedes that pictures of minors in bondage were located on the hard drive of his computer. The government introduced Internet conversations taken from Tucker\u2019s computer which showed that while he was looking for pictures he stated that he was into \u201cyoung action\u201d and would \u201clike to start trading (3)27\u201d and introduced a listing of Internet conversations documenting Tucker\u2019s trading of such images.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">We conclude that the district court properly assessed Tucker a four-level enhancement for intending to possess material depicting minors involved in sadistic, masochistic, or other violent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
