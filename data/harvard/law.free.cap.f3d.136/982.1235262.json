She contends that the district court erred in applying United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2B5.3 and 2F1.1 to calculate her sentence. For the following reasons, we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines and therefore affirm Cho\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Cho and her husband owned a business in Houston, Texas, called C &amp; S Design Handbag and Luggage (\u201cC &amp; S\u201d) from around 1992 to 1996. United States Customs agents began surveillance at C &amp; S in 1995 based on information that C &amp; S had received counterfeit merchandise from a company in Philadelphia. The agents subsequently received permission to search two nearby business suites used as storage space by C &amp; S. The agents found counterfeit merchandise in each suite valued at over $99,000 and $27,000, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">In May, 1996, a confidential informant went into C &amp; S and talked to Cho about purchasing counterfeit goods. The Cl subsequently purchased two counterfeit Dooney &amp; Bourke handbags and one counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbag for $50. On June 12, 1996, the agents executed a search warrant at C <em>&amp; </em>S. They seized 9,257 pieces of counterfeit merchandise with an estimated retail value between $76,000 and $125,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">Cho pled guilty to two counts of trafSeking in counterfeit goods in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2320(a). The district judge sentenced Cho under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3, which mandates a base offense level of six. The judge determined that $123,921 was the retail value of the counterfeit merchandise for which Cho could be held accountable. Because the retail value of the \u201cinfringing items\u201d exceeded $2,000, \u00a7 2B5.3(b)(l) directed the judge to \u201cincrease [Cho\u2019s offense level] by the corresponding number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).\u201d The judge then applied the above amount ($123,921) to the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 and increased Cho\u2019s offense level by seven levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)(H). Because the district judge awarded Cho a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, her total offense level was eleven. The court sentenced Cho to two concurrent fourteen-month terms of imprisonment, two concurrent three-year terms of supervised release, restitution in the amount of $6,633.95, and a special assessment .of $200. The court then granted Cho\u2019s motion for leave to file an out-of-time appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3, \u201cCriminal Infringement of Copyright or Trademark,\u201d directs a sentencing court to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by the corresponding number of levels from the Fraud and Deceit table in \u00a7 2F1.1, but only \u201c[i]f the retail value of the infringing items exeeed[s] $2,000.\u201d The Fraud and Deceit table in \u00a7 2F1.1, however, is calibrated in terms of \u201closs,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rather than \u201cretail value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">Cho argues that, once the infringing items cross the $2,000 \u201cretail value\u201d threshold of \u00a7 2B5.3, a sentencing court should then, according to \u2022 the plain language of \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> calculate the \u201closs\u201d resulting from Cho\u2019s trademark infringement. That figure (\u201closs\u201d) and <em>not </em>the retail value of the infringed items, Cho contends, should determine her enhancement under the \u00a7 2F1.1 table.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">The district court disagreed. Relying on \u00a7 1B1.5, the Commentary to \u00a7 2B5.3, and our decision in <em>United States v. Kim, </em>963 F.2d 65, 67-8 (5th Cir.1992), the district judge found that the reference in \u00a7 2B5.3 to the \u00a7 2F1.1 table refers only to the dollar amounts and their corresponding levels and does not incorporate the subsection\u2019s reliance on \u201closs.\u201d The court therefore used the retail value of the counterfeited items in applying the \u00a7 2F1.1 table and enhancing Cho\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its application of the guidelines to the facts for clear error. <em>United States v. Shano, </em>955 F.2d 291, 294 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>946 F.2d 23, 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>(5th Cir.1991). A sentence imposed under the guidelines will be upheld on appeal unless the defendant demonstrates that the sentence was imposed in violation of the law, was imposed due to an incorrect application of the guidelines, or was outside the applicable guideline range and was unreasonable. <em>See Shano, </em>955 F.2d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">The Background Commentary to \u00a7 2B5.3 strongly supports the Government\u2019s position that the retail value of the infringing items should determine the \u00a7 2F1.1 enhancement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-5\">This guideline treats copyright and trademark violations much like fraud. <em>Note that the enhancement is based on the value of the infringing items, which will generally exceed the loss or gain due to the offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B5.3, comment. (baekg\u2019d)(em-phasis added). Cho argues that the Background Note is \u201csimply a clarification of \u00a7 2B5.3 and emphasizes that the sentencing court is to use the retail value of the infiing-ing items in order to determine whether it must enhance the offense level according to \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l).\u201d Cho misreads the guideline Commentary. The Background Note does not merely alert the sentencing court that a possible reference to the \u00a7 2F1.1 table depends on the retail value of the counterfeited items. Instead, the Note explicitly states that the <em>enhancement itself </em>will be based on retail value. The Note even takes pains to observe that this value will generally <em>exceed </em>the loss or gain caused by the infringement. Cho\u2019s reading of the Background Note would transform it into misleading surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">Furthermore, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.5(b)(2) explains that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-9\">[a]n instruction to use a particular subsection or table from another offense guideline refers only to the particular subsection or table referenced, and not to the entire offense guideline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">Cho maintains that the reference in \u00a7 2B5.3 is in fact to the entire subsection in which the table is included, i.e., \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1); thus, \u00a7 2B5.3 incorporates by reference the reliance on \u201closs\u201d mandated by the prefatory sentence in \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l). <em>See supra </em>note 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">Again, Cho misreads the guidelines. Section 2B5.3(b)(l) makes explicit reference, <em>not </em>to \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1) as a subsection, but instead to \u201cthe table in \u00a7 2F1.1.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section lB1.5(b)(2) specifically foresees that one guideline section might refer only to a table from another section; in such a case, \u00a7 1B1.5 instructs the sentencing court to refer, as the district court correctly did here, only to the \u201ctable referenced.\u201d Thus, the reference in \u00a7 2B5.3 to \u201cthe table\u201d in \u00a7 2F1.1, combined with the explicit adoption of \u201cretail value\u201d in the \u00a7 2B5.3 Background Commentary as the measure of enhancement, convinces us the Government\u2019s interpretation is the correct one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">Cho makes an ingenious argument in reliance on <em>United States v. Kim, </em>963 F.2d 65 (5th Cir.1992), which, unfortunately for Cho, studiously disregards the holding and import of <em>Kim. </em>In <em>Kim, </em>this Court held that the proper measure for an enhancement under \u00a7 2B5.4(b)(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was the value of the <em>counterfeited </em>items, and not the value of the <em>genuine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>items. <em>Id. </em>at 68. We further found, however, that it was not clear error for the district court to rely on the retail value of the genuine items in assessing the retail value of the counterfeit items; such evidence was relevant to the counterfeit items\u2019 value, particularly given testimony as to the difficulty of calculating the \u201cretail price of counterfeit items.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Cho seeks to rob <em>Kim </em>of its precedential value by misstating its holding. Cho asserts that, in <em>Kim, </em>we were concerned merely with determining whether the value of the infringing items exceeded the $2,000 threshold of \u00a7 2B5.4 (now \u00a7 2B5.3); thus, claims Cho, <em>Kim </em>says nothing about the application of the \u00a7 2F1.1 table. Cho adds that the Court\u2019s reference to the Commentary to \u00a7 2F1.1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was simply to support its interpretation of \u00a7 2B5.4, and was not meant as an interpretation of \u00a7 2F1.1 itself. <em>Id. </em>at 69-70. Common sense and the clear implications of <em>Kim </em>counsel against Cho\u2019s reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">It is patently clear that the <em>Kim </em>court was concerned with calculating \u201cretail value\u201d not to determine <em>whether or not </em>to apply the \u00a7 2F1.1 table, but instead <em>in order to </em>apply the table itself. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1039-7\">Kim appeals his sentence, contending that the district court <em>erroneously increased his offense level </em>by using the retail value of the items being infringed \u2014 rather than the retail value of the counterfeit (infringing) items.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\"><em>Kim, </em>963 F.2d at 67 (emphasis added). Kim was complaining about an \u201cerroneous increase\u201d to his offense level \u2014 which presupposes application of the \u00a7 2F1.1 table \u2014 and not about the district court\u2019s decision to use the table at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Further, the Court cited the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Larracuente, </em>952 F.2d 672 (2nd Cir.1992) for the proposition that the district court there, given the similarity of bootleg tapes to the actual merchandise, \u201ccorrectly used the retail value for genuine merchandise <em>to determine the increase in the defendant\u2019s offense level </em>under section 2B5.3.\u201d <em>Kim, </em>963 F.2d at 69 (emphasis added). Again, the <em>Kim </em>court was interested, as was the <em>Larracuente </em>court, in determining retail value for purposes of applying the 2F1.1 table \u2014 not, as Cho claims, for assessing whether the \u00a7 2B5.3 $2,000 threshold had been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">Finally, and perhaps most convincing, are the monetary amounts addressed in <em>Kim. </em>The district court had determined that the retail value of the items seized from Kim was $195,400, based on the retail price of genuine merchandise. <em>Kim, </em>963 F.2d at 68. Kim argued that there was sufficient evidence presented at sentencing from which the district court could have calculated the retail value of the <em>counterfeit </em>items. <em>Id. </em>at 70. The Court found, to the contrary, that there was insufficient evidence of the price of the counterfeit items, and that the district court was therefore not clearly erroneous in relying on the price of genuine articles. <em>Id. </em>Specifically referring to the lack of evidence of both price and quantity of counterfeit Louis Vuitton handbags, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A30\">Kim has not shown that the evidence regarding the handbags is. sufficient to reduce the amount of the counterfeit merchandise by at least $75,400, <em>the amount necessary to decrease his offense level by one. </em>See <em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l)(H).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">In our view, this statement by the <em>Kim </em>court establishes beyond any doubt that the court was concerned with calculating retail value for comparison with the dollar amounts and corresponding level adjustments found in the \u00a7 2F1.1 table. Common sense compels this conclusion as well. The Court was dealing with an initial retail value assessment by the district court of over $195,000. It found that assessment was not clearly erroneous based, in part, on its finding that Kim could not produce sufficient evidence of the infringing items\u2019 value to reduce the total value by some $75,000, the amount necessary to move Kim one level down on the \u00a7 2F1.1 table. If the <em>Kim </em>court had been, as Cho insists, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>concerned with the $2,000 threshold amount in \u00a7 2B5.3, a discussion of monetary values in excess of $195,000 and $75,000 would have been ridiculous at best. Contrary to Cho\u2019s assertions, <em>Kim </em>stands squarely for the proposition that the retail value of the infringing items determines the \u00a7 2F1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Although not cited by either party, our decision in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>973 F.2d 1152 (5th Cir.1992), could be read to support Cho\u2019s argument. <em>Thomas </em>involved the sentencing of a defendant who had been convicted of illegal activities involving the alteration of motor vehicle identification numbers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 511-12, 2321-22. <em>Id. </em>at 1155. The Sentencing Guideline applicable to those offenses\u2014 \u00a7 2B6.1 \u2014 is in pertinent part identical to \u00a7 2B5.3:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-5\">If the retail value of the motor vehicles or parts involved exceeded $2,000, increase the offense level by the corresponding number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B.6.1(b)(1). The <em>Thomas </em>court held that the district court properly used \u201closs,\u201d- rather than retail, value, in applying \u00a7 2B6.1 to \u00a7 2F1.1. <em>Thomas, </em>973 F.2d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">One could read <em>Thomas </em>as conflicting with <em>Kim. </em>We need not distinguish <em>Thomas </em>here, however. Following <em>Thomas, </em>Application Note 2 was added to \u00a7 2B6.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-8\">The \u201ccorresponding number of levels from the table in \u00a7 2F1.1 (Fraud and Deceit),\u201d as used in subsection (b)(1), refers to the number of levels corresponding to the retail value of the motor vehicle or parts involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B6.1, comment, (n.2), effective November 1, 1993 <em>(see </em>Appendix C, Amendment 482)(1995). That amendment seems to us to remove any doubt <em>Thomas </em>might have cast on <em>Kim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the district court correctly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B5.3 and 2F1.1 in calculating Cho\u2019s sentence and we therefore AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">. \u201cLoss\u201d is defined in the Application Notes to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 as \"the value of the property taken, damaged, or destroyed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, comment, (n.l).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">.

We recognize that the Eighth Circuit, in <em>United States v. Lamere, </em>980 F.2d 506, 511-12 (8th Cir.1992), may have reached a contrary conclusion. Language in <em>Lamere </em>could be taken to mean that a reference to \"the table in 2F1.1\u201d is actually a reference to the entire subsection (\u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1)) in which the table is contained. (\"In referring to Application Note 7, the district court did not consider characteristics in addition to those contained in <em>\u00a7 2F1.1(b)(1) </em>\u2014 the <em>\u2018table\u2019.\u2019\u2019). Lamere, </em>980 F.2d at 512 (emphasis added). We disagree with that statement only insofar as it would require a court applying \u00a7 2B5.3 to recalculate \"loss\" for the \u00a7 2F1.1 table, when the court had already calculated \"retail value of the infringing items\u201d in \u00a7 2B5.3. In our view, the Background Commentary to \u00a7 2B5.3 forecloses such an interpretation of the guidelines. <em>See </em>discussion <em>supra. </em>We note, however, that <em>Lamere </em>simply held that it was not error for the district court to refer to the Application Notes under \u00a7 2F1.1 for guidance in interpreting the word \"loss.\u201d <em>See Lam-ere, </em>980 F.2d at 512. We also note that <em>Lamere </em>involved the interpretation of a different guideline section, \u00a7 2B5.1 (\"Offenses Involving Counterfeit Bearer Obligations of the United States\u201d). <em>See Lamere, </em>980 F.2d at 511.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1038-14\">.
