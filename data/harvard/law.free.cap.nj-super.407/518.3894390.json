We hold that such a pre-termination hearing is a contested case and that the federal statute and regulations governing the Section 8 program do not contain any provision that conflicts with the APA\u2019s requirement that this hearing be conducted before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Appellant Stalena Bouie was a long-term recipient of rental assistance under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f, commonly referred to as the Section 8 program, which is administered nationally by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and in New Jersey by the DCA. HUD allocates funds to public housing authorities (PHAs), one of which is the DCA, which in turn pay a portion of low-income tenants\u2019 rent. These payments are generally made directly to the landlord, and the tenant pays the balance of the rent. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f(o); Shelby D. Green, <em>The Public Housing Tenancy: Variations on the Common Law that Give Security of Tenure and Control, </em>43 <em>Cath. U.L.Rev. </em>681, 695-96 (1994) (describing the Section 8 program).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">On November 30, 2004, an official with the title of \u201cField Office Manager, Housing Assistance Element, Essex Field Office,\u201d in the Division of Housing and Community Resources of the DCA, sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>appellant a notice with the caption, \u201cInitial Decision to Deny or Terminate Tenant-Based Assistance and Refusal to Reissue a New Voucher.\u201d This notice indicated that appellant\u2019s Section 8 rental assistance would be terminated, effective December 31, 2004, because she had failed to make unspecified repairs to her apartment by a date established by the Essex Field Office. Although the notice did not so indicate, the only repair appellant had been asked to perform up to that point was the replacement of soiled carpeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The notice informed appellant that she had a right to a hearing before her Section 8 rental assistance would be terminated. Appellant requested such a hearing. Two days before the scheduled hearing date, which was March 10, 2005, the Essex Field Office sent appellant an amended notice of proposed termination of her Section 8 rental assistance, which alleged for the first time that appellant had committed additional violations of the regulations governing the Section 8 program, including that she had failed to provide the Field Office with copies of eviction notices and other related documents served upon her by the landlord, and/or the Special Civil Part.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The hearing on the proposed termination of Section 8 benefits was held before a hearing officer of the Division of Housing in the DCA. There is no transcription of the testimony presented at that hearing. The only record of the evidence presented is the hearing officer\u2019s report and a statement of proceedings in lieu of transcript that the DCA submitted pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:5\u20143(f) after this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Despite the inadequacy of the administrative record, it is undisputed that appellant, her landlord, and the supervisor of the Essex Field Office were the only witnesses at the hearing. The Essex Field Office relied substantially upon documentary evidence in seeking to terminate appellant\u2019s Section 8 rental assistance, such as inspection reports containing hearsay statements regarding the condition of appellant\u2019s apartment and the cause. For example, the hearing officer\u2019s March 16, 2005 report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>An inspection of your unit done on July 29, 2004, noted soiled carpeting in the bedrooms and attributed the condition of the carpeting to tenant causes. The report also noted several other damaged areas of the unit which were the landlord\u2019s responsibility to correct. Notable among those other areas was a leaking refrigerator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">Your landlord\u2019s letter of August 16, 2004, disputes the cause of the other damages as being attributable to him and alleges that most, if not all, of the damages are attributable to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">A letter of September 2, 2004, from the refrigerator repair service employed by your landlord lists the damage to the refrigerator and alleges that the extent of the damage is not due to normal wear and tear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Appellant testified that \u201cthe damage to her [rental] unit was ... due to poor quality materials and construction.\u201d She also testified \u201cthat she was never informed that she was being held responsible for anything other than the soiled carpeting in her apartment, and was not aware that the DCA had reclassified the refrigerator damage as her responsibility.\u201d She further \u201ctestified that if she had known she was being held responsible for the refrigerator, she would have had the refrigerator fixed herself in order to protect her section 8 subsidy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">However, the hearing officer rejected this testimony, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">You have been the sole tenant of the unit since it was constructed. It is not to be believed that the landlord soiled the carpets or damaged the refrigerator to the extent that the evidence demonstrated. The damage to the carpet cannot be attributed to poor quality materials. The damage to the refrigerator can only have been done deliberately. Both instances of damage cannot be attributed to normal wear and tear. I accept the evidence of the DCA inspection report of July 29, 2004, and the photographic evidence supplied by the landlord.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">The hearing officer also found that \u201c[n]one of the eviction notices received by you were ever made available by you to the DCA in a prompt fashion.\u201d Based on these findings, the hearing officer upheld the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 rental assistance benefits, with an effective date of April 30, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Although not revealed by the hearing officer\u2019s report, both the DCA\u2019s statement of proceedings in lieu of transcript and the inspection reports indicate that the only damage to the apartment initially claimed to be appellant\u2019s responsibility was the soiled carpeting. However, after appellant\u2019s landlord was notified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>its Section 8 housing assistance payments would be suspended because of numerous items of damage found in the inspection of appellant\u2019s apartment, the landlord\u2019s agent called the Essex Field Supervisor and convinced her that those items, particularly the refrigerator, were actually appellant\u2019s responsibility. The Supervisor reached this conclusion without any discussion with appellant or further inspection of her apartment. Based upon this conclusion, the Supervisor voided the proposed suspension of the landlord\u2019s housing assistance payments and initiated the termination of appellant\u2019s participation in the Section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The DCA\u2019s statement of proceedings in lieu of transcript acknowledges that the documents the hearing officer relied upon in finding that appellant failed to send the eviction notices and other related documents received by her to the Essex Field Office were not provided to appellant\u2019s counsel before the March 10, 2005 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">After the hearing officer\u2019s decision terminating her Section 8 rental assistance, appellant vacated her apartment sometime in June 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">During the summer of 2005, Essex-Newark Legal Services, which was representing appellant, had discussions with the Division of Housing regarding the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 assistance. The record does not indicate the precise nature of those discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">On December 15, 2005, Essex-Newark Legal Services submitted an appeal of the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 assistance to the Division of Housing. This appeal was supported by a lengthy letter, which argued that the hearing officer\u2019s decision was \u201criddled with significant violations of due process protections and substantive violations of the Federal regulations and DCA\u2019s Section 8 Administrative Plan.\u201d The letter contended, among other things, that the Essex Field Office\u2019s notices of proposed termination \u201cviolate[d] basic due process requirements because they fail[ed] to provide a clear factual statement as to the reason for the proposed termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>On February 9, 2006, the Chief of the Bureau of Housing Services, defendant Deborah Heinz, sent Essex-Newark Legal Services a letter rejecting the appeal of the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 assistance. This letter stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">The evidence presented at the hearing was sufficient to allow the hearing officer to uphold the DCA\u2019s decision to terminate assistance. Ms. Bouie soiled the bedroom carpeting and she damaged the refrigerator. She never disputed these allegations. Ms. Bouie also failed to provide copies of owner eviction notices dating to 2002 and 2004, a fact, which is undisputed. Indeed, it is unclear what defense could be prepared in view of the evidence presented.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The letter did not indicate whether there was any further remedy available to appellant within the DCA to challenge the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">On March 31, 2006, appellant filed this action in the Law Division challenging the termination of her Section 8 rental assistance. The complaint named as defendants the DCA, the Commissioner of the DCA, and Heinz.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After hearing oral argument, the Law Division transferred the case to this court because appellant\u2019s complaint challenged the final action of a state administrative agency, over which this court has exclusive jurisdiction. <em>R. </em>2:2-3(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Thereafter, respondents filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground of untimeliness because it was not filed within forty-five days of the hearing officer\u2019s March 16, 2005 decision terminating appellant\u2019s Section 8 rental assistance. We denied the motion without prejudice to its renewal in respondent\u2019s merits brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\">On appeal, the DCA renews its argument that the appeal should be dismissed as untimely. Appellant argues that her challenge was timely and that the procedures followed by the DCA in terminating her Section 8 rental assistance benefits violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the federal regulations governing the Section 8 program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We conclude that Bureau Chief Heinz\u2019s February 9, 2006 letter upholding the hearing officer\u2019s termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits was the DCA\u2019s final decision, and that because appellant filed an action in the Law Division challenging that decision within forty-five days of its receipt, this appeal is timely. Accordingly, we deny the DCA\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">We also conclude that the DCA proceedings that resulted in the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits violated due process requirements and the federal regulations governing the Section 8 program. Accordingly, the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits must be reversed and the case remanded for a redetermination in proceedings that conform with due process and applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, as previously indicated, we conclude that a dispute concerning the termination of Section 8 benefits constitutes a \u201ccontested ease\u201d under the APA. Therefore, the matter must be referred to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for a hearing before an ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">We first address the DCA\u2019s argument that this appeal is untimely because the hearing officer\u2019s March 16, 2005 decision was the final agency action and appellant did not seek judicial review of that decision until nearly a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Rule </em>2:4^1(b) provides that \u201c[ajppeals from final decisions or actions of state administrative agencies or officers ... shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>taken within 45 days from the date of service of the decision or notice of the action taken.\u201d This same forty-five day limit applies to a challenge to state agency action that is improperly filed in a trial court and transferred to the Appellate Division pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:13-4. <em>Kohlbrenner Recycling Enters., Inc. v. Burlington County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>624, 629, 550 A.2d 771 (Law Div.1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531, 534-35, 539, 591 A.2d 962 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>551, 606 A.2d 364 (1991). However, an agency action does not become final until all avenues of internal administrative review have been exhausted. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-12; <em>R. </em>2:2\u20143(a)(2); <em>see K. Hovnanian Cos. v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>379 <em>N.J.Super </em>1, 8-9, 876 A.2d 847 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>390, 886 A.2d 661 (2005). Therefore, to decide whether a state agency action was final action that had to be appealed within forty-five days, we must determine whether there was any available avenue of internal administrative review. <em>See In re Stoeco Dev., Ltd., </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>326, 334, 621 A.2d 29 (App.Div.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The APA prescribes the ordinary system of administrative adjudication in this State. Subject to certain limited exceptions, a hearing in a contested case under the APA is conducted before a hearing officer with the title of ALJ. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14F-4. However, the APA does not assign final decision-making authority to ALJs. An ALJ\u2019s role in the administrative process is to submit a report containing recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law to the agency head, who retains authority to make the final agency decision. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c),(d). Moreover, even in those limited circumstances where the APA authorizes a hearing to be conducted by an agency-appointed hearing officer rather than an ALJ, such as hearings before the Parole Board or Public Employment Relations Commission, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14F-8, the hearing officer only makes a recommendation to the agency, which retains final decision-making authority. <em>See Trantino v. N.J. State Parole Bd., </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>113, 126, 764 A.2d 940 (2001); <em>N.J. Tpk. Auth. v. Am. Fed\u2019n of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number><em>State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>331, 336-37, 696 A.2d 585 (1997). Consequently, the assignment of final decision-making authority to a hearing officer would constitute a substantial departure from the normal system of administrative adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Section 8 rental assistance is a federal program that is pervasively regulated by federal statutes and regulations. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f; 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 982.1 to 982.643. The governing federal regulations require a PHA that administers the Section 8 program such as the DCA to afford a recipient an opportunity for an \u201cinformal hearing\u201d before terminating benefits. 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555. Those regulations provide that the recipient must be given \u201ca brief statement of reasons for\u201d the proposed termination, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(c)(2)(i), a statement of the deadline for requesting a hearing, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(2)(iii), and \u201cthe opportunity to present evidence and ... question any witnesses,\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(5). The regulations also provide that \u201c[t]he person who conducts the hearing must issue a written decision,\u201d \u2022with a brief statement of reasons, and that any \u201c[fjactual determination\u201d must be based upon a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(6). However, those regulations do not prescribe who must conduct such a pre-termination hearing or make the final determination. Instead, the federal regulations delegate this responsibility to the PHA administering the Section 8 program, by providing that the hearing \u201cmay be conducted by <em>any person or persons designated by the PHA, </em>other than a person who made or approved the decision under review or a subordinate of this person.\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.554(b)(1); 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(4) (emphasis added). Thus, the determination of which official or officials must decide whether adequate grounds have been established for termination of Section 8 benefits is a matter of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The New Jersey Legislature has not enacted any statute prescribing the procedures for hearing and deciding administrative proceedings for the termination of Section 8 benefits. The DCA administers the Section 8 program in accordance with an annually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>updated 200-page document, entitled \u201cHousing Choice Voucher Program Administrative Plan,\u201d the current version of which is available at http://www.state.nj.us/dca/divisions/dhcr/publications/ docs/hcvp/ hcvprogadminplansfy09.pdf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under this document, the responsibility for conducting a hearing regarding a proposed termination of Section 8 benefits is assigned to a hearing officer. <em>Id. </em>at 16-5. However, this document authorizes an appeal of a hearing officer\u2019s decision to the \u201cDirector of the Division of Housing,\u201d which \u201cmay be accepted\u201d at his \u201cdiscretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-8. If the appeal is accepted, \u201c[t]he Director, or designee, will conduct the review.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the informal document under which the DCA administers the Section 8 program establishes an avenue for internal administrative review of a hearing officer\u2019s decision regarding a termination of Section 8 benefits. Moreover, this document does not set any deadline for pursuing such an internal administrative review.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Viewed within this administrative framework, it is clear that the hearing officer\u2019s March 16, 2005 decision did not constitute final agency action that appellant was required to appeal to the Appellate Division within forty-five days. Although the hearing officer described the decision as <em>\u201cmy final decision </em>to uphold the termination of [Section 8] assistance\u201d (emphasis added), this decision did not notify appellant that it was \u201cthe DCA\u2019s final decision\u201d and that the only avenue for challenging it was by appeal to the Appellate Division. Therefore, the hearing officer\u2019s decision did not give the \u201cunmistakable written notice of ... finality\u201d required \u201c[f]or a state administrative agency to gain repose from an appeal by virtue of the elapse of time.\u201d <em>De Nike v. Bd. of Trs. of Pub. Employees Ret. Sys., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>430, 435, 170 A.2d 12 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Moreover, the DCA\u2019s subsequent actions indicated that it did not consider the hearing officer\u2019s decision to be the agency\u2019s final decision. The December 15, 2005 letter that Essex-Newark Legal Services submitted in support of the appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision states that a Legal Services attorney had discussions with DCA officials during the preceding summer. There is no indication the DCA informed Legal Services at that time that it considered the hearing officer\u2019s decision to be \u201cfinal\u201d or that the time for appealing that decision had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Most significantly, the February 9, 2006 letter from Bureau Chief Heinz did not reject appellant\u2019s appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision based on untimeliness or other procedural grounds. Instead, it constituted a decision on the merits, which addressed appellant\u2019s procedural and substantive objections to the hearing officer\u2019s decision. Therefore, the Bureau Chiefs February 9, 2006 letter, rather than the hearing officer\u2019s March 16, 2005 decision, constituted the DCA\u2019s final decision, and the appeal from that decision was timely.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We next consider whether the procedures followed by the DCA in the proceeding before the hearing officer that resulted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits, which was subsequently upheld by the Bureau Chief, comported with the requirements of due process and the federal regulations governing administration of the Section 8 program.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>254, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970), the Court held that a state\u2019s termination of welfare benefits without first affording the recipient an opportunity for an evidentiary hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In order for a pre-termination hearing to satisfy Due Process requirements, the recipient must be given \u201ctimely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination, and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence orally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1020, 25 L.Ed.2d at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The governing HUD regulations recognize that the receipt of rental assistance under the Section 8 program is a public assistance benefit that cannot be terminated without affording the recipient a pre-termination hearing in conformity with the principles set forth in <em>Goldberg. </em>In fact, those regulations mirror the requirements of <em>Goldberg. Compare </em>24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(c)(1) (recipient may request hearing challenging termination if he \u201cdoes not agree with the [initial] determination\u201d) <em>with Goldberg, supra, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>at 267, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1020, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 298 (recipient must be afforded a pre-termination hearing \u201cto protect a recipient against an erroneous termination of his benefits\u201d); <em>compare </em>24 <em>C.F.R,. </em>\u00a7 982.555(c)(2)(i) (PHA must give \u201cprompt written notice\u201d of the proposed termination containing \u201ca brief statement of reasons\u201d) <em>and </em>24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(5) (recipient \u201cmust be given the opportunity to present evidence, and may question any witnesses\u201d) <em>with Goldberg, supra, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>at 267-68, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1020, 25 L.Ed.2d at 299 (recipient must receive \u201ctimely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for a proposed termination, and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting any adverse witnesses and by presenting his own arguments and evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>orally\u201d); <em>see also </em>Section 8 Certificate Program, Moderate Rehabilitation Program and Housing Voucher Program, 55 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>28,538 (July 11, 1990) (stating that \u201cPHAs must adopt written informal pretermination hearing procedures for participants, which fully meet the requirements of <em>Goldberg v. Kelly </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The procedures employed in the proceedings before the hearing officer regarding the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 rental assistance benefits violated the Due Process Clause and the HUD regulations governing the Section 8 program because the DCA failed to give appellant \u201cadequate notice detailing the reasons for [the] proposed termination, and an effective opportunity to defend by confronting [the] adverse witnesses and by presenting [her] own ... evidence.\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>at 267-68, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1020, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 299. Both notices of intention to terminate appellant\u2019s benefits were form notices that failed to inform her of the specific reasons for termination. The initial notice, dated November 30, 2004, simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">You are in violation of 24 <em>C.F.R., </em>Section 982.522(c), Breach of HQS by family, in that you failed to take appropriate action to correct an HQS breach as described in 24 <em>C.F.R., </em>Section 982.404(b)(1). You are responsible for the tenant cause[d] repairs in your apartment and you were given adequate notice by the HA to have repairs completed by [a] specific date or risk cancellation of your rental assistance. Based on this information we have decided to terminate your participation in the Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance Program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Thus, this notice failed to identify the \u201ctenant eause[d] repairs in her apartment\u201d that appellant had failed \u201cto have completed by [a] specific date.\u201d The amended notice, dated March 8, 2005, repeated this same form language, and again failed to identify the specific \u201ctenant cause[d] repairs\u201d that appellant had failed to perform by the date specified by the DCA. Consequently, both notices \u201cmerely parroted the broad language of the [HUD] regulations,\u201d <em>Billington v. Underwood, </em>613 <em>F.2d </em>91, 94 (5th Cir.1980), without identifying the specific alleged conduct upon which the proposed termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits was based, and consequently failed to provide the notice of reasons for proposed termination required by <em>Goldberg.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Moreover, the amended notice of intention to terminate, which was served upon appellant\u2019s attorney on March 8, 2005, only two days before the scheduled pre-termination hearing, did not provide appellant with \u201ctimely\u201d notice of the reasons for the termination. This notice identified a completely new reason for the proposed termination\u2014that appellant had failed to provide the DCA with copies of eviction notices served upon appellant by the landlord, and/or the Special Civil Part. <em>Goldberg </em>suggests that a recipient must be given at least seven days\u2019 notice of the reasons for the proposed termination of welfare benefits. <em>See </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>at 268, 90 <em>S.Ct. at </em>1020, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 299. If seven days\u2019 notice of the reasons for a termination of benefits is only marginally sufficient, as <em>Goldberg </em>seems to indicate, the two-days\u2019 notice that the DCA gave appellant of the proposed new reason for the termination of her benefits was clearly insufficient, particularly since this notice was not accompanied by copies of the \u201cowner eviction notices\u201d and other related documents that appellant allegedly failed to provide the DCA, which the Legal Services attorney representing appellant needed to defend this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The DCA\u2019s failure to give timely and adequate notice to appellant that the unrepaired damage she allegedly caused to the refrigerator was an additional reason for the termination of her Section 8 assistance was even more egregious. This ground for termination was not set forth in either the November 30, 2004 initial notice or the March 8, 2005 amended notice. Moreover, the July 29, 2004 inspection report, which was the only specific notice appellant received before the March 10, 2005 hearing regarding the alleged damage to her apartment and allocation of responsibility for repair of that damage, assigned responsibility for the damage to the refrigerator to the landlord. The first notice appellant received that the landlord\u2019s representative had convinced the Supervisor of the Essex Office that appellant was responsible for this damage was at the March 10, 2005 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the DCA failed to give appellant timely and adequate notice of the reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>termination of her Section 8 benefits and therefore deprived her of an effective opportunity to defend the charges upon which the proposed termination was based. Accordingly, the termination of those benefits must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">On an initial review of this appeal, we tentatively concluded for the reasons set forth in Section III of this opinion that the hearing that resulted in the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits was procedurally deficient and that a remand would be required. This conclusion led the court to question whether such a hearing was a \u201ccontested case\u201d within the meaning of the APA, which should be conducted before an ALJ rather than a DCA hearing officer. Accordingly, the court asked the parties to submit supplemental briefs addressed to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Both appellant and the DCA filed supplemental briefs, which agreed that a dispute concerning the termination of Section 8 benefits constitutes a contested case that must be heard by an ALJ. The DCA\u2019s supplemental brief states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afu\">Historically, the DCA has held hearings within the department for all challenges to the agency\u2019s determinations regarding the Section 8 housing program. This administrative practice started with the intention that compliance with the appeal process established by [HUD] would be consistent no matter which PHA administers the federal housing program. Thus, the informal hearing procedures prescribed by HUD would be applied uniformly regardless of whether the housing program is administered by the DCA, or a local housing authority within the state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">Questions regarding DCA\u2019s administrative practice of holding Section 8 hearings within the department have not, to our knowledge, been raised until now. Having reviewed the relevant federal statutes and regulations in conjunction with the hearing requirements of the APA, the DCA concludes that appellant\u2019s challenge of the Section 8 benefits termination at bar is a \u201ccontested case\u201d under the APA____ [Appellant's challenge is a \u201ccontested case\u201d because the DCA\u2019s initial decision to terminate her participation in the Section 8 housing program involves the loss of a property interest that affords appellant the constitutional right to a due process hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">Based upon the foregoing, respondent DCA respectfully requests remand of the instant appeal for handling by the DCA consistent with the APA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Despite the DCA\u2019s concession, our conclusion that a dispute concerning the termination of Section 8 benefits is a \u201ccontested case\u201d subject to the procedural protections of the APA is of sufficient importance to warrant a full explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The APA defines a \u201ccontested case\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-7\"><em>a proceeding, </em>including any licensing proceeding, <em>in which the legal rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits or other legal relations of specific parties are required by constitutional right or by statute to be determined </em>by an agency by decisions, determinations, or orders, addressed to them or disposing of their interests, <em>after opportunity for an agency </em>hearing----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(b) (emphasis added).l</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Under this definition of \u201ccontested case,\u201d the APA \u201cdoes not create a substantive right to an administrative hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>In re Fanelli, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>165, 172, 803 A.2d 1146 (2002). Therefore, \u201c[t]he right to an administrative hearing generally must be found outside the APA in another statute or constitutional provision.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Christ Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Senior Servs., </em>330 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 61, 748 A.2d 1156 (App.Div.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">As discussed in Section III of this opinion, the Supreme Court held in <em>Goldberg v. Kelly </em>that the Due Process Clause requires an opportunity for a hearing before the termination of public assistance benefits. Both HUD and the DCA recognize that Section 8 benefits are public assistance benefits which, under <em>Goldberg v. Kelly, </em>may not be terminated without first providing the recipient an opportunity for a hearing. <em>See Ressler v. Pierce, </em>692 F.2d 1212, 1215-16 (9th Cir.1982) (holding that an applicant for Section 8 assistance is entitled to procedural due process safeguards); <em>Escalera v. New York City Hous. Auth., </em>425 F.2d 853, 861 (2d Cir.) (holding that \u201cgovernment cannot deprive a private citizen of his continued tenancy [in public housing], without affording him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>adequate procedural safeguards\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 <em>U.S. </em>853, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>54, 27 L.Ed.2d 91 (1970); <em>see also State in Interest of D.G.W., </em>70 <em>N.J. 488, </em>501-02, 361 A.2d 513 (1976) (holding that \u201cdue process rights are found whenever an individual risks governmental exposure to a grievous loss\u201d and listing \u201ctermination of welfare benefits\u201d as one such grievous loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Furthermore, the dispute over the termination of appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits involves contested adjudicative facts that require an evidentiary hearing to resolve. <em>Cf. Sloan v. Klagholtz, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>385, 392, 776 A.2d 894 (App.Div.2001) (noting that \u201c[i]f a matter before an agency does not present contested material issues of fact that can be decided only \u2018after [an] opportunity for an agency hearing,\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-2(b), it is not a contested case subject to transfer to the OAL\u201d). The grounds upon which the DCA terminated appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits\u2014her alleged soiling the carpets, deliberately causing damage to the refrigerator, and failing to transmit eviction notices to the landlord\u2014were all factual in nature. Moreover, the statement in lieu of transcript and appellant\u2019s certification show that appellant disputed the factual allegations upon which the DCA relied. Therefore, unless the agency head elects to conduct the evidentiary hearing personally, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>52:14F-8(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the DCA is required to transmit the matter to the OAL for a hearing before an ALJ in conformity with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Although a proceeding involving the termination of Section 8 benefits is a \u201ccontested case\u201d that must be heard by an ALJ rather than an agency hearing officer, the federal statutes and regulations governing the Section 8 program could mandate an alternative form of hearing which, under the Supremacy Clause, <em>U.S. Const, </em>art. VI, cl. 2, would be binding upon the DCA in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>administration of the <em>program. See Franklin Tower One, L.L.C. v. N.M., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>602, 615-18, 725 A.2d 1104 (1999). However, as discussed in Section III of this opinion, although HUD has adopted regulations that prescribe certain standards for the conduct of hearings involving the termination of Section 8 benefits, those regulations do not require such a hearing to be conducted by a hearing officer employed by the PHA administering the pro<em>gram\u2014in </em>this case the DCA. Instead, the subsection of the regulations dealing with \u201chearing procedures\u201d requires each public housing authority to adopt an \u201cadministrative plan,\u201d which \u201cmust state the PHA procedures for conducting informal hearings for participants.\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(1). This subsection requires \u201c[t]he person who conducts the hearing\u201d to issue a written decision stating the reasons for the decision, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(6), but does not circumscribe a PHA\u2019s authority to determine who will conduct a pre-termination hearing. To the contrary, another subsection provides that \u201c[t]he hearing may be conducted by any person or persons designated by the PHA, other than a person who made or approved the decision under review or a subordinate of this person.\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(e)(4)(i). Therefore, there is no conflict between the APA\u2019s requirement that a pre-termination hearing be conducted before an ALJ and the HUD regulations governing hearing procedures. In fact, the conduct of Section 8 pre-termination hearings before ALJs, as provided under the 1978 amendments to the APA, which undertook \u201cto bring impartiality and objectivity to agency hearings\u201d by \u201cestablishment of a corps of independent hearing officers,\u201d <em>Unemployed-Employed Council of N.J., Inc. v. Horn, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>646, 649-50, 428 A.2d 1305 (1981), will promote the HUD regulations\u2019 goal of providing Section 8 recipients with fair hearings before impartial decision-makers.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Finally, we note that the HUD regulations require pre-termination hearings to be conducted \u201cin a reasonably expeditious manner upon the request of the family.\u201d 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.555(d). The rules governing hearings before the OAL provide for accelerated scheduling of cases that require expedited disposition. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>Ll-9.4. Pursuant to this rule, the OAL has routinely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>provided for expedited disposition of eases involving the termination of public assistance benefits. We assume the OAL will hear and decide cases involving the termination of benefits under the Section 8 program on a similar expedited basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the final decision terminating appellant\u2019s Section 8 benefits and remand the case to the DCA to transmit to the OAL for a contested case hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-12\"> Appellant's Law Division complaint asserted claims under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983. After transfer of the case to this court, appellant did not present any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>argument under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 or seek to preserve the right to pursue such claims in the Law Division in accordance with the procedures set forth in <em>Maisonet v. N.J. Dep't of Human Servs., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>214, 226-28, 657 A.2d 1209 (1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">Appellant's reply brief referred to those claims but did so solely in the course of arguing that this appeal was timely. In any event, a party may not advance a new argument in a reply brief. <em>Borough of Berlin v. Remington Vernick Eng\u2019rs, </em>337 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 596, 767 A.2d 1030 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>294, 773 A.2d 1158 (2001). Therefore, any claim that appellant may have had under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983 was abandoned.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> We note that the DCA has adopted the procedures it follows in administering the State Rental Assistance Program as administrative rules. <em>See NJ.A.C. </em>5:42-1.1 to -7.3. We suggest that the DCA consider also adopting the procedures it follows in administering the Section 8 program as administrative rules.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\"> Because the issue has not been briefed, we do not decide whether the Chief of the Bureau of Housing Services has been delegated final decision-making authority with respect to the termination of Section 8 rental assistance benefits. Insofar as we can determine, it is the DCA, not any bureau or division within the DCA, that administers the Section 8 program as a PHA. The Commissioner of the DCA is the head of this department of state government. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>52:27D-2. As the head of the department, the Commissioner has final decision-making authority in an adjudicatory proceeding unless there has been a valid delegation of such authority to a subordinate official. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>52:14B-10(c). Consistent with this view, the Commissioner apparently acts as the final decision-maker in proceedings involving the termination of rental subsidies under the State Rental Assistance Program, <em>see N.J. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Love, </em>2008 <em>WL </em>1709931, at 5-6, 2008 <em>N.J. AGEN LEXIS </em>215, at 14-15 (N.J.Adm. Mar. 26, 2008), which is similar to a termination of Section 8 rental assistance. On remand, the DCA should consider whether the Bureau Chief has been delegated authority to make a final decision with respect to a termination of Section 8 benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b563-12\"> The one exception to this general statement is set forth <em>inN.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-11, which provides that \"[n]o agency shall revoke or refuse to renew any license unless it has first afforded the licensee an opportunity for hearing in conformity with the provisions of this act applicable to contested cases.\u201d This exception obviously does not apply to a dispute regarding the termination of public assistance benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> As discussed in footnote three, we do not decide whether the Commissioner of DCA or a subordinate official within DCA is the \u201cagency head\" with authority to make the final decision in a case involving the termination of Section 8 benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
