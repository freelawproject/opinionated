He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and concurrent terms for the other charges. The term of life imprisonment equates to seventy-five years in prison and, pursuant to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, a parole-ineligibility period of sixty-three years and nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Defendant appeals his convictions and his sentence. We affirm the convictions but remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Defendant and Kathy Docaj, nee Visita Zadrima, were wed in Yugoslavia in 1983 in an arranged marriage. Kathy had lived in the United States since the age of nine and returned to America shortly after the wedding. Defendant, an Albanian national, followed soon thereafter. They had three children and eventually settled in Lodi, New Jersey. At the time of Kathy\u2019s death in February 2003, their son, Christopher, was eighteen years old, their daughter, Christina, was fifteen years old and their younger daughter was nine years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">Kathy was employed as a concierge at a business in Manhattan near the Battery Park ferry terminus. Defendant worked in air <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>conditioner and refrigeration maintenance at a building in Manhattan. In the latter part of 2002, Kathy became acquainted with Robert Narciso, who also used the ferry to commute to Manhattan. Initially platonic, their relationship grew closer over several months. In mid-December 2002, Kathy told defendant that she no longer loved him. At Kathy\u2019s request, defendant moved out of the marital home to an apartment in Lodi in January 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Approximately ten years earlier, defendant purchased a .38 caliber handgun, which he kept in a shoe box under his bed. At the time that he was moving out, he and Kathy discovered that Christopher had removed the gun some months earlier and kept it, unloaded, in his room since that time. Defendant took the handgun with him when he moved out.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Defendant began to suspect that Kathy was \u201ccheating on him\u201d and later told police that he saw her leaving her place of employment with \u201cher boss.\u201d On February 7, 2003, Kathy telephoned defendant and told him that she was meeting a lawyer that day to prepare papers to file for divorce. Defendant\u2019s diary reflects that he begged her not to divorce him and that she replied, \u201c[T]his thing has to be done.\u201d Kathy met with the lawyer and a complaint for divorce on the grounds of extreme cruelty was drafted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">Defendant and Kathy alternated weekends with the children. It was defendant\u2019s turn to spend the weekend of February 8 and 9 with the children. Narciso, a divorced father of two daughters, also alternated weekend child care with his wife. As a result, Kathy and Narciso were able to spend that weekend together. Kathy told defendant and her children that she was spending the weekend in Atlantic City with friends. Defendant wrote in his diary, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I understand how can a person who has been in love with her husband for 19 years can do something like this and go to Atlantic City to celebrate or for any other reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Defendant\u2019s diary also recorded his reaction to Kathy\u2019s failure to give him anything for his birthday on February 12: \u201cMy wife bought me nothing, I will remember this because one day by the power of God it will come that I will remember that day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>He bought a birthday cake, flowers and a card for Kathy for her birthday two days later. Around this time, Kathy told defendant that she had \u201canother man lined up.\u201d Defendant also noticed her wearing jewelry that he had never seen before.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">On February 17, 2003, Narciso received a telephone call from a man speaking English with a foreign accent who would not identify himself. In their brief conversation, Narciso commented that the caller knew more about him than he did about the caller. When Narciso asked for the caller\u2019s telephone number, the caller hung up.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">It is reasonable to infer that defendant placed this call to Narciso. Christopher had noticed that Kathy was spending \u201ctoo much\u201d time on the telephone and used the \u201cStar sixty-nine\u201d feature to learn what number she was calling. He provided the number, which was Narciso\u2019s, to his father. A paper with Narciso\u2019s telephone number was found among the defendant\u2019s possessions by the police after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Kathy and Narciso planned to spend the weekend of February 22 together. Their plans had to change when defendant told her that he had to work on Saturday and Kathy would have to care for the children. Defendant also told Kathy that he wanted to meet and talk to her. When she told him that she would not be coming home on Friday, he asked her why. She replied, \u201cI\u2019ll come home when I want to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Kathy spent Friday, February 21, 2003, with Narciso at his apartment. He dropped her off one block from her home on Saturday in the early afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Defendant spent Friday night with his children. He awakened around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday and left for his apartment at approximately 6:00 a.m. After changing clothes, he took a book bag containing the .38 caliber handgun with him to work and stored the book bag in his locker.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">While at work on Saturday, February 22, 2003, defendant called the marital home twice. Kathy was not home until his second call. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Defendant asked her, \u201cHow was your night out at the club?\u201d Kathy told him that she had been out until 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. When defendant said that he would see her later at the marital home, she replied, \u2018Whatever.\u201d According to her daughter, Kathy was not looking forward to defendant\u2019s visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Defendant left work at approximately 6:00 p.m., carrying the book bag with the .38 caliber handgun with him to his apartment. He removed the handgun from the book bag, placed it in the waistband of his trousers underneath a vest, and proceeded to the marital home.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Defendant entered the home on the lower level. Kathy was present on that level with their three children and two friends of the children. Defendant and Kathy went upstairs to the kitchen, where they sat, drinking coffee and smoking. When Christopher came to the kitchen to use the telephone, defendant asked Kathy to go to the bedroom because \u201che wanted to talk to her about something.\u201d Defendant walked to the bedroom and Kathy followed him. The door closed and was locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Within a minute, Christopher heard his parents screaming and cursing, as well as noises of pushing and shoving. Then, he heard his mother scream and a single \u201cboom.\u201d Christopher ran to the bedroom, trying unsuccessfully to open the door. He began screaming, \u201cOpen the door, open the door.\u201d Defendant opened the door and, white-faced, immediately said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Defendant blocked Christopher from entering the room but Christopher was able to see his mother lying, bloody, on the floor. Drawn by the sounds, Christina came upstairs where she saw defendant and Christopher struggling and arguing. Defendant told Christina \u201cshe cheated on me for two years\u201d and \u201cshe\u2019s gone.\u201d He continued to block Christina and Christopher from entering the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Christina dialed \u201c911\u201d and asked for an ambulance, stating that she thought her mother was dead. Defendant can be heard on the tape recording of this conversation, yelling loudly, \u201cShe was cheating on me,\u201d \u201cShe was f\u2014king cheating on me,\u201d \u201cShe was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>cheating on me for one year.\u201d A second call to \u201c911\u201d was made by Christopher, urgently requesting help.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Two policemen from the Lodi Police Department arrived to find Kathy lying in a pool of blood on the bedroom floor and a revolver resting on the lower end of the bed. Christopher was irate and about to walk out of the home. Defendant was in a daze, walking aimlessly in circles. Uncertain as to what had transpired, the police handcuffed both Christopher and defendant for \u201csafety\u201d reasons. Defendant was advised that he was not under arrest; he was not given <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings and was not questioned by the police at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Later investigation revealed that Kathy died from a single gunshot wound that entered the back of her head and exited from her forehead. The .38 caliber handgun found on the bed had been pressed loosely against the back of her skull when it was fired. The medical examiner testified that she was not standing but was \u201cpositioned low\u201d in relation to the shooter when she was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Defendant gave a statement to the police and described what happened in the bedroom. He admitted that he had the gun with him when they went into the bedroom but denied that he had gone to the house with the intent to kill Kathy. He said that in the bedroom, he begged her to stay together for the children and that he would \u201cforgive [her] to this point.\u201d He stated that Kathy was sitting on the bed and looked angry, \u201cas if she really wasn\u2019t hearing it, that she didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d According to defendant, Kathy said, the \u201conly thing you\u2019re getting are your walking papers.\u201d She struck him just once, \u201chit[ting] him on the left side of his face right by his mouth.\u201d He said, \u201cThings went dark.\u201d He pushed Kathy downward with his left arm and tried to catch her with his right hand when it appeared that she might strike her face on the floor. He admitted that he had the handgun in his hand as he tried to grab her, but he did not remember withdraw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ing the handgun from his waistband, pulling the trigger, or what he did with the handgun after shooting Kathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Defendant raises the following points on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">THE INSTRUCTION ON PASSION/PROVOCATION MANSLAUGHTER MISSTATED THE LAW. (Not Raised Below)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">IN HER OPENING STATEMENT, THE PROSECUTOR IMPROPERLY URGED THE JURY TO CONSIDER \u201cTHIS ...

Guido, </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>191, 191 A.2d 45 (1963), that a \u201ccourse of ill treatment\u201d can provide the basis for adequate provocation. In addition, defendant contends that his <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated because the warnings were not given in a timely manner and interrogation continued when he was falling asleep.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-6\">[At the direction of the court the discussion of issues other than defendant\u2019s claim of error in the passion/provocation manslaughter charge has been omitted from the published version of the opinion]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">We address first the passion/provocation manslaughter jury charge, an issue raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 411, 568 A.2d 879 (1990), identifies the four factors that must be present for a murder to be reduced to a passion/provocation manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">[T]he provocation must be adequate; the defendant must not have had time to cool off between the provocation and the slaying; the provocation must have actually impassioned the defendant; and the defendant must not have actually cooled off before the slaying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The trial court provided the jury with the model jury charge on passion/provocation manslaughter current at the time the instruction was given. Defendant is correct in stating that the model jury charge contained an error. In one of four statements regarding the State\u2019s burden of proof as to the adequacy of the cooling-off period, the charge stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">In other words, you must determine whether the State has proven that the time between the provoking event and the acts which caused death was <em>inadequate </em>for the return of a reasonable person\u2019s self-control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-12\">[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">As correctly noted elsewhere in the charge, the State\u2019s burden was to prove that the period of time was \u201cadequate\u201d for the return of a reasonable person\u2019s self-control. The question here is whether, within the context of the trial, that error had the clear capacity to lead the jury to convict the defendant of murder, \u201ca result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>409, 422, 688 A.2d 97 (1997) (quoting <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>273 A.2d 1 (1971)). After reviewing the charge in its entirety, the evidence, the arguments of counsel and the questions asked by the jury, we conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>1:7-2, defendant\u2019s failure to object constitutes a waiver of his right to challenge that instruction on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, mindful of the principles that \u201cappropriate and proper jury charges are essential to a fair trial,\u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 387, 799 A.2d 477 (2002), and are even more critical in criminal cases, <em>Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 688 A.2d 97, we review the charge to determine whether there was plain error clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>State v. Afanador, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>41, 54, 697 A.2d 529 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Even in a criminal prosecution, the mere fact of error does not require reversal. To constitute plain error, the error must be: \u201c[L]egal impropriety in the charge prejudicially affecting the substantial rights of the defendant and sufficiently grievous to justify notice by the reviewing court and to convince the court that of itself the error possessed a clear capacity to bring about an unjust result.\u201d <em>State v. Hock, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>526, 538, 257 A.2d 699 (1969) , <em>cert. denied, </em>399 <em>U.S. </em>930, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>2254, 26 L.Ed.2d 797 (1970) . The possibility of an unjust result must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Taffaro, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>442, 454, 950 A.2d 860 (2008); <em>Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 688 A.2d 97; <em>Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 273 A.2d 1. In short, the question here is whether the error made it easier for the State to get a conviction for murder as opposed to passion/provocation manslaughter. <em>See State v. N.I., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, 315-16, 793 A.2d 760 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>To make that evaluation, we review the error within the context of both the charge itself and the evidence and arguments presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">A. <em>The charge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">When the error alleged concerns only a portion of a charge, the challenged portion is not to be \u201cdealt with in isolation but the charge should be examined as a whole to determine its overall effect.\u201d <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422, 307 A.2d 608 (1973). <em>See also State v. Delibero, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>90, 106, 692 A.2d 981 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The instruction on passion/provocation manslaughter was immediately preceded by the model jury charge for murder. In addition to the elements regarding causation and intent, the jury was told, \u201cThe third element that the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt to find the defendant guilty of murder is that defendant did not act in the heat of passion resulting from a reasonable provocation.\u201d The passion/provocation manslaughter charge followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">Passion/provocation manslaughter is a death caused purposely or knowingly that is committed in the heat of passion resulting from a reasonable provocation. Passion/provocation manslaughter has four factors which distinguish it from murder. <em>In order for you to find, the defendant guilty of murder, the State need only prove the absence of any one of them beyond a reasonable doubt.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-9\">The four factors are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">Number one, there was adequate provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">Number two, the provocation actually impassioned defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-12\"><em>Number three, the defendant did not have a reasonable time to cool off between the provocation and the act which caused death; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-13\">Four, the defendant did not actually cool off before committing the act which caused death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-14\">The first factor you must consider is whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the provocation was not adequate. Whether the provocation is inadequate essentially amounts to whether loss of self-control is a reasonable reaction to the circumstance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-15\">In order for the State to carry its burden, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the provocation was not sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his control. For example, words alone do not constitute adequate provocation. On the other hand, a threat with a gun or knife or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>significant physical confrontation might be considered adequate provocation. Again, the State must prove that the provocation was not adequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">The second factor you must consider is whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not actually impassioned; th\u00e1t is, he did not actually lose his self-control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">The third factor you must consider is <em>whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had a reasonable time to cool off </em>In other words, you must determine whether the State has proven that the time between the provoking event and the acts which caused death was <em>inadequate </em>for the return of a reasonable person\u2019s self-control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">The fourth factor you must consider is whether the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actually did cool off before committing the acts which caused death; that is, that he was no longer actually impassioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\"><em>If you determine that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that there was not an adequate provocation or that the provocation did not actually impassion the defendant or <em>that defendant had a reasonable time to cool off, or </em>that defendant actually cooled off, and in addition to proving one of those factors you determine that the State has proven [the elements of murder] you must find the defendant guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">On the other hand, [if] you determine that the State has not disproved at least one of the factors of passion/provocation manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the State [has proven the elements of murder] then you must find him guilty of passion/provocation manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">A review of the charge therefore reveals that all four <em>Mauricio </em>factors were accurately introduced to the jury. <em>See Mauricio, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 411-13, 568 A.2d 879. The third factor regarding the adequacy of the cooling-off period was stated correctly a second time. It was in recasting that factor \u201cin other words\u201d that the error was made. However, the court correctly summed up the State\u2019s burden as to murder and passion/provocation manslaughter thereafter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-12\"><em>If you determine that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt </em>that there was not an adequate provocation or that the provocation did not actually impassion the defendant or <em>that defendant had a reasonable time to cool off, or </em>that defendant actually cooled off, and in addition to proving one of those factors you determine that the State has proven [the elements of murder] you must find the defendant guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-13\">[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">Therefore, of the four references to the third factor and the State\u2019s burden, one was erroneous and three were correct. This was, then, an error that was isolated rather than pervasive in the charge. <em>Compare State v. Martini, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>469, 478-80, 901 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>941 (2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 <em>U.S. </em>1223, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>1285, <em>167 L.Ed.2d </em>104 (2007), <em>with State v. Rodriguez, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>165, 171, 949 A.2d 197 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In <em>Martini, </em>the Court reviewed a similarly isolated error in the <em>Judges Bench Manual for Capital Causes. </em>Following the charge in the <em>Manual, </em>the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury that it had to find the mitigating factors unanimously. <em>Martini, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 476, 901 A.2d 941. The Supreme Court viewed the instructions to the jury in their entirety, which included a curative instruction given after objection by counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 480, 901 A.2d 941. Satisfied that \u201cthe instruction properly conveyed to the jury that each juror must individually determine whether a mitigating factor exists,\u201d the Court found no prejudicial error. <em>Id. </em>at 478-80, 901 A.2d 941. Quoting from its consideration of similar arguments in <em>State v. Loftin, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>295, 375-76, 680 A.2d 677 (1996), the Court recognized that \u201c \u2018[vjiewed in isolation, the single remark ... might suggest that the preferred result is a unanimous conclusion concerning the existence or non-existence of a mitigating factor,\u2019 ... but that \u2018when the isolated remark is viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, it is clear that there was no error.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Martini, supra, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>at 478-79, 901 A.2d 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Similarly, the error here was but one iteration imbedded in a charge that contained three entirely correct articulations of the State\u2019s burden regarding the third factor. In both describing the elements of murder and in summing up the State\u2019s burden as to the factors of passion/provocation manslaughter, the charge clearly conveyed the State\u2019s burden of proof. Specifically, the jury was instructed three times that, as to this factor, the State\u2019s burden was to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat defendant had a reasonable time to cool off.\u201d The isolated error\u2019s capacity to dispel that overall effect was minimal, at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">B. <em>The evidence and arguments at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Reviewing an error in jury instructions within the context of the trial, our courts have found the following factors significant: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>the nature of the error and its materiality to the jury\u2019s deliberations, <em>compare Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 688 A.2d 97, <em>with State v. Jackson, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 54, 672 A.2d 1254 (App.Div. 1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>462, 690 A.2d 609 (1997); (2) the strength of the evidence against the defendant, <em>see Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 426, 688 A.2d 97; <em>compare State v. Heslop, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>318, 639 A.2d 1100 (1994), <em>with State v. Lawton, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>27, 688 A.2d 1096 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>72, 697 A.2d 545 (1997); (3) whether the potential for prejudice was exacerbated or diminished by the arguments of counsel, <em>see Jordan, supra; Wilbely, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 307 A.2d 608; (4) whether any questions from the jury revealed a need for clarification, <em>see Savage, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 393-95, 799 A.2d 477; and (5) the significance to be given to the absence of an objection to the charge at trial, <em>see Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 273 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Errors in the jury instruction \u201con matters or issues that are material to the jury\u2019s deliberation are presumed to be reversible error.\u201d <em>Jordan, supra, </em>147 <em>N.J. </em>at 422, 688 A.2d 97. A presumption of reversible error does not apply here because whether the defendant had \u201ca reasonable time to cool off\u2019 was not \u201ccrucial to the jury\u2019s deliberations on the guilt of [the] defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid. A </em>review of the arguments made by the prosecutor and defense counsel clearly shows that the key <em>Mauricio </em>factor for both sides was whether there was adequate provocation to remove this case from murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The measure of adequate provocation is whether \u201closs of self-control is a reasonable reaction\u201d to the provocation. <em>Mauricio, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 568 A.2d 879.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">That test is purely objective, because the provocation must be \u2018sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary [person] beyond the power of his ... control.\u2019 ... The provocation must be severe enough that the \u2018intentional homicide may be as much attributable to the extraordinary nature of the <em>situation </em>as to the moral depravity of the actor.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\"><em>[Ibid. </em>(Citations omitted) (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Having no evidence of any physical provocation that could rise to such a level, the defense highlighted defendant\u2019s continuing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>escalating emotional state throughout the month of February. Defense counsel\u2019s summation emphasized the defendant\u2019s enduring \u201cemotional swirl\u201d that allowed him to lose control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, once again, please, I do not for one moment suggest that a slap of a person justifies the taking of a life. But after years of marriage, after week\u2014months, weeks, days and hours of confusion, after being told you\u2019re out of here, you\u2019ll get your walking papers, that I have another man lined up, that that conversation there punctuated now by the first form of physical violence may, in fact, be the adequate provocation that churns this to the heat that\u2014that this\u2014that this killing was done in the heat of the passion, a loss of self-control, a passion/provocation manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Since defense counsel conceded to the jury that a slap did not constitute adequate provocation, the question whether an adequate time to cool off passed between the slap and the gunshot was irrelevant to the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In her summation, the prosecutor declared that this was a deliberate murder. Stating that \u201cthere is no adequate provocation in this case,\u201d she plainly targeted that factor as the one the State had proven was absent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">If the State need only prove the absence of just one Tfactor], what that means is if you ... determine that there was no adequate provocation, defendant cannot be found guilty of passion/provocation manslaughter. He must be found guilty of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Therefore, both the State and the defense clearly represented \u201cadequate provocation\u201d as the crucial issue for the jury\u2019s determination in considering passion/provocation manslaughter rather than whether defendant had a reasonable time to cool off.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">The relative strength of the evidence of passion/provocation manslaughter weighs heavily in determining whether the error \u201cled the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>See Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 325, 273 A.2d 1. In <em>Heslop, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 639 A.2d 1100, the Supreme Court observed that it was \u201cnot faced with overwhelming evidence of passion/provocation as the singular and distinctive factor that led to the killing.\u201d The charge contained two significant errors: the \u201csequential error\u201d condemned in <em>State v. Coyle, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>194, 574 A.2d 951 (1990), and the failure to explicitly charge that the State bore the burden of proving the absence of passion/provocation beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>reasonable doubt as required by <em>State v. Erazo, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>112, 594 A.2d 232 (1991).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite the significance of these flaws, the Court found that the weakness of the case for passion/provocation manslaughter \u201cmilitate[s] strongly against the actuality of prejudice that may have emanated from the somewhat maladroit instructions on that charge.\u201d <em>Heslop, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 639 A.2d 1100. The Court concluded that \u201ca review of the factual record [did] not suggest the likelihood that the court\u2019s [charge] resulted in or contributed to an improper verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328, 639 A.2d 1100. In contrast, in a \u201cclose\u201d case, the presence of the same errors constituted reversible error. <em>Lawton, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 39, 688 A.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The lack of proof of adequate provocation posed a critical weakness in the passion/provocation manslaughter evidence here. Adequate provocation is not satisfied by \u201cwords alone, no matter how offensive or insulting.\u201d <em>State v. Crisantos, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>265, 274, 508 A.2d 167 (1986). A wife\u2019s repeated threats to kill her husband and burn the house down were deemed insufficient to warrant a passion/prejudice manslaughter instruction in <em>State v. Rambo, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>506, 951 A.2d 1075 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>258, 962 A.2d 529 (2008). Similarly, Kathy\u2019s statements that she wanted a divorce and had \u201canother man lined up\u201d fail to meet the standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim that Kathy slapped him does not add substantial weight to a claim of passion/provocation. Although perhaps sufficient to warrant the instruction,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the evidence of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>alleged slap was conceded to be insufficient to constitute adequate provocation. Even in instances of \u201cmutual combat,\u201d the defendant\u2019s response must be proportionate to the provocation. <em>State v. Oglesby, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>522, 536, 585 A.2d 916 (1991) (single blow by an unarmed woman was insufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on passion/provocation manslaughter); <em>State v. Crisantos, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 280, n. 12, 508 A.2d 167; <em>State v. Darrian, supra, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 449, 605 A.2d 716.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">[T]he contest must have been waged on equal terms and no unfair advantage taken of the deceased____ The offense is not manslaughter but murder where the defendant alone was armed; and took an unfair advantage of the deceased\u2014 [I]f a person, under color of fighting on equal terms, kills the other with a deadly weapon which he used from the beginning or concealed on his person from the beginning, the homicide constitutes murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\"><em>[Crisantos, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 274-275, 508 A.2d 167 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Defendant brought a concealed and loaded handgun to the home that night. His response to his wife\u2019s refusal to abandon divorce proceedings, and even her slap, was wholly disproportionate to any provocation. As in <em>Heslop, supra, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>at 327, 639 A.2d 1100, the strength of the evidence supporting the State\u2019s theory that this was a deliberate murder \u201cstrongly militates against\u201d a conclusion that the error in the charge contributed to a verdict that the jury might not otherwise have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Turning to the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the prosecutor accurately identified all four <em>Mauricio </em>factors, including the third factor, and the fact that the State had to prove the absence of one beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a murder conviction. Therefore, the summation did not exacerbate the error in the charge, but rather, added further to the \u201coverall effect\u201d of a charge that properly conveyed the State\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Our review of the jury\u2019s questions reveals no indication that the jury was misled by the error. Unlike <em>Savage, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 393-95, 799 A.2d 477, none of the jury\u2019s questions or requests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>suggested any confusion as to what the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt regarding passion/provoeation manslaughter in order to secure a conviction for murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The lack of prejudicial impact is further evinced by the absence of an objection. <em>See Macon, supra, 57 N.J. </em>at 341, 273 A.2d 1 (\u201cfailure to object may suggest the error was of no moment in the actual setting of the trial\u201d). The one-word error was imbedded in the model jury charge that trial courts are required to read to juries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[M]odel jury charges should be followed and read in their entirety to the jury. The process by which model jury charges are adopted in this State is comprehensive and thorough; our model jury charges are reviewed and refined by experienced jurists and lawyers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\"><em>[State v. R.B., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>308, 325, 873 A.2d 511 (2005).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Certainly, trial courts and counsel must review charges for potential error, even in model jury charges. However, this error was one word that was literally buried in a charge that was otherwise correct. The error went unnoticed by the \u201cexperienced jurists and lawyers\u201d who \u201creviewed and refined\u201d the charge, <em>ibid., </em>as well as the trial court and counsel here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the failure to object here reflected the obscure nature of the error and that it is more likely that the jury also depended upon the overall, correct expressions of the controlling legal principles rather than the one erroneous statement here.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In summary, we find that the error here was an isolated occurrence in a charge that repeatedly stressed the State\u2019s burden to prove the absence of one of the factors of passion/provocation manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor specifically targeted \u201cadequate provocation\u201d as the factor the State had proven was not present. The evidence and arguments of counsel clearly show that the adequacy of any cooling-off period was not a crucial issue regarding passion/provocation manslaughter. Moreover, the evidence regarding passion/provocation manslaughter was relatively weak. Finally, the prosecutor\u2019s summation did not exacerbate the error but, rather, diminished it. Accordingly, we conclude that the error in the charge did not lead the jury to a verdict that it otherwise might not have reached.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">[At the direction of the court, the discussion of the other issues in the appeal has been omitted from the published version of the opinion.!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.
