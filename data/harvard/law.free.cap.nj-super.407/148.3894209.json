We now dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In <em>State v. Nwobu, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>236, 241, 652 A.2d 1209 (1995), the Law Division admitted defendant into a PTI program over the rejection of the PTI director and objection of the Prosecutor. We granted leave to appeal, but the State never requested a stay of the enrollment pending the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 652 A.2d 1209. As a result, defendant moved to dismiss the appeal on grounds of double jeopardy after successfully completing the program while the appeal was still pending. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">We denied the motion and reversed the order of enrollment, and the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal. <em>Ibid. </em>While the Court found that defendant had no \u201creasonable expectation of finality,\u201d and rejected defendant\u2019s claim of double jeopardy by virtue of his completion of the PTI program, the matter was referred to the Criminal Practice Committee to study the issue and recommend rule changes which would \u201cavoid repetition of these circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 652 A.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In its 1994-1996 term report, the Committee recommended amendments of the Rules \u201cto provide for an automatic stay\u201d pending appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the defendant be so advised so that there would be no expectation of finality and no possible preclusion of an appeal by his or her participation in the PTI program. <em>See Report of the Committee on Criminal Practice 1994-96 Term, </em>143 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>640, Supp. 16 (Feb. 19, 1996). <em>See also State v. Ryan, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8-14, 429 A.2d 332, <em>cert. denied, </em>454 <em>U.S. </em>880, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>363, 70 L.Ed.2d 190 (1981) (stay of sentence pending appeal of the State required to prevent partial execution and double jeopardy); <em>R. </em>2:9-3(d) (stay following appeal by the State); <em>R. </em>2:9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Rule </em>2:2-3(a)(3) now provides that \u201c[f]inal judgments of a court, for appeal purposes, shall also include those referred to by <em>R. </em>3:28(f) (order enrolling defendant into the pretrial intervention program over the objection of the prosecutor).\u201d Consistent therewith, <em>Rule </em>3:28(f) was amended to provide in pertinent part: \u201c[a]n order enrolling a defendant into the pretrial intervention program over the prosecutor\u2019s objection shall be deemed final for purposes of appeal, as of right, and shall be automatically stayed for fifteen days following its entry and thereafter pending appellate review.\u201d At the same time, <em>Rule </em>2:9-3(e) was adopted on June 28, 1996, effective September 1,1996, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">(e) Stay of Order of Enrollment in a Pretrial Intervention Program. An order of the trial court enrolling a defendant into a pretrial intervention program over the objection of the prosecutor shall be automatically stayed for fifteen days following the date of its entry, and if the prosecutor files a notice of appeal within said fifteen-day period, during the pendency of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The import of these Rules is that the State must appeal from an order enrolling defendant into PTI over the prosecutor\u2019s objection within fifteen days in order to challenge such orders, which are appealable as of right but on an accelerated basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">As the State\u2019s appeal was not filed within the fifteen-day time limit, the State has not satisfied the requirements necessary to prevent the preclusionary effect of enrollment. The record before us includes no stay of program participation. To the contrary, the record contains an \u201corder of postponement\u201d entered on October 8, 2008, which, somewhat surprisingly, states in pre-printed 'language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">In accordance with the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-12 &amp; 13 <em>&amp; R. </em>3:28, and upon the recommendation of the PTI Director and with the consent of the Prosecutor and defendant to the attached listed terms and conditions of the supervisory treatment, it is ORDERED that all further proceedings be and are postponed for a period of 36 months beginning Aug. 28,2008.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The order also has the following language added by hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">This Order of Postponement is entered pursuant to the Order of Hon. Julie Marino dated 8/28/08 and attached hereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Clearly, the October 8, 2008, order cannot be the one deemed to commence the fifteen-day period. It expressly refers to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>program period, commencing August 28, 2008, as the date of the order overruling the Prosecutor\u2019s objection and enrolling defendant into the program. Further, the aforementioned Rules refer to the order of enrollment over the Prosecutor\u2019s objection. Moreover, the Prosecutor\u2019s notice of appeal was dated September 17, 2008, and filed September 22, 2008, weeks before the October 8, 2008, order and the, State appeals from the order of August 28, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As the defendant had an expectation of finality because the notice of appeal was not timely filed to prevent a preclusion by virtue of defendant\u2019s participation in the PTI program, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-14\"> The order read that \"Defendant's appeal of his Pretrial Intervention rejection is GRANTED and Defendant shall be enrolled in the Somerset County Pretrial Intervention Program.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-15\"> The order was \"prepared by the court\u201d and filed the same day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-8\"> As the report provides, the original recommendation was for a stay pending a motion for leave to appeal, but ultimately the recommendation was to treat the interlocutory order as final for puiposes of appealability.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
