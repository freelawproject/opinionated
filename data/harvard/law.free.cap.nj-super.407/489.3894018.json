The State contends that under the totality of the circumstances, the offense \u201ctouched upon\u201d defendant\u2019s offices, and the judge therefore properly banned defendant from all future public employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We have considered the arguments raised in light of the record and applicable legal principles. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Defendant was originally indicted by the Hunterdon County grand jury and charged with first-degree aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(7); and second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(c)(l). When initially charged, defendant was employed as an officer in the Hunterdon County Sheriffs Office, and a part-time police officer in Frenchtown. On January 17, 2008, pursuant to a plea agreement reached with the State, defendant, who was twenty-eight years old, pled guilty to an amended charge of criminal sexual contact with a sentencing recommendation of two years probation. The State agreed not to object to an earlier release from probation, after one year, if defendant \u201cfulfill[ed] all of his obligations.\u201d In addition, defendant agreed to resign from \u201claw enforcement employment^] effective as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of the date of his suspension[,]\u201d and further \u201cagree[d] not to seek any employment in law enforcement in this or any other state in the future.\u201d Defendant consented to the entry of an order to that effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Because the plea was to fourth-degree sexual contact and did not involve a minor victim, the provisions of Megan\u2019s Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -21, were not implicated. Defendant and the State agreed that \u201cthe ... decision for forfeiture will be made by the court at the time of sentencing.\u201d Defendant acknowledged understanding the terms of the plea bargain, responded appropriately to all the judge\u2019s questions regarding his decision to plead guilty, and told the judge, as to the forfeiture issue, \u201cIt\u2019s in your hands at this point with the arguments from both counsel.\u201d The following was the entire allocution with regard to the factual basis for the plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Defense Counsel: [0]n or about January 14th of 2006, were you in the presence of a young lady ... K[.JW[.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">Defense Counsel: And were you present with K[.]W[J in the County of Hunter-don?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">Defense Counsel: And in the Borough of Frenchtown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-12\">Defense Counsel: And while you were in the presence of K[.JW[.] ... did you touch her intimate parts including her buttocks?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-13\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">Defense Counsel: And did you do that without her freely-given consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">Defense Counsel: And did you do that for purposes of your own sexual gratification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">Defendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">The prosecutor accepted this allocution as adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-19\">The judge then asked a series of questions in which defendant explained that K.W. was an adult, \u201c[nineteen] or [twenty] at the time,\u201d and that he \u201cknew [her] prior to\u201d the events. When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>judge asked if there was \u201csome physical force\u201d involved, defense counsel noted that \u201c[t]he case law defines \u2018physical force\u2019 ... [as] the lack of freely-given consent.\u201d The judge responded with apparent recognition of this principle, referencing <em>State in re M.T.S., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>422, 609 A.2d 1266 (1992). A pre-sentence investigation report was ordered, and the parties agreed to brief the forfeiture issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">At sentencing, after considering the briefs and arguments of the attorneys, the judge initially noted that subsection (a) of the forfeiture statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2, was \u201cinapplicable\u201d because defendant had agreed to \u201cforfeit the office he currently holds.\u201d As to the issue of permanent forfeiture of all future public employment, citing <em>Moore v. Youth Corr. Inst., </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983 (1990), the judge listed those factors to be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">First, the Court must assess the gravity of the crime as revealed by its nature, context, [and] identity of the victim. Second, the Court must consider the qualifications required for the public employment. <em>Moore </em>explicitly rejected the proposition that merely because actions took place after hours or off duty they can not touch or involve a person\u2019s employment. LThe] Supreme Court held that is not relevant when [and] where the employee committed the erime[;J [it is] only relevant if the offense rendered suspect the employee\u2019s future service to the State both in the capacity of his employee job at the time of the conviction and in every other potential capacity. When the infraction casts a shadow over the employee as to make his or her continued service incompatible or appear to be incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, obedience to the law and order[,] forfeiture would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The judge then continued by comprehensively reviewing other precedent, which we discuss at length below.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Returning to the analysis in <em>Moore, </em>the judge considered the offense to which defendant had pled guilty. Noting that although only a fourth-degree crime, \u201cthat d[id]n\u2019t dimmish the seriousness of the offense involved.\u201d He further observed that \u201c[t]here was a victim,\u201d and defendant \u201ctook advantage of this individual who was incapacitated at the time.\u201d The judge further found that \u201cdefendant\u2019s actions were at direct odds with the duty to protect and serve the very community within which he was a police officer.\u201d Concluding the \u201cacts did involve and touch his public office,\u201d the judge granted the State\u2019s application for permanent forfeiture of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>all future public employment, and entered the order under review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Before beginning our analysis of the statutory language and precedent, it is prudent to establish several facts that are not disputed, and delineate those that are. In addition to the facts defendant admitted during his plea allocution, it is conceded that he was not on duty when the offense occurred, and that he did not display or in any way use indicia of his offices during the commission of the crime. It is further conceded that the sexual contact took place in K.W.\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In his brief, defendant includes additional factual allegations that were never disclosed during the plea allocution. For example, he claims that K.W. was his former girlfriend, and that he was at her apartment on the day in question \u201cat her invitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Our dissenting colleague references other facts that are contained in the pre-sentence report\u2019s \u201coffense circumstances\u201d section, which is part of the appellate record, and specifically referenced in the State\u2019s brief. Therein, it was alleged that K.W. and a friend had \u201cbeen drinking\u201d before defendant and his friend arrived at the apartment. It further provided that K.W. \u201ceventually fell asleep on her couch\u201d and did not discover, until the next morning, male ejaculate in her underwear and soreness in her vaginal area. K.W. alleged that both defendant and his friend denied having intercourse with her, but she later learned she was pregnant. DNA tests performed subsequently established with near certainty that defendant had fathered the fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">At oral argument before us, defendant reiterated that he only admitted to the facts contained in his plea allocution, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>contests, as he did below, any other allegations. Therefore, defendant contends that the determination of whether his offense \u201cinvolv[ed] or touch[ed] on\u201d his office permitted consideration of only those facts he admitted. The State has advanced no argument to the contrary. Our own research has not revealed any precedent in this State that would permit the trial judge to consider facts not proven at trial, or admitted to by defendant at the time of his guilty plea, in deciding whether the offense required forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d). Our dissenting colleague concedes there is \u201cno authority [that] allows consideration of contested facts when assessing defendant\u2019s conduct[.]\u201d <em>Post </em>at 516, 971 A.2d at 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">In the sentencing context, our Supreme Court has held that the exercise of the judge\u2019s broad discretion must be \u201cbased upon findings of fact that are grounded in competent, reasonably credible evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363, 471 A.2d 370 (1984) (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). Exactly what kind of evidence rises to the level of \u201ccompetent, reasonably credible evidence,\u201d however, may be open to some debate. <em>See </em>Cannel, <em>New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>comment 4 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1 (2008) (noting \u201c[m]any [ ] cases affirm all sorts of findings without discussion of the kinds of proof required\u201d). The Court has, however, noted a significant limitation upon the use of evidence not adduced specifically through a defendant\u2019s plea allocution.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">When a trial court imposes a sentence based on defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the defendant\u2019s admissions or factual version need not be the sole source of information for the court\u2019s sentencing decision. We have stated before that the court may look to other evidence in the record when making such determinations, that it should consider \u201cthe whole person\u201d, and all the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime. <em>What is important\u2014when the court goes beyond defendant\u2019s admission or factual version\u2014is that the court not sentence defendant for a crime that is not fairly embraced by the guilty plea.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\"><em>[State v. Sainz, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>283, 293, 526 A.2d 1015 (1987) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">\u201c[Forfeiture of office is a harsh penalty[.]\u201d <em>State v. Och, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 281, 852 A.2d 1143 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>182 <em>N.J. </em>150, 862 A.2d 58 (2004). But, it is, nonetheless, a civil remedy arising as a collateral consequence of a defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Old Bridge Public Wkrs. v. Old Bridge Twp., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 209-10, 555 A.2d 639 (App.Div.1989). Since a judge is permitted to look beyond a defendant\u2019s plea allocution in the context of imposing a criminal sentence, we concede arguendo without specifically deciding, that in some instances, consideration of extrinsic facts might be permissible to determine whether forfeiture of public employment is necessary under the statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If extrinsic facts are considered, however, it would appear that they must be supported by \u201ccompetent, reasonably credible evidence,\u201d and they may not be used by the court to order forfeiture based upon \u201ca crime that is not fairly embraced by the guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Our dissenting colleague argues that in considering whether defendant\u2019s offense involved or touched on his office, \u201c[a] view that gives weight only to the facts that defendant\u201d admitted \u201cfails to take into account the reality of the situation.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 516, 971 A.2d at 1118. In particular she cites to the pre-sentence report, and its allegations regarding the DNA test results, noting there is \u201cno reason to second guess certain evidence used to identify defendant as KW.\u2019s assailant[.]\u201d <em>Post </em>at 516, 971 A.2d at 1118. In reaching his decision, the trial judge found that defendant \u201ctook advantage of [K.W.] who was incapacitated at the time.\u201d Taken together, these two assertions imply 1) that defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with K.W.; and 2) that she was either asleep or inebriated to the point of incapacity at the time. In our opinion, using either of these factual allegations to support forfeiture in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>this case would essentially mean the decision was based upon \u201ca crime that [wa]s not fairly embraced by the guilty plea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">For example, consideration of the DNA evidence implies that defendant committed an act of \u201csexual penetration,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-l(c). \u201cSexual penetration\u201d is the essential element of \u201csexual assault,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2, which serves to distinguish that crime from \u201csexual contact\u201d in all its forms. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-3. Similarly, consideration of K.W.\u2019s \u201cincapacity\u201d implies she was \u201cphysically helpless\u201d or \u201cmentally incapacitated\u201d at the time of the offense. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-l(g) and (i) (respectively defining those terms as a \u201ccondition in which a person is unconscious or is physically unable to flee or is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to act,\u201d and a \u201ccondition in which a person is rendered temporarily incapable of understanding or controlling his conduct due to the influence of a[n] ... intoxicant, or other substance administered to that person without his prior knowledge or consent____\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sexual contact committed upon a victim in either state elevates the crime to \u201caggravated criminal sexual contact,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3(a). Defendant did not plead guilty to sexual assault, or aggravated criminal sexual contact, and we believe that consideration, therefore, of these factual allegations contained in the pre-sentence report, never admitted by defendant, is inappropriate in deciding the forfeiture issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">With this limitation in mind, we turn to the legal principles involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Having consented to the forfeiture of those positions he held at the time of sentencing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a), defendant\u2019s appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>limited solely to the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(d) to the facts at hand. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">In addition to the punishment prescribed for the offense, and the forfeiture set forth in subsection a. of <em>NJ.S.fA.] </em>2C:51-2, any person convicted of an offense involving or touching on his public office, position or employment shall be forever disqualified from holding any office or position of honor, trust or profit under this State or any of its administrative or political subdivisions. <em>As used in this subsection, \u201cinvolving or touching on his public office, position or employment\u201d means that the offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment held by the person.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\"><em>[NJ.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The highlighted portion of the statute is entirely new language added by the Legislature in 2007. <em>L. </em>2007, c. 49, \u00a7 5 (effective April 14, 2007).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Thus, unlike subsection (a) which requires forfeiture of a currently-held official position if the defendant is convicted of either \u201can offense involving dishonesty\u201d or \u201ca crime of the third degree or above,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a)(l), <em>or </em>\u201can offense involving or touching such office, position or employment[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a)(2), permanent forfeiture of all future public employment can only be ordered if the defendant is \u201cconvicted of an offense involving or touching on his public office, position or employment!;,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The Supreme Court noted this difference in <em>McCann v. Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001). There, the Court held the distinction</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">implies ... a determination on the part of the Legislature to limit the scope of the [permanent future] disqualification provision to crimes <em>that are related directly to an individual\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held by that individual. </em>When an individual commits a crime wholly unrelated to his or her public office, the crime ordinarily cannot be characterized as involving or touching on the public office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\"><em>[McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 321, 771 A.2d 1123 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Court continued by concluding that the permanent forfeiture provisions did not apply to deny a former mayor, who was convicted of various crimes while out of office, from seeking reelection because those crimes did not involve or touch upon his public office. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The <em>McCann </em>Court distinguished the facts presented from those previously considered in <em>Moore, supra. </em>There the defendant, a corrections officer, was convicted of harassing his supervisor, allegedly in retaliation for disciplinary charges that had been lodged against him. <em>Moore, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 259, 574 A.2d 983. The defendant made a harassing phone call to the supervisor\u2019s home, drove his truck onto the supervisor\u2019s lawn, and remained parked in the driveway before speeding off, only to return later and park nearby. <em>Id. </em>at 261, 574 A.2d 983. Later, the defendant was parked in his truck waiting as his supervisor arrived for work at the correctional facility. <em>Id. </em>at 262, 574 A.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">In considering whether the petty disorderly persons conviction for harassment warranted forfeiture, the Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">The inquiry into whether an offense involves and touches on employment to the extent of meriting forfeiture requires careful examination of the facts and the evaluation of various factors in the \u201cinvolve and touch\u201d analysis. First, there is a need to assess the gravity of the crime as revealed by its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim. Second, there is a need to assess the qualifications required of the employee\u2019s public employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 269, 574 A.2d 983.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">At the outset, the <em>Moore </em>Court \u201crejected] [the defendant\u2019s] contention that if the offense d[id] not take place during employment hours or on employment grounds, it d[id] not involve or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>touch employment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, \u201cit is the substance of the crime, not whether it was committed during work hours or on work premises, that should determine whether the offense \u2018involved and touched\u2019 employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 574 A.2d 983. \u201cWhen the infraction casts such a shadow over the employee as to make his or her continued service appear incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, and obedience to law and order, then forfeiture is appropriate.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The Court in <em>McCann, </em>however, noted that \u201c[t]he narrow question in <em>Moore </em>was whether conduct committed during non-business hours and off the premises of the correctional facility ... could be considered to involve or touch on [the defendant\u2019s] employment for purposes of forfeiture.\u201d <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 322, 771 A.2d 1123. Regarding the language from Moore cited above, the <em>McCann </em>court cautioned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">[T]h[at] language ... should be understood in the context of the facts critical to our disposition, and it was undisputed that the petitioner\u2019s harassment of his co-employee in <em>Moore </em>bore a direct and substantial relationship to their respective governmental positions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 322-23, 771 A.2d 1123.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">A number of our subsequent decisions have tried to reconcile the holdings in <em>Moore </em>and <em>McCann, </em>considering specifically the statutory \u201cinvolving and touching\u201d language in the context of offenses committed by off-duty law enforcement officers. The trial judge referenced several of them, and we concede the contour of the landscape painted by these holdings is less than well-defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">In <em>State v. Gismondi, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 186, 801 A.2d 1178 (App.Div.2002), we affirmed the permanent forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s position as a police officer based upon his conviction for harassment, finding his off-duty conduct \u201cb[ore] striking similarities\u201d to that of the defendant in <em>Moore. </em>We summarized the conduct underlying the defendant\u2019s conviction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">[I]n an adjacent community in which [the defendant] might well be called on to serve, he drove a truck on a wide-roaming drunken spree with a fellow officer in which an African-American neighborhood was terrorized, a trumped-up 911 call was made, a police service revolver was discharged, police badges were flashed to ward off attempts to investigate their conduct and no report was made to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>superiors. Such conduct not only demonstrates bad judgment, but also <em>[the </em>defendant]^ participation in an abuse of authority resulting in the disruption of the public peace and exposure to the risk of harm of the lives and property of the citizens [the defendant] was sworn to protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 189, 801 A.2d 1178.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We concluded that such \u201cconduct meets the more stringent standard announced in <em>McCann </em>of a \u2018direct and substantial relationship\u2019 to [the defendant]^ governmental position.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">In <em>State v. Williams, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 810 A.2d 1169 (App.Div.2002), the defendant, an off-duty Bayonne police officer, was convicted of fourth-degree aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1(b)(4), \u201cpointing a firearm in the direction of another under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d <em>Williams, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 582-83, 810 A.2d 1169. At trial, he testified that during a heated traffic encounter, and believing his wife was in danger, he displayed his badge, identified himself as a police officer, and fired his service revolver striking the victim\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>at 584, 810 A.2d 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">In reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of the State\u2019s forfeiture petition, we noted \u201c[t]he [ ] judge\u2019s reliance upon <em>McCann </em>[wa]s misplaced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 586, 810 A.2d 1169. Likening the facts presented as more akin to those in <em>Moore, </em>and reconciling the two Supreme Court precedents, we concluded that \u201cthe Court in <em>McCann </em>simply elucidated, without narrowing, the definition of conduct that involves or touches upon a public position; it is conduct that bears \u2018some direct relationship\u2019 to the office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 810 A.2d 1169 (quoting <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 320, 771 A.2d 1123). We held that the defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal conduct bore a direct relationship to his job and thus involved or touched his position as a police officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Lastly, in <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>663, 664-65, 893 A.2d 60 (App.Div.2006), the defendant, an off-duty police officer, drove through a red light, struck and killed a pedestrian, and fled the scene without stopping. He was convicted of third-degree leaving the scene of a fatal accident, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-5.1, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>various motor vehicle offenses.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 665, 893 A.2d 60. The trial judge ordered the forfeiture of his position as a police officer, as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l) because defendant was convicted. of a crime of the third degree. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 893 A.2d 60. The judge further ordered a permanent, future forfeiture of all public employment, <em>id. </em>at 665, 893 A.2d 60, which upon review we addressed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">We disagree with [the defendant\u2019s] argument ... that his off-duty behavior did not sufficiently involve or touch upon his position as a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">We do not consider defendant\u2019s conduct here to be any less egregious or any less connected with his duties as a police officer than the behavior of the off-duty officers in <em>Gismondi </em>and <em>Williams. </em>In particular, we reject defendant\u2019s assertion that the offense of which he was convicted was \u201ca very low level offense\u201d as to which future disqualification pursuant to the dictates of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) was inappropriate. On the contrary, his conviction of third-degree leaving the scene of a fatal accident was based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that there had been an accident and that he knowingly left the scene. Although the State, in order to secure defendant\u2019s conviction, was not required to prove he also knew that a pedestrian had been killed, that fact was one the judge could permissibly consider as part of the future disqualification analysis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aov\">In light of the fact that reporting to accident scenes and attending to the safety of the public are important parts of any police officer\u2019s duties, we think it plain that defendant\u2019s off-duty behavior that resulted in his conviction of this offense sufficiently involved and touched upon his position that future disqualification was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 668-69, 893 A.2d 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Since <em>McCann </em>was decided, we have also considered the issue of conduct \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d upon a defendant\u2019s public employment in circumstances where the defendant was not a law enforcement officer. In <em>State v. Pavlik, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307, 309, 832 A.2d 940 (App.Div.2003), the defendant, a laborer in the municipal Department of Public Works, was convicted in the municipal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of assorted disorderly persons offenses that stemmed from a violent domestic dispute between him and his grandfather. The trial judge ordered forfeiture under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(2) finding the offenses involved or touched upon the defendant\u2019s position. <em>Ibid. </em>In reversing, we concluded \u201cforfeiture requires a finding of a nexus between the defendant\u2019s conduct and his position or employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 832 A.2d 940. Specifically noting <em>McCann\u2019s </em>limitation of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>holding to the facts presented, we further concluded \u201cas a matter of common sense, the phrase \u2018involving or touching such office, position or employment\u2019 requires some nexus between the conduct and the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312, 832 A.2d 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We believe it noteworthy that when all these cases were decided, neither subsection (a) nor subsection (d) of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 contained any definitional language regarding the phrase, \u201cinvolving or touching,\u201d as used in the statute. The Legislature explained its intention, however, in amending the statute in 2007 to include a definition of the terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">Th[isJ bill amends current law concerning forfeiture of public office to include a definition of the phrase concerning crimes and offenses \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d public office or employment, in accordance with the definition set forth by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>McCann v. Clerk of </em>[ ] <em>Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001). It provides that a crime or offense \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d public office or employment means that the crime or offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held by the person. <em>As </em>the Supreme Court stated in <em>McCann: </em>\u201cWhen an individual commits a crime wholly unrelated to his or her public office, the crime ordinarily cannot be characterized as involving or touching on the public office.\u201d [Comments accompanying <em>L. </em>2007, c. 49.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Thus, the Legislature clearly intended to \u201camend current law,\u201d adopt the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>McCann, </em>and limit future permanent forfeiture to only those situations where a defendant\u2019s \u201ccrime or offense\u201d 1) \u201crelated directly to the person\u2019s performance in ... a specific public office or position held by the person\u201d; or 2) \u201crelated directly to ... circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held by the person.\u201d One noted commentator has observed that the amendment was intended \u201cto narrow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the definition of touching public office as it applies to [ ] subsection [ (d) ].\u201d Cannel, <em>supra, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">From the foregoing, we think it clear that the trial judge\u2019s extensive reliance upon the factors enunciated in <em>Moore </em>was misplaced. The Court in <em>McCann </em>explicitly limited <em>Moore </em>to its facts, and the Legislature has since acted, expressly adopting the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>McCann, </em>and rejecting what it described as the then \u201ccurrent law.\u201d As a result, the permanent future forfeiture of public employment required by subsection (d) is limited only to convictions that meet the statutory definition. We reject the State\u2019s contention made before us at oral argument that subsection (d) permits the exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion in its application. Once a violation of the statute is proven, \u201centry of an order of forfeiture is mandatory and automatic in all but one limited instance.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Och, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 281, 852 A.2d 1143 (citing <em>In re Vitacco, </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>337, 343, 790 A.2d 178 (App.Div.2002)); <em>State v.

Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>874 A.2d 1039 (2005)); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-2(c) (requiring \u201c[t]he provisions of the Code [to] be construed according to the fair import of their terms\u201d). \u201c[W]hen a statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, we need delve no deeper that (sic) the act\u2019s literal terms to divine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Smith, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 333, 963 A.2d 281 (internal quotations omitted). However, if \u201cthe statute contains some ambiguity ... it is permissible to turn to extrinsic evidence for aid in interpreting [it].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In such circumstances, we look to the \u201clegislative history, committee reports, and contemporaneous construction.\u201d <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 493, 874 A.2d 1039 (quotations and citations omitted); <em>see </em>N.J.S.A 2C:l-2(c) (\u201cwhen the [statutory] language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this section and the special purposes of the particular provision involved\u201d); and <em>see </em>Cannel, <em>supra, </em>comment 4 on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-2(c) (noting this \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d is a \u201csupplement\u201d to \u201ccommon law maxims\u201d of statutory construction). We believe the amendatory language adopted by the Legislature is clear on its face and requires no resort to extrinsic tools for interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Permanent future forfeiture is required if \u201cthe offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in ... the specific public office, position or employment held by the person.\u201d Thus, if the offense occurs while a defendant is performing the functions of his office, and arises from some illegal, and obviously unauthorized, act, forfeiture is required. Similarly, if the offense occurs not while the defendant is performing the functions of his office, but is \u201crelated directly\u201d to the defendant\u2019s performance in that position, forfeiture is also required.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">So, for example, when a police lieutenant was convicted of disorderly persons offenses for stealing a rifle he took possession of during a municipal gun buy-back program, forfeiture was appropriate. <em>State v. Medina, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>108, 115-122, 793 A.2d 68 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>193, 803 A.2d 1165 (2002). In <em>State v. Lazarchick, </em>314 <em>N.J.Super. </em>500, 505-08, 527, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>715 A.2d 365 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>546, 724 A.2d 804 (1998), <em>overruled on other grounds, Flagg v. Essex Cty. Pros., </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 796 A.2d 182 (2002), the defendant, convicted of simple assault and harassment stemming from his traffic stop of a citizen, was required to forfeit his position because the offense \u201cinvolved and touched upon defendant\u2019s employment as a police officer.\u201d Forfeiture was also appropriate when the defendants/corrections officers were convicted of disorderly persons offenses involving their assault on a prison inmate under their supervision, <em>State v. Pitman, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 24-26, 492 A.2d 680 (App.Div.1985), or when a corrections officer was convicted of disorderly persons theft offenses when he submitted salary reimbursement vouchers, for his pay, falsely claiming he was at National Guard service on the days in question. <em>State v. Lee, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 314-15, 609 A.2d 513 (App.Div.1992). In such cases, the defendants\u2019 misconduct was \u201cdirectly related to [their] employment,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 319, 609 A.2d 513, and the performance of their duties, even though the specific conduct was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Additionally, under the statute as amended, permanent future forfeiture is required if \u201cthe offense was related directly to ... circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment held by the person.\u201d By including this alternative category of offenses, we must assume the Legislature intended to reach other kinds of misconduct in which there was a direct relation between the offense and other circumstances of the public position, though not necessarily involving the performance of the duties of the position. Thus, under this construction, the facts in <em>Gismondi </em>and <em>Williams </em>would still require forfeiture because in each ease, although the defendant was not performing the duties of his position, and the offense did not relate directly to the performance of those duties, the offense nonetheless involved other circumstances that \u201cflow[ed] from\u201d the position. In <em>Gismondi, </em>the defendant and his fellow officer engaged in a \u201cwide-roaming drunken spree ... in which ... a police service revolver was discharged, police badges were flashed to ward off attempts to investigate their conduct and no report was made to [defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>dant\u2019s] superiors.\u201d <em>Gismondi, supra, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 189, 801 A.2d 1178. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant displayed his badge, identified himself as a police officer, and discharged his service weapon. <em>Williams, supra, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 584, 810 A.2d 1169. In short, there was a direct relationship between the offense and the \u201ccircumstances flowing from[ ] the specific public positional\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Indeed, we have little doubt that the result in <em>Moore </em>would still be the same under the new statutory definition. Though the defendant\u2019s conduct there was not directly related to the performance of his duties as a corrections officer, it was directly related to \u201ccircumstances flowing\u201d from that position. The defendant\u2019s victim was not some private citizen, but rather was his supervisor, who was targeted because he brought disciplinary charges against the defendant. As the Supreme Court noted, the defendant\u2019s misconduct \u201cbore a direct and substantial relationship to <em>their </em>respective governmental positions.\u201d <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 323, 771 A.2d 1123 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>we attempted to reconcile <em>McCann\u2019s </em>standard, essentially adopted by the Legislature and codified in the amendatory language, with the facts presented. Specifically, we noted a nexus between the defendant\u2019s position as a police officer, and his conviction for leaving the scene of an accident \u201c[i]n light of the fact that reporting to accident scenes and attending to the safety of the public are important parts of any police officer\u2019s duties[.]\u201d <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 669, 893 A.2d 60. <em>Rodriguez </em>was decided before the new definitional language was added to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d). Because the issue is not before us, we hazard no opinion whether the defendant\u2019s offense in <em>Rodriguez </em>\u201cwas related directly to [his] performance in, or circumstances flowing from,\u201d his position as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Turning to the circumstances of this case, we conclude that defendant\u2019s offense clearly did not directly relate to his \u201cperformance in\u201d the position of sheriff\u2019s officer or police officer. The offense occurred while off-duty, in a private home involving someone defendant knew, as opposed to a member of the public, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>had no nexus to his positions in law enforcement. Nor was defendant\u2019s offense \u201crelated directly to circumstances flowing from\u201d his positions. Defendant did not use or threaten the use of his offices in any way to commit the offense. He did not display or utilize any indicia of his offices at any time. The offense was not related to any circumstance that flowed from defendant being a sheriffs officer or a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Our dissenting colleague argues that defendant\u2019s criminal conduct, and whether it required forfeiture because it touched or involved his office, must be examined in \u201clight\u201d of his status as a law enforcement officer, a \u201cspecial Mnd of public employee.\u201d <em>Twp. of Moorestown v. Armstrong, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 566, 215 A.2d 775 (App.Div.1965), <em>certif. denied, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>80, 219 A.2d 417 (1966). She further notes that \u201call of the proven circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s commission of the crime, demonstrates a deviation from law-abiding conduct, which remains the hallmark of a police officer.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 517, 971 A.2d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In this regard, she echoes an argument the State made in its brief, contending that defendant\u2019s duties as a law enforcement officer included the obligation to \u201cobey the law,\u201d making \u201cdefendant theoretically [culpable] of the crime of official misconduct[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:30-2, for committing any offense under the Criminal Code. In turn, the State contended every offense committed by a sworn law enforcement officer should result in permanent future forfeiture because it would involve or touch upon the position. At oral argument, the State specifically abandoned that position, arguing instead that the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d surrounding the offense needed to be considered under <em>Moore. </em>Despite the State\u2019s abandonment of this contention, we address it briefly in light of the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We agree that law enforcement officers occupy a unique status and their \u201cobligation to act in a responsible manner is especially compelling.\u201d <em>In re Phillips, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>567, 576, 569 A.2d 807 (1990). However, if we extend our colleague\u2019s argument to its logical conclusion, a conviction for any offense, no matter how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>trivial, committed by such an officer would automatically result in the forfeiture of his present position and any future public employment. Had the legislature intended such a result, it clearly could have said so. <em>See State v. Gelman, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>475, 487, 950 A.2d 879 (2008) (recognizing the Legislature\u2019s ability to \u201cdraft language to accomplish [its] objective\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In interpreting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2, \u201cOfficial Misconduct,\u201d our courts have consistently recognized that not every offense committed by a law enforcement officer results in a violation of the statute. <em>See State v. Hinds, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>540, 549, 674 A.2d 161 (1996) (noting, in considering off-duty police officer\u2019s conduct, \u201cnot every offense committed by a public official involves official misconduct\u201d). Instead it is only \u201cwhen law-enforcement officers commit an act of malfeasance <em>because of the office they hold or because of the opportunity afforded by that office, </em>[that] their conduct sufficiently relates to their office to support a conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:30-2(a).\u201d <em>State v. Bullock, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>149, 157, 642 A.2d 397 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Lastly, as we have already noted, in amending the forfeiture statute to define the terms \u201cinvolving or touching,\u201d the Legislature further limited the statute\u2019s reach to the defendant\u2019s \u201cperformance in, or circumstances flowing from, the <em>specific public office, position or employment </em>\u201d held by the defendant. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) (emphasis added). The obligation to obey the criminal laws of this state is not \u201cspecific\u201d to the public offices defendant held. Rather, it is a responsibility imposed upon everyone in society. As Chief Justice Weintraub eloquently explained nearly fifty years ago,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">All persons have the \u201cduty\u201d to obey the law. More accurately, there is no \u201cduty\u201d but rather a liability to punishment.

If defendant was convicted of a crime constituting \u201can offense involving or touching on his public office, position or employment,\u201d future disqualification is mandated. <em>Ibid.; State v. Rodriguez, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>663, 666, 893 A.2d 60 (App.Div.2006). I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the sexual assault downgraded to fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3(b), committed \u201cwhile [defendant was] off-duty, in a private home involving someone defendant knew, as opposed to a member of the public, [ ] had no nexus to his position in law enforcement.\u201d Therefore, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">I cannot accede to the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute that mandates disqualification only for conduct performed in the course of performing public duties or while invoking the trappings of the office. Our courts have repeatedly noted the nature of the responsibilities of the office itself must be considered when analyzing whether the person was \u201cconvicted of an offense involving or touching on his public office.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d). <em>See Moore v. Youth Corr. Inst., </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 270, 574 A.2d 983 (1990) (\u201c[w]hen the infraction casts such a shadow over the employee as to make his or her continued service appear incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, and obedience to law and order, then forfeiture is appropriate.\u201d); <em>McCann v. Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 322, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001) (forfeiture was not warranted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>because the criminal offenses were committed while the plaintiff was not employed as a public official and thus bore no direct relationship to the public responsibilities during his public service); <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>383 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 669, 893 A.2d 60 (off-duty police officer who failed to report a hit and run accident he caused was subject to future disqualification, as reporting to accident scenes and attending to the safety of the public are important parts of any police officer\u2019s duties).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Even though these authorities were rendered prior to the statute\u2019s April 14, 2007 amendment, the Legislature\u2019s added language requiring a nexus between the conduct and the employment, such that a conviction is \u201crelated directly to an individual\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held,\u201d would not change the conclusions as the statute\u2019s standard has been in effect since first enunciated by the Court in <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 321, 771 A.2d 1123. Further, application of this standard does not eliminate the need for an examination of whether the offense is incompatible with the performance in the specific public office held. In fact, <em>McCann </em>requires just such an analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>McCann </em>involved an action filed by a political candidate who had previously served as the Mayor of Jersey City. The portion of the Court\u2019s examination applicable to this matter reviewed whether the forfeiture statute precluded plaintiffs current candidacy for the upcoming mayoral election due to his past convictions for various federal charges, involving mail fraud, wire fraud, false swearing, and income tax evasion, committed while he was not in office. <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 312, 771 A.2d 1123. The Court determined that because the crimes occurred while the plaintiff was in the private sector, \u201cthere [wa]s no indication in the record that any direct relationship exist[ed] between the offenses and his mayoral responsibilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 771 A.2d 1123. The Court concluded McCann was not subject to disqualification under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d), because \u201cinquiry under subsection (d) is limited to determining whether McCann\u2019s offenses touched upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>either of his specific tenures as Mayor of Jersey City[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, a review of whether forfeiture was warranted entailed an analysis of whether the crime committed bore a relationship to the responsibilities of the public office then held. <em>Ibid. </em>Because McCann was not in a public office when he evaded his income tax obligations and committed other offenses, he could not be said to have engaged in conduct that abused the public trust or responsibilities associated with his public employment. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The amendment to N.J.S.A 2C:51-2(d) echoes this requirement, as the legislative comments specifically state an intention to adopt the definition enunciated in <em>McCann. </em>Comments accompanying <em>L. </em>2007, c. 49. That amendment neither suggests nor implies a rejection of past court precedent, which examines the context of the offense as it relates to the public responsibilities of the employment at hand. Every case requires an analysis of whether a defendant\u2019s conduct is inconsistent with \u201cthe degree of care and responsibility expected of an employee\u201d in the specific position held. <em>State v. Pavlik, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>307, 311, 832 A.2d 940 (App.Div.2003). The application of such an analysis to this matter is provided below.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Additionally, the unique circumstances reviewed in <em>McCann, </em>that is, whether criminal acts committed while not in public office can preclude future public service, are not presented here. Defendant was employed and held the public offices of police and sheriffs officer at the time he assaulted the victim, K.W. In my view, that dissimilarity from the facts in <em>McCann </em>renders a distinguishably different result, particularly as it relates to an examination of whether the crimes committed bore a \u201cdirect relationship to the responsibilities\u201d of those offices.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">In the context of disciplinary proceedings, this court has identified the unique responsibilities of law enforcement officers. Specifically we have recognized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201ca police officer is a special kind of public employee. His primary duty is to enforce and uphold the law. He carries a service revolver on his person and is constantly called upon to exercise tact, restraint and good judgment in his relationship with the public. He represents law and order to the citizenry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>must present an image of personal integrity and dependability in order to have the respect of the public, particularly in a small community.....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\"><em>[Township of Moorestown v. Armstrong, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 566, 215 A.2d 775 (App.Div.1965), <em>certif. denied, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>80, 219 A.2d 417 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-8\"><em>See also, In re Carter, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>474, 486, 924 A.2d 525 (2007); <em>In re Disciplinary Procedures of Phillips, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>567, 577, 569 A.2d 807 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Even though these precedents do not arise in an examination of whether forfeiture applies, they aptly describe the responsibilities of police officers, <em>State v. Gismondi, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 185, 801 A.2d 1178 (App.Div.2002), who like those of judges or lawyers, require the taking of an oath to uphold the law. These positions \u201crequire a high level of honesty, integrity, sensitivity, and fairness in dealing with members of the public, knowledge of the law, and a pattern and exhibition of law-abiding conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, the responsibilities of those exclusive positions give the people who hold them an elevated societal position, accompanied by an implied enhanced responsibility of good behavior as one \u201c \u2018who stands in the public eye as an upholder of that which is morally and legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hartmann v. Police Dept. of Ridgewood, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>32, 40, 609 A.2d 61 (App.Div.1992) (quoting <em>Appeal of Emmons, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 140, 164 A.2d 184 (App.Div.1960)). If this were not so, it would tend to destroy public respect of and confidence in the value of upholding the law itself. It is in that light defendant\u2019s criminal conduct is examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">Here, defendant pled guilty to fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3(b), regarding the assault of twenty year old K.W. As noted, the events occurred on January 13, 2006, while defendant, then age twenty-eight was at K.W.\u2019s residence. K.W.\u2019s discovery of her attacker\u2019s identity was compromised and delayed by the fact that the attack occurred while she slept. Almost one year later, following the termination of KW.\u2019s pregnancy and the State\u2019s receipt of expert DNA evidence that reflected defendant was 99.9% likely the father of the fetus, an indictment issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">In making a determination of whether to impose permanent future forfeiture, the court may consider other evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>record, and is not restricted to the factual basis admitted by the defendant. Although I concede no authority allows consideration of contested facts when assessing defendant\u2019s conduct, I see no reason to second guess certain evidence used to identify defendant as K.W.\u2019s assailant, which was considered by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The majority aptly identifies the broad discretion of a court in reviewing facts prior to sentencing following a defendant\u2019s guilty plea as stated by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Sainz, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>283, 293, 526 A.2d 1015 (1987). The Court stated: \u2018When a trial court imposes a sentence based on defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the defendant\u2019s admissions or factual version need not be the sole source of information for the court\u2019s sentencing decision.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because forfeiture is a civil remedy arising as a collateral consequence of a defendant\u2019s conviction, I conclude the trial court\u2019s broad discretion allows consideration of extrinsic established facts. For the same reason, I disagree with the majority\u2019s suggestion that the use of established collateral facts is limited and cannot result in an order of forfeiture based upon \u201ca crime that is not fairly embraced by the guilty plea.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u201cForfeiture is not a sentencing disposition!!.]\u201d <em>Old Bridge Public Workers and Sanitation Union v. Tp. of Old </em>Bridge, 231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 209, 555 A.2d 639 (App.Div.1989) (citing <em>State v. Heitzman, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 604, 527 A.2d 439 (1987)). \u201cWhile a judgment or order imposing a civil penalty may be incorporated in the sentence, it remains a civil remedy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The limitation on use of extrinsic facts imposed in sentencing a criminal defendant is inapplicable in this civil matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Here, a view that gives weight only to the facts that defendant committed the unlawful sexual contact, while off duty, to a known victim, without invoking his status as an officer, leading to a conclusion that the crime is unrelated to his office, fails to take into account the reality of the situation. Unquestionably, defendant who is more than eight years older than the victim, performed the sexual contact for his own sexual gratification. In my view, it matters not that defendant knew K.W., the assault oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>eurred in her home, or that defendant was off-duty at the time. <em>Moore, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, 574 A.2d 983; <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 669, 893 A.2d 60; <em>Gismondi, supra, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 189, 801 A.2d 1178. This was a flagrant offense, not a de minimus encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Consideration of all of the proven circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s commission of the crime, demonstrates a deviation from law-abiding conduct, which remains the hallmark of a police officer. Assuredly, the conduct is an offense \u201cdirectly related\u201d to defendant\u2019s \u201cperformance in\u201d the position of his public law enforcement employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cIt is the public policy of this State that \u2018person[s] holding any public office, position or employment\u2019 must avoid committing serious criminal acts or offenses which involve or touch upon their governmental duties, or sacrifice their right to governmental employment. This is a harsh response to a problem serious enough to justify the harshness. The purpose is to prevent miscreants and corrupt officials from again holding office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\"><em>[Cedeno v.
