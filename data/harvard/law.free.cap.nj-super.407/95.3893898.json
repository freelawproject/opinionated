He appeals from the October 23, 2007 final judgment of conviction, contending that he was improperly excluded from the pre-trial intervention program (PTI). <em>See R. </em>3:28(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Following his indictment for three related third-degree CDS offenses, based on his alleged sale of $150 worth of cocaine to an undercover detective, defendant attempted to apply to the Monmouth County Vicinage Criminal Division for admission to PTI. However, he received a Notice of PTI Ineligibility dated January 23, 2007 from the Criminal Division Manager. The notice advised that his case had \u201cbeen pre-screened by the Monmouth County Criminal Division\u201d and that defendant would not be permitted to apply for PTI without the prosecutor\u2019s written consent \u201cin accordance with the guidelines for PTI outlined in\u201d <em>Rule </em>3:28.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The pre-printed notice checked off as the reasons for rejection: that defendant was charged with selling Schedule II narcotic drugs, an offense carrying a presumption of imprisonment; that the prosecutor had not joined in his application; and that defendant had not shown \u201ccompelling reasons justifying [his] admission and establishing that a decision against enrollment would be arbitrary and unreasonable\u201d (citing <em>Rule </em>3:28, Guidelines 2, 3i and 3e). However, it appears from the record that the Criminal Division never actually permitted defendant to apply and therefore never considered the possible merits of such an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Thereafter, defendant corresponded with the prosecutor\u2019s office, providing significant evidence of his rehabilitation during the period between the October 2005 incident on which the charges were based, and the January 2007 indictment. Stating that there was nothing \u201cextraordinary\u201d or \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d about defendant\u2019s situation, the prosecutor declined to join in a PTI application. Thereafter, it appears undisputed that the Criminal Division never actually considered an application from defendant, but instead precluded him from applying at all without the prosecutor\u2019s consent. On July 12, 2007, defendant filed a \u201cNotice of Appeal from Pretrial Intervention (PTI) Rejection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">From the transcript of the oral argument of defendant\u2019s eventual PTI appeal, we discern that the Criminal Division\u2019s practice had been to preclude a defendant charged with certain crimes from applying for PTI without a letter of agreement from the prosecutor\u2019s office. While the judge indicated on the record that the system had been revised, because it allowed the prosecutor to, in essence, \u201cshort-circuit\u201d a defendant\u2019s right to even apply for PTI, it does not appear that Green had the benefit of any such change.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In response to defense counsel\u2019s inquiry, the judge responded that defendant was \u201carguing for the ability to apply\u201d to PTI. The judge confirmed that \u201cif I grant the ability to apply, I\u2019m not putting the defendant into the PTI Program. I\u2019m then allowing the director [of the Criminal Division] to do a full evaluation\u201d and make a recommendation. While acknowledging that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>had not even been allowed to apply for PTI, the judge nonetheless rejected the appeal on the grounds that the prosecutor\u2019s refusal to join in the application was not a gross and patent abuse of discretion. We conclude this was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">We do not reach defendant\u2019s appellate contentions concerning whether he should have been admitted to PTI. Instead, we reverse and remand this matter on procedural grounds, because we conclude that defendant was mistakenly deprived of the opportunity to apply for PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">It is clear from <em>Rule </em>3:28 that the Criminal Division must at least allow a defendant to submit an application to PTI, and must evaluate the application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">Application for pretrial intervention shall be made at the earliest possible opportunity, including before indictment, but in any event no later than twenty-eight days after indictment. The criminal division manager shall complete the evaluation and make a recommendation within twenty-five days of the filing of the application. The prosecutor shall complete a review of the application and inform the court and defendant within fourteen days of the receipt of the criminal division manager\u2019s recommendation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\"><em>[B. </em>3:28(h).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-10\"><em>See State v. Brooks, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>215, 223-24, 814 A.2d 1051 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The PTI Guidelines explicitly provide that all defendants must be permitted to apply, and the Criminal Division Manager must consider the merits of the application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\"><em>Amy defendant accused of crime shall be eligible for admission into a PTI program. </em>When the application indicates factors which would ordinarily lead to exclusion under the guidelines ... the applicant nevertheless shall have the opportunity to present to the criminal division manager, and through the criminal division manager to the prosecutor, any facts or materials demonstrating the defendant\u2019s amenability to the rehabilitative process, showing compelling reasons justifying the defendant\u2019s admission, and establishing that a decision against enrollment would be arbitrary and unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">[ft. 3:28, Guideline 2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">Guideline 3(i) does provide that defendants charged with the sale of Schedule I or II narcotic drugs \u201cshould ordinarily not be considered for enrollment\u201d in PTI unless the prosecutor joins in the application. However, this does not mean that such defendants can be denied the opportunity to apply in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Guideline 3(i) further provides that even \u201cin such cases, the applicant shall have the opportunity to present to the criminal division manager, and <em>through the criminal division manager to the prosecutor, </em>any facts or materials demonstrating the applicant\u2019s amenability to the rehabilitation process ...\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Official Comment on Guideline 3(i) to <em>R. </em>3:28 (2009). While the prosecutor has enormous influence over a defendant\u2019s admission to PTI, the Criminal Division Manager cannot short-circuit a defendant\u2019s statutory right to apply for PTI, even if the application is unlikely to receive a favorable recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We gather from the record that the Monmouth Criminal Division changed its procedures to recognize these principles, but this defendant did not have the benefit of the new procedures. Because defendant was not given the opportunity to make his application to the Criminal Division Manager, we reverse the order on appeal and remand to permit defendant to submit his PTI application to the Criminal Division Manager, who shall consider the application on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-8\"> As illustrated in <em>State v. Negran, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>73, 78-79, 835 A.2d 301 (2003), there will be times when the Criminal Division Manager supports a defendant\u2019s admission to PTI, while the prosecutor opposes it; the prosecutor\u2019s views do not always prevail. <em>Id. </em>at 83-85, 835 A.2d 301.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
