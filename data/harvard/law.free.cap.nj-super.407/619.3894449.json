We affirm. The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our consideration of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">The crimes that led to W.X.C.\u2019s present commitment all took place in 1992 when W.X.C. was twenty-five years old. W.X.C. burglarized his first victim\u2019s home twice when she was not in the house. On April 17, 1992, W.X.C. entered the home for a third time and, at knifepoint, raped the victim, a young woman. After committing the assault, W.X.C. demanded money and, when the victim had none, stole her VCR. According to various psychological reports, W.X.C. found it sexually exciting to be in the victim\u2019s home during the first two burglaries, even while she was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">On June 4, 1992, W.X.C. entered another home, this time using a key he had found outside, and raped a woman after telling her he had a gun. W.X.C. then made her drive him to an ATM machine, where he forced her to withdraw and give him approximately $600. He also stole two of the victim\u2019s rings. On October 22, 1992, W.X.C. entered a rest home and overpowered a female employee. He dragged her into an empty bedroom and demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that she perform an oral sex act on him. The police were called and W.X.C. attempted to flee but was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In his statement to the police, W.X.C. admitted to committing all three assaults. On October 5, 1993, pursuant to a negotiated agreement, W.X.C. pled guilty to two counts of first degree aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:.14-2(a), first degree kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-l(b), and two counts of first degree armed robbery, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1. The plea agreement called for various consecutive and concurrent sentences, aggregating twenty-four years imprisonment, with a twelve-year period of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Prior to his sentencing, Dr. Mark Frank, a clinical psychologist, evaluated W.X.C. to determine if he should be committed to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (ADTC) for sex offender treatment, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:47-1 to -8; <em>R. </em>3:21-3. Dr. Frank determined that \u201cthe \u2018taking\u2019 of sex by [W.X.C.] has no more meaning for him than the taking of money or property.\u201d Based on this finding, Dr. Frank determined that W.X.C.\u2019s criminal sexual behavior was not compulsive and he was therefore not a viable candidate for sex offender treatment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-1. Dr. Frank also noted that W.X.C. had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and recommended that he receive psychotherapy and attend drug and alcohol treatment programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The trial judge sentenced W.X.C. on April 4, 1994. W.X.C. requested that the court consider that he had admitted to committing the subject offenses, that he was remorseful, and that he himself was sexually abused as a child. After finding no mitigating factors applied, the judge sentenced W.X.C. to twelve years of imprisonment for his kidnapping charge, with a six-year period of parole ineligibility, to run consecutively with a twelve-year term, with a six-year period of parole ineligibility for the two counts of aggravated sexual assault and the two counts of armed robbery. W.X.C. subsequently filed a pro se motion to amend the sentence, arguing that the judge erred in not finding W.X.C.\u2019s own history of sexual abuse as a child to be a mitigating factor. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>judge denied his motion. W.X.C. later admitted, during subsequent evaluations, that he was not abused as a child but lied in the hope that his sentence would be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">W.X.C.\u2019s criminal record prior to the subject sexual assaults revealed seven adjudications of delinquency as a juvenile, which included assault, burglary, and possession of a controlled dangerous substance. As an adult, his convictions included obstructing police and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On April 23, 2007, prior to WXC.\u2019s scheduled release from prison, the State filed a petition to civilly commit him under the SVPA. W.X.C. filed a motion arguing that the SVPA is punitive because he was not afforded sex offender treatment during the period of his incarceration and, therefore, the statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The SVPA trial judge held a commitment hearing on July 23 and 25, 2007. She began by denying WXC.\u2019s motion, rejecting his argument that the SVPA was unconstitutional on its face. The judge reserved ruling on whether the statute was unconstitutional as applied, pursuant to WXC.\u2019s argument that he should have been provided with sex offender treatment while he was serving his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">At the civil commitment hearing, the State produced two expert witnesses, Dr. Brian Friedman and Dr. Evan Feibusch. No other witnesses testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Dr. Friedman testified that in rendering his opinion, he reviewed \u201call of the police documents, investigation reports, presentence reports, Judgments of Conviction, [and] victim statements.\u201d He also examined W.X.C.\u2019s statement to police, his prison records, and \u201creports completed over the years by different evaluators____\u201d When questioned about his reliance on reports by other mental health professionals, Dr. Friedman explained: \u201cI utilize them just to get a little bit of kind of a snapshot of how an individual presented at varying points in the past____However, ... I went through all the original documents myself.\u201d He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>noted \u201cI do not rely on other professionals\u2019 diagnoses or opinions regarding risk. I formulate my own conclusions.\u201d Dr. Friedman attempted to interview W.X.C., but he refused. W.X.C. likewise refused to participate in any psychological testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Dr. Friedman testified that W.X.C. tended to pair sexual arousal and violence, compulsively masturbated to movie scenes depicting rape or death, and committed the rapes despite having an acceptable consenting sexual partner. Also of note was the fact that W.X.C.\u2019s first two rapes were planned, while his third attack was spontaneous, perhaps showing a decreasing ability to control himself. Dr. Friedman opined that WXC.\u2019s reduced inhibitions from drug and alcohol abuse may also increase his risk to re-offend.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">In terms of W.X.C.\u2019s personality traits, Dr. Friedman expressed concern that W.X.C. did not appear to have any genuine empathy for his victims and consistently used manipulation to avoid or reduce punishment. For example, W.X.C. created a fictional history of child abuse in an attempt to have his sentence reduced. Dr. Friedman also referred to various reports from other evaluators who noted that W.XC.\u2019s requests for treatment of any kind seemed insincere and geared towards avoiding responsibility for his actions. For example, W.X.C. admitted that he only attended substance abuse treatment programs \u201cto get some help in sentencing\u201d and \u201cnot because he actually wanted to change his behavior.\u201d Generally, Dr. Friedman found that W.X.C. was deceitful, lacked remorse for his behavior, was impulsive, and had poor behavioral controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Dr. Friedman diagnosed W.X.C. with antisocial personality disorder, which is a risk factor for recidivism. He also diagnosed him with paraphilia, NOS (non-consenting), meaning that W.X.C. has experienced recurrent and intense fantasies, urges, and behaviors involving non-consensual sexual acts for at least six months. Based on these findings, Dr. Friedman opined that W.X.C. \u201cis highly likely to engage in future acts of deviant sexual behavior as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>defined by the SVP statute if released into the community at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">W.X.C. also declined to be interviewed by Dr. Feibusch. As a result, Dr. Feibusch based his opinion on various psychological reports prepared on prior occasions, police reports, and clinical risk assessment tests. He testified that in reviewing that information he was \u201cmostly looking for things that the evaluatee may have said to the person who is doing the evaluating that\u2019s helpful____\u201d He noted \u201c[t]he opinions that are in other evaluators\u2019 reports can stimulate my thinking in certain directions, but the opinion contained in my report is my own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">Dr. Feibusch began by calling attention to the fact that W.X.C. had \u201csexualized\u201d breaking into his first victim\u2019s home. He also noted that W.X.C.\u2019s assaults had elements of playing out sexual fantasies and observed that the rapes appeared planned and were not committed \u201cin the context of a burglary.\u201d Dr. Feibusch also found it significant that W.X.C. was aroused by viewing movie scenes of women who had been murdered. Like Dr. Friedman, Dr. Feibusch noted W.X.C.\u2019s propensity to manipulate and discussed his attempts to gain sympathy from the sentencing judge by untruthfully stating he was a sexual abuse victim himself. Dr. Feibusch also utilized the Static-99 test, a \u201cwell validated actuarial instrument designed to estimate the probability of sexual and violent recidivism among adult males who have been charged with at least one sexual offense.\u201d W.X.C. scored a six on this test, placing him in the \u201chigh risk\u201d category to re-offend. Based on these considerations, Dr. Feibusch diagnosed W.X.C. with antisocial personality disorder, paraphilia NOS, and possibly sexual sadism and opined that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that he would re-offend if he was not confined to an institution for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">The trial judge rendered an oral decision on August 20, 2007, finding that W.X.C. remained a sexually violent predator in need of commitment. At that time, the judge denied the portion of W.X.C.\u2019s motion that argued the SVPA was unconstitutional as applied because he had not been afforded sex offender treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>while serving his sentence. The judge quoted <em>In re Civil Commitment of E.S.T., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, <em>565 </em>n. 1, <em>854 </em>A.2d 936 (App.Div.2004), where we stated that \u201ceven a finding by the ADTC that a defendant is not eligible for sex offender sentencing does not preclude a later civil commitment of that defendant under the SVPA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In reviewing the testimony of Dr. Friedman, the judge found \u201c[rjespondent has demonstrated the characteristics of the antisocial personality disorder, including his lack of remorse, his manipulativeness, his demonstration of feeling that rules do not apply to him, his lack of regard for the rights of others, and his taking what he wants when he wants it.\u201d She further held that \u201c[t]he respondent has demonstrated his difficulty controlling his sexually violent behavior and he is highly likely according to the testimony to recidivate.\u201d The trial judge likewise accepted Dr. Feibusch\u2019s diagnosis of paraphilia and antisocial personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">[t]he diagnoses of Dr. Friedman and Dr. Feibuseh are not contradicted. The basis for the diagnoses were clearly stated by both witnesses based on materials which are clearly presented in the record and particularly in the statements of the respondent himself. The State\u2019s evidence was clear and convincing. The Court is clearly convinced that the respondent is a sexually violent predator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The judge ordered that W.X.C. be reevaluated after one year. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">On appeal, W.X.C. presents the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-11\">THE CIVIL COMMITMENT OF W.X.C. WITHOUT ANY PRIOR OPPORTUNITY FOR SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT WAS PUNITIVE AND THEREFORE IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES AGAINST EX POST FACTO LAWS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">THE STATE FAILED TO PROVE BY COMPETENT, CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT W.X.C. WAS SUBJECT TO SVP COMMITMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-14\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-15\">THE COURT ERRED IN RELYING ON THE OPINIONS OF DRS. FRIEDMAN AND FEIBUSCH BECAUSE THESE OPINIONS WERE BASED IN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>PART ON THE OPINIONS OF NON-TESTIFYING EXPERTS. (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">\n<em>POINT IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">THE EVALUATIONS PREPARED BY NON-TESTIFYING EXPERTS CONSTITUTE HEARSAY, DO NOT COMPLY WITH <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AS EXHIBITS AT TRIAL. (NOT RAISED BELOW).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Our scope of review of civil commitment judgments is exceedingly narrow. <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.M.B., </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>69, 89, 928 A.2d 102 (App.Div.2007), <em>aff'd, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>563, 964 A.2d 752 (2009); <em>In re Civil Commitment of V.A., </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 63, 813 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>490, 828 A.2d 917 (2003). We must give the \u201cutmost deference\u201d to the reviewing judge\u2019s determination of the appropriate balancing of societal interest and individual liberty. <em>In re Commitment of J.P., </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>443, 459, 772 A.2d 54 (App.Div. 2001) (citing <em>State v. Fields, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>282, 311, 390 A.2d 574 (1978)). That determination will be subject to modification on appeal only where the record reveals a clear abuse of discretion. <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 90, 928 A.2d 102. Accordingly, it is our responsibility to canvass the record, inclusive of the expert testimony, to determine whether the findings made by the trial judge were clearly erroneous. <em>In re D.C., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>31, 58-59, 679 A.2d 634 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We begin by addressing W.X.C.\u2019s contention that the State failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is a sexually violent predator. To be deemed a sexually violent predator under the SVPA, the individual must have been convicted, adjudicated delinquent, or found not guilty by reason of insanity, of a \u201csexually violent offense\u201d or declared incompetent to stand trial for such an offense. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26. The statutory definition of a \u201csexually violent offense\u201d is contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26(a) and (b). Subsection (a) lists the following offenses: aggravated sexual assault; sexual assault; aggravated criminal sexual cont\u00e1ct; sexual contact; certain forms of kidnapping and felony murders; attempts to commit those enumerated acts; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>all criminal offenses with substantially the same elements as those offenses. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26(a). Subsection (b) is a catchall provision to include \u201cany offense for which the court makes a specific finding on the record that, based on the circumstances of the case, the person\u2019s offense should be considered a sexually violent offense.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26(b). It does not matter when the offense was committed as long as it qualifies as a predicate offense under the SVPA. <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 75, 928 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In addition to the determination that a person committed a sexually violent offense, the State must prove that the person is a threat to the health and safety of others because he or she \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26. Our Supreme Court has interpreted the statute to require the State to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it is \u201chighly likely\u201d the person will re-offend in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>In re Commitment of W.Z., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>109, 120, 801 A.2d 205 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The State put forth proof as to several incidents leading to convictions that are sexually violent offenses under <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26(a). W.X.C. sexually assaulted three different women in the span of approximately six months. He pled guilty to those offenses and was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, and kidnapping. These offenses are all specifically enumerated under <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.26(a) as \u201csexually violent.\u201d The trial judge, therefore, clearly did not err in finding that the first prong of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26 had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The trial judge also found that W.X.C. is a threat to the safety of others because he suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26. Both Drs. Friedman and Feibusch opined that W.X.C. suffers from paraphilia and antisocial personality disorder and these conditions can manifest themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>through acts of sexual violence. Dr. Feibusch testified that W.X.C. scored a six on the Statie-99 risk assessment test, putting him at a high risk to re-offend. Both doctors also noted that W.X.C.\u2019s drug and alcohol addiction may lead to reduced inhibitions, thus exacerbating his propensity to commit sexual assault. Drs. Friedman and Feibusch based these opinions on W.X.C.\u2019s criminal history as well as numerous documents in the record, including police documents, investigation reports, presentenee reports, judgments of conviction, victim statements, as well as psychological reports. W.X.C. did not contradict these doctors\u2019 diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Based on the doctors\u2019 thorough testimony and reports, the trial judge found that W.X.C. did in fact suffer from personality disorders that make him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence. She also determined by clear and convincing evidence that W.X.C. was at risk to re-offend unless he is confined to an institution for treatment. Because this finding is amply supported by the record, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion in determining that W.X.C. is a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We next turn to W.X.C.\u2019s argument that his civil commitment is punitive and therefore in violation of the ex post facto clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions. W.X.C. asserts that because the State did not offer him sex offender treatment during his incarceration, and instead waited until he had served his sentence before committing him to a treatment facility, his commitment is further punishment for his offenses and therefore prohibited by the ex post facto clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Both the United States and New Jersey Constitutions forbid the Legislature from passing ex post facto laws. <em>U.S. Const. </em>art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3; <em>U.S. Const. </em>art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1; <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. IV, \u00a7 7, P 3; <em>State v. Fortin, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>619, 626-27, 969 A.2d 1133 (2009). In order to violate the ex post facto clause, the statute in question must (1) punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; (2) make more burdensome the punishment for a crime after its commission; or (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>deprive a defendant of any defense available according to the law at the time when the crime was committed. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>23, 56, 678 A.2d 164 (1996). Here, W.X.C. argues that his civil commitment is a \u201cmore burdensome\u201d punishment for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Our Supreme Court has already addressed whether the SVPA violates the ex post facto clause and has held that it does not. <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 964 A.2d 752; <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.H.M., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 608, 845 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2003), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>312, 845 A.2d 137 (2004). The SVPA is not a criminal statute but rather a civil commitment statute with one of its primary objectives being the treatment of the sex offender. <em>J.H.M., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 608, 845 A.2d 139. Involuntary commitment under the SVPA \u201cis not punitive but a consequence of a reasoned balance between the liberty interest of a committee in need of treatment for emotional disorders and protection of the citizenry from those who have demonstrated an inability to control their sexual violent behavior and are highly likely to re-offend.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.M.B., </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>69, 97, 928 A.2d 102 (App.Div.2007), <em>aff'd, J.M.B., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>563, 964 A.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\u201c[T]he Constitution does not prevent society from attempting to protect itself from convicted sex offenders, no matter when convicted, so long as the means of protection are reasonably designed for that purpose and only for that purpose, and not designed to punish____\u201d <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 662 A.2d 367 (1995). Par from any punitive objective, the SVPA\u2019s confinement is instead linked to the stated purposes of the commitment, \u201cnamely, to hold the person until his mental abnormality no longer causes him to be a threat to others.\u201d <em>J.H.M., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 610-11, 845 A.2d 139. As such, there is no constitutional infirmity. <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 97, 928 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">W.X.C. does not argue that the SVPA is unconstitutional because it is generally punitive in nature. Instead, he contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>that the statute became a covert vehicle for additional, unconstitutional punishment when the State failed to treat him while he was serving his sentence, only to civilly commit and treat him after he had served his sentence. W.X.C. relies on Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent in <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>346, 381, 117 <em>S.Ct. 2072, </em>2091, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>501, 527 (1997) (Breyer, J., dissenting) to support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>a closely divided Supreme Court held that there was no impediment, at least under the Federal Constitution, to a state, in that case Kansas, \u201ccivilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available, but who nevertheless pose a danger to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2084, 138 L.Ed.2d at 517. In his critical concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy observed that \u201c[i]f the object or purpose of the Kansas law had been to provide treatment but the treatment provisions were adopted as a sham or mere pretext, there would have been an indication of the forbidden purpose to punish,\u201d the hallmark of an ex post facto law. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087, 138 L.Ed.2d at 521 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Justice Breyer authored the dissent, which was joined by three other justices. He argued that Hendricks\u2019 confinement was not justified because there was inadequate evidence that Kansas intended the committees to receive treatment. Among the reasons supporting such a view was that the Kansas Act only seeks civil confinement after the offender has served his or her criminal sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2093-94, 138 L.Ed.2d at 530 (Breyer, J., dissenting). This statutory framework prompted Justice Breyer to pose the rhetorical question, \u201cBut why, one might ask, does the Act not commit and require treatment of sex offenders sooner, say, soon after they begin to serve their sentences?\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Justice Breyer went on to state that \u201c[w]hen a State believes that treatment does exist, and then couples that admission with a legislatively required delay of such treatment until a person is at the end of his jail term (so that further incapacitation is therefore necessary), such a legislative scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>begins to look punitive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2091-92, 138 L.Ed.2d at 527 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In his dissent, Justice Breyer carefully analyzed the Kansas statutory scheme to determine whether it was aimed at treatment as opposed to impermissible additional punishment. In doing so, he looked to <em>Allen v. Illinois, </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>364, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2988, 92 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>296 (1986), an earlier civil commitment case, for guidance. In <em>Allen, </em>the Court set forth four factors to determine if a commitment statute is punitive. These factors were employed by Justice Breyer in his analysis of the Kansas statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The first factor asks whether a state\u2019s highest court has held that treatment under that state\u2019s sexual offender commitment statute is a significant objective of the statute. Regarding the Kansas Act, the Kansas Supreme Court held that any goal of providing treatment was \u201cincidental at best.\u201d <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 383, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2092, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 528. In New Jersey, our Supreme Court has held that SVPA is not punitive but \u201cremedial,\u201d <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 601, 964 A.2d 752, and regulatory. <em>State v. Bellamy, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>127, 137, 835 A.2d 1231 (2003). Moreover, our Supreme Court in dicta has noted that the statute requires that the Division of Mental Health Services must provide \u201ctreatment tailored to address the specific needs of sexually violent predators.\u201d <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 120, 801 A.2d 205 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.34b).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The second factor Justice Breyer considered was the fact that the Kansas Act \u201cexplicitly defers diagnosis, evaluation, and commitment proceedings until a few weeks prior to the \u2018anticipated release\u2019 of a previously convicted offender from prison.\u201d <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 386, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2094, 138 L.Ed.2d at 530 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In New Jersey, we have a statutory scheme in place to provide treatment for certain sex offenders immediately upon conviction, so long as they meet the requirements of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>[wjhenever a person is convicted of the offense of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping ... the judge shall order the Department of Corrections to complete a psychological examination of the offender ____ The examination shall include a determination of whether the offender\u2019s conduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior and, if it was, a further determination of the offender\u2019s amenability to sex offender treatment and willingness to participate in such treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">If the court finds that these criteria are met, the defendant must be placed in the custody of the ADTC. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:47-3(b). <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:47-3(h)(2) also allows a defendant to request a transfer to the ADTC on a biennial basis, at which point the State is required to provide an evaluation and entertain the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">In the event an inmate\u2019s conduct is not found to be \u201ccharacterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior,\u201d for example, it is found to be impulsive as opposed to compulsive, he may still obtain some treatment if he seeks it. <em>N.J AC. </em>10A:16-4.3 requires a correctional facility to inform inmates how to gain access to mental health services. The inmate handbook, required to be provided to each inmate pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>10A:8-3.2, explains the psychological and psychiatric services available. <em>N.J.S.A </em>10A:8-3.5(b)5. The Department of Corrections Internal Management Procedure (MED.MHS. 001.001) sets forth the procedure for inmates\u2019 access to mental health services. Its purpose is to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">A. Ensure appropriate access to mental health care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">B. Reduce the disabling effects of mental illness and enhance the inmate\u2019s ability to function within the prison environment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">C. Reduce or, when possible, eliminate suffering caused by mental illness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">D. Improve the safety of the prison environment and the community upon release; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-13\">E. Prepare the individual for reentry into the community by reducing the debilitating effects of mental illness and arrange for appropriate aftercare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">[MED.MHS. 001.001.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">If the inmate meets the criteria for classification as special needs, the inmate will receive appropriate services. <em>Ibid. </em>In addition, the prisons offer various social services programs, such as anger management courses, substance abuse programs, and reentry programs. Thus, unlike the Kansas Act, which does not provide an avenue for a defendant to procure treatment while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>incarcerated, our statutes and regulations clearly make treatment available to appropriate candidates throughout their sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Third, Justice Breyer considered that \u201c[l]egislation that seeks to help the individual offender, as well as to protect the public, would avoid significantly greater restriction of an individual\u2019s liberty than public safety requires.\u201d <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 388, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2095, 138 L.Ed.2d at 531 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Under the New Jersey statutory scheme, committees are entitled to an annual review to determine if confinement is still necessary. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.35. The court at any time may order a conditional discharge if it finds, upon the Department of Human Services\u2019 recommendation, that the individual is not likely to commit further acts of sexual violence. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.32; <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 120-21, 801 A.2d 205. The SVPA is clearly designed to ensure that committees are not confined longer than necessary to provide effective treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In addition, the liberty interests of offenders receiving treatment are protected and restricted only as much as necessary. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:36A-2.1 states that a patient \u201cshall not be deprived of a civil right solely by reason of receiving treatment under the provisions of the SVPA.\u201d Moreover, \u201cft]reatment shall not modify or vary legal or civil rights including but not limited to, the right to register for and to vote in elections, or rights relating to the granting, forfeiture, or denial of a license, permit, privilege, or benefit pursuant to any law.\u201d Exceptions are made only to those rights \u201crelated to providing a safe, secure facility or any appropriate concern.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Clearly, the SVPA is designed to protect the liberty interests of committees to a far greater extent than statutes aimed at punitive confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Lastly, Justice Breyer considered the commitment laws of other states. At the time of writing his dissent, seventeen states had laws that sought to protect the public from sexually dangerous individuals through civil commitment. <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, supra, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>at 388, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2095, 138 L.Ed.2d at 532 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Ten of those statutes provided treatment immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ately and only one other state besides Kansas delayed treatment and did not \u201cexplicitly consider less restrictive alternatives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2095, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 532. In criticizing the Kansas Act, Justice Breyer noted that New Jersey\u2019s SVPA \u201cgenerally do[es] not delay treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2095, 138 L.Ed.2d at 532. Also, as discussed above, New Jersey\u2019s statutory scheme provides immediate review of an individual to determine if treatment is appropriate and offenders may request subsequent reviews throughout their imprisonment. Annual reviews are also guaranteed. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4-27.35. These considerations place New Jersey in line with several other states\u2019 statutory schemes that the United States Supreme Court implicitly found satisfactory and not punitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We first note in weighing W.X.C.\u2019s ex post facto argument that a dissent is instructive but not binding. <em>See Northern Sec. Co. v. United States, </em>193 <em>U.S. </em>197, 400, 24 <em>S.Ct. </em>436, 486, 48 <em>L.Ed. </em>679, 726 (1904) (where Justice Holmes wrote \u201cI think it useless and undesirable, as a rule, to express dissent____\u201d). As such, W.X.C.\u2019s reliance upon Justice Breyer\u2019s opinion in <em>Kansas v. Hendricks </em>is misplaced. However, even if we were to treat Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent as law, W.X.C.\u2019s argument overlooks that all four factors from <em>Allen </em>were analyzed by Justice Breyer in order to conclude that the Kansas Act was, in fact, punitive. W.X.C. relies only on the second factor Justice Breyer considered, whether the statute in question defers diagnosis and commitment proceedings until a few weeks prior to the individual\u2019s anticipated release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">As we explained above, this argument is itself unfounded because New Jersey does provide treatment immediately upon sentencing if a defendant qualifies under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:47-1 and affords mental health treatment under the prison\u2019s regulations if the appropriate criteria are met. Dr. Frank evaluated W.X.C. prior to his sentencing and determined that, while his behavior was repetitive, it was not compulsive and W.X.C. was not eligible for treatment at the time of his sentencing. Moreover, <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>2C:47-3(h)(2) permits defendants to request reevaluation and transfer to the ADTC program throughout their sentences. There is nothing in the record to suggest that W.X.C. made any attempt to utilize this statutory right or the mental health services available under the Department of Corrections regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The three other factors enumerated in Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent likewise do not apply. The SVPA carefully preserves the liberty interest of committees with the need to protect the public and our Supreme Court has found that the statute requires committees to receive treatment. Justice Breyer himself stated that the SVPA is comparable to other states\u2019 commitment statutes and thereby suggested that it is not punitive. As such, we reject W.X.C.\u2019s argument that, based on Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent, the SVPA violates the ex post facto clause as applied to his confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Defendant also argues that the trial judge erred in relying on the opinions of Drs. Friedman and Feibusch because their opinions were based in part on the opinions of non-testifying experts. In <em>In re Commitment of E.S.T., supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 575, 854 A.2d 936, we held that the experts at the SVPA hearing cannot simply parrot the findings of the doctors who author the clinical certificates in support of commitment but do not themselves testify at trial. In that case, the testifying experts based their opinions \u201csubstantially\u201d on the opinions of the doctors who authored the defendant\u2019s clinical certificates. Those doctors never treated E.S.T., but only reviewed his records and conducted short interviews with him. Our primary concern in that ease was that the trier of fact \u201cmay not be able to fairly evaluate the basis of the in-court opinions that rely upon out-of-court opinions effectively shielded not just from meaningful cross-examination, but from any cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 854 A.2d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">However, we later elaborated that <em>E.S.T. </em>should not be read \u201cto preclude reliance, in part, on prior evaluations conducted for other purposes, such as ADTC and other psychiatric evaluations conducted in connection with sentencing or for parole consideration.\u201d <em>In re Civil Commitment of A.E.F., </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>492, 873 A.2d 604 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>393, 886 A.2d 663 (2005); <em>see also In re Commitment of J.S.W., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 225, 852 A.2d 1107 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>586, 874 A.2d 1105 (2005). As long as the opinion ultimately rendered at the initial commitment hearing is that of the witness based on his or her own evaluation of the committee, prior offenses, and objective test data, the testimony is admissible. <em>A.E.F., supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 492, 873 A.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">In this ease, Drs. Friedman and Feibuseh did not simply \u201cparrot\u201d the findings of the psychologists who provided the State\u2019s certificates in support of W.X.C.\u2019s commitment. Both doctors reviewed W.X.C.\u2019s prior offenses and statements to the police, his ADTC and other psychiatric evaluations conducted prior to sentencing, his presentence reports and objective test data, such as his score on the Static-99 test. They testified that their opinions were their own and that they did not rely on other professionals\u2019 diagnoses. Both doctors were thoroughly cross-examined on their findings. Moreover, Drs. Friedman and Feibuseh attempted to interview W.X.C. prior to rendering their opinions on his commitment and W.X.C. refused. He cannot now argue that their testimony should not be considered because they did not evaluate him through interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Because the State\u2019s testifying experts did not merely rely on reports prepared by non-testifying evaluators for the express purpose of civilly committing W.X.C., and because W.X.C. had ample opportunity to cross-examine those experts, the trial judge did not err in considering their opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Lastly, defendant contends that \u201c[t]he evaluations prepared by non-testifying experts constitute hearsay, do not comply with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, and should not have been admitted as exhibits at trial.\u201d Evidentiary decisions of a trial judge are reviewed utilizing the abuse of discretion standard. <em>J.H.M., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612, 845 A.2d 139; <em>State v. Brown, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>138, 147, 784 A.2d 1244 (2001). While out-of-court statements used to prove the truth of the matter asserted are inadmissible hearsay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number><em>see N.J.R.E. </em>802, an expert who substantially relies on hearsay evidence for his or her opinion may testily at trial as long as the hearsay information was of a \u201ctype reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703; <em>see </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 7 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703 (2008) (citing <em>State v. Torres, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>554, 576, 874 A.2d 1084 (2005)). \u201cHowever, hearsay is not admissible substantively as establishing the truth of the statement.\u201d <em>State v. Vandeweaghe, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 480, 799 A.2d 1 (App.Div.2002), <em>aff'd, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>229, 827 A.2d 1028 (2003). A psychiatrist is permitted to testify about a defendant\u2019s prior criminal history in order to offer an opinion about a defendant\u2019s mental condition. <em>State v. Eatman, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 302, 774 A.2d 571 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>85, 784 A.2d 718 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Here, the testifying experts relied on reports concerning W.X.C.\u2019s mental health, his criminal history, police reports, and clinical tests in rendering their opinions. Both doctors testified that these sources of information were of the type typically relied upon by experts in performing risk assessment. The trial judge considered the experts\u2019 opinions, but did not allow the \u201cwholesale and uncritical admission of prior forensic evaluations.\u201d <em>J.M.B., supra, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 95, 928 A.2d 102. To the contrary, she properly used the hearsay reports \u201cas background in evaluating the opinions of the ... experts, who testified that they considered these reports in reaching their own diagnoses.\u201d <em>J.S.W., supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 225, 852 A.2d 1107 (quoting <em>In re Civil Commitment of A.X.D., </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 202, 851 A.2d 37 (App.Div. 2004)).
