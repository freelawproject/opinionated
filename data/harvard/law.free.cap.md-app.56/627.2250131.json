The backlash of the sentences imposed for the crimes continues to reverberate in the halls of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tribunals throughout the State. The sentences meted to Jerry Lee Beatty and Jack Ronald Jones have led to these similar appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Beatty entered into a plea bargain with the State\u2019s Attorney for St. Mary\u2019s County, in which County Miss Roper\u2019s assailants were initially charged. In exchange for Beatty\u2019s guilty plea to the crimes of murder in the first degree, first degree rape and kidnapping, the prosecutor withdrew a demand for the imposition of the death penalty. Beatty was sentenced in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, to which the case had been removed, to two concurrent life sentences and a concurrent twenty year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Jack Ronald Jones opted to be tried before a jury. The trial was removed from St. Mary\u2019s County to Baltimore County. Jones was found guilty of murder in the first degree, first degree rape and kidnapping. Jones was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment and twenty years. The hue and cry that arose was a result of what was perceived by some to be the leniency on the part of the trial judge. We infer that the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County was among those who were displeased with the fact that the sentences were not more severe. In any event, even before disposition of the case in St. Mary\u2019s County, the Prince George\u2019s County prosecutor presented the matter to that political subdivision\u2019s grand jury, who in turn indicted Beatty and Jones for the criminal acts perpetrated in that County. Each indictment contained a multitude of averments, but some of them varied slightly as to the allegations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Beatty and Jones moved to dismiss the indictments. They asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that further prosecution of them was barred by <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel and double jeopardy. Judge Jacob S. Levin denied the motions and these appeals ensued. Inasmuch as the issues before us in the two appeals are homogenous, we shall consider them in concert.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The sole proposition presented to us by the appellants is, \u201cThe trial judge erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy.\u201d Intertwined by appellants into the double jeopardy question are that subject\u2019s next of kin: <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Before we explore the depths necessary to resolve the matter, we shall sketch the factual scene from which these cases arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Beatty and Jones were charged in St. Mary\u2019s County by way of a criminal information with the kidnapping, rape and murder of Stephanie Ann Roper. From the record we glean that in the early morning hours of April 1, 1982, Miss Roper\u2019s vehicle was halted on Floral Road in Prince George\u2019s County because of three flat tires. Miss Roper was lured into a vehicle driven by Jones. Beatty said that she was told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that they \u201cwould give her a ride to her friend\u2019s house.\u201d Jones and Beatty, however, went past the friend\u2019s house and drove to a barn. Miss Roper was raped by each of the men. The barn was located in Prince George\u2019s County. Miss Roper was then transported to an abandoned house in St. Mary\u2019s County where she was again raped. She tried to flee but was struck on the head by Jones with a logging chain. Little purpose would be served by iterating herein further abhorrent particulars of the crimes. It is sufficient for our purpose to know that Miss Roper was shot to death, and her body was burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Beatty and Jones were charged in St. Mary\u2019s County. The criminal information averred that they murdered, raped and kidnapped Miss Roper \u201con or about the 3rd day of April, 1982 at Oakville, St. Mary\u2019s County, Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">As we have previously stated, Beatty pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County to the crimes of first degree murder, rape in the first degree and kidnapping. Jones was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">\n<em>The Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Beatty and Jones, in an effort to prevent further prosecution with the concomitant possibility of additional punishment, invoked the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy barrier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Double jeopardy, however, is but the root stock of two other distinct concepts: <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. We shall address each.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Cook v. </em>State, 281 Md. 665, 381 A.2d 671 (1978), <em>aff\u2019g </em>35 Md.App. 430, 371 A.2d 433 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 839, 99 S.Ct. 126, 58 L.Ed.2d 136, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">\u201c[UJnder the doctrine of res judicata, sometimes known as direct estoppel, a final and valid judgment rendered in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>proceeding between two parties operates as a bar in a second proceeding between them on all matters that have been or could have been decided in the original litigation, where the second proceeding involves the same subject matter as the first cause of action.\u201d 281 Md. at 668, 381 A.2d 671.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Such a rationale is applicable to criminal cases as well as civil ones. <em>Cook v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 668, 381 A.2d 671; <em>Rouse </em>v. <em>State, </em>202 Md. 481, 486, 97 A.2d 285, 286, <em>cert. denied, </em>346 U.S. 865, 74 S.Ct. 104, 98 L.Ed. 376 (1953); <em>State v. Coblentz, </em>169 Md. 159, 164-66, 180 A. 266, 268 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The way Beatty and Jones see it in the instant case, when the prosecution was initiated in St. Mary\u2019s County, the State\u2019s Attorney for that County should have charged <em>all </em>of the crimes committed by appellants to the person of Stephanie Ann Roper. Appellants theorize that, \u201cthere was one continuous episode, which included abducting Miss Roper in Prince George\u2019s County, raping her, carrying her into St. Mary\u2019s County, raping her again and murdering her.. . . There is no suggestion that there are now relevant facts relating to the crime[s] not known to the State\u2019s Attorney for St. Mary\u2019s County at the time of the original charges.\u201d In sum, the appellants advance the idea that all charges must be asserted in a single criminal proceeding against a defendant or those not so joined are barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">What appellants overlook is that the crimes that were committed in the two political subdivisions were separate. The rape of the victim in Prince George\u2019s County, together with other, sexual violations that took place there, were crimes committed solely within that County. Venue for trial of those crimes was and is Prince George\u2019s County, subject, of course, to removal for trial purposes to another county or to the City of Baltimore. The crimes that were begun and completed in Prince George\u2019s County could not properly be charged in St. Mary\u2019s County. Thus, <em>res judicata </em>does not bar prosecution of Beatty and Jones in Prince George\u2019s County for the offenses they committed in that County.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Collateral estoppel is based on a prior judgment grounded in litigation between the same parties but on a different cause of action. <em>Cook v. State, supra, </em>281 Md. at 668-69, 381 A.2d 671; <em>MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. 29, 32-33, 367 A.2d 486, 489 (1977); <em>see also Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970); <em>Cousins v. State, </em>277 Md. 383, 354 A.2d 825, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1027, 97 S.Ct. 652, 50 L.Ed.2d 631 (1976). \u201cCollateral estoppel, by definition involves the first litigation of a fact in a different case involving a different legal issue. The double jeopardy protection mandates that a person shall not be placed twice in jeopardy for \u2018the <em>same </em>offense.\u2019 Collateral estoppel, on the other hand, deals with being placed twice in jeopardy for \u2018a <em>different </em>offense.\u2019 If the same offenses were involved, it would not even be called collateral estoppel (coming in from the outside) but rather direct estoppel.\u201d R. Gilbert and C. Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law: Practice and Procedure </em>(Michie, 1983) \u00a7 37.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We think that a prerequisite to the invocation of collateral estoppel is the showing that the prosecution has the authority to charge in a single charge document all of the offenses committed by the defendants. In the matter <em>sub judice, </em>the State\u2019s Attorney for St. Mary\u2019s County was without power to prosecute any offense begun and completed within Prince George\u2019s County. The kidnapping did not end in Prince George\u2019s County even though it began there. Such an offense may be prosecuted in any jurisdiction in which it takes place. <em>See generally Hunt v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 286, 278 A.2d 637 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 715 (1971). <em>See also </em>Wharton\u2019s <em>Criminal Law, </em>14th ed. \u00a7 59, where it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-6\">\u201cContinuing offense has been defined as \u2018a transaction or series of acts set on foot by a single impulse ... no matter how long a time it may occupy. ... It is an offense which continues day by day....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-7\"><em>See also Ellingham v. State, </em>163 Md. 278, 280, 162 A. 709, 710 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>If, for example, a defendant kidnapped a person in Oakland, Garrett County, Maryland, and carried them through Allegany, Washington, Frederick, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s, Charles, Calvert and St. Mary\u2019s Counties before being apprehended, any one of those counties could prosecute the defendant. Nevertheless, not more than one could prosecute. This is true because of the continuing nature of the offense. There was one kidnapping and there can be but one prosecution. Where, however, the facts indicate that the same person may have been kidnapped twice or more, then there can be an equal number of prosecutions. To illustrate the point: Had the victim been kidnapped in Charles County, transported to St. Mary\u2019s County and there released, but the defendant changes his or her mind and again kidnaps the victim, transporting him or her to Baltimore County, there are two separate kidnappings. The first may be prosecuted in Charles or St. Mary\u2019s County, the second in St. Mary\u2019s or any other county through which the victim was transported.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The rape and sexual offenses committed in Prince George\u2019s County upon the person of Miss Roper were not adjudicated in the trial of the offenses that took place in St. Mary\u2019s County, hence collateral estoppel is unavailable to preclude prosecution in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The facts in the instant case compel the conclusion however, that but one kidnapping occurred, and it was continuous in nature. Once Miss Roper was seized by the appellants, she was not released, except by death, from them. Because the crime of kidnapping is a continuing offense, the trial of that crime in St. Mary\u2019s County terminates the prosecution of it. Therefore, those counts of the indictment that charge Beatty and Jones with kidnapping should have been dismissed. What we have said relative to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>kidnapping applies with equal force and effect to the charges directed at false imprisonment, which are merged into the kidnapping allegations. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>292 Md. 405, 439 A.2d 542 (1982); <em>Hunt v. </em>State, 12 Md.App. 286, 278 A.2d 637 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">We shall, therefore, reverse the trial judge with respect to those counts of the indictments that charge kidnapping and false imprisonment and direct the judge, upon remand, to dismiss those particular counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Irrespective of what we have said with regard to kidnapping, the commission of a substantive offense and the conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinguishable crimes, neither of which merges, upon conviction, into the other. <em>See Sealfon </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 332 U.S. 575, 578, 68 S.Ct. 237, 239, 92 L.Ed. 180 (1948). Furthermore, each offense requires proof of elements which are distinct, and the factual showing attendant to each is different even though both have certain facts in common.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The conspiracies charged in connection with the rape and sex offense crimes are similarly disparate and are matters which can be litigated in Prince George\u2019s County. Beatty and Jones refer us to <em>Braverman v. United States, </em>317 U.S. 49, 53, 63 S.Ct. 99, 101, 87 L.Ed. 23 (1942), which states that a single agreement to commit many crimes \u201ccannot be taken to be several agreements and hence several conspiracies because it envisages the violation of several statutes rather than one.\u201d <em>Braverman, </em>however, did not preclude the possibility of charging several conspiracies for several agreements. It is within the realm of possibility that Beatty and Jones conspired to commit rape and other sexual offenses in Prince George\u2019s County and later conspired to commit similar crimes in St. Mary\u2019s County. It is also plausible that appellants conspired, in one agreement, to commit two rapes in both counties. The resolution of those possibilities must await a trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The constitutional common law protection against double jeopardy differs only in the name. Long before the Fifth Amendment\u2019s barrier against double jeopardy was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>applicable to the States via <em>Benton v. </em>Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969), Maryland followed the common law prohibition against \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The double jeopardy barrier, whether expressed as such or as prior jeopardy or former jeopardy, is designed to guard against an individual\u2019s twice being held accountable for the <em>same </em>crime. If in the present case there were the possibility of the appellants being charged twice for the <em>same </em>crime, the principle of double jeopardy would preclude that trial. The principle, however, is inappropriate to the matter before us, because, as we have seen, the crimes, except kidnapping and false imprisonment, that were committed in Prince George\u2019s County are properly triable in that County.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">AS TO APPEAL NO. 179, JERRY LEE BEATTY v. STATE, ORDER AFFIRMED AS TO ALL COUNTS EXCEPT COUNTS 22 and 23; ORDER REVERSED ON COUNTS 22 and 23. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">AS TO APPEAL NO. 366, JACK RONALD JONES v.
