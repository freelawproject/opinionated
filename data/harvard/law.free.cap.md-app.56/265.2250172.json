Striking their bargain upon an initial meeting on Baltimore Street and Guilford Avenue (colloquially known in Charm City as \u201cthe\u201d block), Ms Davis led Mr. McNabb to a sixth floor apartment of an Asquith Street highrise apartment complex. Without hesitation she prepared to perform as previously agreed \u2014 \u201csome fun\u201d in exchange for fifty dollars \u2014 but before contractual consummation, or even partial performance, fate in the form of an elderly man interrupted the assignation and evicted the clandestine couple. Bibulous if not crapulous and presumably considering contracts as <em>bonae fidei et non ex turpi causa, </em>Mr. McNabb, still concerned with consummation, descended the stairs with Denise, discussing their \u201cgetting together when [they] got to the bottom\u201d. But upon departing from the complex, the contractors were again interrupted. Fate, this time in the form of appellant Wayne White, interfered and with the aid of a pellet pistol relieved McNabb of twice the consideration he had promised Denise. Until their arrest, Mr. McNabb did not again see the contractee nor the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Whether the jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found that Denise had substantially performed, or that Mr. McNabb\u2019s consideration had failed, they exonerated Ms Davis. But for whatever reason the jury exculpated her, it found appellant, whose participation presumably was seen as a unilateral novation, guilty of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In the face of positive identification, appellant with and through his codefendant appeared to have raised a peripheral defense of police brutality insinuating that so badly was appellant beaten upon arrest that the police did not even dare photograph him when he was booked. This is shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>most clearly by cross-examination of the police officer on rebuttal by counsel for appellant\u2019s codefendant Davis. He asked the arresting officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cQ Isn\u2019t it true, Officer, that the reason Wayne White\u2019s photograph wasn\u2019t taken was because his face was bruised and beaten by you or one of your other officers who made the alleged arrest on the night of the 15th of March?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">A No, sir, it\u2019s not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">This peripherally relevant theme was followed up by appellant\u2019s counsel who asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">\u201cOfficer, isn\u2019t it customary that pictures of both Defendants would have been taken?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The groundwork for the ultimate purpose indicated by the smoke screen billowing forth at this juncture was first aired by counsel for Ms Davis when the officer was cross-examined after he initially testified in the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201cQ Isn\u2019t it true when a person is brought into the police station, you know, and I guess they are, what, booked, what they call booked and write out a statement of charges and then, the Sergeant writes down certain information, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">A I\u2019m not qualified to say exactly what the booking procedure is because I\u2019m not a booking officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">Q Weren\u2019t you ever there when a booking was taking place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\">A We don\u2019t go into the cell blocks. That\u2019s strictly for the booking officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\">Q Isn\u2019t it true when a person is first arrested and brought into the station house, that he\u2019s photographed and fingerprinted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-15\">A He\u2019s always fingerprinted for the purposes of identification. He has been arrested in a period of time span, let\u2019s say, I don\u2019t know exactly what the time is, if he had been arrested a month prior to that, they find that out, they will not take another photo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-16\">Q Although he was arrested then and there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">Q Can you check, officer, to find out whether his photograph was taken that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">A Yes, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">Q And will you do that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">A Yes, I will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">Q And will you respond back here after you find out and bring such a photograph, if there is one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">A Yes, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">Q Okay. That\u2019s a photo of Mr. White and Ms. Davis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">A If they are on file, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">There was no protest from or on behalf of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">When the State subsequently recalled the officer after the defendants\u2019 cases in order to respond to defendant Davis\u2019 request for the photographs, that of Ms. Davis was introduced and it was brought out that appellant had not been photographed on the night of his arrest. The obvious implication by appellant, suggested through the codefendant was that the police had so badly beaten appellant that they dared not photograph him. Appellant\u2019s counsel himself elicited the testimony when cross-examining Ms. Davis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-15\">\u201cQ Did you see them do anything to Mr. White?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-16\">A Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-17\">Q What did they do to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-18\">A Kicked him down on the ground, kicked him in the stomach, kicked their knees in his back. They was hurting him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-19\">Q Did you see any marks on him at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-20\">A Yes, bruises on his face and arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-21\">Q Was he bleeding anywhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-22\">A Yes, his face was bleeding and his ear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-23\">MR. LUNTZ: No further questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-24\">It logically followed that when the State recalled the officer who had been directed by Davis\u2019 attorney to produce any photographs taken of the defendants \u2014 including White \u2014 the State was compelled to explain why no photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>graph had been taken of him upon his arrest for this crime. The reason had already been suggested by the officer when initially cross-examined. Using that procedural explanation the State rebutted the brutality charges and sought to explain the missing photograph. The court summarized the rebuttal purpose of his testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201cAt this time I have asked him to produce photographs taken the day of the arrest. He has testified that there was a photograph taken of Denise Davis. There was no photograph taken of Mr. White, is that correct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The State then proceeded to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cQ And did the fact that there\u2019s no photograph taken conform to the booking requirements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-8\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">Q Did you at any time beat Wayne White?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-10\">A Excuse me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-11\">Q Did you at any time beat Wayne White?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">MR. SACKS [Counsel for Davis]: I object to the form of the question.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-13\">THE COURT: When?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-14\">MR. FLANNERY [State\u2019s attorney]: On the date of the arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-15\">A Did I beat him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-16\">Q (BY MR. FLANNERY) Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-17\">A No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-18\">Q Was he hurt in any way when he booked him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-19\">A Not that I recall. He was not taken to a hospital. The procedure at the desk if he complains of any type of injury, the Desk Sergeant will not accept him, he will have to be taken to a hospital. He was not taken to a hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-20\">Appellant\u2019s attorney, either having forgotten the initial testimony or unwilling to let sleeping dogs lie asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-21\">\u201cQ Officer, isn\u2019t it customary that pictures of both Defendants would have been taken?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-22\">A Procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-23\">MR. SACKS: I would object to the procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>THE COURT: Overruled. The question has been asked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">A When I went over to the B of I to obtain photos, I checked on procedure. Procedure is if the person who has been arrested has been arrested within a six months period prior to that, they generally do not take the photo. The photos are just in the six months period. There were photos, recent photos of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">MR. SACKS: I would object, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll overrule the objection; asked by his counsel. You may continue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">But as the answer continued, appellant\u2019s attorney (Mr. Luntz) realized that he may have asked one question too many.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Appellant complains here of what followed there. On redirect examination, in order to show that the missing photograph in appellant\u2019s case was in strict accordance with the elicited police procedure, the State educed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">\u201cQ Officer, how many recent photographs were there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">MR. SACKS: Object, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">MR. LUNTZ: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">THE COURT: Of who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">MR. FLANNERY: Of the Defendant, Wayne White.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">MR. LUNTZ: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll sustain the objection to how many. How many were taken within that prescribed time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-17\">MR. SACKS: Object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-18\">MR. LUNTZ: I object to that question also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-19\">THE COURT: Overrule the objection. You opened the door to the questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-20\">A There were two photos taken in the month of January, 1982, one on the 27th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-21\">MR. LUNTZ: Your Honor, I would object to that. The question had nothing to do with previous photos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-22\">THE COURT: I overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Q (BY MR. FLANNERY) Now, those photographs were taken in two different districts, weren\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">MR. SACKS: Object, Your Honor, to the form of the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">Q (BY MR. FLANNERY) You say that\u2019s correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-10\">Q Which district?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">A One on the 27th was taken in the Central District, the one on the 19th taken in the Southeast District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-12\">Q Both in January of this year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-13\">A That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">Q Now, if Mr. White had been beaten, would they still have taken\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-15\">MR. SACKS: Object, Your Honor, to the form of the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-16\">Q (BY MR. FLANNERY) Would they still have taken a photograph of him at the booking procedures?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-17\">THE COURT: I\u2019ll let him answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-18\">MR. SACKS: He said he didn\u2019t know the booking procedures when I asked him the question. He says he knows nothing about that. It\u2019s done in the cell block. He knows nothing about booking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-19\">THE COURT: Can you answer the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-20\">A If the subject has been cut or any marks on him, that has no bearing on whether he\u2019s photographed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-21\">THE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-22\">Appellant complains with ill grace, we think, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-23\">\u201cThe trial court erred in admitting evidence that Appellant had recently been arrested on unrelated charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">The judge\u2019s response that appellant had \u201copened the door to the questions\u201d is adequate, if not sufficient, to respond to appellant\u2019s complaint. Judicially, a \u201cyou asked for it\u201d answer smacks of juvenile rhetoric; but, however stated, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>carries the connotative reasoning of the doctrine we refer to as \u201cverbal completeness\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">\u201c \u2018When any part of an oral statement has been put in evidence by one party, the opponent may afterwards (on cross-examination or re-examination) put in the remainder of what was said on the same subject at the same time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Worthington v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 487, 491, 381 A.2d 712 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 740 (1978), quoting 7 <em>Wigmore on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 2115 (3d ed.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">This rule of completeness is equally applicable whether applied to oral supplementary statements introduced to provide the full picture, or used as a principle of admissibility under which evidence that is irrelevant or otherwise incomplete may be allowed to be answered to correct a prejudicially misleading impression left by the introduction of misleading evidence. According to McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 57 (2d ed. 1972), most courts seem to say generally that one who induces a trial court to let down the bars to a field of inquiry that is not competent or relevant to the issues cannot complain if his adversary is allowed to avail himself of the opening. Irrelevant evidence can not become relevant simply because it is capable of being contradicted and will thereby impeach a witness. <em>Smith v. State, </em>273 Md. 152, 158, 328 A.2d 274 (1974). To justify rebuttal of the irrelevancy there must be something more. One such instance when the \u201cdoor is opened\u201d is most pronounced when, as in this case the questionably relevant evidence as initially admitted will clearly prejudice an opponent unless the opponent can meet the evidence. 1 Wigmore, <em>Evidence, </em>\u00a7 15 (3d ed.). Testimony that appellant was beaten upon arrest is peripherially relevant, at best, in regard to whether he committed an armed robbery. Furthermore, there was no evidence or statement, the admissibility of which rested upon the validity of the arrest. When convincingly proven such evidence is certainly prejudicial to the State upon whose officers the proof of the crime relies, if they are shown to have criminally assaulted the accused. Upon such evidence, supported by the police failure to have photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>graphed the allegedly beaten appellant, the State could hardly be expected to stand mute when it is the State\u2019s own procedure that has been used to support the irrelevant accusation. After having denied the brutality charge, the officer was properly permitted to explain why there was no picture taken of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Straining even farther, appellant complains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in admitting evidence that the arresting officer \u2018knew of\u2019 Appellant prior to arresting him in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">This was elicited when the State sought to have the officer explain why he approached the defendants with his revolver drawn at the time of arrest. He explained that the crime alleged indicated that they were armed and that he \u201cknew of\u201d the defendants anyhow.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We do not agree that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">\u201c[t]he obvious inference to be drawn from Gutberlet\u2019s testimony is that Appellant had been arrested or otherwise involved in trouble with the police on an earlier occasion,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">as argued by appellant. It is <em>an </em>inference which one might draw but not necessarily <em>the </em>obvious one. Assuming it were, however, the officer had previously testified that once the victim had identified the photographs of the defendants, he knew them by sight. If the inference was obvious the second time, it was equally obvious the first and appellant chose not to object initially. In like manner, if the testimony was not prejudicial the first time absent objection, its repetition subject to objection does not make it so. See <em>Peisner v. State, </em>236 Md. 137, 144, 202 A.2d 585 (1964). Beyond that, when appellant subjected himself to testimony of prior arrests, how the officer \u201cknew of\u201d him was implicit and consequently made harmless, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Dorsey </em>v. <em>State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
