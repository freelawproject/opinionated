In the suit, also directed against the owners and developers of the complex, appellants sought permanently to enjoin conversion, or at least until proper approval of a new report was obtained. They further sought to have the matter declared to be a class action. Significantly there has been no effort to obtain a temporary injunction, or otherwise to forestall the conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">A demurrer sustained (by Judge Fairbanks) to the original bill struck the tenants\u2019 association as a party plaintiff and the court\u2019s opinion narrowed the focus of any permissible cause of action to executive acts which might have been so arbitrary or capricious as to deprive plaintiffs of due process. The court expressly found that at that time it was unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>sary to decide whether the action was properly a class action. In light of the ultimate disposition of the case hindsight reveals that decision to have been an unfortunate one.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Be that as it may, appellants filed an amended bill to which appellees demurred generally, alleging a failure to comply with the substantive restrictions suggested by the opinion sustaining the former demurrer. Without a hearing or opinion this demurrer was overruled by Judge Cahoon who subsequently explained his reasoning to have been that a demurrer to substantive matters was an inappropriate way to dispose of declaratory judgments. See, <em>e.g., Urbana Civic Ass\u2019n v. Frederick Co., </em>23 Md.App. 49, 325 A.2d 755 (1974). Once again appellees requested a ruling on the question whether this case was an appropriate class action. Although we are unable to glean the vaguest hint from the record that the judge addressed that issue, appellants argue ironically that the judge implicitly determined that this case is a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The judge dismissed the case, with prejudice, upon preliminary motion, for want of interested parties pursuant to Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 3-405(a), noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnK\">\u201cFrom this record it is abundantly clear that the contract purchasers of the 500 apartment units have not been joined nor have any of those having acquired a mortgage interest in the condominium regime. From a review of the scope of the declaratory relief sought, it is manifest that a declaration in these proceedings would affect the interest of those persons. For these reasons, the Court will grant the Motion Raising Preliminary Objection and dismiss the action. There having been no efforts through this extended litigation to join these interested parties, the dismissal will be with prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Applying their implied holding of a \u201cclass action\u201d principle, appellants argue that the judge even determined the bounds of the class <em>(i.e., </em>contract purchasers and mortgagees) and thus</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>\u201c... the lower court abused its discretion by deciding on the initial pleadings that this suit is in effect a class action which should include all contract purchasers and mortgagees in the condominium regime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">Such an interpretation of Judge Cahoon\u2019s opinion obfuscates the issue to appellants\u2019 own detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">We need not reach the question of whether the contract purchasers and mortgagees were necessary parties whose interests would be affected by a declaration. Cts. Art. \u00a7 3-405.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue is whether appellants\u2019 inaction in adding them was so inexcusably dilatory as to warrant dismissal \u201cwith prejudice\u201d, keeping in mind that amendments are being allowed with increasing liberality. Judge Singley pointed out for the Court of Appeals in <em>Crowe v. Houseworth, </em>272 Md. 481, 485, 325 A.2d 592 (1974), that the Court has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201csaid that amendments should be freely allowed in order to promote justice, <em>Earl v. Anchor Pontiac Buick, Inc., </em>246 Md. 653, 656, 229 A.2d 412, 414 (1967) so that cases will be tried on their merits rather than upon the niceties of pleading, <em>Hall v. Barlow Corp., </em>255 Md. 28, 39-40, 255 A.2d 873, 878 (1969). Additional parties plaintiff may be added, <em>Ehrlich v. Board of Education of Baltimore County, </em>257 Md. 542, 547-50, 263 A.2d 853, 856-57 (1970), subject only to the limitation contained in Rule 320 b 2(a) that \u2018some one of the original plaintiffs and some one of the original defendants must remain as parties to the action.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Appellants initially appear to have been cognizant of the problem concerning who should have been included as necessary parties <em>(i.e., </em>those persons who had or claimed any interest in the proceeding; \u00a7 3-405). Knowledge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>possible standing of the unnamed parties is clear from the prayer for certification of the cases as a class action wherein appellants sought to be the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201crepresentatives of the class of tenants and prospective purchasers at the Willoughby Apartments, or of a lesser appropriate class.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">While there is some question in our mind whether \u201cprospective purchasers\u201d following the institution of suit against the developer would be necessary parties (since they would seem to take subject to the rights of the owner under the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>once suit is filed),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants were not even permitted to amend to join them as they become prospective purchasers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants, however, had anticipated such problem by asking to be their representative in a class action which would have avoided the cumbersomeness apparent in joining these people as parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Md.Rule 209, the class action rule, is by its very nature procedural. Its popularity as a public interest device has obscured its practical procedural purpose, which-is readily apparent by its expressed applicability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201cWhen there is a question of law or fact common to persons of a numerous class <em>whose joinder is impracticable, </em>one or more of them whose claims or defenses are representative of the claims or defenses of all and who will fairly and adequately protect the interests of all may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sue or be sued on behalf of all.\u201d Md.Rule 209 a (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">If the request for a certification is opposed, whenever</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzqE\">\u201ca class action is maintained of right, the court may adjudicate and declare the non-representative character of the action and render judgment specifically determining that only the parties to the action are bound thereby.\u201d Md.Rule 209 b.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The court is admonished by Rule 209 c to require notice to class members,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and is urged to innovate in fashioning protections for them\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-6\">\u201cThe court at any stage of the action may impose such terms as shall fairly and adequately protect the interest of the persons on whose behalf the action is brought or defended, including an order that notice be given in such manner as it may direct: (1) of the pendency of the action, (2) of a proposed settlement, (3) of rendition of judgment, (4) to come in and present claims, or (5) of any other proceedings in the action\u201d\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARU3\">and the class action shall not be dismissed or compromised but with court approval. Rule 209 d.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In short, the primary purpose of this rule is to overcome the impracticalities of overtly cumbersome joinder requirements. In <em>Bender v. Sec. Dep\u2019t of Personnel, </em>290 Md. 345, 430 A.2d 66 (1981), the Court of Appeals addressed \u201ca question involving necessary parties to a declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ment action.\u201d While holding that all 350 persons who had an interest in the declaration were necessary parties, the Court of Appeals remanded the case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhN\">\u201c... with directions to permit either an amendment adding the 350 unclassified employees as parties or, if appropriate, a class action under Md.Rule 209.\u201d <em>Id. </em>290 Md. at 356, 430 A.2d 66.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The message suggested to us by <em>Bender </em>apropos to our present concern, is that the trial judge should have decided appellee-developer\u2019s renewed request for ruling on class action before or concurrently with the ruling on the appellants\u2019 motion for preliminary relief predicated upon want of necessary parties. A party clearly has the right to expect the determination of any pending motions which may affect the outcome of the case prior to a decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Regardless of the merit of such motions, absent waiver, express or implied, a court failing to rule on them may be subject to reversal. We do not agree with appellants that by finding the contract purchasers and mortgagees to be necessary parties, the judge necessarily determined \u201cin effect\u201d that this case is a class action. Had he done so, the \u201cnecessary parties\u201d would not have to have been joined in the more formal sense. Notice, together with discretionary requisites protecting their rights and interests, would have to be prescribed under Rule 209 c as a substitution for the \u201cimpracticality\u201d of formally joining over five hundred people.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Upon remanding the case for determination of the class action issue we by no means suggest the conclusion to be reached, nor do we reach the question whether the contract purchasers are necessary parties. As Judge Davidson noted in <em>Bender, </em>the alternative (to permitting an amendment adding the necessary parties) of permitting a class action was only to be allowed \u201cif appropriate\u201d. Upon remand, we further suggest to the trial judge that if class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>action certification is appropriate, the appellants\u2019 early and expeditious request would seemingly alleviate their failure to join formally the cumbersome \u201cclass\u201d, if such it is determined. If, on the other hand, certification is inappropriate, the judge should reconsider the dismissal-with-prejudice in light of whether the unadjudicated request for class action certification was sufficient to excuse the failure to join all members of the class and consider whether any missing parties that are necessary to the proceeding might be added by amendment. <em>Crowe v. Houseworth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">This brings us to the motion of appellee developers to dismiss the appeal as moot. We deny that motion because it is predicated upon facts alleged, but unproven as part of the record, there having been no evidentiary hearing. We cannot upon appeal accept factual conclusions as if we were a trial court deciding a motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, both sides have asked us either to determine whether a condominium regime was established or to conclude that it was not. To make such determination <em>de novo </em>is not our permitted role. Nor are we to give advisory opinions concerning what laws apply and who, if anyone, violated them as is requested by appellees. <em>Harford Co. v. Schultz, </em>280 Md. 77, 80-81, 371 A.2d 428 (1977) and <em>Hammond v. Lancaster, </em>194 Md. 462, 471-472, 71 A.2d 474 (1950). All of these issues, as well as the mootness issue, are precisely the issues appellants sought to determine had they not been deprived of their day in court. If the case is moot, that determination should be made after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We hold only that the discretionary abuse by the court which warrants reversal and remand consisted of its having decided in a vacuum the prehearing motion to dismiss for want of necessary parties without having considered the pending application for certification of the case as a class action. Since one was a procedural amelioration of the apparent impracticalities of the other, as viewed by the judge, neither could have been decided properly without considering the other. That is especially so in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>early request for class action adjudication which was repeatedly requested throughout the \u201cextended\u201d litigation period prior to the time when the want of parties issue was raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Finally, we note that appellants\u2019 motion to limit their costs is moot in light of the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">. Appellants do not argue that the contract parties were not necessary parties. Rather they contend primarily that the class action impliedly granted sufficed to include them but was improperly decided without a hearing on the class\u2019s definition. As an afterthought by rebuttal brief, appellants contend that because the contract parties would benefit, there was no need to serve them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\">. \u201cIn any action to which the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>is applicable, service of process shall not be necessary to create <em>lis pendens.\u201d </em>Md.Rule BD1. The Committee note to the rule points out that \u201c[i]t is the express intention of Lis Pendens Rule to overrule the existing case law, which holds that the mere filing of the original pleading does not create lis pendens, but that there must also be service of process.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\">. At argument counsel could not tell us if or how many prospective purchasers existed prior to the filing of suit in April of 1981. The record reflects only that in July 1981 35% of the units had been contracted for; however, none of the contract purchasers were of record and none were expressly known to appellant even when the court placed the burden of suing and serving over 500 of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">. Appellants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Reddick v. State, </em>213 Md. 18, 130 A.2d 762 (1957), for the principle that constructive notice (presumed knowledge) was adequate (even if class action had been allowed) is completely in error. The declaratory judgment act <em>mandates </em>notice which was factually alleviated in <em>Reddick </em>only because all of the interested parties in that case actually appeared as witnesses and indicated their full knowledge of the proceedings and what was involved therein. The narrow exception to the mandatory rule which was sanctioned by the Court in <em>Reddick </em>requires a showing in the record reviewed that the missing necessary party had full knowledge (not constructive knowledge) of the pending litigation, and that it affects, and will determine, his rights, but who without attempting to intervene knowingly permits a conclusion thereof without objection. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 130 A.2d 762.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">.
