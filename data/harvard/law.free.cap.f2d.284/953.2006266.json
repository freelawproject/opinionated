United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1001-21\">SMITH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1001-22\">Appellant\u2019s petition to cancel registration No. 624,348 issued to appellee on its mark \u201cGalvieon\u201d on April 3, 1956, for \u201cGalvanizing and Rust-Resistant Paints and Solvents for Metals,\u201d was dismissed by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (120 USPQ 505). This appeal from the dismissal of the petition raises the issue as to whether under the provisions of Section 2 of the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052), the mark \u201cGal-vieon\u201d so resembles appellant\u2019s registered mark \u201cGalvanum\u201d as to be likely, when applied to the goods of appellee, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-23\">The pertinent facts upon which the parties are agreed show:</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-24\">1. Appellant is the prior user by many years of its mark \u201cGalvanum\u201d and is the owner of trademark registration No. 133,677 issued to a predecessor on August 3, 1920, and since renewed. Appellant and its predecessor have used and are now using the mark in connection with the sale of paint particularly intended as a protective coating for <em>galvanized </em>iron surfaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-25\">2. Appellee since February 4, 1953 has used the name \u201cGalvieon\u201d for a pfo-tective coating and solvents therefor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>The coating contains a high proportion of zinc and is used cold to provide a rust resisting protective coating, sometimes referred to as <em>\u201ccold galvanizing\u201d </em>on iron or steel surfaces which are subject to corrosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">3. Comparing the marks as a whole, the common prefix \u201cGalv\u201d is found in both marks. The respective suffixes \u201cIcon\u201d and \u201cAnum\u201d differ in sound and appearance. The affidavit of Grebinar describes the origin and meaning of ap-pellee\u2019s mark as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cThe mark Galvicon was coined by me from the dictionary term \u2018Gal-vano,\u2019 which is defined by Webster\u2019s Dictionary as a \u2018combining form for galvanic or galvanism\u2019, to describe the electrical action which occurs between Respondent\u2019s product and the coated base metal. The suffix \u2018con\u2019 forming a part of Respondent\u2019s mark was added to the prefix \u2018Galvi\u2019 to suggest the electrical contact or binding properties between the coating and the base metal, \u2018con\u2019 also being a dictionary term defined as \u2018with\u2019 or \u2018together.\u2019 The mark was coined by me on or about 1952.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">4. The prefix \u201cGalv\u201d is shown to have been used in other registered trademarks, some ten in number, all of which registrations have been issued since the registration of appellant\u2019s mark. Such a prefix also is shown in a list of trademarks listed in The Thomas Register of American Manufacturers subsequent to the effective date of the registration of appellant\u2019s mark \u201cGalvanum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board concluded that the common syllable of the two marks was \u201chighly suggestive\u201d as applied to the goods and concluded that \u201cthe differences between the marks are such as to preclude reasonable likelihood of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">We agree with the conclusions reached by\u201d the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. The common prefix \u201cGalv\u201d used in the two marks in issue has no significance as indicating either party as the source or origin of the respective goods to which the names are applied. The word \u201cGalvano\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d ed., as a combining form as used in the words \u201cgalvanic, galvanism.\u201d The same dictionary defines the words \u201cgalvanic\u201d' and \u201cgalvanism\u201d from which we find that, both terms were derived from the proper name of Luigi Galvani on account of his connection with the discovery of \u201cdynamical electricity.\u201d Substantially the-same combining form also appears in, the word \u201cgalvanize\u201d which in its second definition means \u201cto coat (iron or steel)with zinc; as galvanized iron.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">While it is necessary in analyzing the-similarities and differences of the marks in issue to dissect them, our decision is based on a comparison of the entire-marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">\u2022 At the time the mark \u201cGalvanum\u201d was first adopted and used by appellant\u2019s-predecessor it was a coined word in-which \u201cGalv\u201d or \u201cGalvan\u201d was highly suggestive of the intended uses of the-products on which the mark was used. Thus when appellee adopted and used its mark \u201cGalvicon\u201d using the same prefix, it was using a common combining form also found in the descriptive term \u201cgalvanize.\u201d Such distinctiveness as there is in-appellee\u2019s mark must be found in the-\u201cIcon\u201d suffix.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">Thus when we consider the marks in their entireties we are impressed, and we think a purchaser of the goods also-will be impressed with the fact that the-similarities of the mark do not have that. . distinctiveness which by themselves, would enable the marks to indicate the source or origin of the goods of either party. The distinctive portions of the respective marks cause the names to-sound different because of the difference in pronunciation. Also, the differences in appearance between the marks include, in addition to the difference between \u201c-Anum\u201d and \u201c-Icon,\u201d the use of script with the tail of the \u201cG\u201d extending under the whole word in petitioner\u2019s mark while appellee\u2019s mark is in plain block capital letters. The marks thus look different. To the extent the distinctive portions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>the marks have any significance they convey distinctive meanings to a prospective purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">While each case must stand \u2022essentially on its own facts, the conclusion we here reach finds ample legal support in earlier decisions of this court, among which are Sure-Fit Products Co. v. Saltzson Drapery Co., 254 F.2d 158, 45 CCPA 856; National Motor Bearing Co., Inc. v. James-Pond-Clark, 266 F.2d 799, 46 CCPA 877, and Shoe Corp. of America v. The Juvenile Shoe Corp. of America, 266 F.2d 793, 796, 46 CCPA 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">In the Shoe Corp. case this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahy-dedup-1\">\u201cIn determining whether a word or <em>syllable </em>has a descriptive or suggestive significance as applied to merchandise, it is proper to take notice of the extent to which it has \"been used in trademarks by others on such merchandise. If it has been frequently so used, the inference is warranted that it is not purely arbitrary; that it would be likely to be understood by purchasers as identifying or describing the merchandise itself, rather than the source thereof and hence as having little or no trademark significance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">We, therefore, approve of the summary of the board in the concluding paragraph \u25a0of its opinion which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-7\">\u201cConsidering the highly suggestive nature of the common syllable of the two marks [\u201cGalv-\u201d] as applied to the goods, it is concluded that the \u25a0differences between the marks are such as to preclude any reasonable likelihood of confusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">For the foregoing reasons the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1003-10\">WORLEY, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ab_-dedup-0\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">In my opinion \u201cGalvicon\u201d and \u201cGalva-num\u201d are so similar in sound, appearance, and meaning that their concurrent use on the goods of the respective parties, which are substantially identical, would be quite likely to lead to confusion. In view of that fact, and of the well-settled rule that doubts as to registrability should be resolved against the newcomer, I am of the opinion that appellant\u2019s opposition should have been sustained and that the decision appealed from should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
