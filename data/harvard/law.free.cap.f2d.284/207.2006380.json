Koontz. The accident occurred shortly after midnight at or near the intersection of 47th and Upton Streets, Northwest. Koontz\u2019s testimony was confusing and inconsistent. He repeatedly testified that he did not see the pedestrian before striking him, but he said that he saw what he described as a \u201cshadow\u201d when he was in the middle of the intersection and that he then applied his brakes. The plaintiff administratrix had the burden of proving that Koontz should have seen Skinner in time to avoid the accident. She failed to do so. She failed to offer any evidence either of the decedent\u2019s direction of travel or of the point of impact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The jury was thus left to mere speculation on those two issues, which were crucial to her cause under the circumstances of this case. Upon the evidence in this record the jury could properly have accepted the plaintiff\u2019s contention that Koontz was traveling at a minimum of twenty miles per hour when he passed through the intersection, but she failed to make any showing that such speed was unreasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, viewing the evidence most favorably to the plaintiff administratrix,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we hold that there was not sufficient evidence of negligence to warrant a jury in finding a verdict for the plaintiff. Hence the District Judge properly granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b256-11\">. 31 Stat. 1394 (1901), as amended, D.C.

Appellant urges us to accept certain principles of driver accountability set forth in Frisina v. Dailey, 395 Pa. 280, 150 A.2d 348 (1959). Those principles may have been well suited to the particular facts of that case, but they cannot be applied in this case in the absence of vital evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b256-21\">.
