Section 15 of the Act requires all \u201cwater borne\u201d carriers to file with the Board contracts made between them and other such carriers, or between a carrier and any other \u201cperson subject to this Act,\u201d whom \u00a7 1 of the Act, defines as anyone not a carrier, \u201ccarrying on the business of forwarding or furnishing wharfage, dock, warehouse, or other terminal facilities in connection with a common carrier by water.\u201d Thus it would seem that, so far as concerns contracts between the carriers themselves and other \u201cpersons subject to the Act,\u201d \u00a7 21 was not necessary; such contracts fell within \u00a7 15. The petitioners argue that for this reason we should not hold that the \u201ctransactions\u201d as used in \u00a7 21 included \u201ccontracts between carriers.\u201d That would seem to us a wanton perversion of the natural meaning of the words, even if both sections had the same scope. Every \u201ccontract\u201d presupposes a \u201ctransaction,\u201d for it results from some mutual dealing between the parties, and to limit its scope to such dealings as do not result in a contract would, especially in this setting, do the utmost violence to its normal meaning. Any significance of the substitution of \u201ctransaction\u201d in \u00a7 21 as a limitation disappears when we remember that that section covers more than \u201ccontracts,\u201d and in addition that it covers more contracts than those covered by \u00a7 15. There is likewise no significance in the provision of \u00a7 407(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1377(a), which was previously in the same section of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, empowering the Civil Aeronautics Board to \u201crequire any air carrier to file with it a true copy of each or any contract, agreement, understanding, or arrangement, between such air carrier and any other carrier or person, in relation to any traffic affected by the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Since the Aviation Act contains no provision of the breadth of \u00a7 21 of the Shipping Act, the specific grant to the Civil Aeronautics Board of the power to require the filing of contracts of air carriers implied no recognition that the general language of \u00a7 21 had not conferred such a power upon the Maritime Board with respect to carriers by water.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Nor can we agree that the orders were too vague to be valid. It is of course true that they are in general terms and that their ambit is not defined with verbal exactness; but precisely limited demands would have been impossible in an investigation of the kind proposed. Decisions of a carrier as to what \u201ctransactions\u201d were within the orders if made in good faith, would not necessarily result in fines of $100 a day, although the court disagreed with the carrier\u2019s understanding of what \u201ctransactions\u201d were covered. It appears to us that the orders are as definite as the subject-matter permitted, and did not impose any unreasonable risk upon a carrier who in good faith should submit all contracts that seemed to it to be within the intent of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Next, the petitioners complain that the orders were beyond the competence of the Board because they required the petitioners to produce copies of contracts that were outside the United' States. It is to be noted in the first place that the orders do not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>production of the original \u201cmemorandums\u201d of contracts with other carriers, but only copies. Even were we to assume for argument, which we do not mean to suggest, that the Board could not have demanded production and inspection of such originals if they were outside the United States, that is not the question before us. The investigation was to acquaint the Board with what were the practices of carriers engaged in commerce with the United States, and it was essential to that purpose to know what took place outside the United States as well as. inside. Nobody would argue, we should suppose, that oral agreements made in other countries could have no effect upon the commerce of the United States, which was the subject being investigated. The Board could not proceed unless it found out what were the arrangements between carriers and between a carrier and others who took part in its preparations, no matter where the \u201ctransactions\u201d occurred. It would be absurd, for example, to hold that the Board had no power to examine a witness as to what had been agreed abroad, if that was relevant to the terms and conditions of the eventual carriage. We can see no valid distinction between such an inquiry and the production of a \u2022copy of the agreement \u2014 \u201ctransaction\u201d\u2014 in which those concerned formulated their obligations. The extent to which the information could be forcibly elicited is another matter, not in the least relevant to whether it may be lawfully demanded. Sections 27 and 29 provide other procedure, but not necessarily to the exclusion of an action under \u00a7 15 or \u00a7 21. The process by which an order is to be enforced is one thing, its validity is another.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Next, the petitioners argue that to require them to prepare and file copies of all their \u201ctransactions\u201d in foreign commerce would violate their constitutional protection from unlawful search and seizure. It is true that the order of such a tribunal as the Board may be so burdensome as to require modification (United States v. Morton Salt Co., 1950, 338 U.S. 632, 651-654, 70 S.St. 357, 94 L.Ed. 401) and that even in the case of corporations, its discretion is not beyond any judicial review whatever. But \u201ccorporations can claim no equality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to privacy\u201d (338 U.S. at page 652, 70 S.Ct. at page 368). \u201cEven if one were to regard the request for information in this case as caused by nothing more than official curiosity, nevertheless law-enforcing agencies have a legitimate right to satisfy themselves that corporate behavior is consistent with the law and the public interest\u201d (338 U.S. at page 652, 70 S.Ct. at page 369). It does not appear that any of the petitioners tried to show what was the financial burden of listing and copying the contracts in question, or that it was out of all reasonable proportion to any purpose that the proposed investigation might have. Until it did, the carrier could not resist complete disclosure; and, if it did, it could resist only so much as it proved to be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Nor does the accompanying complaint impress us any more: that is, that an omnibus disclosure of the kind demanded might include secret arrangements between carriers, or a carrier and another person whether or not he was \u201csubject to the Act.\u201d That was presumably one of the purposes of the whole investigation, and it is strange indeed to have it argued that a common carrier, may refuse to tell what are its secret agreements with others engaged in the enterprise, when the inquiry was to learn among other things what those secret arrangements were, and how far they might trench upon that freedom of commerce that it was one of the purposes of the Act to secure. If such an inquiry annoys other governments, as apparently it does, their complaint must be addressed to the Executive; it is not a matter with which courts have any power to deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Petitions denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-14\">.
