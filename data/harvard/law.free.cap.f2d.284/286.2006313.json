The dissent depicts the appellant as just another one of the \u201cmere addicts\u201d upon whom the \u201cpresent narcotics statutes\u201d have an \u201cunfortunate impact.\u201d The record does not support the argument that this appellant is a \u201cmere addict.\u201d Apart from any of the information which the officers had received or the testimony of government agents that appellant engaged in drug traffic, Delores Terry, a friend of appellant who had no connection with the government, testified that appellant had supplied drugs to her \u201cfrequently.\u201d She testified that this occurred when she lived with appellant in the summer of 1959 and her description of one episode with the \u201cmere addict\u201d is disclosed by the following excerpt from the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">\u201cQ. Did Trent buy drugs for you or supply you with drugs? A. He bought drugs for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">\u201cQ. Frequently? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cQ. Now, then, did you ever pay him for them? A. No, I just gave him some of the stuff, that\u2019s all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cQ. What kind of a habit did Trent have; do you know? A. Same kind I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cQ. What would that be? A. You mean what type of drugs he used?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">Q. Yes. A. Heroin. <em>it</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cQ. Were you ever in Trent\u2019s presence when he went out to obtain money to purchase drugs ? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">\u201cQ. Would you describe any one incident, as to what happened? A. I went shoplifting with him to get some money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">\u201cQ. How frequently did you do that? A.

He wasn\u2019t a dealer, if that is what you mean.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-22\">\u201cQ. No, but I meant, you would give him money to get it; isn\u2019t that right? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-23\">In great specificity the testimony showed Trent not only to be supporting himself generally by this unfortunate girl\u2019s illicit earnings but also supporting his drug habit by procuring drugs for her and taking his \u201ccompensation\u201d for that illegal brokerage in the form of part of the drugs so procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-24\">The courts have regularly condemned and penalized enforcement by true entrapment procedures. Such methods are universally proscribed. Sherman v. United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819, 2 L.Ed.2d 848; Sorrells v. United States, 1932, 287 U.S. 435, 53 S.Ct. 210, 77 L.Ed. 413. But this case is a far cry from Sherman or Sorrells. It is well settled that \u201c[ajrtifice and stratagem may be employed to catch those engaged in criminal enterprises.\u201d 287 U.S. at page 441, 53 S.Ct. at ppg\u00a1e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>212. In discussing the rule as it applied to Sorrells the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">\u201cThe act for which the defendant was prosecuted was instigated by the prohibition agent, * * * it was the creature of his purpose * * * defendant had no previous disposition to commit [the crime] but was an industrious, law-abiding citizen, and * * * otherwise innocent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The distinction between the \u201cinnocent\u201d and the \u201cpredisposed\u201d was again emphasized in Sherman v. United States, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cTo determine whether entrapment has been established, a line must be drawn between a trap for the unwary <em>innocent </em>and a trap for the unwary criminal. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) 356 U.S. at page 372, 78 S.Ct. at page 821.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The distinction was also emphasized by Judge Washington in Guarro v. United States, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 101, 237 F.2d 578, 582:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201cThere are many situations wherein use of police decoys is permissible, and perhaps a practical necessity. Drug peddlers are hard to catch if the undercover policeman may not make a purchase. And * * * it may lead to a conviction * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">No one can seriously challenge the proposition that the courts should not aid or \u2022even tolerate criminal prosecution for acts \u201cwhich [the accused] otherwise would not have attempted.\u201d Such methods will tend to foster crime and ought not be employed on behalf of the government to bring about convictions. Such methods ought to be and often are condemned by trial courts as well as appellate courts. See United States v. Johnson, Crim.No. 434-60, D.D.C. Sept. 16, 1960. The disturbing factor is that such cases as Sherman or Johnson can occur at all. But this is plainly not such a case. The question here is whether it can reasonably be said on this record that Trent, who trafficked in narcotics on behalf of Delores Terry as well as with the undercover officer, meets the test of an \u201cinnocent person\u201d lured by police into crimes \u201cwhich [he] otherwise would not have attempted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">When the appellant here is \u201csubjected to [the] \u2018appropriate and searching inquiry into his own conduct * * * \u2019 as bearing on his claim of innocence\u201d (Sherman, 356 U.S. at page 373, 78 S.Ct. at page 821), his claim, as that of the dissent, that he was a \u201cmere addict,\u201d who was \u201cinnocent\u201d until lured into crime by government agents, simply falls apart. Appellant\u2019s predisposition to engage in narcotics trafficking was not, as in Sherman, remote in point of time by several years, but current and active as the undisputed testimony of Delores Terry discloses. It should not be overlooked that the whole of her testimony showed her to be friendly to appellant and hostile to the government, even though she was called as a government witness. -</p>\n<p id=\"b336-15\">The issue of entrapment was properly submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions. This record does not show as a matter of law, as contended by appellant and by the dissent, that the police or any police informant \u201chad convinced an otherwise unwilling person to commit a criminal act.\u201d Quite the contrary the evidence shows that appellant \u201cwas already predisposed to commit the act and exhibited only the natural hesitancy of one acquainted with the narcotics trade.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Sherman v. United States, supra; Sorrels v. United States, supra. On the first transaction with the police officer appellant received $6 for two capsules and kept two capsules for himself. This afforded a basis on which a jury could reasonably conclude that this transaction was in the same pattern of his transactions with the witness Delores Terry, where appellant\u2019s \u201cprofit\u201d on the transaction was taken in the form of narcotics rather than cash. Moreover, the record shows that when first approached by the plainclothes officer appellant refused to sell to him because, according to the officer\u2019s testimony, \u201che [appellant] didn\u2019t know who I was. He didn\u2019t know whether I was a policeman or who.\u201d On a second approach the officer was told by appellant to \u201cwait a while and I will talk to you.\u201d This sequence of events, appellant now argues, shows that he, an \u201cinnocent mind\u201d was entrapped to do wrong. However, a jury could reasonably view this conduct not as showing innocence of criminal disposition, but as a manifestation of the caution and wariness of one seasoned and knowledgeable in the ways of the drug traffic, and suspicious lest his customer be a police officer or informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">No doubt also a jury would, and reasonably so, be influenced by the whole pattern of appellant\u2019s activities and mode of life, his willingness to live off the illicit earnings of Delores Terry, his activity in procuring drugs for her and taking his \u201cpay\u201d in narcotics caps, his wary responses to the agent\u2019s efforts to buy. Perhaps, too, the jury may have taken into account the fact that while Agent Coursey was aware of Delores Terry\u2019s weaknesses and need for narcotics he never tried to induce her to get drugs for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">At this posture of the case we are not free to reject what the jury accepted as true nor to accept as true Trent\u2019s testimony which the jury refused to believe. But the dissent elects to reject or ignore the testimony of Delores Terry and of Agent Coursey and to accept as true the contradictory and equivocal self serving suggestion of appellant that Dorothy Washington induced him to abandon his pure state and return to his drug habit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The dissent seems to recognize that in Sherman the Supreme Court did <em>not </em>choose between conflicting witnesses or pass on credibility, but rather reached its conclusion \u201cfrom the undisputed testimony of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.\u201d 356 U.S. at page 373, 78 S.Ct. at page 821. But the dissent attempts to bridge this very great difference in the facts of Sherman and the facts here by drawing inferences in favor of Trent from the prosecution\u2019s failure to call Dorothy Washington as a witness; he would have us say that because the prosecution failed to call this witness we are <em>compelled </em>to reject the undisputed testimony of Delores Terry and of Agent Coursey and believe Trent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">Because defense counsel was free to argue the \u201cmissing witness\u201d point and because <em>the jury </em>was free to draw inferences unfavorable to the prosecution, it does not follow that at this very late date we are under a compulsion, as the dissent seems to be, to believe appellant. Deaver v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 148, 155 F.2d 740, certiorari denied, 1946, 329 U.S. 766, 67 S.Ct. 121, 91 L.Ed. 659; United States v. Davis, 7 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 871; Ferrari v. United States, 9 Cir., 244 F.2d 132, certiorari denied, Darneille v. U. S., 1957, 355 U.S. 873, 78 S.Ct. 125, 2 L.Ed.2d 78; cf. Masciale v. United States, 1957, 356 U.S. 386, 78 S.Ct. 827, 2 L.Ed.2d 859. Indeed, we as an appellate court are not even free to accept his testimony, which the jury must be deemed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>have rejected. To accept Trent\u2019s testimony would require us to reject other credible testimony believed by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Assuming, arguendo, that the evidence warranted the missing witness instruction with respect to Dorothy Washington if the defense had requested it, (but cf. Richards v. United States, 1960, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 275 F.2d 655; see also United States v. Jackson, 3 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 41; United States v. Beekman, 2 Cir., 1946, 155 F.2d 580) the failure to give it without a request is not \u201cplain error\u201d under Rule 52(b) Fed.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.A. That instruction is but one of a multitude of evidentiary instructions; denying the instruction might be error had it been asked for, but it was not indispensable to a fair trial on this record. This is pointed up by the fact that it is often a carefully calculated defense tactic <em>not </em>to ask for such an instruction in a close case thus leaving the defense free to press upon the jury the prosecution\u2019s failure to call an alleged \u201cmissing witness.\u201d There having been no such instruction requested, failure to give it is not \u201cplain error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Some would perhaps think it would be more appropriate for courts to extend a modicum of judicial sympathy to Delores Terry and the other potential victims of Trent\u2019s varied procuring activities, rather than on Trent. For surely if he is set free as the dissent would have us do\u2014 with his conduct judicially vindicated as it will appear to him \u2014 there will be other Delores Terrys, whose earnings from shoplifting, prostitution or other crimes will be exploited by Trent.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-28\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 174; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4704(a), 4705(a) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\"><em>. </em>As pointed out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his Sherman concurrence, the <em>particular </em>sale to an officer or police agent is <em>always </em>one induced by the purchaser.

United States, No. 15514, - U.S.App.D.C. -, F.2d -; and once again raises very serious questions regarding the methods employed by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in enforcing these statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">Although the narcotics laws are, in Congress\u2019 own view, primarily designed to deter and punish professional narcotics traffickers who prey upon the weak and defenseless,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they wreak their stiff vengeance upon both these leeches and their victims. Congress recognized that \u201cDrug addiction is * * * a symptom of a mental or psychiatric disorder * * .\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from which it would appear to follow that the answer to the problem of addiction lies in medical and rehabilitative treatment and not severe, mechanical prison sentences which frustrate rather than facilitate rehabilitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But until Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>gress, in recognition of its own findings, sees fit to remedy the situation, the judicial machinery must grind out its sorry grist by convicting as traffickers, addicts whose possession of, or transactions with, narcotics bring them within the ambit of the narcotics control laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The cloth of judicial self-restraint, however, cannot be stretched to shield the conviction of a narcotics addict whose \u201ctragic dependency upon drugs\u201d was created by agents of the Government who then preyed upon this weakness to induce him to procure narcotics for fellow sufferers in need. That is this case. Accordingly, the conviction should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The record shows that one John Cour-sey, after a two-year training course at the Pennsylvania Institute of Criminology, was commissioned as a Treasury narcotics agent on March 16, 1959. He was assigned to the New York field office and almost immediately thereafter detailed to the Washington field office. Under the direction of three other agents, he was assigned to work under-cover in a group of addicts centering around one Dorothy Washington, an under-cover \u201cspecial employee\u201d of the Narcotics Bureau.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Miss Washington, herself an addict, financed her \u201chabit\u201d by prostitution. Her special utility to Coursey lay in the fact that she operated a rooming-house which was used as a \u201cpad\u201d \u2014 a place where addicts would gather to take their shots of heroin in company \u2014 as well as a brothel.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Appellant first became addicted to drugs in 1954 when he was about 18 years old. He paid for the drugs he used by selling his clothes, by stealing from his grandmother, with whom he lived, and by shop-lifting. His shop-lifting led to petty larceny convictions in 1954 and 1958. In April of 1959, appellant was discharged from the District of Columbia General Hospital Rehabilitation Clinic where he had been committed as a \u201cnarcotics vagrant.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 33-416a (Supp. VIII 1960). According to his unchallenged testimony, he was at that time cured of his drug addiction. He obtained regular employment and lived with his grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">It was at this stage of his life, when he had never peddled drugs and was no longer using them, that the agents of the Narcotics Bureau fixed their attention upon him and instituted a course of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>duct culminating in his present conviction. In May of 1959 \u201cspecial employee\u201d Washington, who had been a friend of appellant\u2019s for years, began to give him drugs and to invite him to stay at her rooming-house. The circumstances of Trent\u2019s readdiction are detailed in the following uncontradicted testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201cQ. Now when you came out [of D. C. General] you were no longer an addict? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201cQ. And you went back to Narcotics in May or June? A. May.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cQ. And the narcotic was heroin ? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cQ. Who got you back on narcotics? A. Informer mentioned in this case. She kept telling me to come\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cQ. Who was it? A. Dorothy Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cQ. Was she your girl friend? A. She had been a friend of mine for years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\u201cQ. Now how did she get you back on? A. <em>She would give me stuff. </em>She would give me narcotics when we \u2014 she had them, and I just started venturing back into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">\u201cQ. Were you living with her? A. She asked me to come and stay with her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">\u201cQ. Did you? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">\u201cQ. Did you actually stay with her or\u2014 A. No. She asked me to come and stay. She had a room down in the basement that I could stay there if I would like.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">By June of 1959 \u2014 one month later \u2014 he was again in the throes of addiction and was living rent-free in the basement of Miss Washington\u2019s house with another young woman addict, named Delores Terry, who supported her \u201chabit\u201d by prostitution. With the profits of her profession, she also helped to supply appellant with drugs. Appellant\u2019s other source of income was the fairly regular shoplifting expeditions which he undertook, sometimes with the help of Miss Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-21\">Agent Coursey, who had been working for some time among the wretches centering about the special employee\u2019s \u201cpad,\u201d met appellant shox*tly after his re-addiction. The special employee led appellant to believe that Coursey was her boy friend and Coursey conceded that \u201cshe may have\u201d told appellant that \u201che [Cour-sey] was alright.\u201d Between them, the two under-cover agents began to urge appellant to procure drugs for them and, in a few weeks, the two transactions occurred from which this case arises. The first transaction consisted of appellant procuring four capsules of heroin at the standard price of $1.50 per capsule, with money supplied by Agent Coursey. He gave two of the capsules to the agent and retained two for himself. Appellant agreed to obtain these drugs only after Coursey\u2019s repeated pleas that he needed heroin for his sick girl friend.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the second transaction, appellant, acting at Miss Washingtoxx\u2019s request, procured four capsules and delivered them to her but was paid by Agent Coursey. These are the two \u201csales\u201d for which appellant was convicted as a drug peddler.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-22\">My brethren hold that the immediate circumstances of the two sales do not amount to entrapment as a matter of law. I do not reach that question. Finding that the Government, through its agents, lured appellant into his dependency on drugs, I would hold that the Government may not prosecute him for offenses that spring directly from his addiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-23\">In a case most similar to the one before us, the Supreme Court reversed a conviction because it found the defendant had, as a matter of law, been entrapped into selling narcotics to an undercover agent who preyed upon his sympathies as a fellow addict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>that \u201cCongress could not have intended that its statutes were to be enforced by tempting innocent persons into violations.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I think it equally clear that Congress could not have intended that the narcotics laws be enforced by tempting weak-willed persons into <em>addiction, </em>and then convicting them for violations which would not have been committed but for such addiction. The Supreme Court said in Sherman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-4\">\u201cThe case at bar illustrates an evil which the defense of entrapment is designed to overcome. The government informer entices someone attempting to avoid narcotics not only into carrying out an illegal sale but also into returning to the habit of use. * * * Thus the Government plays on the weaknesses of an innocent party and beguiles him into committing crimes which he otherwise would not have attempted. Law enforcement does not require methods such as this.\u201d [Id. 356 U.S. at page 376, 78 S.Ct. at page 822.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">I do not leave out of consideration the fact that in Sherman the Supreme Court avoided the problem of judging credibility by resting its conclusion that the defendant was entrapped as a matter of law solely upon testimony of prosecution witnesses. In the instant case, the evidence that the Government agents drew appellant back into drug addiction comes from appellant whose credibility may, of course, be questioned. In my opinion, however, the circumstances not only justify but require a resolution of any doubts in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Trent\u2019s testimony was essentially consistent with that of Agent Coursey and was corroborated in many respects by defense witnesses. The prosecution introduced no evidence to challenge his testimony that he came out of the hospital cured of his addiction. If that testimony were false, presumably the hospital\u2019s records or its staff members would have been available to contradict it. No such evidence was produced. Appellant\u2019s testimony that he was lured back into addiction by Dorothy Washington, the special employee of the Narcotics Bureau, was likewise uncontradieted. It too could have been refuted, if untrue, simply by calling the special employee to the witness stand. But the prosecution not only failed to call her as a witness, it failed to cooperate in any way with the earnest efforts of appellant to locate her for the purpose of calling her as his witness to corroborate his testimony. Appellant\u2019s efforts to subpoena the special employee at the address of her rooming-house proved unavailing when the marshal reported that she had moved from that address. Appellant\u2019s grandmother testified that she had seen and talked to the special employee in the city ten days before the trial, but that, when she tried to reach her at the address to which Miss Washington was said to have moved the information proved false. The prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tion\u2019s only contribution to the search was to object to the grandmother\u2019s testimony concerning what the special employee had told her.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">. Considering Miss Washington\u2019s employment by the Government, the crucial role she played in making the Government\u2019s case, and the obvious importance of the testimony she could give, an attitude of malevolent neutrality did not discharge the prosecution\u2019s burden. Having failed to make the least effort to produce this critical witness or to facilitate appellant\u2019s search for her, the prosecution should not be permitted to challenge the presumption that the witness would have corroborated appellant\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Concluding as I do that the circumstances disclosed by the record constitute entrapment as a matter of law, I would reverse the conviction and remand the case to the District Court for entry of a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">I should add that even if the issue of entrapment were not resolved in favor of appellant as a matter of law I think the conviction should be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial because of the absence of a missing witness instruction, see note 9 supra, and also on the ground that, contrary to my brethren\u2019s conclusion, the entrapment issue was not submitted to the jury under appropriate instructions. The District Court failed to separate the element which the defendant must establish <em>(i. e., </em>inducement) from that which the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt <em>(i. e., </em>predisposition). The necessity for drawing this distinction to the jury\u2019s attention is fully discussed by Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Sherman, 2 Cir., 1952, 200 F.2d 880, and need not be elaborated here. I agree with Judge Hand that failure to give such instructions is \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">. For other instances, see Sherman v.

Miss Washington did not appear at the trial and the record does not disclose the mode of compensation. From assertions in other cases, it would appear that narcotics employees are compensated in various ways: (1) actual cash payments for each narcotics offender turned over to the Bureau for prosecution (See note 1 <em>supra </em>concerning the case from the Southern District of New York, reported in the N. Y. Times, March 5, 1959, p. 53. The special employee there was paid forty to sixty dollars for each case he \u201cmade\u201d and had earned some $1,-200 for eighteen cases reported over a three-year period); (2) immunity from prosecution under the narcotics laws in return for continued cooperation in reporting other offenders (See trial transcript in Willis v. United States, - U.S.App.D.C. -, 285 F.2d 663, where the defendant testified he was offered immunity from prosecution for making sales to suspected offenders in the presence of a narcotics agent and was himself framed when he refused to continue this cooperation) ; (3) payment in narcotics (See Deutsch, The Trouble With Oops 98 (2d ed. 1955); and Senate Committee on the District of Columbia, Investigation of Crime and Law Enforcement in the District of Columbia, S.Rep.No.1989, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. 15 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"Aru\">The use of informers in narcotics cases is well described and documented in J. Goldstein, Police Discretion Not To Invoke the Criminal Process: Low Visibility Decisions in the Administration of Justice, 69 Yale L.J. 543, 562-73 (1960).

United States, 1958, 356 U.S. 369, 78 S.Ct. 819. The facts were that the defendant met a Government informer at a doctor\u2019s office while both were undergoing cures for addiction. Their accidental acquaint-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>anee grew until the informer, claiming he was not responding to treatment, requested the defendant to secure narcotics for him. The defendant refused, became evasive, but finally capitulated to recurrent pleas. Although the Government attempted to show that the defendant\u2019s prior narcotics convictions demonstrated ready compliance, the Court found this insufficient to demonstrate predisposition. The Court pointed out that there was \u201cno evidence that petitioner himself was in the [narcotics] trade.\u201d Id., 356 U.S. at page 375, 78 S.Ct. at page 822.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. 356 U.S. at page 372, 78 S.Ct. at page 821. In a concurring opinion Justice Frankfurter, joined by Justices Douglas, Harlan and Brennan, took issue with this rationale. He argued that \u201cThe courts refuse to convict an entrapped defendant, not because his conduct falls outside the proscription of the statute, but because, even if his guilt be admitted, the methods employed on behalf of the Government \u2022 to bring about conviction cannot be countenanced.\u201d Id. 356 U.S. at page 380, 78 S.Ct. 825. This view also covers this case. The \u201cpolice conduct revealed [here] falls below standards, to which common feelings respond, for the proper use of governmental power.\u201d Id. 356 U.S. at page 382, 78 S.Ct. at page 825.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. The prosecution\u2019s failure either to produce the special employee, to reveal her new address and the new name she had assumed, or to explain her unavailability entitles appellant, on due process grounds, to a new trial and, if the Government does not come forward with the required information or explanation, to an acquittal. Roviaro v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639. In Roviaro, the Supreme Court reversed a conviction because of the Government\u2019s refusal to disclose the identity of the informer to whom the accused had allegedly sold narcotics, notwithstanding the fact that the defendant very likely knew the informer\u2019s name and how to reach him (see dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Clark). The special employee in the instant case surely played as central a role, especially as to the alleged entrapment and the second transaction, as that played by the informer in Roviaro. If \u201cthe fundamental requirements of fairness,\u201d 353 U.S. at page 60, 77 S.Ct. at page 628 required disclosure of the informant\u2019s name in Roviaro, they required the disclosure of Dorothy Washington\u2019s new name and address here.</p>\n<p id=\"Afzk\">At the very least, I think appellant was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the jury was not given a missing witness instruction. The rule is that \u201c[I]f a party has it peculiarly within his power to produce witnesses whose testimony would elucidate the transaction, the fact that he does not do it creates the presumption that the testimony, if produced, would be unfavor-orable.\u201d Graves v.
