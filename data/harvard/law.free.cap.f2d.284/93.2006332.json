The vehicles, by the terms of the note, were \u201cassign [ed], transfer [red] and deliver [ed]\u201d to the bank. The debt- or retained possession of the cars and truck.

If such be true, the referee in holding against the validity of the lien was correct. However, the district court on the authority of Embree Uranium Co. v. Liebel, 169 Cal.App.2d 256, 337 P.2d 159, on review, reversed the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">The Embree case is squarely in point. But it is from a California intermediate appellate court. We have examined the cases of the California Supreme Court upon which appellant relies. In our judgment, they do not reach the point here involved. We cannot warrant our opinion, but our best appraisal of the situation is that the California Supreme Court would follow Embree in holding that the Motor Vehicle Code set up a complete plan for establishing a lien on motor vehicles and that the plan by implication excluded the application of Section 2956 of the Civil Code. Therefore, we must sustain the district court\u2019s decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-21\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-5\">. Section 2956 of the Civil Code of California provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201cA mortgage of personal property or crops shall be clearly entitled on the face thereof, apart from and preceding all other terms of the mortgage, to be a mortgage of crops and chattels, or either, and such mortgage may otherwise be made in substantially the following form:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u201cThis mortgage, made the - day of - in the year <em>-\u25a0, </em>by AB, of -, mortgagor to CD, of -\u25a0, mortgagee, witnesseth:</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">\u201cThat the mortgagor mortgages to the mortgagee (here describe the property), as security for the payment to him of -dollars, on (or before) the-day of-, in the year-, (or, as security for the payment of a note or obligation, describing it, etc.) AB.</p>\n<p id=\"A0O\">\u201cNo mortgage of personal property or crops shall be invalid for any purpose by reason of the omission to state therein the interest rate or the due date or due dates of the obligation or obligations secured thereby.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-16\">.
