The District Court answered the first question in the affirmative and the second in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-23\">The facts are simple and undisputed. On December 16, 1957, at the Port of Salem, Massachusetts libellants signed shipping articles in the presence of a United States Shipping Commissioner on the S.S. Illinois. The articles provided, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-24\">\u201cIt is agreed between the Master and the seamen, or mariners, of the S.S. Illinois of which James W. Mc-Gulley, Lie. No. 191668 is at present Master, or whoever shall go for Master, now bound from the Port of Salem, Massachusetts, to one or more Atlantic Coast Ports and/or Gulf Coast Ports and/or one or more ports in the Carribean and/or such other ports and places in any part of the world as the Master may direct, and back to a final port of discharge in the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>for a term of time not exceeding twelve (12) calendar months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The vessel proceeded from Salem, Massachusetts to Guayanville, Puerto Rico, a port in the Caribbean Sea. It then returned directly to Providence, Rhode Island, where the voyage terminated on December 28, 1957. There each of the libellants signed off the articles in the presence of a United States Shipping Commissioner and received his earned wages which were less than he would have earned had he worked a full month. Each of the libellants then commenced an action to recover one month\u2019s wages for the alleged improper discharge under Section 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The legislative history of Section 594 (Act of June 7, 1872, c. 322, Section 21, 17 Stat. 266) discloses that it was substantially derived from Section 167 of the British Merchant Shipping Act of 1854.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">In Tindle v. Davison, 66 L.T.N.S. 372 (Q.B. Div. 1892) the British court had occasion to construe Section 167. There the shipping articles provided for a voyage</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201c * * * from Sunderland to Bilbao and to any port or ports, place or places within the limits of 73 degrees north latitude and 60 degrees south latitude trading to and fro, if required, and back to a final port of discharge in the United Kingdom. The term of employment may be for any period not exceeding six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">The libellant was employed on August 21, 1891 and was discharged on September 12, 1891, after having completed the voyage to Bilbao. In reversing the judgment of the lower court permitting recovery of the balance of a month\u2019s wages under Section 167, the court <em>held, </em>at page 374,. per Wright, J.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">\u201cThe section requires evidence of his having been improperly discharged, and there is no such evidence here. The meaning of the-section is that when a seaman is-improperly discharged, he is to have-due compensation up to a month\u2019s-wages in lieu of his right of action, unless he has earned a month\u2019s wages, in which case the section does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">It is thus apparent that the British court construing the act upon which the instant statute is based held that a breach; of the articles is a prerequisite to recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">In The Steel Trader, 1928, 275-U.S. 388, 48 S.Ct. 162, 72 L.Ed. 326, a breach of the shipping articles had occurred and the libellant had been paid' both the wages actually earned and those-for an extra month as provided in Section-594. Thereafter he instituted a suit to-recover the wages he would have earned had he completed the voyage. In reversing the trial court which had granted recovery, the Court said, at page 391, 48 S.Ct. at page 163:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">\u201cThe word \u2018compensation,\u2019 in section 4527 [Section 594], distinctly indicates that payment of a sum equal to one month\u2019s wages was intended to constitute the remedy for an invasion of the seaman\u2019s right through <em>breach of his contract </em>of employment in the circumstances specified.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">The Court quoted with approval the language in Calvin v. Huntley, 1901, 178 Mass. 29, 32, 59 N.E. 435, 436 that \u201c[T]he object of the statute is not to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>punish, but to provide a reasonable rule of compensation for a <em>breach of contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">In Newton v. Gulf Oil Corp., 3 Cir., 1950, 180 F.2d 491, 494, certiorari denied 1950, 340 U.S. 814, 71 S.Ct. 42, 95 L.Ed. 598, this court affirmed a judgment recovered under Section 594. The present issue was not reached in that case because it was noted that \u201cthere was a technical breach of contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In other courts where this issue has been directly decided it has been held that a breach of contract is a prerequisite to recovery,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and where recovery has been permitted the facts reveal a breach of contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The libellants argue that since the statute is remedial in nature it should be given a liberal construction. We have no quarrel with this position but we point out that even in construing a remedial statute we are bound by legislative intent. That intent was clearly stated in Vlavianos v. The Cypress, 4 Cir., 1948, 171 F.2d 435, at page 439, where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-7\">\u201cThe statute was intended to afford a simple summary method of establishing and enforcing damages which are frequently difficult of definite ascertainment but are fixed by the statute as complete satisfaction for the breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">It is therefore clear, as found by the district court, that a breach of the articles is a prerequisite to recovery under Section 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">The second question to be decided is whether by reason of Section 594 there is an implied guarantee in all shipping articles that a voyage will be of such duration as to enable a seaman to earn a month\u2019s wages. In urging an affirmative response to this question the libellants contend that \u201cexisting statutes and judicial precedents must be read into all contracts as if they were expressly contained therein.\u201d Although we do not doubt the validity of that principle it affords the libellants no comfort for we must still decide what the \u201cexisting statutes and judicial precedents\u201d provide. Since we have concluded that Section 594 merely provides a statutory measure of liquidated damages that is all we can and do read into the articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">In fact this precise issue was decided in the English case of Tindle v. Davison, supra. In that case the libellant argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At1\">\u201cThis agreement contemplates a duration of at least a month, and the plaintiff had a right to earn a month\u2019s wages.\u201d 66 L.T.N.S. at page 374.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">The defendant.in opposing that contention argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-16\">\u201cSection 167 of the Statute of 1854 only goes to the remedy in ease of improper discharge; it does not extend to introduce a time minimum of a month into the employment of a seaman.\u201d 66 L.T.N.S. at page 374.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au9\">Since the court in Tindle reversed the judgment below granting the libellant the balance of a month\u2019s wages it is apparent that the libellant\u2019s contention was not accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-17\">The case of Moore v. Marine Transport Lines, 1950 A.M.C. 1592 (S.D.Tex.1950) stands directly opposed to libellants\u2019 posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>tion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There the articles provided for a voyage from San Francisco to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201c * * * one or more ports in the 'Canal Zone and such other ports and places in any part of the world as the master may direct, and back to a final port of discharge in the United States for a term not exceeding twelve (12) calendar months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">These articles were signed on December 29 and 30, 1948. The ship made a voyage to the Canal Zone and then to Houston, Texas, where the crew was discharged on January 18, 1949. The libel-lant argued that he was entitled to one month\u2019s wages under Section 594 since he was discharged before earning that amount. The court held at pages 1593-<em>M:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201c * * * I conclude that the weight of authority is that such section only gives seamen the right to have and recover an additional month\u2019s wages when their contract has been violated. Here their contract has not been violated. <em>The voyage and length of their employment were as stipulated in the articles.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">All the libellants\u2019 arguments raised before the district court and repeated here add up to the proposition that Section 594 operates upon the articles so as to guarantee the seaman a minimum of a month\u2019s wages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court refused to sustain these arguments and we agree. Accordingly the decrees of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-13\">. Joseph A. Zarraga, Martin D.

The libellants belabored the point that the district court erred when it \u201cheld there was no breach of the articles because the voyage made by the SS. \u2018Illinois\u2019 was within the purview of the Articles.\u201d They further submitted that the trial court reasoned (allegedly erroneously) that \u201cit was fairly inferred from the language of the Articles that for a time not exceeding twelve (12) calendar months meant for any period of time less than twelve calendar months.\u201d What the court did say was: \u201cThe phrase \u2018a term of time\u2019 in these Articles indicates \u2018any period \u2019.\u201d 182 F.Supp. at page 592, n. 5, and \u2018[i]t seems clear that the libellants consented to a voyage of any duration less than a year by signing the Articles.\u201d Id., at page 593, n. 8. In any event whether or not \u201ca\u201d means \u201cany\u201d the result in this case is the same, because \u201ca\u201d in the context used does not mean, as the libellants contend, at least a month.</p>\n<p id=\"alg-dedup-0\">The libellants also raised the issue that the burden of proving fault and consent rested with the respondent. The district court found, as we do, that no ruling thereon is required in view of the present disposition of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
