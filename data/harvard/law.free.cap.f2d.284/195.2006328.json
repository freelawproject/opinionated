A contest was instituted by the Regional Forester in Portland, Oregon, a representative of the Secretary of Agriculture. A hearing was held, and on January 3, 1957, a hearing examiner in the Bureau of Land Management found the claims invalid. Appellants sought to appeal to the Director of that Bureau; that was the next step in the regular administrative process. On January 30, 1957, in accordance with the rules of the Secretary of the Interior,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>timely filed their notice of appeal with the hearing examiner. This notice did not include a statement of the reasons for the appeal \u2014 the equivalent, we are told, of a brief. On February 27th appellants mailed copies of this required document \u2014 the statement of reasons \u2014 to opposing counsel and to the hearing examiner in Portland and the Director in Washington, D. C. Appellants allege that through clerical inadvertence the statement was sent to Washington by regular mail instead of by air mail. The appellee Secretary alleges that the statement was stamped \u201cReceived\u201d by the Department in Washington on March 4, 1957. The hearing examiner and Government counsel in Portland received these copies before March 1st.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">The Regulations of the Department of Interior on the point are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201c\u00a7 221.3 <em>Statement of reasons; written arguments; briefs. </em>If the notice of appeal did not include a statement of the reasons for the appeal, such a statement must be filed in the Office of the Director within 30 days after the notice of appeal is filed. Failure to file the statement of reasons within the time required will subject the appeal to summary dismissal as provided in \u00a7 221.98.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsK\">The pertinent feature of this regulation is that failure to file the statement of reasons on time \u201cwill subject the appeal to summary dismissal\u201d. Filing the statement is not jurisdictional, if the notice of appeal has been properly filed. Failure to file the statement does not result in automatic dismissal; it \u201csubject[s]\u201d the appeal to dismissal. The plain import of the regulation is that somebody will act to dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The thirtieth day after January 30, 1957 (the date this appeal was filed) was March 1st, a Friday. The statement of reasons was mailed from Spokane, Washington, within the thirty days but was received in the Washington office of the Director after the thirtieth day; <em>i. e., </em>on the Monday after the critical Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">The Director, in a decision dated April 16, 1957, dismissed the appeal, without consideration of the merits, on the sole ground that the statement of reasons had been filed late. About a year later, on April 2,1958, the Secretary affirmed this dismissal without consideration of the merits. Meanwhile, during that year\u2019s time, he (the Secretary) amended the rules of practice so that, under the new rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> less than 10 days\u2019 delay in filing a statement \u201cwill be\u201d waived if the document \u201cwas transmitted or probably transmitted\u201d within the specified time. Thus, under the amended rule our appellants\u2019 appeal would not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">Our appellants filed a complaint in the District Court under the Administrative Procedure Act;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> on cross-motions for summary judgment the trial court awarded judgment to the Secretary and the other governmental defendants. The sole issues before us are (1) whether the Secretary erred in his determination that the statement of reasons was not timely filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>and (2) whether the Secretary abused his discretion in dismissing the appeal from the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. We do not have before us any issue concerning the merits of the claims to the patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Appellants\u2019 first contention is that their statement of reasons was, as a matter of law, timely filed. They seek to rely primarily upon Dayton Power and Light Co. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We there held that the statutory requirement that an application for rehearing be made within 30 days after the issuance of an order by the Commission<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was satisfied by the filing within the period of one copy with the Commission\u2019s General Counsel. A Commission rule required that one original and 14 copies be filed with the Commission. Dayton had mailed the required copies but, inadvertently, by fourth-class mail. Our appellants allege that the case at bar is very similar to Dayton Power. They claim that the receipt by the hearing examiner of a copy of the statement within the thirty-day period constituted substantial compliance with the rule and that this was enough since the filing of the statement is not jurisdictional. Therefore, they say, under the reasoning of Dayton Power, their statement was timely filed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We must reject this contention. In Dayton Power the court decided only that the prerequisite jurisdictional requirements of the statute were fulfilled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Federal Power Commission rule there involved merely required filing with \u201cthe Commission\u201d; the General Counsel might be considered the Commission\u2019s agent under the circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here the Secretary\u2019s rule explicitly required that the statement be filed in a specific office, that of the Director. Failure to comply made the appeal \u201csubject to summary dismissal\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Prior to his action in this case the Secretary had ruled at least twice that filing the statement of reasons with some official in the field does not constitute a filing \u201cin the Office of the Director\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We must give considerable weight to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his own rules. Since that interpretation is not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, we accept it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">On the record before us we hold that the appellants\u2019 statement of reasons was not timely filed under the Secretary\u2019s rules. The plain facts of the matter are that the Office of the Director is in Washington, D. C., and that appellants\u2019 statement was not filed there within thirty days after January 30, 1957. It was in the course of being filed within that period, and it was actually physically there three days (one business day) after the crucial day. But the simple fact is that the statement was not filed as required by the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">This brings us to the question whether the Secretary was arbitrary\u2014 abused his discretion \u2014 in dismissing the appeal. We repeat in order to emphasize. The appeal itself was timely filed; no jurisdictional defect appears. The appeal was then dismissed; a decision to dismiss was made. The reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>dismissal was failure to file on time a document which is the equivalent of a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The features of the case pertinent to the discretion involved in the dismissal of the appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">(1) The brief, or statement of reasons, was put in the mail in time to have reached Washington from Spokane within the thirty days if it had been sent by air mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">(2) If the Director had had an \u201coffice\u201d in Portland or thereabouts, the statement would have been received by him in time. The effect of the rule, applied literally, is to give people on the West Coast less time to file such papers than is given people on the East Coast.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">(3) An official in the Department other than the Director, <em>i. e., </em>the hearing examiner, actually received a copy of the statement within the specified time.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">(4) The Secretary changed the rule before he decided this ease. The sequence of events is noteworthy in a consideration of an exercise of discretion. Had the operative events occurred after the amendment to the rule, which occurred while this appeal was pending, appellants\u2019 appeal would have been considered on its merits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Certainly rules are made to be followed; that is the essence of the rule of law. But the rule now before us was not a peremptory rule.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It did not unequivocally provide that upon a late filing of the statement the appeal would be dismissed. It said that under such circumstances the appeal would be \u201csubject to\u201d dismissal. It left the door wide open to a consideration of circumstances. The situation is a familiar one in the courts, where the timely filing of notices of appeals is jurisdictional and cannot be extended or excused,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but the timely filing of subsequent briefs is frequently excused, the time extended, and other measures taken to preserve the substance of the adjudicatory process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">The factors we have listed add up to the inescapable conclusion that, discretion being implicit in the controlling rule, and no prejudice to any one being shown or even claimed, this appeal, having been timely filed, should not have been dismissed for a technical, excusable delay over one weekend in the filing of the supporting statement of reasons. The Secretary\u2019s own amendment of the rule is enough to show the basic merit in the equity of appellants\u2019 position. We hold that the Secretary abused his discretion, in a legal sense, in dismissing this appeal from the hearing examiner\u2019s report. Accordingly the judgment of the District Court will be reversed and the case remanded with directions to enter a judgment for appellants directing the Secretary to take such action as is necessary to comply with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-12\">.
