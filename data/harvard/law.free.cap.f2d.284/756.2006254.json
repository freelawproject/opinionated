In addition to responding to the arguments on the merits, the Commission and Manufacturers have filed motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">In the second petition, Docket No. 13,-285, Lynchburg seeks review of the final order in the Manufacturers\u2019 action asserting it is aggrieved by the decision itself as well as by the Commission\u2019s determinations on its petition to intervene. This second petition is before the court on motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">Lynchburg is a Virginia corporation engaged in purchasing, distributing and selling natural gas in Lynchburg, Virginia and other surrounding areas. It purchases its total natural gas requirement from Atlantic Seaboard Corporation, a subsidiary of the Columbia Gas System, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Columbia). Manufacturers is also a subsidiary of Columbia, but Lynchburg does not buy, either directly or indirectly, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>gas from Manufacturers. Except for the fact that Manufacturers and Atlantic Seaboard Corporation are both subsidiaries of Columbia, there is no connection between Lynchburg and Manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">On various dates, Manufacturers, Atlantic Seaboard Corporation, and several other Columbia subsidiaries made simultaneous rate filings with the Federal Power Commission.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">On September 3, 1959, the Commission issued a \u201cNotice of Date of Hearing\u201d, in two of the filed rates of Manufacturers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lynchburg gave timely notice to intervene, but at the date set for the beginning of the hearing before the examiner, September 30, 1959, Lynch-burg\u2019s petition to intervene had not been passed upon by the Commission. Nevertheless, the examiner, in order to expedite the hearing, granted Lynchburg full rights of participation until such time as the Commission should act upon its petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">As the situation developed, the sole point, not susceptible of settlement through negotiation was \u201crate of return\u201d' between Manufacturers and its customers. Lynchburg was not interested in any of the questions upon which there would be settlement, but only in the contested issue. After several days of hearing spread over one and a half months,, the direct case of Manufacturers and rebuttal thereto had been fully heard.. During a recess after that, the Commission denied Lynchburg\u2019s petition to intervene. Thereafter, on November 19, 1959, Lynchburg did not appear and did' not participate in the hearing when cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>\"tain documentary evidence upon which there had been oral testimony and the \u25a0settlement agreement between Manufacturers and its customers were formally introduced into evidence. The hearing was recessed with the only remaining matter being the filing of briefs and the oral argument on January 7, 1960. During the interim period Lynchburg filed its petition for rehearing and on December 30, 1959, the Commission reversed its previous order stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\">\u201cUpon consideration of the aforementioned application, we find that Lynchburg should be permitted to intervene and participate henceforth in the proceedings in Docket No. G-12197.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Lynchburg filed a motion for continuance \"to change the date set for oral argument, which was denied by the Commission. Lynchburg did not submit a brief or participate in the oral argument. Subsequently, a final order was entered on February 25, 1960.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In Docket No. 13,170, we are immediately confronted with the problem of jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s or\u2022der denying intervention. The applicable statute is Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717r(b), which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">\u201c(b) Any party to a proceeding under this chapter aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission in such proceeding may obtain a review \u25a0of such order in the circuit court of appeals of the United States * * * by filing in such court, within sixty days after the order of the Commission upon the application for rehearing a written petition praying that the order of the Commission be modified or set aside in whole or in part.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-8\"> As a primary requisite for judicial review, the statute dictates mandatory compliance with the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, as well as compliance with the required showing of a <em>party </em>who is <em>aggrieved </em>by a Commission order. See F. P. C. v. Colorado Interstate Gas Co., 1955, 348 U.S. 492, 75 S.Ct. 467, 99 L.Ed. 583; Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Federal Power Comm., 3 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 3, 9. In Docket No. 13,170, Lynchburg seeks direct review of the Commission\u2019s order, made during the proceedings denying its petition for intervention. As a general rule, such intermediate orders cannot be reviewed on an interlocutory basis, but may be considered on appeal from the final order in the proceeding. Federal Power Comm. v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 1938, 304 U.S. 375, 58 S.Ct. 963, 82 L.Ed. 1408; United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 3 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 842. Notwithstanding the general applicability of the above rule, Lynch-burg asserts that under the authority of a recent decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Public Service Commission of New York v. F. P. C., 284 F.2d 200, it is aggrieved and can obtain review of the order denying intervention. We find a material factual distinction between that case and the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">In Public Service Commission of New York the petition to intervene was not only denied originally, but also on rehearing. Thus the court was faced with the choice of either granting a right of review from the <em>final </em>order denying intervention, or refusing review and thereby rendering the decision of the Federal Power Commission on the petition to intervene unreviewable, since in its opinion the court indicated that the would-be intervenor had no standing to review the final order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the instant matter, if these facts were present, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>would have no hesitancy in allowing direct review of the order denying Lynch-burg\u2019s petition to intervene. Lynch-burg\u2019s right to represent its interest before the Commission would have been finally determined. But actually although initially the Commission denied Lynchburg\u2019s petition to intervene, its rights in the proceeding were not <em>finally </em>determined. By subsequent order on rehearing, the Commission negated the effect of its first order and allowed Lynch-burg to appear as a party. Being a party, Lynchburg had the right to petition for review from the final order. So that if Lynchburg was aggrieved by the way the Commission handled its petition to intervene it can obtain proper relief on review of the final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Contrary to Lynchburg\u2019s argument in its brief that: \u201cThe Commission should not be permitted to thwart the jurisdiction of a reviewing court merely by wording an order in such a way as to render the order complained of not immediately reviewable while still maintaining the practical effect of that order,\u201d it is evident that by providing for mandatory application for rehearing before the Commission, Congress contemplated situations where the Commission on reconsideration would have the opportunity of correcting a previous order if necessary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In a situation as is indicated here, the effect of the Commission\u2019s order is not to thwart appellate jurisdiction but merely to place review in its proper setting, i. e., from a final order in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Accordingly the motion to dismiss in Docket No. 13,170 is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In Docket No. 13,285, Lynch-burg\u2019s petition for review is from the final order. The prime question is whether Lynchburg had the right to intervene. If Lynchburg was wrongfully denied intervention, then it is aggrieved within the meaning of Section 19(b) of the Natural Gas Act and this court has jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s determination. National Coal Ass\u2019n v. Federal Power Commission, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 135, 191 F.2d 462, 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Section 15(a) of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 717n(a), grants to the Commission power to promulgate rules and regulations dealing with intervention. Pursuant to that statutory authorization, Section 1.8(b) (2) of the Commission\u2019s Rules and Regulations, 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.8(b) (2), defines the basis for granting intervention as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\">\u201c (2) An interest which may be directly affected and which is not adequately represented by existing parties and as to which petitioners may be bound by the Commission\u2019s action in the proceeding (the following may have such an interest; consumers served by the applicant, defendant, or respondent; holders of securities of the applicant, defendant, or respondent; and competitors of the applicant, defendant, or respondent).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Under this section, as a minimum requirement to assert and sustain a right of intervention, there must be a showing that some interest of the petitioner will be directly affected. Memphis Light, Gas &amp; Water Div. v. Federal Power Comm., 1957, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 243 F.2d 628; National Coal Ass\u2019n v. Federal Power Commission, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">In the pending petition, Lynch-burg\u2019s alleged right to intervene is predicated on the theory that a decision in the Manufacturers\u2019 rate proceeding might create an adverse precedent as to subsequent proceedings between Lynch-burg and its direct supplier \u2014 Atlantic Seaboard Corporation. To bolster this, Lynchburg asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-13\">\u201c * * * the Commission, having once determined the proper rate of return for one Columbia System subsidiary, has applied that identical rate of return to all of the other sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>sidiaries. Thus, as a practical matter, a determination of the issues involved in the Manufacturers\u2019 case would be dispositive of the identical and common issues involved in the pending filings of Atlantic Seaboard, Petitioner\u2019s immediate supplier. If Petitioner is to be heard at all on the issues in the pending rate cases \u25a0of Atlantic Seaboard and its supplier United Fuel, Petitioner must be heard in the proceeding below in which the Commission will first hear and dispose of those issues.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Lynchburg\u2019s position is without merit. The setting of the rate of return in the Manufacturers\u2019 filing does not preclude Lynchburg from offering such evidence as it may desire in the rate proceedings filed by its direct supplier. Cf. Boston Tow Boat Co. v. United States, 1944, 321 U.S. 632, 633, 64 S.Ct. 776, 88 L.Ed. 975. As clearly stated in the order entered in Manufacturers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">\u201c(J) <em>This order is without prejudice to any findings or orders which have been or may hereafter be made by the Commission </em>and is without prejudice to any claims or contentions which may be made by the Commission, Manufacturers, the Commission staff or any other parties affected by this order in any proceeding now pending or hereafter instituted by or against Manufacturers or any other companies, persons or parties affected by this order.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Moreover, an examination of the Manufacturer\u2019s record shows that no party there <em>(including </em>Lynchburg) considered that the results in that case would be dispositive and binding in any other proceeding wherein the rate of return issue would be contested. In fact, Mr. Shea, Lynchburg\u2019s president, answering the presiding examiner\u2019s inquiry as to whether Lynchburg would participate in the cross-examination of witnesses, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-8\">\u201cWe do not intend to participate in the cross-examination of this case. However, we can inform counsel that <em>we intend to raise the rate of </em>re<em>turn matter in every other docket involved, where we are a direct customer.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">Lynchburg not having a right to intervene, the motion to dismiss the petition for review in No. 13,285 is granted. This eliminates the necessity of discussing the question of whether in view of the Commission\u2019s decisions in first denying and later granting intervention, Lynchburg was denied the rights of a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\">.
