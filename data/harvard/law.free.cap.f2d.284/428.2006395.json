The accident occurred at defendant\u2019s railroad station in Perryville, Maryland. The ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>plicable law in this diversity case is concededly that of Maryland. The case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict for the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s appeal raises only alleged errors in the court\u2019s charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">For an understanding of appellant\u2019s specific contentions, a brief statement of the circumstances which preceded the accident is necessary. Plaintiff, a United States soldier assigned to the Maryland Military District, was a passenger in defendant\u2019s train which left New York City near midnight. When the train stopped at the station in Perryville, Maryland, early the next morning plaintiff got off, thinking he had arrived at Baltimore. Having discovered his mistake he tried to reboard the train while it was in motion. When the train started he was about thirty-five feet away from it. To his left (north) he saw that the door of one of the rear cars was open. He walked rapidly, or ran, diagonally toward the train, then ran alongside it, and when the open door overtook him, he grasped the left hand rail with his left hand, put his left foot on the step, and swung his body slightly to grasp the right hand rail with his right hand in which he was carrying an overnight bag. He says he got his right foot on the step for a second or two and then slipped off. Several witnesses testified that the train was moving at five or six miles an hour; one witness estimated its speed at fifteen miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">To the court\u2019s charge that the plaintiff was not a passenger at the time of the occurrence, plaintiff excepted, and this is urged on his appeal as an error. Under Maryland law the charge was clearly correct. See Damico v. Washington, B. &amp; A. Electric R. Co., 158 Md. 470, 148 A. 821; Baltimore Traction Co. of Baltimore City v. State ex rel. Ringgold, 78 Md. 409, 28 A. 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Exception was also taken to the court\u2019s refusal to charge plaintiff\u2019s requests 8 and 9 to the effect that \u201cif the plaintiff had safely boarded the first step of the car,\u201d the jury might eliminate from its consideration any question of the plaintiff\u2019s contributoiy negligence in attempting to board a moving train. There was no error in refusing the requests. The evidence was conclusive that the plaintiff had not \u201csafely\u201d boarded the first step of the car. The New York cases on which appellant relies are readily distinguishable. Thus, in Distler v. Long Island R. Co., 151 N.Y. 424, 45 N.E. 937, 35 L.R.A. 762, not only had the plaintiff \u201cstepped upon the step leading to the forward platform of the second car, [and] passed on until one foot was upon the platform and the other was upon the first step below,\u201d in marked distinction to the plaintiff here, who had, at best, boarded the first step for an instant, but it was there clear that \u201cthe danger which attended the boarding of a moving train had been passed\u201d and that \u201cthe direct and proximate cause of his [plaintiff\u2019s] injury was the mismanagement of the train, causing a sudden jerk or lurch which threw the plaintiff therefrom.\u201d Similarly, plaintiff\u2019s invocation here of the doctrine of last clear chance is without merit. Maryland, like most states, recognizes that doctrine, but it is not operative unless the defendant failed to use reasonable care to avoid plaintiff\u2019s injury, see 2 Harper &amp; James, Torts 1245, and \u201cthe defendant\u2019s negligence must have been sequential, and not concurrent for the doctrine to apply,\u201d Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. v. Leasure, 193 Md. 523, 69 A.2d 248, 251. The only act of defendant\u2019s employees <em>after </em>plaintiff attempted to board the train which plaintiff now suggests was negligent was the flagman\u2019s failure to pull the emergency valve. The jury was instructed to determine whether the flagman exercised reasonable care in pulling the communication cord rather than the emergency valve (which was farther away) and that they should return a plaintiff\u2019s verdict if they found that the flagman failed to exercise reasonable care to avoid the accident. Thus the jury, had they so viewed the facts, might have found for plaintiff under the doctrine of last clear chance. That they did not do so closes the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Appellant\u2019s next contention is that the court erred in giving, at defendant\u2019s request, an additional charge on the subject of contributory negligence, which unduly emphasized this subject. No exception was taken, but regardless of that, a trial judge may <em>suo motu </em>recall a jury for further instructions when he thinks them needed. Fredericks v. American Export Lines, 2 Cir., 227 F.2d 450, 453. A defendant\u2019s verdict was clearly indicated by the evidence. Cf. Ferguson v. Baltimore &amp; Annapolis R. Co., 197 Md. 488, 80 A.2d 9, 12. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
