The jury was, in part, instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-24\">\u201cIn this case, for example, the defendant did not testify. He doesn\u2019t \u25a0 have to. He has a' right not to testify, and you are not entitled to draw any inference whatever from his failure to do so, because it is up to the Government to prove him guilty ; it isn\u2019t up to him to prove his innocence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-25\">Appellant does not attack the correctness of the instruction as given, but argues he had,- and was denied, an indefeasible right to demand that it not be given. He relies \u201cheavily\u201d upon Bruno v. United States, 1939, 308 U.S. 287, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed. 257. There the Supreme Court, for the reasons outlined, held that the trial judge erred in <em>refusing </em>to give such an instruction. In the circumstances presented here, we find <em>no </em>basis <em>for </em>a conclusion that the appellant was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"AaG\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
