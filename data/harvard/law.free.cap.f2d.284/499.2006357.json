The sums were paid to settle a claim of liability due to injury arising from unseaworthy condition of the vessel. Indemnity is here sought under Ryan Stevedoring Company v. Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation, 1956, 350 U.S. 124, 76 S.Ct. 232, 100 L.Ed. 183, upon the ground that the unseaworthy condition was brought about by the negligent manner in which the loading stevedore had stowed the ship\u2019s cargo. From judgment of the District Court in favor of the libelants the libelee has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Appellee Calmar Steamship Corporation was operator of the vessel Alamar. Appellant Jones was a stevedore firm which, in June, 1954, loaded lumber aboard the vessel at Newport, Oregon. Pittston Stevedoring Corporation (im-pleaded in the case by Jones\u2019 petition under fifty-sixth Admiralty Rule, 28 U.S.C. A.) was the stevedore which later, on July 6, 1954, discharged the lumber from the vessel at Brooklyn. Edward Oprosko was a longshoreman employed by Pitts-ton. He was injured by falling lumber in the course of discharging the cargo. Cal-mar was sued by Oprosko in New York and settled the case before trial for $117,-500. It was reimbursed by its insurance underwriters and it is to recover the amount of this settlement that this suit is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">The principal dispute presented by the case is as to whether Calmar, Jones or Pittston is responsible for the unsea-worthy condition which caused Oprosko\u2019s injury. The principal issue upon this appeal is whether the District Court was clearly erroneous in its determination that the conditions causing injury were created by Jones. We have concluded that it was not and that judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">The injury occurred in the No. 2 lower hold of the Alamar. This hold had been loaded with lumber in Oregon by first laying floor stowage across the entire floor of the hold, building it up from the bottom toward the underside of the \u2019tween deck beams. After completing this floor stowage, lumber was stowed in the wings in tiers, approximately six feet high, rising from the floor to the beams overhead. It was in the course of unloading the starboard wing stowage that Oprosko\u2019s injury occurred. One or more of the tiers toppled and fell on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">In building wing tiers, it is customary that cross-pieces of lath, known as \u201cstickers,\u201d be inserted at intervals as the tier rises from the floor in order to bind and steady the structure. The District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-15\">\u201cJones stowed the wing tiers of lumber on the starboard side of the No. 2 lower hold, and particularly the tier or tiers from which the lumber fell on Oprosko, without using lath or stickers. This was improper stowage, as it rendered the tiers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>shaky and wobbly and likely to fall over or collapse. Jones failed to use due care, and was negligent, in this respect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">This finding is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">The court further found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">\u201cThe improper stowage of the wing tiers of lumber in No. 2 lower hold, performed by Jones, without lath or stickers, thereby rendering the tiers shaky and wobbly, was the sole, active, and primary conduct causing the lumber to fall or collapse upon Oprosko, and was the sole proximate cause of the accident and resulting injuries to Oprosko.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">\u201cThe falling or collapsing of the lumber upon an unloading longshoreman was a natural and foreseeable consequence of the improper stowage of the lumber as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">There is ample evidence to the effect that the tiers fell because of the lack of stickers. There can be no doubt that this lack of stickers created an unseaworthy condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">There is no doubt that Oprosko and his fellow longshoremen had knowledge of the shaky condition of the tiers as they commenced to work back into the wings from the square of the hatch. The hatch foreman had remarked on the condition to the ship\u2019s mate, advising him that they were faced with \u201cbum stowage.\u201d The mate had in effect told the foreman to do the best he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Jones contends that under Bruszewski v. Isthmian Steamship Company, 3 Cir., 1947, 163 F.2d 720, this destroyed any warranty of seaworthiness since the stevedore had knowledge' of the unsea-worthy condition and had assumed responsibility for correcting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">This same contention under similar circumstances was made to this court in Metropolitan Stevedore Company v. Dampskisaktieselskabet International, 9 Cir., 1960, 274 F.2d 875, and was rejected in the following language (at page 877):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">\u201cWhile the bales of rubber had to be removed in order to repair the condition, no change in mode of operation was commenced which would indicate that the removal of bales by Metropolitan was other than a continuation of the unloading operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">We conclude that Bruszewski does not apply under the facts of this case and that the warranty of seaworthiness continued unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">Jones\u2019 principal contention throughout the case has been that Pittston and Cal-mar both had knowledge of the lack of stickers and negligently failed to take effective action to protect against it; that this negligence constituted an intervening cause freeing Jones from responsibility for the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">The District Court disposed of this contention by finding upon the evidence that Pittston was not negligent. In proceeding to the question whether this finding of the District Court was clearly erroneous, we do so without deciding whether the tort concept of intervening negligence is available as a defense in an action for breach of the stevedore\u2019s warranty that loading and stowing will be done in a workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">The Pittston longshoremen did attempt to remedy the situation by \u201cchocking\u201d the shaky tiers: that is, by driving wedges between the tops of the tiers and the bottom of the overhead beam. The injury had resulted notwithstanding this precaution. After the accident had occurred, the shaky tiers were, by order of Pittston\u2019s superintendent, deliberately toppled to the floor to eliminate any further possibility of injury. Jones contends that Pittston\u2019s reliance upon chocking instead of pulling the tiers over in the first instance was negligence and operated as an intervening cause. Testimony was divided as to what would have constituted good stevedoring practice under the circumstances. The court found that chocking \u201cwas good stevedoring practice,\u201d and further found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cPittston, in wedging or chocking the tiers as a precaution against their falling over or collapsing, acted in the exercise of reasonable prudence and judgment. Pittston was not negligent in failing to pull the tiers over before attempting to discharge the lumber.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">There is testimony to support these findings and they cannot be held to be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Jones\u2019 theory of the case is that the cargo had been unsettled by the long voyage and rough weather; that the ship was listing at the time of the accident and that this contributed to the shaky condition of the tiers; that Pittston\u2019s longshoremen, to expedite the unloading operation, had lengthened and weakened the tiers by first removing floor stowage in front of them, which stowage was not customarily strengthened by stickers. The court found against Jones on each factual contention and the record provides support for all such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">As to Calmar, Jones contends that it was guilty of negligence in that its mate failed to take effective action once he had been advised of the unseaworthy condition. Specifically, it is suggested that when the hatch foreman advised of this condition the mate should have communicated this information to Pittston\u2019s superintendent. But this is to recognize that the responsibility for taking preventive action remained with Pittston. The mate would have acted as no more than a go-between from foreman to superintendent, injecting himself into Pittston\u2019s chain of command. The record establishes that the foreman himself could as easily have acted in this capacity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">The District Court found:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201cCalmar was not guilty of any conduct which was a proximate or contributing cause of the accident and injuries to Oprosko.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201cCalmar did nothing in any way to hinder, delay, prevent or excuse Jones from properly performing its contractual obligation to load and stow the vessel in a safe and proper manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">We conclude that in all respects the-court's findings have ample evidentiary support and may not be held clearly erroneous. The judgment necessarily follows from the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">Calmar has taken a protective cross-appeal against Pittston, asserting error of the District Court in holding Pittston free from negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">Upon both the appeal of Jones and the cross-appeal of Calmar, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
