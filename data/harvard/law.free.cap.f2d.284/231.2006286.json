In di-' recting a representation election the National Labor Relations Board noted that the union had complied with these requirements. The District Court dismissed, holding that appellant had an adequate remedy under Sections 9(d), 10(e) and (f), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 159(d), 160(e, f). We agree. Appellant may raise the issue in an enforcement proceeding following a refusal to bargain with the union and hence there is no showing of the lack of an adequate legal remedy sufficient to resort to equity. Cf. Leedom v. Kyne, 1958, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed. 2d 210; National Labor Relations Board v. Highland Park Mfg.
