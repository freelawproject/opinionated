Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1958, 259 F.2d 744, 746. See the multitude of cases to the same effect cited in Goldberg v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1960, 283 F.2d 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">Petitioners first contend that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain the Commission\u2019s order. An examination of the evidence in the record reveals that petitioners shipped punchboards from Peerless\u2019 plant in Chicago, Illinois, to customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. These punchboards were of a conventional type, similar in construction to those which have been the subject of repeated litigation in many cases before this court. Cf., James v. Federal Trade Commission, 7 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 78, 79-80. Most of the boards were \u201cplain boards\u201d which had no legend printed upon them designating the winning numbers and prizes. However, there was substantial testimony from petitioners\u2019 customers that they easily had adapted these plain boards for the distribution of merchandise by lottery and that the adapted boards were used primarily to distribute merchandise rather than cash prizes. In addition, there was testimony that in certain instances Peerless furnished its customers with \u201cflares\u201d (legends describing prizes and winning numbers) which they could attach to plain boards in adapting them for the distribution of merchandise as prizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">The evidence in this case fully supports the Commission\u2019s findings, and under such circumstances the Commission properly issued its cease and desist order against petitioners. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45 (a) (6). By the sale and interstate shipment, of its punchboards, petitioners have supplied and placed in the hands of third persons the means of and instrumentalities: for engaging in unfair acts of distributing merchandise by lottery in violation of the Act. Since the evidence indicates that such punchboards were designed and used primarily for the distribution of merchandise by lottery, it is no defense that in the main third parties attached to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>The boards the legends of winning numbers and merchandise prizes or that such boards could possibly be adapted as money .boards giving only cash prizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">In its brief and on oral argument the \u2022Commission concedes that it has no statutory authority to regulate the flow in interstate commerce of punchboards designed and intended to be used solely as money boards. This question, however, is not before us here, since the Commission\u2019s order is explicitly limited to the \u2022 shipment of punchboards or other devices designed or intended to be used in the sale \u25a0or distribution of merchandise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Petitioners, in addition, contend that local policy sanctioning the use \u25a0of merchandise boards, evidenced here by \u25a0certain municipal ordinances in the State \u25a0 of Washington, limits the power of the Commission over unfair or deceptive acts \u25a0of competition in interstate commerce. We disagree. Unless Congress specifically withdraws authority in particular .areas, the Commission, upon its general grant of authority under 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45(a)(6), can restrain unfair business practices in interstate commerce even if the activities or industries have been the subject of legislation by a state or even if the intrastate conduct is authorized by state law. Royal Oil Corp. v. F.T.C., 4 Cir., 1959, 262 F.2d 741, 743; Lichtenstein v. Federal Trade Commission, 9 Cir., 1952, 194 F.2d 607, 609-10, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 819, 73 S.Ct. 15, 97 L.Ed. 638. In this case there is no congressional limitation on the Commission\u2019s use of its full power to order petitioners to cease shipping in commerce punchboards designed for distribution of merchandise when such shipment is so clearly a violation of federal policy as indicated in Surf Sales, supra. A local ordinance cannot here circumscribe the plenary power granted to the Commission to police unfair and deceptive practices in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">We hold that the Commission\u2019s order to cease and desist was properly issued, and it is now affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">It is ordered that the petition for review be denied and that the Commission\u2019s order be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">\u25a0 Petition denied. Enforcement ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-10\">. The Hearing Examiner dismissed additional charges in the Commission\u2019s complaint against Shirley Maltz, individually, and against Rose Maltz, individually and as an agent of Peerless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-17\">.
