Hoff a, request is made that the order of the District Court of July 14,1960, to the extent that it grants custody and control of Board files, paper and personnel to Martin F. O\u2019Donoghue, Esquire, be set aside; and it further appearing that in the supplemental petition for writ of mandamus and prohibition and further appropriate relief filed by intervenors, Dorsey, et al., and Bath, et al., it is requested that this court enter an order directing Judge Letts to appoint forthwith as Chairman, Plato E. Papps, Esquire, directing the Board to report directly to this court, and relieving the District Court of all jurisdiction in this case except insofar as the interim report of September 14, 1959 is concerned, and it appearing that oppositions and replies with reference to these matters have been filed, and this court having on September 7, 1960 heard argument on said petitions, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Ordered by the court that the prayers requesting that Martin F. O\u2019Donoghue, Esquire, be relieved of custody of the documents and staff of the Board and that such custody be transferred to Monitors Smith and Bufalino are for the time being denied because of the unsettled status of the Board of Monitors, without prejudice to the right of the present Monitors to have access to the files and consult with the staff, both at all reasonable times.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">It is further ordered by the court that the prayer that this court require Judge Letts to appoint Plato E.
