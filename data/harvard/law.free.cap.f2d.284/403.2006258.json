Charges of violation of Section 8(a) (3) in the firing of the employee were dismissed by the Board, since the-Board found the remedy would be the same; that is, the rehiring of the discharged employee with back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-24\">It is the position of the general counsel here that the employee, Rodgers, a shop-steward of the respondent for the night shift in his department, was fired because of his complaints <em>on behalf of his coworkers </em>at a time of very slack employment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that in lay-offs the company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>not carrying out its contractual seniority agreements. Respondent counters by saying that there is insufficient evidence on the record as a whole to permit a finding by the Board that the \u201cgriping\u201d and complaining by Rodgers that were admittedly the cause of his discharge were on behalf of anyone other than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The general counsel and the Board recognize that unless the evidence justifies the finding that Rodgers was fired for the purpose of interfering with, restraining or coercing him in the exercise of his rights to engage in \u201cconcerted activities\u201d in connection with \u201ccollective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157, the Company had an uninhibited right to fire him as an \u201chabitual nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Here we have a somewhat different case from the usual discriminatory discharge case, for both parties seem to agree that the grounds asserted by the company for firing Rodgers are truly the grounds for his dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the conversation preceding the delivery of the written statement the company superintendent told the employee he was an \u201chabitual nuisance.\u201d The thrust of the Board\u2019s position is that the thing that made Rodgers such a nuisance to the respondent was his pleas on behalf of the other employees in his shift for whom he acted as shop steward, and not his repeated demands for preferential treatment for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We have carefully read the record, as we must do when a finding of motive for firing is attacked as not being legally supported, and the following is clear: There is ample evidence from which the Board must have found that Rodgers was in fact a frequent complainer, not only to his own shop steward and immediate superior, but to others all the way up to the company vice president; he complained several times as to matters that affected him only \u2014 transfer from night to day shift, transfer back to night shift, transfer from light work, after an injury, to his old job, failure to get messages calling him to particular work (Rodgers lived 30 miles away and had no telephone and could not always be reached), and a specific complaint on April 4, 1958, that Frank Hethington was working and that he, Rodgers, was not. There is evidence credited by the examiner, although this is denied by several opposing witnesses, that Rodgers did on several occasions, while complaining about violations of seniority rules as to himself, bring up the application of the seniority rules to others on his shift. Some of these complaints were to Gatz, the union president, however, and were not shown to have been communicated to the respondent. There was no evidence of anti-union bias. The employees were, and had been for years, represented by the Independent Workers Union of Florida. Relations were friendly and there is no evidence on the record of any effort by the respondent to interfere with the rights of the union or the employees as protected by the Act other than the one act of firing Rodgers.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">The record further discloses that at no time while he was shop steward did Rodgers ever file a written complaint or grievance covering the rights of the employees on his shift under the seniority rules or for any other complaint. It is clear, therefore, that if any concerted action protected by the Act was carried on by Rodgers in his relations with the respondent it was strictly an informal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>occurrence and as a part of a protest he was making on his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">A consideration of the question, then, whether it was the nuisance consisting of Rodgers\u2019 repeated complaints about himself or the nuisance consisting of his presentation of the seniority demands of his fellow employees brings this case within the class of many heretofore decided by this Court. The most recent of these is N. L. R. B. v. Redwing Carriers, 5 Cir., 284 F.2d 397. Others pointing out the guiding, legal principles are N. L. R. B. v. McGahey, 5 Cir., 233 F.2d 406, and N. L. R. B. v. Coats &amp; Clark, Inc., 5 Cir., 231 F.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Here, as in many other cases, there is conduct of an employee that offers ample ground, if any were needed, for a discharge. Rodgers made repeated requests for special treatment. In order to retain this admittedly competent workman the supervisory employees tried to satisfy him. They shifted him to day shift when he couldn\u2019t get along with the night supervisor. Then they shifted him back to the night shift when he complained that he was needed at home during the day. During the year 1957 they put him to work on jobs that produced much more in hourly wages for him than were earned by his own shop steward, Moon. Finally, having complained several times that he \u2022should be on the job instead of others with less seniority, he came in and complained that one Frank Hethington, a brother of an assistant foreman and of a vice president of the company, was working when he should have the time. Here is Rodgers\u2019 testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">\u201cA. I went in and talked to Mr. Moon. I had to get a tool clearance to pick up my check, and I talked to Mr. Moon, and Mr. Hethington, Frank Hethington, was working, and I asked Mr. Moon, I says, \u2014 says, \u2018Mr. Moon, why is he working and he hasn\u2019t been here over three years and I\u2019ve been here six ?\u2019 and he says, G don\u2019t know. I have an appointment with Mr. Richardson.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">The next day Rodgers received a telegram to report to the company. When he got there he was told that he was being fired. When he asked why he was told, \u201chabitual nuisance.\u201d Thereafter, he filed a written grievance and attended a meeting between the union president and management in which he was handed a formal discharge letter, footnote 2, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">Although Rodgers testified that on several occasions, in talking with his shop steward or foreman, he called attention to the fact that seniority rules were being disregarded as to other employees, the finding of the examiner, we think, pinpoints the exact cause for the discharge. The examiner found: I am convinced that the immediate cause of Rodgers\u2019 discharge was his demands to Moon on April 4 that Frank Hethington, an employee with lower seniority was employed while he was not, and the report of this remark to Richardson, and that neither the filing of the charges nor their dismissal touched off his unlawful action against Rodgers.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Not only did the examiner and the Board thus find that the immediate cause of Rodgers\u2019 discharge was his complaint to Moon which related solely to a personal gripe of his own, but Rodgers\u2019 own testimony completely eliminates any pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>sibility of a finding that he was fired on account of his activities on behalf of the employees he was authorized to represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Rodgers filed a formal complaint about being fired. This written complaint said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cApril 7, 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cI was discharged unjust for no reason at all only that I asked for my right to work and could not get any results, and I ask the Labor Board for a hearing which was not granted and then I was called in to get fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201cW. L. Rodgers\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The filing of this written grievance with the union president resulted in the holding of a meeting on April 8th, which was attended by Rodgers, Moon, Gatz, the union president, and Dorman, vice president in charge of industrial relations. Testifying <em>on </em>the hearing about this meeting Rodgers made it clear that twice during the hearing he said that his only complaint was that <em>he </em>was being deprived of <em>his </em>seniority rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">\u201cI said, \u2018All I ask for is <em>my </em>rights to work,\u2019 and I said, \u2018They\u2019re working men with less seniority than myself down there as of tonight.\u2019 \u201d and, again,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">\u201cAnd Mr. Gatz told me, he says, \u2018Now, state your beef.\u2019 I says, <em>\u2018I\u2019ve got no beef </em>only what\u2019s in that \u2014 in that grievance that you\u2019ve just read\u2019 (T was discharged unjust for no reason at all only <em>that I ashed for my right to </em>work\u2019) and he says, \u2018You haven\u2019t got any beef?\u2019 I said \u2018Nothing other than that <em>I need my: job,\u2019 </em>\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">Here was the time and place, if such was the fact, for Rodgers to tell the vice president of the respondent, whom he had known for years, that he felt he was being fired because of his activities as shop steward on behalf of his union. He made no suggestion either in his written complaint or in restating his demands or his \u201cbeef,\u201d that he was being discharged for anything other than his insisting on his. own rights. Moreover, his abortive complaint of February with the Labor Board and his initial complaint in this case asserted only grounds personal to him. This is entirely consistent with his own freely repeated testimony that his only complaint about being fired was that he, Rodgers, was being deprived of rights-that he claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">It is overwhelmingly clear from this record that the company had grounds for discharging Rodgers because of the continued special treatment he demanded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since, when he undertook <em>ante litem mo~ tam </em>to state his complaint, he repeatedly stated he was being fired only because he-was insisting on his personal seniority rights, and in view of the examiner\u2019s finding that the complaint about Hething-ton\u2019s working was the \u201cimmediate cause-for Rodgers\u2019 discharge\u201d we are forced to-conclude that the finding that Rodgers was fired on account of his earlier and informal mention of the rights of others is-without substantial evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">The petition to enforce is Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-14\">. Tlie record is clear that for several months between November 1957 and April 1958 the number of employees had dropped from some 1100 to between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>800 and 400 on account of shortage of shipyard work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\">. Rodgers requested a written statement of the grounds for his discharge. In response he was handed the following letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">\u201cDear Mr. Rodgers,</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">\u201cIt is apparent from your attitude that you are not happy working for Gibbs Corporation and are creating an unpleasant problem between our Per-; sonnel Office, Supervisory Staff and other rank and file employees; therefore, it is for the good of the company that we are dispensing with your services.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">\u201cVery truly yours,</p>\n<p id=\"AvWB\">Gibbs Corporation</p>\n<p id=\"APH\">\u201c(Signed) Rex Dorman</p>\n<p id=\"APg\">Rex Dorman</p>\n<p id=\"AIn\">Vice President</p>\n<p id=\"AT5\">Industrial Relations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\">. Rodgers had filed on February 12, 1958, charges with the Board in which, significantly, he alleged, \u201cSince on or about November 1, 1957, and at all times thereafter Gibbs Corporation * * * had repeatedly laid off W. B. Rodgers <em>for asking </em>the Independent \"Workers Union of Florida <em>to adjust his complaints </em>against Gibbs Corporation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) These charges were dismissed by the Regional Director on March 31st for \u201cinsufficient evidence of violation.\u201d In the instant proceedings, filed May 2nd, Rodgers\u2019 action in filing the earlier complaint was the asserted ground for which Rodgers was fired. This was charged as a violation of Section 8(a) (4). This was later amended to include the alleged violations of Section 8(a) (1). The examiner recommended the dismissal of the 8(a) (4) charges and the Board approved this dismissal in these same proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\">. Between these two statements, in response to the leading question asked by general counsel\u2019s representative, \u201cWas any mention made of any other men being out of work?,\u201d Rodgers testified that he answered:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">\u201cA. I told him that \u2014 I told him, I says, \u2018Not only myself, but,\u2019 I says, \u2018there\u2019s several of the other men out there on the street that has more seniority than the men that\u2019s working tonight, than some of the men that\u2019s working tonight.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">\u201cQ. Can you remember anything else that was done? Is that all that was said?</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">\u201cA. And Mr. Gatz told me, he says, \u2018Now, state your beef.\u2019 I says, \u2018I\u2019ve got no beef, only what\u2019s in that \u2014 in that grievance that you\u2019ve just read,\u2019 and he-says, \u2018You haven\u2019t got any beef?\u2019 I said, \u2018Nothing other than that and I need my job.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b454-19\">. This is not to say that he may not have been justified in insisting on his seniority rights. We are not here permitted to pass on that question. But so long as-, this was action personal to him the company could fire him for such insistence.without interfering with his right to engage in \u201cconcerted action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
