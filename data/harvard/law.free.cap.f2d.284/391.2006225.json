The appellant, Rexall Drug Company, sought to register \u201cAsma-Kets\u201d for medicinal tablets for the relief of bronchial asthma and hay fever. Appellee, Manhattan Drug Company, opposed the registration on the grounds that it is a prior user of \u201cAsmatab\u201d as a trademark for a medicinal preparation for temporary relief from paroxysms of bronchial asthma and hay fever.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">. The Patent Office found that the products of both parties are non-prescription medicinal preparations, made in tablet form for the treatment of asthma and hay fever, and sold in ordinary contain.ers through the usual retail outlets. Finding also that \u00e1ppellee was the first user, the board agreed with the appellee that the similarities between these marks when applied to such products were such that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers is quite likely to occur. Accordingly, the registration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Appellant urges that the two marks are not confusingly similar when used on asthma tablets because the term \u201cAs-matab\u201d merely suggests the generic 'name of the goods, \u201cAsma\u201d being the phonetie spelling of <em>asthma </em>and \u201cTab\u201d being a recognized abbreviation for <em>tablet, </em>while the \u201cKets\u201d portion of \u201cAsma-Kets\u201d is arbitrary, the term as a whole creating the commercial impression of an asthma treatment preparation emanating from a particular source.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Although appellant has listed in its Notice of Appeal a number of trademarks containing \u201cAsma,\u201d we are without authority to consider these third party registrations since they were not included in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">In spite of this deficiency, we are of the opinion that appellant should prevail. \u201cAsthma\u201d or its phonetic equivalent, \u201casma,\u201d is the name of a common disease, and is highly descriptive when used as part of a mark to identify a medicinal preparation to be used in the treatment of this malady. Furthermore, <em>\u201cKets,\u201d </em>the suffix of appellant\u2019s mark, is arbitrary whereas the suffix of appellee\u2019s mark is not. \u201cTab\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201ctablet\u201d in which form appellee sells its products. Besides, \u201cKets\u201d and \u201cTab\u201d neither sound alike, have the same appearance, nor have the same meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Considering both marks in their en-tireties in view of the weakness of ap-pellee\u2019s mark and the dissimilarities 'noted between the marks, we are of the opinion that there is no likelihood of confusion when appellant applies its trademark to its goods. For these reasons, we reverse the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-20\">. Appellee neither filed a brief nor appeared at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-14\">WORLEY, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AmW\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">I agree with the following statement of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board:</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">\u25a0 The goods on which \u201cAsmatab\u201d and \u201cAsma-Kets\u201d are used are similar in form and composition and are adapted for sale without prescription for the treatment of the same commonplace complaints. As applied to such products, the similarities between these marks are believed to be such that confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers is quite likely to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
