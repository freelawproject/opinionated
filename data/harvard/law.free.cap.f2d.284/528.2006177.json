United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019CONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.O.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b576-22\">RICH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b576-23\">These are appeals in consolidated oppositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-24\">Appeal No. 6610 is in opposition No. 36,055 to the registration of \u201cIvy Hall\u201d as a trademark for neckties, application serial No. 694,931, filed September 19, 1955, by Superba Cravats, Inc., of Rochester, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-25\">Appeal No. 6611 is in opposition No. 36,057 to the registration of \u201cIvy Loom\u201d as a trademark for neckties, application serial No. 694,930, filed September 19, 1955, by Superba Cravats, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-26\">The opposer in each case is House of Worsted-Tex, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation located in Philadelphia, the present owner by assignment from Cohen, Goldman &amp; Co., Inc., the original registrant, of registration No. 371,524 of the trademark \u201cIvy League Model\u201d surrounded by a rectangular line border, the goods named in the registration being: \u201cmen\u2019s, boys\u2019, and children\u2019s outer garments, consisting of coats, vests, pants, and trousers; also men\u2019s overcoats and topcoats; also women\u2019s overcoats, topcoats, and suits, consisting of outercoat, ensemble, vest, and skirt.\u201d This registration was granted under the 1905 Act on September 26, 1939, claiming first use November 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>1938, and has been renewed for 20 years from September 26, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The assignment from Cohen, Goldman &amp; Co., Inc., to opposer, dated June 27, 1950, shows that the entire business of the former was acquired, including a large number of trademarks and trademark registrations. The only trademarks pertinent here are listed in the assignment in the following words: \u201cIvy League Model\u201d; \u201cIvy League Model positioned within a rectangle shown in Certificate No. 371,524\u201d and in a long list of \u201cRegistered Marks\u201d the item \u201c371,524 Ivy League Model plus design Sept. 26, 1939 Cohen, Goldman &amp; Co., Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In its brief, opposer also claims to be the owner of the trademark \u201cIvy League\u201d with no additions, embellishments, or qualifications and claims to have been using it continuously \u201csince it acquired said trade-mark in 1950\u201d from Cohen, Goldman &amp; Co., Inc., which firm, it claims, had been continuously using that mark since 1938. The proofs, however, fail to show any acquisition from the said assignor of the simple \u201cIvy League\u201d trademark or any use thereof by the assignor, as distinguished from the marks listed in the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Opposer took the testimony of one witness, its advertising director, in its employ only since 1950. He testified to substantial sales \u201cunder the trademark \u2018Ivy League\u2019 \u201d and certain advertising expenditures by opposer and its customers in promotion of products thus sold. No example of an advertisement, however, was put in evidence. We are therefore unable to see in what manner the claimed use of \u201cIvy League\u201d took place or in what manner it was promoted, whether by itself as implied by opposer or merely as a part of \u201cIvy League Model\u201d or in some other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Opposer also put in evidence five labels about the use of which its sole witness testified. One of these reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Authentic</p>\n<p id=\"amg-dedup-0\">\u201cIvy League\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">We are unable to find any clear evidence in the record as to when, on what, to what extent or by whom this label was used. Of the other four labels, two of them feature at the top in large type the words \u201cWorsted Tex,\u201d at the left side is a small panel containing a police dog\u2019s head under which is \u201c \u2018TEX\u2019 \u201d and to the right of the dog between two horizontal lines and in much smaller type are the words:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Ivy</p>\n<p id=\"b577-14\">League</p>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">The remaining two labels are similar in composition except that the featured words are \u201cTropi-Tex,\u201d the words \u201cIvy League\u201d are thereunder and above the top parallel line, and between the lines, to the right of the dog\u2019s head, are the words:</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">By the House of</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">Worsted-Tex</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">Opposer admits that \u201cthe words \u2018Ivy League\u2019 connote a group of certain eastern universities when used in their general sense\u201d but would have us believe that \u201cnevertheless <em>they refer only to the appellant\u2019s product when </em>they are <em>used in the clothing industry.\u201d </em>In other words an \u201cIvy League\u201d suit means to the purchasing public only a suit originating with opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">Applicant has introduced numerous exhibits consisting of excerpts from advertisements and editorial comments and even a crime news item showing common use of \u201cIvy League\u201d and \u201cIvy\u201d as an abbreviated form of reference to the same thing (as for example in the term \u201c \u2018Ivy\u2019 style\u201d or \u201cThe Ivy Man\u2019s Sport Shirt\u201d) to imply a style meeting with favor by or popular with those attending the Ivy League universities or colleges. Opposer\u2019s witness, questioned about these terms as used in several of the applicant\u2019s exhibits, admitted that the items of clothing therein referred to were not opposer\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">This case appears to resolve itself into two parts. Opposer of necessity is urging unregistrability of \u201cIvy Hall\u201d and \u201cIvy Loom\u201d on the basis of section 2(d) of the Lanham Act (Trademark Act of 1946) 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d), which provides that a mark shall not be registered if it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201c(d) consists of or comprises a mark which so resembles [1] a mark <em>registered </em>in the Patent Office or [2] a mark or trade name previously <em>used </em>in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to the goods of the applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers * * [Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Insofar as opposer is relying on a registered mark, we must refer to the mark of its only registration of record, No. 371,524, which is for \u201cIvy League Model\u201d positioned within a rectangle. That mark is so different from either of applicant\u2019s marks that, taking into account also the differences in the goods, we see no reasonable likelihood of confusion. 'Therefore, we find no basis in the registered mark for sustaining the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Insofar as opposer is relying on prior <em>use </em>of \u201cIvy League,\u201d on which mark it has not obtained registration, we are not obliged to regard it as possessing exclusive rights to that term by itself as a trademark, as we would be if it could point to an unimpeached registration thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">At the very least, the record shows that \u201cIvy League\u201d has a primary meaning according to which it indicates a group of eastern colleges and universities and, by extension, things and matters pertaining thereto. In the clothing field \u201cIvy League\u201d clothing would indicate to persons familiar with the \u201cIvy League\u201d educational institutions \u2014 and their number is legion- \u2014 styles somehow associated therewith. It would require much to develop a secondary meaning whereby the public would come to associate \u201cIvy League\u201d clothing with a single manufacturer or vendor. The record here fails to \u25a0show such a secondary meaning. For this reason opposer has failed to establish an exclusive right to the term \u201cIvy League\u201d in the clothing field and cannot, therefore, \u2022show damage from the registration of applicant\u2019s marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Assuming, arguendo, that opposer has .some rights in \u201cIvy League,\u201d those rights are certainly not of such a nature as to enable it to prevent the registration of applicant\u2019s marks \u201cIvy Hall\u201d and \u201cIvy Loom\u201d for neckties.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The decision of the board dismissing the oppositions is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
