KIRKPATRICK, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Dilly Manufacturing Company made application for registration of its trademark, registration was refused upon opposition by the Bassett Company, and Dilly took this appeal (No. 6585). The trademark of the application consists of the words \u201cKlipper King\u201d together with an outline drawing of a crown, the whole being arranged in a unique manner. The letter \u201cK\u201d placed on the left is tall enough to serve as a common initial letter for both words, the letters 1 i p p e r following it on the upper line and i n g on the lower. In addition, the \u201cK\u201d has on the top of its upright a crown slanted to the left much in the manner of a hat hung on a pole. In order to differentiate between classes of its products, the appellant-applicant uses in association with the mark the notations \u201c4 in 1,\u201d \u201c6 in 1,\u201d and \u201c7 in 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">The applicant\u2019s goods as stated in the application are \u201cfinger nail clippers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-14\">The opposer, since prior to the applicant\u2019s adoption of its trademark, has used the mark \u201cKustom King\u201d for a deluxe line of toenail and fingernail clippers. Its goods are advertised and sold exclusively to jobbers dealing in advertising specialty products, who resell to business concerns which in turn distribute the goods with their trade names imprinted on them, as gifts to their customers, for the purpose of advertising their own particular business. There is no evidence as to the manner in which the opposer uses its mark upon its goods, but in its promotional literature it prints the words in broad block letters, \u201cKing\u201d below \u201cKustom,\u201d and upon the upright of the \u201cK\u201d in \u201cKustom\u201d it sometimes hangs a slanted crown resembling that of the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">The Board found that the mark of the application so resembles the opposer\u2019s mark \u201cKustom King\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as to be likely to cause purchaser confusion and to lead purchasers to believe that \u201cKlipper King\u201d is another product in the opposer\u2019s line. With this finding we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">It is to be borne in mind that the applicant\u2019s mark consists not only of words but, in addition, a symbol. The opposer\u2019s promotional literature has the same symbol displayed in the same way. Admittedly, there is nothing unusual in the idea of associating crowns with kings, but in this case the crowns are both associated with the letter \u201cK\u201d of the misspelled 'first word rather than with the word \u201cKing,\u201d both in the same unique manner. In fact, when one looks at the two marks, the crown hanging on the upright of the \u201cK\u201d is a prominent feature of both. In Columbian Steel Tank Co. v. Union Tank and Supply Co., 277 F.2d 192, 196, 47 CCPA 900, this court found likelihood of confusion between two marks on the basis of a similarity between the designs with which words were displayed. The word marks in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>case (\u201cUnion\u201d and \u201cColumbian\u201d), taken alone, were not in the least alike and certainly far less likely to cause confusion than the words involved in this appeal. However, the court said, \u201cthe issue in this case is not the likelihood of confusion from the use of those names but rather whether confusion is likely to result from the use of appellee\u2019s <em>whole </em>mark in view of opposer\u2019s use of its <em>world symbol </em>mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Here we have an applicant desirous of registering a mark for articles which are the same as the opposer\u2019s goods and which might easily be accepted by the public as coming from the op-poser. The newcomer has adopted a mark having the following features in common with the opposer\u2019s mark, as used by it: (a) two words, the second of which is the same as the opposer\u2019s, (b) a first word not much like the opposer\u2019s but, like the opposer\u2019s, misspelled by using a \u201cK\u201d in place of an initial \u201cC,\u201d and (c) a crown apparently hung upon the top of the vertical part of this \u201cK.\u201d We think they are clearly similar enough so that confusion is likely to result.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Appeal No. 6587.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">In addition to its marks \u201cKustom King\u201d and \u201cPocket King\u201d referred to above, the opposer has a mark \u201cClipper King,\u201d the first sale under the latter mark having been made on March 5, 1957. The applicant proved a sale under its mark as early as January 23, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">No. 6587 is a cross-appeal filed by the opposer assigning as error the board\u2019s holding that \u201cthe record shows that applicant has used \u2018Klipper King\u2019 since pri- or to opposer\u2019s first use of \u2018Clipper King\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-12\">While that question appears to be moot, so far as applicant\u2019s right to register the \u201cKlipper King\u201d mark is concerned, in view of our decision in Appeal No. 6585, it has been made the sole subject of Appeal No. 6587 and we therefore think it proper to decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-13\">The opposer and cross-appellant contending that the law does not countenance the creation of a trademark based on a single isolated sale, argues that the applicant\u2019s evidence shows only one sale prior to October 1957. However, we think that the board\u2019s finding was amply justified by the record and that the evidence shows a general and continuous use of the mark since the earlier date.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-14\">The witness, Edward Goldstein, the applicant\u2019s sales manager, produced a number of bills which he testified were representative for the years 1957 and 1958, showing the billing of \u201cKlipper King\u201d to customers and testified that during those years there was a continuous billing of customers for \u201cKlipper King.\u201d He was not cross-examined on this point and his. testimony stands unchallenged. The fact that the first representative bill of those produced was sent in January and the second was dated in October does not. negative his testimony as to the continuous use of the trademark, and we find no. reason to hold that the board should have disbelieved him.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-15\">The decision of the board upon this, point is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b583-17\">. The hoard also dealt with the opposer\u2019s mark \u201cPocket King\u201d in connection with its \u201cKustom King,\u201d but, in view of the conclusion reached herein, we need not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
