In this court he complains that the evidence furnished an insufficient basis for the jury\u2019s verdict. We think the evidence easily sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-23\">In the argument of the appeal, as in his brief, the appellant concentrates upon comments made by the judge during the trial, in his charge to the jury, and at the time of sentencing. Although the appellant has diligently combed the record and cited numerous statements by the judge, to which no objection was made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel (not the counsel appearing in this court), we have examined them all in context and find no substance in the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
