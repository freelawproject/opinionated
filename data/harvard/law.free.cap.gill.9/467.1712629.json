Owings, </em>deceased, reduced to writing by <em>Basil Owings, </em>the father of the deceased, and one \u25a0of the attesting witnesses, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\"><em>\u201c </em>On the 29th day of August, 1849, <em>Richard H. 'Owings, </em>of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>called on <em>Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Mills, </em>and myself, to witness his will, which he declared to be as \u25a0follows: <em>* </em>I leave all that I am worth to my mother, to be \u25a0divided between my brothers and sisters.\u2019 As witness my hand, this 31st day of August, 1849. Basil Owings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AeJ\">This will was offered for probate, on the 7th of November, 1850, and a <em>caveat </em>was filed thereto by the appellant, one of the creditors of <em>Basil Owings, </em>the father of the deceased, said <em>Basil </em>having applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws prior to the death of his son. This <em>caveat </em>was answered by the appellees, the brothers and sisters of the deceased, and the depositions of <em>Basil Owings, Elizabeth Mills </em>and <em>John H. Taylor, </em>the three attesting witnesses above referred to, were taken, \u2022establishing the following facts: That the witnesses were called upon by the deceased, at the time he spoke the words, to witness his will. That the words were spoken by the deceased in his last illness, the day before his death, at the house of <em>Hezekiah Magruder, </em>of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>where the deceased resided for more than ten days next previous to his decease, and were reduced to writing by said <em>Basil Owings, </em>about two hours after his son\u2019s death. That said <em>Basil </em>showed \u25a0the writing to <em>Mrs. Mills </em>immediately thereafter, who read and approved of the same. That <em>Mr. Taylor, </em>the other witness, never saw the paper until about December 1850, and never reduced the same to writing at all. This witness, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>ever, swore that the words in the paper were the words spoken by the deceased, as stated by the other witnesses. The estate of the deceased was admitted to amount to, at least, $400.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">On this testimony the orphans court passed an order, admitting the same to probate, from which the caveator, Welling, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The first section of the act of 1810, ch. 34, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\"><em>\u201c Be it enacted, </em>that no nuncupative will, hereafter to be made, shall be good, where the estate thereby bequeathed shall exceed the value of $300, that is not proved by the oaths of three witnesses at least, who were present at the making thereof; nor unless it be proved, that the testator, at the time of pronouncing the same, did bid the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will, or to that effect; nor unless such nuncupative will were made in the time of the last sickness of the deceased, and in the house of his or her habitation or dwelling, or where he or she had been resident for the space of ten days, or more, next before the making of such will, except where such person was surprised or taken sick, being from his own home, and died before he or she returned to the place of his or her dwelling.\u201d The second section is quoted at length in the opinion of this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b477-8\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, O.

It is well known that testaments of this character are, from their nature, not only open to fraud and fabrication, but peculiarly exposed to mistakes in relation to the testator\u2019s intention on account of the imperfection and frailty of human memory. And it is manifest, that the legislature in legalizing these nuncupative wills, intended to guard the testator against imposition and to protect him <em>from </em>mistakes, by requiring that these testaments should in point of accuracy, approximate as near as possible to written wills, and they believed that this purpose would be only accomplished by demanding that the testamentary words, as uttered, should be written down and seen and recognised as correct by each of the three attesting witnesses, while the language of the testator was fresh in their recollection.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The word \u201ctestimony\u201d as used in this section, applies, we think, to the nuncupation itself, and not to the prerequisites required by the <em>first </em>section of the statute, as that the will was made in the last sickness of the testator, and in the house of his habitation. These certainly are material facts with respect to the predicament of a person making a nuncupative will, and must be clearly proved. But they are facts which may be established at any time before the paper is admitted to probate, and need not be proved by the attesting witnesses. No useful purpose could be gained by requiring testimony of this kind to be reduced to writing within six days after the will was made. The provision with regard to the testamentary words, stands however upon a very different ground. It is obvious that accuracy and precision in reference to the words used by the testator, is of the greatest importance, as his.intention with respect to the disposition of his estate can only be known from the language he may have employed to communicate his meaning. And that accuracy might be secured, so far as practicable, in reference to the words used by the testator, we understand the legislature to have required that these testamentary words, or the substance of them, should be reduced to writing, and should be seen by, and found to be correct, by each of the three attesting witnesses, within the period limited by the second section of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">It follows from the construction we have thus placed on the second section of the act of Assembly of 1810, ch. 34, that the decree of the orphans court admitting this paper to probate is erroneous and must be reversed. For it appears from the record, that although the pretended testamentary words were reduced to writing by one of the witnesses, and shown by him to another, within the time prescribed by the act, yet they were never reduced to writing by Taylor, the third witness, and were not seen by him until more than twelve months after the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The order of the orphans court is reversed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">ORDER REVERSED WITH COSTS,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
