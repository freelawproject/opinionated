At the same-term the defendant appeared and pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the plaintiff, on motion of the defendant, was ruled to give security for costs by the second Monday of January then next, and to file a bill of particulars. The plaintiff gave security as required, and on the 23rd of March 1847, during the January term 1847, a bill of particulars was furnished charging the defendant with $50.000, in money, and proceeds of real and personal estate, received by him on the 12th of September 1842, from said <em>Hoover, </em>who conveyed the same to him in contemplation of bankruptcy, in order to conceal it from his creditors, the defendant not being a <em>bona fide </em>creditor of said <em>Hoover.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">On the 30th of March 1847, also during the January term 1S47, the plaintiff filed his petition, called in the record a <em>bill </em>of discovery, requiring the defendant to answer on oath the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>following interrogatories, which the court by its order of the same day, required him to do by the 30th of April then next.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">1st.

Afterwards, on the 26th of January 1848, during the same term, <em>Reverdy Johnson </em>and <em>John Glenn </em>the counsel for the defendant, filed their affidavits alleging surprise in the obtention of this judgment, and praying that it might be stricken out. On the 31st of the same month, <em>Robert J. </em>Brent, counsel for the plaintiff, filed a counter affidavit justifying the course adopted by him, and denying all design to take undue advantage. These affidavits show that the counsel misunderstood each other in reference to certain verbal agreements made by them in regard to the case. The court on the 7th of February 1848, ordered the judgment tobe struck out, and to this order the plaintiff took his <em>first </em>exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-7\">On the 8th of February 1848, the court at the instance of defendant, gave him further time to show cause why he should not answer the plaintiff\u2019s interrogatories. Under this leave the defendant assigned the following reasons for not answering. 1st. Because the same were not filed by the trial term as required by the act of 1801, ch. 74, and the act of 1831, ch. 64. 2nd. Because the same are not a bill of discovery, and the court sustained these objections, and ordered the previous order directing the defendants to answer to be rescinded. To this the plaintiff took his <em>second </em>exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-8\">The cause was then tried, and the plaintiff offered in evidence two transcripts, from the records of the circuit court of the <em>District </em>of Columbia, sitting in bankruptcy, for the purpose of proving his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>appointment as assignee of <em>Hoover, </em>under the bankrupt law of Congress of the 19th of August 1841. The first of these transcripts set forth. 1st. The petition of <em>Hoover </em>for the benefit of the bankrupt law, with schedules of his creditors and property. The time of filing is not stated, though the affidavit to the petition was made on the 13th of April 1842. 2nd. An order of the court appointing, the 5th of September 1841, for the hearing of the petition, and directing notice to creditors, with a certificate of the printer, that the notice had been duly published. The date of this order is not given. 3rd. The transcript then states that on the said 5th of September, no creditors appearing, \u201cthe court passed the following decree, and appointed <em>David A. Hall, Esq., </em>assignee of said <em>John Hoover, </em>a bankrupt, who gave bond with surety approved by the court.\u201d Then follows a decree declaring said <em>Hoover </em>a bankrupt, within the act of Congress of 1841, dated 5th of September 1842, and made absolute the 12th of the same month. 4th. A petition of <em>Hoover </em>for a certificate and discharge, stating that he has <em>bona fide </em>surrendered all his property for the benefit of his creditors, and on this petition an order of the court dated 12th of September 1842, appointing the 12th of December then next, for the hearing thereof, and directing notice thereof to creditors to be published, and the certificate of the printer, that said notice was duly published. 5th. A report signed by <em>D. A. Hall, </em>assignee of <em>John Hoover, </em>a bankrupt, stating that said <em>Hoover </em>had <em>bona fide </em>transferred to him all his property as required by the bankrupt law, upon which the court passed a decree for his discharge and certificate, dated 12th of December 1842, and made absolute on the 19th of the same month, 6th. A certificate of discharge, dated 19th of December 1842. 7th. A certificate of the clerk of said court, duly attested, certifying that the \u201caforegoing is a full, true and perfect transcript, of all the proceedings had in the said court, in the said cause of <em>John Hoover, </em>a bankrupt, as appears from the minutes of the proceedings of the said court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">The <em>second </em>transcript set forth. 1st. That <em>David A. Hall </em>is appointed general assignee in bankruptcy, \u201cin and for <em>Wash</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>ington </em>county <em>District of Columbia.\u201d </em>2nd. The bond of said <em>Hall </em>as such general assignee, in the penalty of $10,000, dated 22nd of February 1842, approved and recorded, 10th of March 1842. 3rd. A certificate dated 1st of October 1842, signed <em>\u201cD. A. Hall </em>assignee of bankrupts,\u201d certifying that <em>John Hoover, </em>a bankrupt, had transferred to him all his property as set forth in his schedule, attached to his petition for the benefit of the bankrupt act. 4th. A decree of said court, dated 19th of December 1842, granting a discharge and certificate to said <em>John Hoover, </em>the same as in the preceding transcript. 5th. The certificate of the clerk of said court duly attested, that the appointment of said <em>Hall, </em>\u201cas assignee in bankruptcy, in and for the county of <em>Washington, </em>in the <em>District </em>of <em>Columbia, </em>his bond to the <em>United States </em>as such assignee, his certificate in the matter of <em>John Hoover, </em>and the certificate and discharge of said <em>John Hoover, </em>are truly and correctly copied from the minutes of proceedings and records of the said court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">The court (Le Grand, J.,) upon the defendant\u2019s prayer, instructed the jury that the above evidence was not sufficient proof oi the appointment of the plaintiff as assignee of said <em>Hoover, </em>and that he could not therefore maintain this action. The plaintiff took his <em>third </em>exception, and the verdict and judgment being against him, appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b159-6\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, C. J., Chambers, Spence, Ma cruder, Martin and Frick, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-7\">Robert J. Brent and John Nelson, for the appellant, insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA\">that there was error, <em>first, </em>in striking out the judgment by default, and rescinding the order requiring answers to the interrogatories; and <em>second, </em>in collaterally impeaching and annulling the appointment of the plaintiff, by the circuit court as general assignee in bankruptcy, and in holding that there was no evidence of his appointment as assignee of <em>Hoover. </em>On the latter point they cited:</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\"><em>Erwin vs. Lowry, 7 Howard, </em>172. <em>Shriver vs. Lynn, </em>2 <em>Howard, </em>58, <em>McCormick vs. Sullivant, </em>10 <em>Wheat. </em>199. <em>Ra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>borg vs. Hammond, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>42. <em>Bowie vs. Jones, </em>1 <em>Gill, </em>214. 3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>189. 8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>346. 12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>177.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-5\">Glenn and R. Johnson for the appellee, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">1st. That the interrogatories of the plaintiff constituted no such sufficient bill of discovery, as he had any lawful right to file, or to ask the defendant to answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">2nd. That the said interrogatories, even if they constituted a proper bill of discovery, should have been filed by January term, 1847, and were in fact filed too late to avail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">3rd. That the court were right in striking out the judgment by default, both because of the facts stated in the affidavits and of the defects above alleged in reference to the said interrogatories; that they were also right, for the latter reasons, in rescinding the previous order to answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">4th. That no appeal lies from the order of the court, striking out the judgment by default.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-10\">5th.- That the two records, from the circuit court of <em>Washington, </em>do not separately, and' cannot together, prove the proper and legal appointment of the plaintiff, as assignee of <em>Hoover, </em>or his having given bond, in such manner as to entitle him to sue as such assignee.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-11\">Magruder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A0f\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The point which arises in this case upon the last bill of exceptions, will first be disposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">The appellant, as the assignee of one <em>John Hoover, </em>a bankrupt, instituted this action' in his own name, against the appellee, claiming sums of money alleged to be due from the appellee to the bankrupt, at the time of his application. Proof was offered of the claim, and of the proceedings, in the case of the bankrupt, and upon the evidence offered, the court at the instance of the appellee, instructed the jury, that it is not sufficient evidence of the appointment of the plaintiff, (appellant,) as assignee of <em>John Hoover, </em>and therefore the plaintiff could not maintain the action. Did the court err in giving this instruction ?</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>W\u00e9 are told in <em>2nd Maddock\u2019s Chancery Practice, </em>that in <em>England, </em>all the chancellor\u2019s jurisdiction in bankruptcy is derived from the legislature, it is a statutory jurisdiction, and begins and ends in acts of Parliament. In <em>2nd Philips on Evidence, p. </em>319, <em>(Cowen\u2019s edition,) </em>we learn what proof must be offered by the assignees of a bankrupt, if their title' be not admitted. The provisions of our statute of bankruptcy, are very different from those of the bankrupt law in England. In this country, however, proof, equally strict, of his title to sue, is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The plaintiff below, in proof of his title to recover in his own name, money alleged to be due by the defendant below to the bankrupt, offered in proof the proceedings which took place in the circuit court of the <em>District of Columbia, </em>upon the application of the bankrupt.- It is objected, that these proceedings do not authorise the suit.- One answer given to this is, that it is not competent f\u00f3r' a court of <em>Maryland, </em>\u201cnot invested with appellate powers,\u201d to revis\u00e9 or question, the correctness of the circuit court;' that the proceedings show the appointment of a trustee by that court, and what was done by him and the court in consequence of said application; these proceedings it must be presumed here, are correct. This is sometimes true, but not when the court is exercising the power conferred by the bankrupt law. It is possible, indeed, that the courts of the different States, will differ in their interpretation of some of the provisions of this act of <em>Congress, </em>each being governed by its own interpretation of its bankrupt or insolvent laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The bankrupt law, like our insolvent law, requires the trustee to give bond, and it is presumed that the same proof will be required of an assignee of a bankrupt, suing as assignee, that is required here of the trustee of an insolvent, appointed by our own judicial tribunals. In the case of <em>Winchester, trustee, vs. The Union Bank, 2 G. &amp; </em>J., 73, we are told what proof is required of a trustee of an insolvent applicant, claiming a right to sue in that character. He must give bond, and so the assignee of a bankrupt is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to give bond, with at least two sureties, in such sum as the court may deem proper; and this, and every other requisite of the act of Congress, must be complied with, before he can sue in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">It was attempted in this case to show, that the appellant did give bond, and for this purpose two, (not corresponding) copies of the proceedings of the circuit court, were offered in evidence. The one shows that, previously to this application, he had been appointed a general assignee in bankruptcy, and had given bond faithfully to discharge his duties as such. It is thought that this is not such an appointment, as divests out of the bankrupt his property, and vests it in the assignee' <em>u </em>appointed from time to time by the proper court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Of this opinion, indeed, the circuit court seems to have been, for one of the records shows, that the general assignee was also appointed the assignee of <em>Hoover. </em>The special assignee', however, does' not appear ever to have given the bond which the act of Congress requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">When the assignee thus appointed claims and would exercise the right of suing in our'.courts, they must judge, whether in any such character, he has <em>a </em>right to maintain an action in them'.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">But there are two other exceptions of which we will now dispose. An application, by petition, had been made to the county court, to require the defendant below to answer certain interrogatories then submitted, and on- the 30th March, 1847, it was ordered that the defendant answer them, on or before the'30th of April then next. On the second Monday of January, 1840, a judgment, or decree is obtained, because the interrogatories are not answered, and thereupon,, the record tells us, let a jury come to inquire what damages the plaintiff hath sustained.- We will not stop to inquire whether this is the course authorised by the act of Assembly ?</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">During the same term, the attorney for the defendant filed in court affidavits, and one was filed by the attorney for the plaintiff, and upon motion, the judgment spoken of, was, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>order of the court, stricken out. Because of this an exception was taken by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The power of the court to strike out this interlocutory decree or judgment, will be seen by a reference to the act of 1787, chap. 9, sec. 6. Upon the affidavits filed, in connection with this motion, we shall only remark, that they show the necessity, in all such cases, that counsel reduce their agreements to writing. It cannot be doubted that each of the gentlemen misunderstood the other, and hence the surprise. See upon the subject of striking out judgments, 2 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>G., </em>374 <em>and </em>379. See, also, in <em>Palmer and Hamilton vs. </em>Oliver, 11 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 137, some remarks pertinent to applications of this description: \u201cJudgments at law,\u201d said the court, 2 <em>H. &amp; G., </em>378, \u201care not lightly to be interfered with, and it must be a case infinitely stronger than the present, to induce this court to sanction the striking out a judgment of almost eight years standing\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In the case before us, theout an interlocutory judgment, and made too the very term that the judgment was entered. Ido the very termilhat the judgmotions.</p>\n<p id=\"AnL\">hi$h had been ;o the interrer But the court also rescifdecl the order passed, and thereby dispensfc ^tSjfsiMy rogatories which the defendan^S^low.^ha\u00e9^iJ\u00cd\u00e9n required to answer. Of this can the appellant complain in this court ? The plaintiff had been required to furnish, and had furnished, a bill of particulars. To this he must confine himself in his proof, and cannot propose questions, the answers to which do not relate to the matters in issue. It is thought that this last order of the court, furnishes the plaintiff with no ground for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
