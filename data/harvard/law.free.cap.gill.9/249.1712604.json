The plaintiff then asked the court to amend the attachment so as to show that he produced the original judgment, which he avers was done by him. This amendment was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>sistedby the defendant. 1st. Because the court has no power to make such alteration in the writ. 2nd. Because the affidavit of the plaintiff, to his petition, was not sufficient to authorise the alteration asked for. 3d. Because it is not an amendment of the process or proceedings in said cause, as respects any defect or imperfection therein. And 4th.
