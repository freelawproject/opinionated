The appellants, the defendants below, claimed, under the deed from <em>Jacob Rohrer </em>to <em>Joseph Graff, </em>referred to in the opinion of this court.

Both <em>Rohrer </em>and <em>Graff </em>died before the institution of this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Did the deed give <em>Graff </em>authority to sell the fee? It conveys the land to him, without adding \u201c and his heirs,\u201d and if it had been designed to convey the absolute property, no doubt it would not have been a conveyance of the fee-simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">But the deed of <em>Rohrer </em>was executed by a man involved in debt, and is executed by him in order that <em>Graff </em>might make sale of the land, and discharge his (the grantor\u2019s) debts. It is a conveyance of all his estate and all his right and title thereto, with power to sell the same, and pay tiiose debts. If a deed of this description conveys land to the trustee and his heirs, we are told (4 <em>Kent, </em>310) that the legal estate is in him so long as the \u201cexecution of the trusts requires it, and no longer.\u201d So \u201can assignment or conveyance of an interest in trust will carry a fee, without words of limitation when the intent is manifest.\u201d 4 <em>Kent, </em>304.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The trustee, it is believed, had the power to dispose of the fee, and also \u201c to pass the legal estate. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">The estate conveyed to <em>Graff </em>was for the benefit of the grantor\u2019s creditors, and his creditors could have compelled a sale of so much of the property as was necessary, in order to pay all their debts. If be died, or was discharged as trustee, another could have been appointed in his place, and the chancellor could have empowered and have directed him to sell as much of the estate as would be sulficient to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">A testator may direct a sale of his real estate for such a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>pose, without naming any person by whom the sale is to be made, and the person who is empowered to make the sale, is authorized to sell and convey the fee. So the executor if authorized, may make the sale, although no fee is vested in him. \u00a3\u00a3lt is not any estate or interest of the grantee in the deed of trust which is to pay the debts; it is the estate of the grantor from whom the title is derived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">It cannot be doubted in this case that a sale of the fee was necessary in order to execute the trust, and that the deed was executed in order to give the grantee power to sell it. The trustee is to sell, pay the debts, &amp;c., and the surplus whether lands, bonds, &amp;c., to deliver to said <em>Jacob, </em>if alive, but if he die before the trusts are executed, then that surplus to be delivered to the heirs of said <em>Jacob, </em>or as said <em>Jacob </em>may before his decease direct by will, or other writing according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">J\u00fcGDMENT REVERSED WITH COSTS,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
