Whereupon the county court gave judgment that the liberties, privileges, franchises, property and endowments of the said board of commissioners for <em>the Frederick Female Seminary </em>should be seized into the hands of the State of <em>Maryland, </em>and the said board of commissioners be excluded and removed therefrom, and the same be vested as directed by the act of 1845, ch. 75.

Palmer and Wm. Schley, for the appellants, made the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">1st. On the general demurrers of the State to the pleas of the defendants, the court will examine and consider tho whole record, and mount up to the first defect, in substance, and give judgment against the party whose pleadings are first defective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">2nd. The <em>scire facias </em>is radically and substantially defective, for that, it is not shown and made to appear in the said writ, that the commissioners, &amp;c., are a corporation and body politic by that name, but it clearly appears that the commissioners, &amp;c., as such, were merely fiscal agents to perform certain preliminary acts and conditions, provided for in the charter, before they could assume the character of corporators, and exercise corporate powers aud franchises, as trastees of \u201cthe <em>Frederick Female Seminary</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-8\">3rd. The commissioners, as such fiscal agents, were required by the charter, to give bond to the State of <em>Maryland, </em>with approved security, conditioned for the faithful discharge of the duties and trusts reposed in them as such commissioners, &amp;c., and they are responsible for all miscouducl or breach of trust, to any person or persons, or body politic, interested in the condition thereof, and they, as a board of commissioners, are not in any way responsible as corporators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-9\">4th. A charter is a contract or a compact between the State granting it and the corporators, and no act or acts of the corporators can legally he construed to amount Jo a forfeiture of the powers and franchises to them granted, unless they be such acts as amount to a breach or violation of some express or implied stipulation or condition in the charter: no such acts are charged or alleged in flits <em>scire </em>facias.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>5th.- The board of commissioners, &amp;c., as such, were merely fiscal agents or trustees to perform preliminary duties and conditions\u2019specified-in the charier, before the corporation sprang into existan'ce as a body politic and corporate, with the right to exercise corporate powers and franchises, and so soon as those preliminary duties and conditions were performed, the board of commissioners were,- by virtue of the 4th and 5th sections of the charter, converted into a board of trustees of <em>\u201c </em>the <em>Frederick Female Seminary,\u201d </em>with the right and privilege of exercising corporate franchises; and as soon as they assumed the character of trustees, &amp;c., and became a body politic, they ceased to be and existas a board of commissioners, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">6th. So soon as the board of commissioners as fi'scal agents ceased to exist as such, and they were organised into a board of trustees of the <em>Frederick Female </em>Semihary, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the <em>corporation </em>and body politic,-both fiscal and educational, devolved- on them as trustees of said seminary, and they then;- and not before,- became amenable to the law as such body politic, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">7th'. The writ of <em>scire facias </em>in this State against a corporation and body politic, to obtain a judgment and vacate a charter, was authorised by the act of 1832, ch. 306, and before that act, no such writ could legally be issued and sustained in <em>Maryland, </em>as writs of <em>scire facias </em>issue out of a record, hence\u2019 out of the court where a record is, and in this State, all corporation-charters are created by acts of the legislature,\u2019and the acts of incorporation being recorded in the office of the clerk-of the Court of Appeals of the Western Shore,-and as that court has no original jurisdiction, it became necessary for the-legislature to interpose and accommodate the writ of <em>scire facias </em>to the existing state of things, and that act only authorises a writ of <em>scire facias </em>to be issued against an actual <em>legal </em>existing- corporation and body politic, capable of acting as such, who have abused their powers and franchises,-and not against a corporation <em>de facto.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-7\">. Sth. To authorise a proceeding in the name of the State, by the attorney general, to annul and vacate a charter- or fran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>chises, a public injury or wrong must be charged and alleged in the <em>scire facias, </em>and proved, and if the wrong complained of is a mere private injury, in which the public has no interest or concern, and for which a civil action can be sustained,' the <em>scire facias </em>is bad on general demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">9th. The board of commissioners for the <em>Frederick Female Seminary </em>as such, being morel}\u2019\u2019 fiscal agents or trustees, arc' not strictly an integral part of the corporation, and as commissioners, they are only liable and responsible for all their misdoings or breaches of trusts upon their official and individual bond given to the State, by virtue of the 2nd section of the\u2019 charter aforesaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-6\">10th. The true and legal construction of the charier in this case, is for the court, and the true intentions of the legislature and the corporators must bo complied with, regardless of the letter of the acts: words must be so construed as shall best answer the iatentiou of the legislature,'and when the true intention can be discovered, it must prevail and be regarded, &amp;c.; and iu case of doubtful construction of the charter, the court will mould it according to reason and convenience to effectuate the true intention of the legislature and corporators.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-7\">11th. The supposed difficulty, <em>&amp;c., </em>springing out of the 8th and 10th sections of the charter, in relation to filling vacancies, &amp;c.j in the hoard of trustees and the board of commissioners, vanishes by adopting the principles and theories contained in the foregoing points, as the board of commissioners as such cease to exist, the moment they legally assume (he character of trustees, &amp;c.; hence, the necessity and the power of the governor to fill vacancies in the board of commissioners cease, because the board of commissioners cease to exist as such, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-8\">12th. The only charges made in said writ of <em>scire facias, </em>against the commissioners as acts of abuser, &amp;c., are, that they organised as a board of trustees of the <em>Frederick Female Seminary, </em>and kept and carried on a female school or seminary, before they had received from the lottery grants fifty thousand dollars, and while the buildings were unfinished and incomplete and unpaid for, and it is respectfully submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>whether such charges and acts are, according to the true construction of the charter, sufficient to work a forfeiture of the said charier and franchises under the pleadings in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">13th. The demurrers to the several pleas in bar filed in this case admit all the facts well pleaded, and it is expressly stated and set forth in said pleas, that all the preliminary stipulations and conditions contained in the 4th and 5th sections of said charter, necessary to be performed before the commissioners became aboard of trustees, &amp;c., by virtue of the provisions of the charter were fully and completely discharged and performed: the judgment of this court ought, therefore, to be for the appellants on the said demurrers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">14th. If there be nine corporators instead of five, as contended for by the appellees, a part of whom have been ousted and deprived of their rights and privileges by the others, the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>in the name of the Slate, esc., is not the legal appropriate remedy\u2019 in the' case, but the parties injured and aggrieved, should obtain a <em>mandamus, </em>to be issued for the purpose of trying the right and restoring them to their rights and privileges as corporators, it being the only legal and appropriate remedy in this State in such cases; as the writ of <em>quo ioarranto </em>has never been in use and practised under in <em>Maryland,.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-7\">15th. What acts of abuser or nonuser of corporators will be deemed and considered sufficient to work a forfeiture of a charter or corporate franchises must depend in a great measure upon the particular stipulations and conditions contained in the particular- charter under consideration, and but little, if any aid can be derived from the examination of adjudged cases upon the subject, and every case-must therefore depend for its determination upon its own particular circumstances, and the peculiar phraseology, conditions and requirements contained and embodied in the act of incorporation or charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-8\">16th. The facts stated and set forth in the pleas in bar of the- defendants, are legally sufficient to defeat the said <em>scire facias, </em>and as all the facts set forth in the pleas are admitted by the demurrers of the State, the judgment of the county courtis erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>17th. It does not appear in the record that the board of commissioners for the <em>Frederick Female Seminary </em>were, at the time of issuing the <em>adre facias, </em>a legal existing body politic and corporate by the name of the commissioners for the <em>Frederick Female Seminary, </em>capable of acting as a body politic: hence, considering the pleadings in the case, the judgment is erroneous, and ought to be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">18th. The judgment of the county court, tnade and entered up in this case, is manifestly erroneous, as not being warranted or authorised by the act of 1845, ch. 75, which authorised the issuing of this <em>scire </em>facias, as said act declares and provides that the judicial declaration, &amp;c., of the court, shall not, in fact, work a forfeiture of the charter, franchises and endowments of said seminary\u2014in other words, the judgment of the court shall not, in fact, be a judgment upon which any process can be issued, or any judicial action of the court taken to enforce it, &amp;c. The court are called upon to deliver their opinion upon ao abstract proposition, without, being permitted to give a judgment in the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">19th. The right to issue the <em>scire facias </em>in this case, and the court to act under it, is by virtue of the special delegated authority given by the act of 1845, ch. 75, and that authority, &amp;c., according to the repeated adjudications in this State upon similar questions, must be construed strictly; hence, the judgment of the court, <em>if for the Slate, </em>will leave the charter and franchises, &amp;c., to remain and continue precisely as they did at the time of issuing the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-7\">Samuel Tyler and F. A. Schley, for the State.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-8\"><em>First. </em>That the organizing and carrying on a school by the corporation in the buildings, <em>before all the funds </em>under the lottery grants were received, and before all the duties of commissioners under the charter were performed, was a violation of the charter, and such a violation as works <em>a forfeiture.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-9\">This proposition, though applicable to both breaches, has more particular .reference to the <em>third breach. </em>In discussing it, the appellee contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>1st. That corporate powers must be construed strictly, and must be exercised in <em>the manner </em>and <em>forms </em>of the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">2nd. That a corporation is created <em>upon trust, </em>and <em>all the terms </em>of its charter are <em>conditions </em>of the trust, and <em>if any one of them </em>be violated, it will work a forfeiture of the charter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\"><em>Second. </em>Upon the second breach, the appellee contended:</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-7\">That even admitting that the nine corporators who constitute tlje corporation, had a right to organise and carry on th.e .school in the buildings, before all the funds under the lottery grants were received, and before all the duties of commissioners under the charter .were performed; yet that <em>the three </em>had no such right, and that the exercise of such a power <em>by the three, </em>with <em>the permission of the nine, </em>was a violation of the .charter, and such a violation as works a forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">The appellee also made the following .objections to <em>th,e </em>pleas of the defendant, which they contended were defects <em>in substance, </em>and therefore reached by the general demurrers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-9\">1st. The <em>first plea </em>does not aver the receipt of <em>the whole </em>fund, to wit: the $&gt;50,000 <em>before </em>the seminary was put into operation as a seminary of learning, which was a <em>condition precedent, </em>and the performance of it ought therefore to have .been averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-10\">2nd. This plea professes to answer <em>both </em>breaches assigned in the writ, when in fact it answers <em>only one. </em>It answers the <em>second, </em>but not the <em>third, </em>breach. The <em>third </em>breach charges the acts of abuser as done by the <em>whole board. </em>To this charge the plea affords no answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-11\">The <em>second pipa </em>is to the entire writ, and is obnoxious to the same objections as the first.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-12\">The <em>writ </em>alleges, that the board of commissioners consist of <em>nine </em>corporators. This is a <em>material </em>allegation, and the defendant has <em>not </em>traversed it, and therefore <em>admits it.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-13\">The <em>third plea </em>is to both breaches, but it is only an answer to the charge against <em>the.whole </em>board. It does not notice, or i.n any way answer the charge <em>of permitting a minority to </em>act. This being bad in part, it is bad altogether.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-14\">The <em>fourth plea </em>is to the <em>third breach only, </em>and raises the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>question, and none other, of the necessity of the commissioners receiving the whole fond of $50,000, before the seminary could go into operation, according to the letter and intention of the charter. Now, even admitting this to be a good answer to the <em>third breach, </em>to which alone it is pleaded, yet not being an answer to the <em>whole writ, </em>but only to <em>one </em>of the breaches, it follows, that if the other breach be for the appellee., judgment must be for the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\"><em>Third. </em>The judgment below was properly a judgment of seizure and restitution.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b405-6\">Magrtjder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag3\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">It was made know to the General Assembly, at its December session 1839, that citizens of <em>Frederick </em>were attempting to establish a female seminary in that city, but that individual contributions were found to be insufficient for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">What the memorialists aslced, it is not stated . What the General Assembly upon this representation being made to it thought proper to do for this Seminary, will be seen in the act passed during that session, entitled, \u201cAn act <em>to aid </em>in the establishment of a Female Seminary in the city of <em>Frederick.'\u2019'\u2019</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">This law names four persons, and invests them with authority to raise $20,000 by a scheme or schemes of a lottery. These four persons are styled commissioners, and in some parts of the law, a board of commissioners. To them is given authority to sell the schemes or the tickets and apply the proceeds of sale towards defraying the expenses of the building, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">These commissioners are also the persons to purchase the ground for this institution, and to build such houses, make such inclosures or improvements as they or a majority of them shall deem necessary for a female academy, and the property was to be conveyed to them in trust, &lt;fcc.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">This seemed to be every thing the legislature offered to do for the seminary until the ground was purchased and paid for and the buildings or other improvements were erected. When all this was done, a body corporate was to be brought into ex - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>istence to be named. \u201c The trustees of the <em>Frederick Female </em>Seminary,\u201d to sue and to be sued by that name, to have its corporate seal, and to discharge the duties which this law required of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">It is further provided, that those who are the commissioners at the time when the ground is purchased and paid for, and the buildings erected, shall be the board of trustees, with the power of filling, themselves, any vacancies that may occur. Vacancies in the board of commissioners are to be filled by the governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Now this board of trustees when it comes into being, is unquestionably a body corporate. But it is insisted that the same act of Assembly creates another body politic, to continue such until and only until, the board of trustees have legal existence. These two bodies politic, we are told, cannot exist at the same time, the existence of the one must terminate, when that of the other commences, and thus the conclusion is arrived at, that there could be no board of trustees to open the school, while any of the duties of the board of commissioners remained to be performed, such as occasionally paying over the proceeds of another lottery grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We do not think so. The General Assembly, no doubt might have created another, and more than one other, corporate body, and might have assigned to each of them some of the .duties which it was thought proper to require of the board of trustees. It might have constituted a corporate body <em>in </em>perpetuum, with no power but to manage the finances of the institution and others for other purposes. The legislature might have incorporated those commissioners <em>eo nomine, </em>or by any other name, with such powers as it chose to confer upon that corporation, and then have made the same individuals a board of trustees, with corporate powers, and have brought them into existence at the same moment, and given to each <em>immortality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">But it was deemed expedient not to have a corporate body, until there was a school tobe opened, but to have commissioners, having it is thought no corporate name, or existence, te per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>form all the duties which were imposed upon them for the present and for an indefinite time.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">We are not able to discover when or how these commissioners were incorporated for fiscal purposes, and certainly cannot learn that an individual of one board who is a member of the one, may not at the same time be a member of the other, or that the two boards cannot be in existence at the same time, and for any period of time, if the legislature so willed it. To the faithful performance of any of the duties assigned to the commissioners a corporate existence was not at all necessary. All the duties required of them, might have be\u00e9n performed by a single individual, as well as by a corporate body, and if a bond is required, os one was of the board of commissioners, then for any omissions of duty or wrongful and injurious acts, the bond, and not the charier of a body, never perhaps to be brought into existence, would be answerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">.But if the view which we have taken of this whole subject be correct, it is quite immaterial, whether these commissioners be a corporation, or, it may be, what is called a <em>quasi </em>corporation. An act of incorporation would neither enlarge nor lessen theirpowers, and the period of their existence as commissioners, would in either event, be determined by the act of Assembly, if it had fixed any period; or as it has not, with the duties, for the performance of which, the board was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">It is said, that be these commissioners incorporated or not, in fact, they must be regarded in this proceeding, as a body politic. It would seem, however, to be as necessary to let us have a sight of the charter, as it was in the case of <em>Agnew against The Bank of Gettysburg, 2 H. &amp; </em>G., 478. Without inspecting it, how are we to determine, that the body corporate (if it be a body corporate,) has done in its corporate character, any thing which it ought not to have done. It is here assumed, that the various acts of Assembly, set forth in the <em>scire facias, </em>do not show to us the corporate duties, or even corporate existence of this board.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">The defendants, we are told, have admitted, that they are a corporate body, by appearing and pleading. It is manifest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>however, that the individuals could not deny that they constituted the board, which was summoned to appear, and answer to the charges made against that board.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">But what were their powers, and duties, and responsibilities as a board of commissioners? Again, it would seem to be somewhat difficult to discover who are the defendants, how many, or how few of them there are. It is supposed that there were either five or nine, but the record does not tell us any thing at all satisfactory, in regard thereto. The <em>scire facias </em>directs the sheriff, to make known to \u201c the said board of commissioners,\u201d (without giving us the names or numbers of them,) to appear and show cause, why, &amp;o. The sheriff\u2019s return is, \u201cmade known.\u201d Thereupon, the record proceeds: \u201cAnd the said board of commissioner's for the said <em>Frederick Seminary, </em>being, &amp;c., forwarned, now here come by <em>Joseph M. Palmer, </em>their attorney.\u201d Some persons then must be <em>Mr. Palmer's </em>clients, and we necessarily suppose that he has more than one. But the sheriff alone can tell us to whom he gave the notice', and he tells us nothing more than that he gave the notice to those who, in liis judgment, were \u201cthe commissioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Here in.court, one great matter in controversy seems to be, for how many people <em>Mr. Palmer </em>appears. For nine, says one of the parties litigant, while the other is equally positive that there are but five. If we turn to the acts of Assembly to instruct us, it would appear from them, that there were some ten or twelve of these commissioners'. In answer, however, to this, as well as to some other statements we have heard about acts of Assembly, we may be (old of the remarks of <em>Chancellor Hanson,- </em>(4 <em>Har. and McHenry, p. </em>10,) that \u201cevery allegation or matter, affirmed in a preamble to an act or resolution of the legislature, shall not be considered as incontrovertible. And that a man may conceal from the legislature facts, which if known to them, might have defeated his application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">We cannot take it for granted, that all who possibly may cai m to be, really are clients of <em>Mr. Palmer. </em>1st. Because there were but five, who, according to the act of <em>1845, </em>were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>parties, affirming and denying, and afterwards, consenting to a reference of the matters in issue, to the court; and 2ndly. Because of the four persons, about whom the controversy arises, two of them appeared as counsel against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">There is some other matter which we notice in this record, and which may have some Connection with this controversy. This institution, it seems, was so1 fortunate, as to' obtain a second lottery grant,-which it is taken for granted, will be worth to it $30,000. This, however, was not obtained from the legislature. It is a <em>constitutional </em>grant. The same amendment of the constitution, which grants this to this seminary, expressly directs, that the lottery commissioners, as they shall \u201cfrom time to time\u201d raise said sum, shall pay the same over to \u201c the said board of commissioners for the <em>Frederick Female </em>Seminary.\u201d No one can question* that \u201cthe said board\u201d consisted but of five individuals, and a board consisting of a greater number, it would seem, can have no title to the proceeds of this (the second) lottery grant, without another change of the constitution-of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In this change of the constitution, we are furnished with an answer to all that has been-said, in order to satisfy us, that the two boards cannot have a cotemporaneous existence. It is here required, that they shall have existence at the same time; the board of trustees to receive and apply as directed, the $20',000, all of which is to be paid to it by the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">It is made a question, what is correctly pleaded in this case? We have come to the conclusion, that the defendants have a right to insist, (the demurrer being- a general demurrer,) not that the whole matter, suggested in the breaches is untrue, but that notwithstanding some of the suggestions, there is no ground for this proceeding, or for the complaint against the board of commissioners, that the school was opened, as the latter was the act of the board of trustees, determined upon and carried into execution by the trustees, after the property had beed purchased and paid fot, and the buildings erected. These facts, (the purchase and payment of the money, and erection of the buildings,) k is thoyght the demurrer admits; and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>arises the question, whether the board of trustees could come into being, and act in that character, before the money to arise from the lottery grant was, (as it has not been,) received? This whole sum, it is said, must be raised and paid over to the trustees, before they can consistently with the charter, open the school, or have existence as a board of trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">A conclusive answer, it is believed, will be found to this, in the 5th section of the act of 1839, which tells us when the board of commissioners shall become a board of trustees, and in this respect, certainly, the charter has never been changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">If, when they had the power to open the school, there were females ready to enter it, and proper persons could be had to take charge of it, why should its doors be closed any longer?' Their charter nowhere requires it.,</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Would an excuse for this <em>non user </em>be found in the inability of the lottery grant, to yield all it promised ? It might have been of advantage to the institution to have this fund; for the want of it the trustees might not have been enabled to employ teachers, and therefore could not have opened the school. But we are here to assume, that able professors could be had, and that there were scholars ready to enter the school; and the question is put to us, whence the authority of the trustees to open the school, until the $20,000 were paid over to them ? Their authority is to be found in their charter and office, which made it their duty to open the school as soon as they possibly could, after the building was ready to receive students, and the lot paid for. Could the mere grant of a lottery scheme have the effect to delay opening the school ? We are required here to believe, that although the buildings were all of them in a state of preparation, the library procured, the philosophical apparatus purchased, the ablest professors ready to enter upon their duties, students demanding admittance, and although too this institution was enriched by the contributions of individuals, yet the buildings must be unoccupied, the professors remain unemployed, the children uneducated, and all the wealth of the institution of no value to it until a lottery grant could be made to yield $30,000. Surely laws are not to be so interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>But the demurrer brings to ournotice the objections to the <em>scire facias, </em>and perhaps it is needless <em>to </em>look <em>at anything but </em>this writ, and the act of Assembly, which authorized the issuing of it. This act of Assembly is a <em>charter </em>granted to the attorney general, and the inquiry now is whether in issuing this writ he was not guilty of an abuser or usurpation ?</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Why is he required by the act of 1845 to institute proceedings against the board of commissioners? Because two of the commissioners (their names given) had represented to the General Assembly that the charter or franchises of the said institution had been forfeited by certain acts of three of the commissioners, (their names also given,) which acts have been denied by those three commissioners, \u201cand by mutual <em>consent of </em>the said parties, it has been agreed that a <em>scire facias </em>be issued to try the alleged forfeiture.\u201d The inquiry to be made is, whether the charter or corporate powers and franchises of said board of commissioners ought, \u201cby reason of abuses of such powers and franchises, to be vacated or annulled.\u201d If the acts of said commissioners, or a majority of them shall be judicially declared to amount to a forfeiture of their charter and franchises, all the property, effects and endowments, and all grants heretofore made by the General Assembly, shall vest in <em>A. B. Hanson, </em>and the eight others \u201cas commissioners and trustees of the <em>Frederick Female Seminary, </em>in. the manner in which the said property and franchises are now vested in the original commissioners and trustees by the act of 1839, and the several supplements thereto, who shall be incorporated by said name, and shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and obligations conferred upon the said original commissioners and trustees by the last said act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In the remarks which have already been made, will be found reasons for the opinion of the court, that the act of Assembly does not authorise this proceeding. It is true, as we have been frequently reminded in the course of this argument, that corporations <em>are mere </em>creatures of the law, and must not violate the conditions upon which they are incorporated. But still legal causes must be stated, and the proceeding must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u25a0warranted by the law which directs it. For every imaginable breach the law does not design that the charter of a corporation must be revoked, <em>Stephens, </em>in his <em>Commentaries </em>on the laws of <em>England, </em>tells us, that \u201cthe exertion of this act of law for the purpose of the State, in the reigns of <em>King Charles </em>and <em>King James </em>the <em>Second, </em>particularly by revoking the charter of the city of <em>London, </em>gave great and just offence, though perhaps in strictness of law, the proceedings in most of the eases that occurred were sufficiently regular\u201d and (by way of warning us of the consequence, but too frequently, of a wanton or even unnecessary exercise of power,)' he adds, \u201cbut the judgment against the charter of <em>London </em>was reversed by act of Parliament after the revolution; and by the same statute it is enacted, that the franchises of the city of <em>London </em>shall never more be forfeited for any cause whatever.\u201d Hence it is that the sovereign authority reserves to itself the right to determine, not only when such proceedings shall be instituted, but also when violations of a charter shall be overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">It is the opinion of the court, that the act of 1845, ch. 75, did not authorize any proceeding against the person spoken .of as additional commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">It is also the opinion of the court, that the act just mentioned only authorized charges of abuse of franchises, and did not authorize any inquiries touching the breaches before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The court is not authorized by any thing to be found in this Record to say that the hoard of trustees was not in being, .and acting in that character in appointing the professor and opening the school. The court can discover in the record, pothing which \\y.ould warrant it in deciding, that the board in opening the school, was not acting up to the end and design for which it was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, NO PROCEDENDO,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
