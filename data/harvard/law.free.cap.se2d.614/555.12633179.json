Eley following a bench trial in Hertford County District Court. Plaintiff's claims for conversion and unfair and deceptive trade practices were based on defendant's otherwise lawful repossession of plaintiff's truck, which contained a load of watermelons belonging to plaintiff. After defendant caused plaintiff's truck to be repossessed, the melons, which were still in the truck bed, quickly spoiled in the summer heat, rendering them valueless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, defendant argues that it is not liable for conversion because it did not engage in the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership over plaintiff's watermelons to the exclusion of plaintiff's rights. It also argues that it did not commit an unfair and deceptive trade practice under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (2003). Because we find that competent evidence exists to support the trial court's findings of fact and those findings are sufficient to establish conversion and unfair and deceptive trade practices, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"`It is well settled in this jurisdiction that when the trial court sits without a jury, the standard of review on appeal is whether there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were proper in light of such facts.'\"\n   <em>\n    Keel v.

Plaintiff was the owner of a 1995 Ford F150 pick-up truck that she had purchased through a loan from defendant, using the truck as collateral. In the summer of 2002, plaintiff missed two consecutive payments on the loan, and defendant made repossession arrangements with Carolina Repossessions. At approximately 4:00 a.m. on 29 July 2002, employees of Carolina Repossessions, Roger Pinkham and his brother, arrived at plaintiff's residence and began to hitch plaintiff's pick-up truck to their tow truck. Plaintiff heard them and went outside to investigate. When she requested to see the paperwork related to the repossession, one of the men briefly showed it to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff explained to Pinkham that she was not contesting the repossession of the truck, but that she was concerned about the 130 watermelons in the truck bed. She had purchased and loaded them into the truck on the previous day and had planned to drive them to Maryland for re-sale. In addition to the watermelons, the truck also contained some other personal items belonging to plaintiff, including a coat, an ice chest, and some children's toys. Plaintiff asked Pinkham if she could unload her melons and other personal property before he towed the truck. Pinkham refused, telling her he was in a hurry because he had to get to his regular job. Pinkham also refused to allow plaintiff to deliver the truck herself later that morning after she had had time to unload the melons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff called defendant's office at about 8:00 a.m. the same morning and spoke to defendant's employee, Joyce White. When plaintiff asked White if she could retrieve her watermelons out of the repossessed truck, White replied, \"What truck?\" Fearing that the melons would quickly spoil in the summer heat, plaintiff, on the same day, filed a complaint alleging conversion in the Hertford County Small Claims Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's evidence tended to show that on Wednesday, 31 July 2002, two days after the repossession, one of defendant's employees called plaintiff and asked her to bring her truck key to defendant's office, but plaintiff refused. White testified that it was not defendant's practice to allow public access to the lot where repossessed items were kept; rather, defendant usually sent an employee to the lot to gather up personal property left in repossessed vehicles and bring it to defendant's office for the owners to collect. White noted that plaintiff's load of watermelons created an unusual situation, and defendant had asked plaintiff to furnish her truck keys so that defendant could drive the truck to its office and allow plaintiff to unload it there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant then mailed plaintiff a letter, stating, \"The watermelons are rotting and the smell is polluting the storage lot. If something is not done with them by 12:00 p.m., Friday, August 2, 2002, we will have to hire someone to dispose of them for us and the fee will be charged to your account.\" Although the post office attempted to deliver this letter to plaintiff, she never received it, and it was later returned to defendant's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On Thursday, 1 August 2002, the day after defendant mailed the letter, defendant called plaintiff again and asked her to come retrieve her watermelons from the repossessed truck because they were spoiling and creating a mess. Plaintiff informed defendant that since the melons were rotten, she no longer wanted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The small claims court dismissed plaintiff's conversion claim in a judgment dated 19 August 2002. Plaintiff filed a timely appeal to the Hertford County District Court. Following a bench trial, the district court entered an order on 12 November 2003, concluding that defendant had converted plaintiff's property and committed an unfair and deceptive trade practice under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1. The order awarded damages in the amount of $455.00, the value of the watermelons. These damages were then trebled in accordance with North Carolina's unfair and deceptive trade practice statute, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-16 (2003), for a total liability of $1,365.00. The court also awarded plaintiff $1,562.50 in attorneys' fees, under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-16.1 (2003). Defendant has appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"`Conversion is defined as: (1) the unauthorized assumption and exercise of the right of ownership; (2) over the goods or personal property; (3) of another; (4) to the exclusion of the rights of the true owner.'\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Graham v.

In support of this contention, defendant asserts (1) that plaintiff had an opportunity to remove the watermelons before the repossession and (2) that the loss of the watermelons was due to plaintiff's subsequent failure to supply defendant with her truck key.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With regard to the first assertion, defendant argues that there is no competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that defendant's agent, Carolina Repossessions, failed to give plaintiff \"a reasonable amount of time to unload her watermelons during the repossession.\" We disagree. Plaintiff testified specifically that she requested an opportunity to remove her melons from the truck at the time of repossession and that her request was refused. Also, plaintiff's brother testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A. .... I got up and went to the door, and [plaintiff] was talking to two men, and one of them was starting hooking up the truck, and I asked her what they were doing. She said, \"They came to get the truck.\" I said, \"Well, are they gonna let you get the watermelons off?\" and while she was standing talking to them, I went back to get dressed to come back, and when I got back out there they had the\n   truck loaded up going down the lane throwing the watermelons all in the lane. That's when I told her to call the police department and see if they knew anything about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. How long would you say it took you to go back and get dressed and come back out?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Two to three minutes....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Q. What did - what did Ms. Eley say when you came back and - and asked her about the watermelons?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. She said they'd got - they'd gone on down the lane, and that's when I told her to call the police. They were supposed to give you time to get your property out of there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Even Mr. Pinkham, one of the repossessors, testified that \"when I got the truck turned around to leave, [plaintiff] did say that she wanted to get her belongings out of the truck, and I told her that if she wanted to get her belongings she needed to go ahead and get them because I did have to get back to Washington, and after about 15 minutes of being there, I figured that had been enough time for her to get the belongings, so I left. I did have other things to do, and so I pulled out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The record thus contains competent evidence allowing the trial court to find that plaintiff was not allowed a reasonable time to unload her 130 watermelons. Although it is arguable that the record might also support a finding that plaintiff did have time to unload her melons, but failed to do so, the trial court's finding of fact otherwise is supported by ample evidence and is, therefore, binding on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Hensgen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8521061\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/53/331/#p335\">\n    53 N.C.App. at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=280%20S.E.2d%20766\">\n    280 S.E.2d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With regard to defendant's second assertion regarding plaintiff's failure to give defendant her truck keys, the trial court made the following pertinent findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   9. Ms. Eley contacted Ms. White, of Mid-East Acceptance, on the morning of July 29, 2003 to inquire as to the location of her truck so she could retrieve her watermelons. Ms. White's reply was \"What truck?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   10. Mid-East Acceptance was the bailee of Ms. Eley's personal property and had an obligation to protect this collateral from harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   11. When Mid-East Acceptance contacted Ms. Eley on Juy [sic] 31st to tell her where her truck was located the watermelons were already decomposing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   12. Mid-East Acceptance placed a condition on the return of Ms. Eley's property by requiring her to bring them the vehicle ignition key prior to that return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Since defendant has not assigned error to these findings of fact, they are binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    In re Beasley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9379756\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/147/399/#p405\">\n    147 N.C.App. 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20S.E.2d%20643\">\n    555 S.E.2d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 647 (2001). These findings of fact establish that the loss was not due to plaintiff's failure to deliver the truck key because the request for the key came too late to preserve the watermelons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Taken together, all of these facts combine to support the inference that defendant assumed and exercised the right of ownership over plaintiff's watermelons without her permission, to the exclusion of her own rightful ownership interest. More colloquially, as plaintiff put it, \"It was too hot. The melons was already there a week. The melons were spoiled. They wouldn't do me any good. They were their melons. They took the truck, they took the melons. They were their melons then.\" The trial court, therefore, did not err in entering judgment in favor of plaintiff on her claim for conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant next contends that the trial court erred by concluding that defendant's actions amounted to an unfair and deceptive trade practice under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1. A practice violates N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 if it is \"`(1) an unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) in or affecting commerce, and (3) which proximately caused injury to plaintiffs.'\"\n   <em>\n    Lake Mary Ltd.

Defendant challenges this award on the ground that there was insufficient evidence of the value of the watermelons. Specifically, defendant contends that plaintiff's oral testimony as to the value of the watermelons is \"not even adequate in the most basic business setting, and is woefully inadequate in a court of law.\" To the\n   contrary, it is well-settled in this state that \"the opinion of a property owner is\n   <em>\n    competent evidence\n   </em>\n   as to the value of such property.\"\n   <em>\n    Compton v.

Moreover, since we have upheld the trial court's conclusion that defendant committed an unfair and deceptive trade practice under Chapter 75, we also affirm the trebling of the $455.00 to $1,365.00 in accordance with N.C.

Plaintiff did not, however, file an appellant's brief on this issue, but rather included her discussion in her appellee's brief. Because this argument is not an alternative basis for upholding the trial court's order, N.C.R.App. P. 10(d), but rather asks this Court to reverse the order in part, plaintiff was required to file a separate appellant's brief.
