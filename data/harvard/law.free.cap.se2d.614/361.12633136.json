Gillespie asked Hairston to help him rob \"some Mexicans\" living at 1231-B Gholson Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Hairston agreed, retrieved his gun, and got into a vehicle with Gillespie. Steven Gaines (Gaines) and defendant were already in the vehicle. Defendant was armed with an assault rifle. The four men planned the robbery as they drove to the home of defendant's aunt, where they switched vehicles, getting into defendant's aunt's vehicle to drive to pick up Kenyon Grooms (Grooms).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Grooms got into the driver's seat, and defendant directed him to an apartment complex on Gholson Street. At the apartment complex, Hairston, Gaines, Gillespie and defendant got out of the vehicle and approached apartment 1231-B (the apartment). Gaines went toward the rear of the apartment. Hairston walked away, abandoning the robbery. Grooms stayed in the car. Defendant, carrying the assault rifle, and Gillespie, armed with a nine millimeter gun, entered the apartment. Defendant shot Noyola and Gillespie shot a six-year-old girl. Hearing gunshots, Grooms started the car and drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer T.G. Brown (Officer Brown) of the Winston-Salem Police Department responded to a telephone call reporting gunfire. Officer Brown found two Hispanic women, Maria Santos (Santos) and Justina Dominguez (Dominguez), in the apartment. The two women were crying and were unable to speak English. Officer Brown found Noyola still breathing, but Noyola died before emergency medical personnel arrived. Officer Brown found the body of the six-year-old girl on the floor near the entrance to a bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Officer Rafael Barros (Officer Barros) of the Winston-Salem Police Department arrived approximately ten minutes after Officer Brown. Officer Barros spoke fluent Spanish. He found Santos and Dominguez in one of the bedrooms. Santos, who was the mother of the six-year old girl, reported that three black men had entered the apartment through the front door, demanded money, shot Noyola, shot the six-year old girl, and left the scene. Dominguez, who was Noyola's wife, said that she had been in a bedroom with her baby when one of the intruders kicked the door open and ripped a gold chain from her neck. She heard gunshots but she never left the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Barros showed a photographic lineup to Santos and Dominguez on 28 January 1998. Officer Barros testified that Santos identified Gillespie as the man who shot Santos's daughter; but Officer Barros admitted\n   that Santos was not positive in her identification. Dominguez did not identify Gillespie, and neither woman identified defendant. Santos and Dominguez later returned to Mexico and refused to return for defendant's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to trial, the trial court ruled that the statements made by Santos and Dominguez at the scene and during the photographic lineup would be admissible under the excited utterance exception and the residual exception to the hearsay rule respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At trial, in addition to Officer Barros testifying as to the statements made by Santos and Domiguez, Hairston and Grooms testified as witnesses for the State. Both men admitted their participation in the robbery. Each testified that defendant, armed with an assault rifle, entered the apartment with Gillespie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Patrick Lantz (Dr. Lantz) also testified for the State. Dr. Lantz conducted autopsies on both Noyola and the six-year-old girl. He testified that the entrance and exit wounds, and the multiple fragments found in Noyola's abdomen were characteristic of being from a high-powered rifle. The six-year-old girl's wounds were consistent with a bullet from a nine millimeter gun or other medium caliber gun, not an assault rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant testified that he had gone with the others to the apartment to sell an assault rifle to Noyola as payment for drugs. Defendant further testified that when he entered the apartment, Noyola pulled out a gun, and fired a shot toward defendant's head. Defendant \"tensed up\" and accidentally pulled the trigger of the rifle. Noyola dropped his gun and fell. Defendant testified that shots were fired in the apartment and that he and Gillespie fled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder, and defendant was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Defendant appealed to this Court and argued in part that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements made by Dominguez and Santos as conveyed through the testimony of Officer Barros. Our Court concluded that because the statements by Santos and Dominguez \"were made only twenty minutes after the shootings and the statements related to the startling events at issue, the testimony was properly admitted pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 803(2)\" as an excited utterance.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We further concluded that the trial court had properly \"determined that the admission of Santos'[s] identification would serve the interest of justice\" and that the trial court had properly admitted the photographic identification under N.C.

However, the twenty minutes between the shootings and Officer Barros's arrival provided enough time for Santos and Dominguez to reflect on the shootings before they conversed with Officer Barros. Having more time to reflect makes it more probable that an objective witness, when subsequently questioned by the police, \"would reasonably believe ... that the statement would be available for use at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    See Sutton,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20S.E.2d%20270\">\n    609 S.E.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Furthermore, unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Forrest,\n   </em>\n   the witnesses in the present case were not \"rescued\" by Officer Barros.

In the present case, the challenged statements were not given during the \"criminal incident itself,\" but rather after the apartment had been secured and the threat of danger to Santos and Dominguez was no longer immediate. Officer Barros arrived twenty minutes after the shootings, and ten minutes after the first police officer arrived on the scene. Officer Barros's primary focus would have been to investigate the crime and he would have had \"an eye toward trial\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   when he questioned Santos and Dominguez.\n   <em>\n    See Sutton,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20S.E.2d%20270\">\n    609 S.E.2d at 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under these facts, Officer Barros's questioning of Santos and Dominguez amounted to interrogation, and Santos and Dominguez reasonably believed that their statements would be used prosecutorially. Thus, the challenged statements were testimonial. Since it is undisputed that both Santos and Dominguez were unavailable and that defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine either declarant, defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by the admission of their statements through Officer Barros's testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   However, a violation of defendant's confrontation rights does not necessarily result in a new trial. \"A violation of the defendant's rights under the Constitution of the United States is prejudicial unless the appellate court finds that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The burden is upon the State to demonstrate, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error was harmless.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(b) (2003). \"[T]he presence of overwhelming evidence of guilt may render error of constitutional dimension harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Autry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2568444\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/392/#p400\">\n    321 N.C. 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20S.E.2d%20341\">\n    364 S.E.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (1988). In the present case, the evidence of defendant's guilt, even without considering the statements made by Santos and Dominguez, is overwhelming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant argues that the statements made by Santos and Dominguez were prejudicial in that they provided the only evidence of an attempted robbery. However, two of the State's witnesses, Hairston and Grooms, testified that they, along with defendant, Gillespie and Gaines, were involved in a plan to rob Noyola. Specifically, Hairston testified that on 27 January 1998, Gillespie had told Hairston that Gillespie had a \"lick,\" or a robbery, that he wanted Hairston to help him commit. Hairston further testified that he agreed to participate, grabbed his gun, and went with Gillespie to the vehicle where defendant and Gaines were waiting. Hairston stated that the men discussed the robbery on their way to defendant's aunt's house, but that the robbery had been defendant's and Gillespie's idea. Hairston further testified that defendant not only participated in the planning of the robbery, but also provided the vehicle and the directions to the apartment. Hairston testified that when they arrived at the apartment, Gaines walked toward the back of the building and Hairston, defendant and Gillespie approached the apartment from the front.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Grooms testified that he agreed to drive the car for a \"lick\" that Gillespie wanted to commit. Grooms did not want to drive his vehicle, so Gillespie talked to defendant and then asked Grooms if Grooms would mind driving defendant's aunt's vehicle. Like Hairston, Grooms testified that Gaines went behind the apartment building, and that defendant, Hairston, and Gillespie approached from the front. Both Hairston and Grooms testified that defendant was armed with an assault rifle and that Gillespie had a nine millimeter gun when they entered the apartment. Contrary to defendant's argument, the testimony of Hairston and Grooms amply demonstrates that defendant intended to commit a robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Furthermore, other evidence presented at trial supports the jury's guilty verdict. Dr. Lantz testified that Noyola's wounds were consistent with a high-velocity bullet from a rifle, and that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The six-year-old girl's wounds were consistent with a bullet from a nine millimeter gun. Defendant's testimony corroborated the testimony of the other witnesses in that defendant admitted that he was carrying an assault rifle into the apartment, and that Noyola fell after defendant pulled the rifle's trigger. The sum of this evidence supports defendant's guilt to the extent that the trial court's error in admitting the testimonial hearsay of Santos and Dominguez was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant also argues that Santos's identification of Gillespie from the photographic lineup was testimonial because it was made in response to police questioning the day after the killings. We agree. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Lewis,\n   </em>\n   we held out-of-court identifications\n   from photographic lineups to be testimonial, stating:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In substance, the information obtained from a photo line-up is not very different from other evidence that is classified as testimonial under\n   <em>\n    Crawford.\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the photo line-up is very similar to the ex parte and extra-judicial examinations by government officials which\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   makes clear the Sixth Amendment was meant to address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Lewis,\n   </em>\n   166 N.C.App. at ___,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=603%20S.E.2d%20559\">\n    603 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   563 (citing\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at 51-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. at 1364-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d at 192-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Moreover, as a photographic lineup has the clear purpose of collecting evidence for prosecution and a person being faced with a photographic lineup must know that his or her identification will be used for prosecution, there is not the same factual question as to whether such an identification is testimonial as discussed above. Thus, the admission of the photographic lineup identification when Santos was not available to testify and defendant did not have the opportunity to confront Santos about this identification did violate defendant's right to confront his accuser under the Sixth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, again the State demonstrates that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The State asserts that even though Officer Barros testified that Santos identified a photograph of Gillespie as being the person who shot her daughter, this evidence \"did not directly implicate defendant for the murder of Feliciano Noyola.\" This evidence may have prejudiced defendant in that it corroborated the testimony of Hairston and Grooms, showing that Gillespie was present in the apartment when the shooting occurred. However, defendant himself testified that Gillespie was present with him and that shots were fired in the apartment. Also, the facts that neither Santos nor Dominguez identified defendant, and that defendant was convicted for Noyola's murder and not for the murder of the six-year-old girl, indicate that the admission of this identification was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Cf.
