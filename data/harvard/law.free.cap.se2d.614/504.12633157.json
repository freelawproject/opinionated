On 18 December 2000, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all claims. All defendants except defendants O'Brien and Brooks also moved for summary judgment. After a hearing on the respective summary judgment motions, the trial court on 14 December 2001 entered summary judgment for plaintiffs on all issues. The trial court further stayed operation and enforcement of the order pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants filed timely notice of appeal from the trial court's order. On 16 September 2003, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court's order.\n   <em>\n    N.C. Sch. Bds. Ass'n v.

The Court of Appeals' opinion may be broken down into five discrete sections. The Court of Appeals first reversed the trial court's conclusion that the General Assembly's plan prescribed in N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 115C-457.1 through - 457.3 for distributing the money collected pursuant to Article IX, Section 7 is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals noted that Article IX, Section 7 is not self-executing and requires legislation to provide for its enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court of Appeals held that the \"General Assembly, by enacting Article 31A of Chapter 115C, has properly legislated the details necessary to effectuate the general proposition laid down by Article IX, Section 7 that the clear proceeds of civil penalties be set aside and used exclusively for the support of our State's public schools\" and that the provisions of the statutes were in keeping with the framers' intent manifested by Article IX, Section 7.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court of Appeals next considered the trial court's ruling that all the payments to state agencies referenced in plaintiffs' complaint are to be distributed to the public schools pursuant to Article IX, Section 7. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling with respect to the following payments: (i) payments collected by the Department of Transportation from owners of overweight vehicles pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118, and (ii) payments collected by the Department of Transportation for lapses in insurance coverage pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-309.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 268-70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 428-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's holding that the following payments are subject to Article IX, Section 7:(i) payments collected by the Department of Revenue for failure to comply with regulatory or statutory tax provisions pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 105-113.89, -163.15, -163.41, -164.14, -231, and -236; (ii) payments collected by the Employment Security Commission from employers for overdue contributions to the unemployment insurance fund, late filing of wage reports, and tendering a worthless check pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 96-10(a), (g), and (h); (iii) payments collected by the boards of trustees of the Consolidated University of North Carolina campuses for violation of ordinances regulating traffic, parking, and vehicle registration pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-44.4(h); (iv) payments collected by the boards of trustees of the Consolidated University of North Carolina campuses for loss, damage, or late return of materials borrowed from university libraries pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-33; (v) payments collected by the Department of Revenue from persons dealing in unauthorized substances pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 105-113.105 through -113.113; and (vi) payments collected by state agencies and licensing boards for licensees' failure to comply in a timely manner with licensing requirements pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 87-22, 87-44, 88B-6 and -21, and 84-34.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270-78, 282-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 430-34, 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In making these determinations, the Court of Appeals followed this Court's precedent by employing an analysis which classifies each of these payments as either punitive, in which case the payment accrues to the public schools under Article IX, Section 7, or remedial, in which case it remains under the dominion of the collecting agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266-68,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 427-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court of Appeals also considered whether monies paid by an environmental violator to perform or to fund a third party's performance of a Supplemental Environmental\n   Project (\"SEP\") in lieu of paying a civil penalty to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (\"DENR\") pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 143-215.6A, -215.114A, and -215.3(a)(9) were subject to Article IX, Section 7.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 278-81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 434-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court of Appeals held that \"payments by an environmental violator, including [a specific violator for whom payments are in question], to support a SEP as part of a settlement agreement are `still paid because of a civil penalty assessed against the [environmental violator]' and as such are punitive in nature and therefore subject to Article IX, Section 7.\"\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Acknowledging the trial court's holding that these payments are within the clear purview of Article IX, Section 7, the Court of Appeals nevertheless held that monies raised from school systems' own penalties should not be returned to those same school systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 281-82,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 436-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals reasoned that were the schools permitted to utilize the funds remitted by them as civil penalties, \"the offending unit will receive back from the School Technology Fund a portion of the fine or penalty assessed against the unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 282,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals concluded that such a reversion violated the public policy of this State that a malfeasor not be permitted to benefit from his own bad acts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result the Court of Appeals held that money paid by the schools as civil penalties should remain with the collecting State agency.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Finally, the Court of Appeals considered the trial court's conclusion that the three-year statute of limitations in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1-52 should apply to plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 283-84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 437-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants contended that this case is governed by N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1-54(2), which provides for a one-year statute of limitations. The Court of Appeals reasoned that, although appellate courts have held that section 1-54(2) applies to actions to collect civil penalties and forfeitures, this action is not to collect unpaid penalties but instead to recover for public schools the penalties already collected by the various State agencies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 284,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court on this issue, holding that \"the trial court correctly applied the three-year limitations period provided in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1-52 (2001) for `an action ... [u]pon a liability created by statute' or `[a]gainst a public officer, for a trespass, under color of his office.'\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1-52 (2001)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals concluded that payments collected by the Department of Transportation pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) from owners of vehicles which exceed axle-weight limits are not within the purview of Article IX, Section 7 and should remain with the collecting agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The dissenting judge concurred with the majority's analysis classifying payments as remedial or punitive, but would have held that \"[t]he weight penalties collected pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-118(e) are remedial in nature and, therefore, do not belong to the public schools\" on the basis that they are \"intended to compensate the state for the deterioration of its highways due to operation of overweight vehicles thereon and are thus remedial in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 286,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The dissenting judge also opined that penalties paid by local school boards to state agencies should be remitted to the Civil Penalty Fund pursuant to Article IX, Section 7.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 287,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The dissenting judge would apply the same case-by-case remedial/punitive analysis to payments made by school systems as to payments by other persons or entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 288,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, under the Rules of Appellate Procedure, defendants have abandoned the assignment of error relative to the proper statute of limitations, and this Court will not consider it. N.C.

Law Governing Proper Disposition of Payments Made to State Agencies and Claimed by Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs and defendants each except to certain determinations by the Court of Appeals that payments made to the various state agencies do or do not fall within the purview of Article IX, Section 7. All parties agree as to the basic precedent which governs this Court's consideration of these payments. The parties' arguments, however, diverge on how this precedent should be applied in this case. Plaintiffs argue that the precedents hold that any civil penalties paid for violation of a penal law of the State and accruing to the State are necessarily punitive and must be paid to the public schools. Defendants, on the other hand, argue that any penalty paid to the State to compensate it for an injury, damage, or loss above normal operating costs falls outside the scope of Article IX, Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mussallam v.

In\n   <em>\n    Mussallam\n   </em>\n   the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   These are (1) the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures in all cases, regardless of their nature, so long as they accrue to the state; and (2) the clear proceeds of all fines collected for any breach of the criminal laws. In the second category, it is quite apparent from the words of section 7 that the clear proceeds of all fines collected for the violation of the criminal laws are to be used for school purposes. One could not legitimately argue that the violation of a criminal law is not a \"breach of the penal laws.\" While its intent as to the first category is less obvious, the wording of the entire section 7 makes its meaning clear. The term \"penal laws,\" as used in the context of article IX, section 7, means laws that impose a monetary payment for their violation. The payment is punitive rather than remedial in nature and is intended to penalize the wrongdoer rather than compensate a particular party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.

Here, the purposes authorized for the parking penalties under section 116-44.4(m), with the possible exception of subdivision (1), are not legitimate \"remedial\" purposes under our Article IX, Section 7 analysis. Subdivision (1) of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116.44.4(m) \"[t]o defray the cost of administering and enforcing ordinances adopted under this Part,\" could be a legitimate remedial purpose, but in this situation this use is not sufficient to declare the payment remedial in that this purpose is already accounted for in the definition of \"clear proceeds\" under \u00a7 115C-457.2. The \"actual costs of collection\" up to ten percent of the total amount collected may be deducted from the funds received. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 115C-457.2. Accordingly, we hold that \"civil penalties\" collected pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-44.4(h) are punitive in nature and must be remitted by the University system to the Civil Penalty Fund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, we note with respect to the Court of Appeals' discussion of the applicability of Article IX, Section 8, that plaintiffs have not challenged the constitutionality of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116.44.4, but merely the disposition of penalties collected under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-44.4(h) into a trust account under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-44.4(m). The authority of the constituent campus boards of trustees to enact ordinances and to charge fees for parking, registration, bus rides, and any other transportation-related services is not in question. What is in question are civil penalties collected under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-44.4(h), and they belong to the public schools under Article IX, Section 7. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals' decision on this issue is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    V. Monies Collected by the Boards of Trustees of the Consolidated University of North Carolina Campuses for Loss, Damage, or Late Return of Materials Borrowed from University Libraries.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that payments collected by the trustees of each University campus for loss, damage, or late return of materials borrowed from campus libraries are not subject to Article IX, Section 7. Section 116-1(b) of the North Carolina General Statutes, under the heading \"Purpose,\" sets out the mission of the University and states: \"[t]hat mission is to discover, create, transmit, and apply knowledge to address the needs of individuals and society.... Teaching and learning constitute the primary service that the university renders to society. Teaching, or instruction, is the primary responsibility of each of the constituent institutions.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-1(b) (2003). To assist in achieving this mission, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 116-33 directs that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [e]ach board of trustees shall promote the sound development of the institution within the functions prescribed for it, helping it to serve the State in a way that will complement the activities of the other institutions and aiding it to perform at a high level of excellence in every area of endeavor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This broad grant of authority enables the board of trustees to establish and maintain a library collection, an integral and necessary asset in the achievement of the University's mission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court of Appeals held that this fee was not subject to Article IX, Section 7 for two reasons.\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Second, the Court of Appeals held that the statute was passed pursuant to Article IX, Section 9 of the North Carolina Constitution, which mandates that the General Assembly provide higher education to North Carolina citizens \"as far as practicable ... free of expense,\" N.C. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 9.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since this provision is separate from and co-equal to Article IX, Section 7, the Court of Appeals reasoned that a statute passed pursuant to Article IX, Section 9 would not be subject to the mandate of Article IX, Section 7. We affirm the Court of Appeals' holding that these library fees are not subject to Article IX, Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As noted earlier, Article IX, Section 7 applies to the penal laws of the State, meaning those statutes imposing a monetary payment for their violation and which are punitive rather than remedial in nature.\n   <em>\n    Mussallam,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2570813\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/504/\">\n    321 N.C. at 508-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20S.E.2d%20364\">\n    364 S.E.2d at 366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this instance the authorizing statute provides a broad grant of power, but does not specifically authorize the fees charged by the University libraries. However, defendants' answers to interrogatories reveal that the fees collected for lost and damaged materials are calculated from the replacement cost of the book, plus an additional twenty-five dollar fee for \"reacquisition and recataloging.\" Thus, the funds received are used exclusively for the costs associated with the replacement of the items lost or damaged by the user. This payment is remedial in nature since the funds are collected to repair harm done by the offending party.\n   <em>\n    See Shore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8562843\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/290/628/\">\n    290 N.C. at 633-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=227%20S.E.2d%20553\">\n    227 S.E.2d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, the money collected for late return of a book compensates the institution for the additional costs necessary to have sufficient quantities of materials for all users, a need which arises when a patron retains materials longer than the allocated time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the late fee collected for an overdue book is no different from a parking fine for over-parking. However, the fee collected for an overdue book differs from a parking penalty in that the patron, usually a student or faculty member, has the privilege of using the book without cost for the designated period; and the fees are normally assessed based upon daily or hourly overage. To the contrary, a person who uses a parking space without depositing money in the meter has violated the law; and if ticketed, the penalty is a set amount whether the person parked for two minutes or for two hours. Moreover, the library patron is usually entitled to borrow the book free of charge for an additional period by renewing the checkout. Hence, the late fee is in the nature of a user fee designed to manage the collection, as opposed to a penalty. We conclude, therefore, that the monies collected for library materials are remedial and, thus, not subject to Article IX, Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Having determined that these library charges are not subject to Article IX, Section 7, we do not address defendants' argument related to Article IX, Section 9 or the Court of Appeals' reliance thereon. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    VI. Monies Collected by the Department of Transportation for Violations of Axle Weight Limits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Based on the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals, defendants Tippett and Howard appealed the issue of whether the clear proceeds of payments collected by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) are subject to Article IX, Section 7. The majority in the Court of Appeals determined that the penalties were assessed for unlawful conduct under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-115 and were, thus, payable to the public schools.\n   <em>\n    N.C.

The dissenting judge agreed with defendants that the penalties were assessed to compensate the State for damage caused to the highways by the operation of overweight vehicles and were not payable to the public schools. The dissenting judge further concluded that the annual registration fee and penalties for overweight vehicles are \"`compensatory taxes for the use and privileges of the public highways of this State'\" which are paid into the Highway Fund to finance the maintenance of roads, and are, accordingly, remedial not punitive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 285-87,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n    585 S.E.2d at 438-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-97 (2001)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   On appeal to this Court, defendants contend that the majority of the Court of Appeals erred and argue that the penalties assessed against the owners of overweight vehicles are reimbursement for damages or are a tax. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For purposes of licensing, the weight of a self-propelled property-carrying vehicle is determined by the empty weight and the heaviest load to be carried as declared by the owner or operator, with limitations and calculations specified in the statute. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-88(a) (2003). A vehicle driven with a weight in excess of its declared gross weight\n   is subject to axle-group weight penalties under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) as determined by the amount the actual gross weight exceeds the declared gross weight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-88(k) (2003). Section 118(b) establishes axle weight limitations, and subsection (e) of section 118, entitled \"Penalties,\" prescribes \"civil penalties\" for operating a vehicle in violation of the axle weight limits, calculated on a graduated scale based on the pounds in excess of the limit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-118(b) and (e) (2003). This penalty is assessed against the owner or registrant of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=585%20S.E.2d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20-118(e). Finally, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-115 declares that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive or move or for the owner to cause or knowingly permit to be driven or moved on any highway any vehicle or vehicles of a size or weight exceeding the limitations stated in this title.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Defendants first argue that the Court of Appeals erred in finding the conduct unlawful pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-115. Defendants base this assertion on their contention that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-115 is directed to the driver of the vehicle, while N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) is directed to the owner or registrant of the vehicle. Defendants next argue that, since pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) a violation of section 118 is not punishable under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-176 as an infraction or violation of the criminal law, the penalty for violation of the weight limit is not punitive in nature. Neither of these arguments has merit. By its plain language N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-115 is directed at both the driver and the owner of the vehicle. Further, the law is well settled that Article IX, Section 7 applies to both civil and criminal penalties.\n   <em>\n    Mussallam,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2570813\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/504/\">\n    321 N.C. at 508-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=364%20S.E.2d%20364\">\n    364 S.E.2d at 366-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the fact that a violation is not punishable as a crime does not establish that the penalty is not penal in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Defendants also argue that the \"civil penalty\" is remedial in nature in that the payments compensate the State for damages to the highways caused by overweight vehicles. Defendants rely heavily on the affidavit of the Deputy Chief for Operations of the DOT, who opined that \"[a]lthough many other factors contribute to road failures, in my opinion overweight vehicles accelerate the deterioration of pavements which causes premature failures of the roadways in this state which the Department of Transportation repairs.\" Defendants argue that the use of a graduated scale based on excess pounds to calculate the penalty signifies that the penalty has a reasonable relationship to the injury caused and that because these funds are deposited in the Highway Fund, the penalty is remedial rather than punitive. We do not find these arguments persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As plaintiffs note, nothing in the record supports a conclusion that a correlation exists between the graduated scale for the penalties and the cost of repair to the highways. The scale is a measure of the degree of the violation. Moreover, funds deposited in the Highway Fund are used for purposes other than repair and maintenance of roadways damaged by overweight vehicles. As noted earlier, this Court has recognized restitution in the context of Article IX, Section 7 only when the damages were specifically quantified.\n   <em>\n    Shore,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8562843\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/290/628/\">\n    290 N.C. at 633-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=227%20S.E.2d%20553\">\n    227 S.E.2d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   We similarly reject defendants' argument that the penalty is a tax. As plaintiffs observe, the underlying premise to defendants' argument is that the licensing and registration fee imposed in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-88(a) is a tax although the statute makes no mention of a tax. Defendants then argue that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-97 supports the claim that the registration fee is a tax, but N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-97 does not suggest that registration fees are taxes. Furthermore, the statutes cited by defendants, namely, N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 20-88, 20-85, and 20-87, refer to fees and are contained in Part 7 of Article 3 entitled \"Title and Registration Fees.\" Section 20-85(b) directs that all but one of the title and registration fees collected under the statute are to be paid into the Highway Trust Fund, not the Highway Fund, as provided for the taxes referenced in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-97. Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Helvering v. Mitchell\n   </em>\n   is also misplaced in that\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   dealt with the issue of whether a tax penalty under the Internal Revenue Code constituted criminal punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n    303 U.S. at 398-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n    58 S.Ct. at 632-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n    82 L.Ed. at 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the underlying rationale\n   of the United States Supreme Court's decision is not applicable in the context of penalties collected under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e). These penalties are not a safeguard to protect the State's revenues nor is there evidence that punishment of the owners of overweight vehicles entails extensive investigation or litigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n    at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n    58 S.Ct. at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n    82 L.Ed. at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Throughout Article 3, the General Assembly referred to the penalties in N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) as a civil penalty. The language chosen manifests the legislature's intent that the penalty be imposed to punish those who own motor vehicles operating on the highways of the State while carrying loads that exceed the statutory weight limitations, conduct which violates the State's motor vehicle laws and is deemed unlawful. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-115 (2003). That the violation causes harm supplies the rational basis for imposing the penalty but does not undermine the intent of the legislature to punish those who cause the harm. We hold, therefore, that payments under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-118(e) are subject to Article IX, Section 7 and belong to the public schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    VII.

Section 20-309(e) provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Division [of Motor Vehicles], upon receiving notice of a lapse in insurance coverage, shall notify the owner of the lapse in coverage, and the owner shall, to retain the registration plate for the vehicle registered or required to be registered, within 10 days from date of notice given by the Division either:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (1) Certify to the Division that he had financial responsibility effective on or prior to the date of such termination; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (2) In the case of a lapse in financial responsibility, pay a fifty dollar ($50.00) civil penalty; and certify to the Division that he now has financial responsibility effective on the date of certification....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 20-309(e) (2003). Additionally, section 20-309(e) requires, subject to certain conditions, that the insurer notify the Division of the termination of a policy providing financial responsibility within twenty business days of the termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Any person, firm or corporation failing to give notice of termination shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred dollars ($200.00) to be assessed by the Commissioner of Insurance upon a finding by the Commissioner of Insurance that good cause is not shown for such failure to give notice of termination to the Division.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6141190\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/303/391/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Defendants argue that the payment by the owner is voluntary.

At the outset, we note that plaintiffs alleged in their complaint and the trial court ruled that the public schools were entitled to the proceeds of penalties collected by the ESC pursuant to section 96-10 for overdue employer contributions, for late filing of required reports, and for a check returned for insufficient funds. These penalties are prescribed in sections 96-10(a), (g), and (h). In their new brief to this Court, plaintiffs now include the penalty collected by the ESC pursuant to section 96-9(a)(7) for an employer's failure to file wage reports as required by statute. Since the trial court had no opportunity to consider the applicability of Article IX, Section 7 to section 96-9(a)(7), consideration of this provision is not properly before the Court, and our holding is limited to those statutory provisions on which the trial court and the Court of Appeals ruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court of Appeals accepted defendants' contention that N.C.G.S. \u00a7 96-10 \"defines employers' contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund as a `tax,'\" and construed the penalties paid pursuant to section 96-10 as part of the \"taxes\" or \"additional taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    N.C.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Neither defendants nor the Court of Appeals cites to specific language in the statute defining the employer contributions as taxes. The definitions section of Chapter 96 characterizes the payments made to the Unemployment Insurance Fund as \"contributions.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 96-8(3) (2003). Admittedly, certain statutes use the term \"tax\" interchangeably with the word \"contribution,\" for example, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 96-10(a), but these isolated references do not compel the conclusion that the payments made as penalties are likewise to be classified as taxes.

Nothing in the statute suggests that the penalty is in any way remedial or intended to preserve the integrity of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Rather, the penalty is assessed, in addition to interest, to penalize an employer for noncompliance with a statutory mandate. As with any other punishment, the threat of a hefty penalty may deter noncompliance, but this deterrence factor does not transform the penalty into a remedial tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   We hold that the penalties collected under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 96-10 are subject to Article IX, Section 7 and are payable for the benefit of the public schools.

Although public education is a very important and a sincere use of these funds, the process returns\n   very little to the environment which often suffers as a result of these environmental violations. This policy will set up a mechanism to provide opportunities for environmental benefit as a result of negotiated settlements where some portion of the settlement agreement may be in the form of a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Supplemental Environmental Projects are defined as projects that are beneficial to the environment and/or to public health that a defendant agrees to perform as part of a settlement to an enforcement action....

Applying these principles, we hold that Article 31A of Chapter 115C merely specifies details which are omitted from the broad language of Article IX, Section 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   As quoted above, Article IX, Section 7 of the North Carolina Constitution states that \"the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures and of all fines collected in the several counties ... shall belong to and remain in the several counties, and shall be faithfully appropriated and used exclusively for maintaining free public schools.\" N.C. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 7. Plaintiffs assert that the phrase \"shall belong to and remain in the several counties\" requires that administrative fines within the purview of this provision must remain in the county where they are paid; thus, the funds are not subject to legislative control and local school boards necessarily have discretion as to how to spend these funds. The constitutional provision, however, does not dictate specifically that funds shall remain in the county where collected, but only within the \"several counties.\" Contrary to plaintiffs' contention, the use of the phrase \"several counties\" suggests that the drafters intended that the funds not stay in one particular county, but rather in the \"several counties\" of the State of North Carolina. By directing that funds subject to Article IX, Section 7 of the Constitution be remitted to the Civil Penalty Fund and returned to the county school systems, the General Assembly has fully complied with the mandate embodied in the phrase \"belong to and remain in the several counties.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Plaintiffs also submit that the General Assembly has violated the Article IX, Section 7 mandate that the funds be \"faithfully appropriated and used exclusively for maintaining free public schools\" by requiring that the contents of the Civil Penalty Fund be deposited into the Technology Fund for use solely to implement local school systems' technology\n   plans.
