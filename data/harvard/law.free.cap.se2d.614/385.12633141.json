Hurley (\"Hurley\"), and Western Surety Company (collectively, \"defendants\") appeal from an order denying their motions for summary judgment. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and dismiss plaintiff's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 7 January 1999 to 31 December 2002, Hugh Kevin Hines (\"plaintiff\") worked as an investigatorial assistant in the district attorney's office for 19-B Prosecutorial District. Plaintiff's job duties included locating and interviewing witnesses, serving subpoenas for attendance at trials, and acting as a liaison between the district attorney's office and law enforcement agencies. Prior to working for Yates, plaintiff worked as a lieutenant for the sheriff of Randolph County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During the 2002 election, plaintiff became a candidate in the republican primary election for sheriff of Randolph County and challenged Hurley, the incumbent sheriff. Over the course of the campaign, plaintiff publicly criticized Yates for his prosecutorial decisions in prior cases and publicly announced his disagreement with Yates' decision to not criminally charge a sheriff's deputy who had collided with a motorcyclist during a pursuit. The motorcyclist died from injuries sustained from the collision. Plaintiff also publicly expressed his disagreement with the sheriff's department's investigation and handling of an unrelated and unsolved murder case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff's affidavit states that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Yates, on numerous occasions personally stated to me that he intended to discharge me from my employment . . . due to my seeking the office of Sheriff of Randolph County . . . after each occasion on which I made a public appearance or there was some news media attention in connection with my election campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After plaintiff appeared at a public event to express interest in running for the sheriff's position, plaintiff was instructed by Yates not to work on pending cases involving the Randolph County sheriff's department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the primary election held 10 September 2002, Hurley defeated plaintiff, secured the republican party's nomination, and won reelection as sheriff of Randolph County in the November general election. On 16 September 2002, less than one week after the primary election, plaintiff's annual employee performance report was completed. On 26 September 2002, Kay Lovin, Yates' administrative assistant and plaintiff's supervisor, informed plaintiff of his impending termination. Yates extended the termination date to 31 October 2002, and again to 31 December 2002, and offered plaintiff the opportunity to resign. Yates also offered to provide a reference to other law enforcement agencies. Plaintiff refused to resign and continued to criticize the sheriff's department after the election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his sworn affidavit, Yates stated, \"[Plaintiff] continued to criticize the Sheriff and even accused him of voter fraud\" and\n   \"stated publically that he intended to run against the Sheriff again in 2006.\" On 31 December 2002, plaintiff received a separation notice from Yates stating as grounds that \"[e]mployee is no longer able to function effectively in his position. To wit: cooperate and maintain an effective and confidential relationship with all law enforcement agencies in the judicial district.\" Yates listed as a second reason for plaintiff's separation as \"[e]mployee further directly criticized supervisor's decision in the media concerning a law enforcement matter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff instituted this action seeking damages from defendants for various torts: (1) wrongful discharge against Yates in both his official and individual capacity; (2) malicious interference with contractual relations against Hurley; (3) violation of plaintiff's State constitutional rights by Yates and Hurley in their official capacities; (4) violation of plaintiff's federal constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Yates and Hurley in their official and personal individual capacities; and (5) claims for punitive damages for Hurley's and Yates' conduct in their official and personal individual capacities. Plaintiff asserted claims against Western Surety Company on Hurley's official bond. Defendants answered and asserted defenses of sovereign immunity, qualified immunity, and that plaintiff was an \"at will employee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants moved for summary judgment. Hurley's sworn affidavit, filed with his motion for summary judgment, admits he asked Yates to reassign plaintiff from the sheriff's department's cases due to \"[his] concern that a conflict of interest was arising by plaintiff's reportedly questioning crime victims as to whether they were satisfied with response times, friendliness, etc. of deputy investigators . . . for the time during the election campaign.\" Hurley denies requesting Yates to terminate plaintiff. Yates' sworn affidavit states, \"[a]t no time did Sheriff Hurley or anyone on his behalf ask me to fire [plaintiff]. I made the decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court granted defendants' motions regarding: (1) \"plaintiff's first claim for relief as against defendant Yates in his official capacity and in his individual and personal capacity\" (wrongful discharge); (2) \"plaintiff's third claim for relief as against defendant Hurley in his official capacity and in his individual and personal capacity\" (denial of State constitutional rights); (3) \"plaintiff's third claim for relief as against defendant Yates in his official capacity, but not as against defendant Yates in his individual and personal capacity\" (denial of State constitutional rights); (4) \"plaintiff's fourth claim for relief as against defendant Yates in his official capacity for all forms of relief except injunctive relief, but not as against defendant Yates in his individual and personal capacity\" (denial of federal constitutional rights under color of State law); (5) \"plaintiff's sixth claim for relief as against defendant Yates in his official capacity, but not as against defendant Yates in his individual and personal capacity\" (punitive damages); and (6) plaintiff's sixth claim for relief as against defendant Hurley in his official capacity but not as against defendant Hurley in his individual and personal capacity (punitive damages).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The trial court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment on plaintiff's: (1) second claim of relief for malicious interference with contractual relations against Hurley; (2) injunctive relief for violation of plaintiff's State constitutional rights by Yates in his individual and personal capacities; (3) violation of plaintiff's federal constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Yates in his individual and personal capacities limited to injunctive relief; (4) plaintiff's fifth claim for relief on the sheriff's bond against Western Surety Company (for wrongful conduct by Hurley in his official capacity as sheriff); and (5) punitive damages against both Hurley and Yates in their individual and personal capacities. Defendants appeal and plaintiff cross appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The common issues presented by defendants are whether the trial court erred in denying defendants' summary judgment motions on plaintiff's claims for violation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and punitive damages. Defendants Hurley and Western Surety separately assert the trial court erred in denying summary judgment on plaintiff's malicious interference with contractual relations as plaintiff failed to allege a waiver of immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff assigned cross assignments of error on the granting of defendants' motions for summary judgment dismissing plaintiff's claims for: (1) wrongful discharge by Yates; (2) punitive damage charge against Hurley in his official capacity; (3) all forms of relief except injunction in regards to his\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action; and (4) punitive damages against Yates and Hurley in their official capacities. Except for the trial court's granting Yates summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff's claims for wrongful discharge, plaintiff's arguments in his brief assert solely alternative grounds to support the trial court's partial summary judgment in his favor. Plaintiff abandoned his remaining cross assignments of error by not arguing them in his brief. N.C.R.App. P. 28(a) (2004);\n   <em>\n    Summers v.

Also, plaintiff's cross appeals, except the wrongful discharge, are interlocutory and are dismissed. N.C.R.App. P. 10 (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    III.

Plaintiff's inconsistency and fallacy throughout his claims and arguments are his assertions that freedom of speech and expression shields his termination from at will employment, (that is exempt\n   from the State Personnel Act), and compels his reinstatement by injunctive relief and allows him to hold Yates and Hurley liable for compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff asserts Hurley is liable in tort for speaking his views of plaintiff to Yates on matters that concern both constitutional officers, and Yates must suffer plaintiff's continued employment while his subordinate publicly criticizes and disrespects the district attorney's office, and erodes its working relationship with a law enforcement agency.

Plaintiff's insubordination and criticism of Yates' discretionary decisions were blatant, impugned the character of his employer, and disrupted an essential working relationship between the sheriff's department and the district attorney's office. When faced with plaintiff's continued criticism of the sheriff's department after the election, his allegations of voter fraud and plaintiff's stated intent to seek the sheriff's office again in 2006, Yates was not powerless to avoid years of continued turmoil and future criticisms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Any constitutionally elected officer of the judicial department possesses the inherent and statutory right to choose their staff.

In Plaintiff's affidavit of 13 November 2003, he stated that \"Mr. Garland Yates, on numerous occasions personally stated to me that he intended to discharge me from my employment as his investigatorial assistant due to my seeking the office of Sheriff of Randolph County.\" Plaintiff stated that \"[o]n each such occasion, Mr. Yates stated to me that Sheriff Hurley had contacted him to complain about my continuing campaign activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Mr. Tony Yates, Defendant Yates' brother, stated in his deposition that when he went to his brother Defendant Yates' office, \"I told him, I said, I've come over here because I heard you were going to fire Kevin because he's going to run for sheriff. And I said I realize that, you know, you have the right to do whatever you want. . . . But I said, I don't think this is fair because a person has a right to run for a political office in this country.\" Upon being asked whether \"your brother ever t[old] you that Sheriff Hurley expressed any interest in having Mr. Hines discharged[,]\" Mr. Yates answered \"[y]es\" and stated that \"[a]t the end of that little statement, he made the - made the statement that the sheriff had called him and told him that he had to get rid of Kevin now.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In his deposition, Plaintiff stated that Defendant Yates' brother, Tony Yates, as well as Defendant Yates himself, informed him that Defendant Hurley demanded that Defendant Yates terminate Plaintiff's employment because of Plaintiff's candidacy for sheriff. Plaintiff stated that Defendant Yates told him \"that the sheriff come to him and told him he wanted me - that he wanted me moved out of the county. He wanted me fired.\" Plaintiff said that Defendant Yates \"told me he was going to fire me at different - at different times. He was going to fire me if I filed. And then when I filed, he decided to wait, and then he told me he was going to fire me before the election, and then he told me he was going to fire me after the election. I was told countless times that he was going to fire me if I ran against him\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In her deposition and through an accompanying exhibit, Ms. Cynthia Kay Lovin, administrative\n   assistant to Defendant Yates, indicated that Plaintiff's performance evaluations for 2001 and 2002 rated Plaintiff's job performance as being satisfactory to outstanding. A portion of his 2001 performance evaluation stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Kevin had previous law enforcement experience when he joined our office. He possesses excellent investigative skills, which our office uses to develop and prepare cases for trial. He also serves as a liaison with the law enforcement agencies and has a pro-active working relationship with these agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Kevin has a very easy-going personality, which is a true asset in his job performance. He has proven to be invaluable in his ability to locate and interview witnesses. This is often a time-consuming process and requires someone with excellent investigative techniques and the ability to communicate with all segments of society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Kevin is also very informed as to the elements of criminal law and the policies and procedures of the judicial system. He works independently and has the ability to analyze each case or situation and make any necessary decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Kevin is always available and willing to help . . . whether it is directly in our office or in the judicial community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In Defendant Hurley's deposition, the following colloquy took place:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Q: Is it within the scope of your authority as sheriff of Randolph County to cause or seek to cause the termination of any employee at the district attorney's office?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   A: No. I didn't try to do that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Q: Well, my question is simply is that within the scope of your authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A: No, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Q: So whether you did it or not, you agree you don't have any legal right to try to cause a termination of an employee at the district attorney's office?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   A: Absolutely not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Q: Did you have any legal right or lawful authority in the fall of 2001 to ask Garland Yates to get rid of Kevin Hines?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   With regard to the damages element of Plaintiff's interference with contract claim, Plaintiff made clear that he was terminated from his employment with Defendant Yates, and at his deposition on 13 June 2003 that he was seeking but had not yet found full-time employment and was \"drawing from the state of North Carolina unemployment. . . .\" Indeed, Plaintiff stated that Defendant Hurley had contacted an administrator at a community college, at which Plaintiff obtained part-time employment after his termination by the District Attorney's Office, and \"tried to get me fired. . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In sum, the pleadings in this matter, contrary to the majority's assertion, are unverified. Under the \"drastic measure\" of summary judgement, this Court must look at the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Beyond the unverified pleadings, the \"depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits\" in this case show that there are genuine issues of material fact as to Plaintiff's interference with contract claim. Thus, Superior Court Judge John O. Craig, III, correctly applied the law to this claim in denying summary judgment.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
