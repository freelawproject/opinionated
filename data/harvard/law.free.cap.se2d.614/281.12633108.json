Because we hold that the power to review such proposed contracts is consistent with the duties imposed upon the Utilities Commission by our General Assembly and is not preempted by federal law, we reverse the holding of the North Carolina Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 17 November 1998, Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (CP &amp; L) applied to the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) for permission to construct additional generating capacity in Rowan and Richmond Counties. The application, filed pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 62-110.1, was given Docket Number E-2, Sub 733. Related documents indicate that CP &amp; L sought to construct new generating plants both because it anticipated increased demand arising from normal load growth and because it intended to enter into contracts to sell electric power to two wholesale customers, the South Carolina Public Service Authority (also known as Santee Cooper) and the North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), outside the service area in which CP &amp; L sold electricity to retail customers. As a public utility, CP &amp; L is required to secure and maintain adequate resources to meet anticipated demands for electricity in its assigned service area. The contracts provided that CP &amp; L would guarantee service reliability to these new wholesale customers at \"native load priority.\" A grant of native load priority would ensure that the new wholesale customers would receive power at the same level of reliability as CP &amp; L's existing retail customers. Under this proposed arrangement, in the event of a power shortage, CP &amp; L would not interrupt the energy supply to the wholesale customers any sooner than it would interrupt the supply to its retail customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Evidence obtained during the Docket No. E-2, Sub 733 proceeding revealed that in 1998, CP &amp; L initially had indicated that it planned to add 1,500 megawatt (MW) capacity to its facilities in the 2002-2007 period. However, CP &amp; L now planned to accelerate the construction and also increase its capacity to 1,600 MW in the 2001-2002 period. Additional evidence indicated that CP &amp; L's demand and energy forecasts showed that, unless the requested 1,600 MW capacity was added to its system, CP &amp; L's capacity margin would fall to a level of negative 1.4 percent by the summer of 2003, thus preventing it from being able to provide reliable service to meet the needs of its customers, including the proposed new wholesale customers. CP &amp; L's reliability analysis showed a target capacity margin of thirteen percent would be appropriate to allow it to have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of all its customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 2 November 1999, NCUC issued an order granting the requested certificates for construction of two new power facilities. The order contained additional provisions that \"CP &amp; L shall fully consider the wholesale market for future generation resource additions that will be used in whole or in part to serve retail customers whether by formal RFP [requests for proposals] or other measures that ensure a complete evaluation of the market\" and that \"CP &amp; L shall ensure that its retail electric customers will not be disadvantaged in any manner, either from a quality of service or rate perspective, as a result of its participation in the wholesale power market.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response to the issues raised by CP &amp; L's request in Docket No. E-2, Sub 733, and because no Commission rules or guidelines existed to address situations in which \"(1) a utility desires to enter into a contract to serve off-system load at native load priority and/or (2) a utility ... seeks a certificate to construct generation capacity to serve such off-system load [,]\" the Public Staff requested that NCUC initiate a generic proceeding to address similar future situations that were likely to arise in the developing wholesale market. Accordingly, NCUC initiated Docket No. E-100, Sub 85 by order dated 17 November 1999. After twelve parties submitted\n   comments, on 26 April 2000 NCUC concluded that the Docket No. E-100, Sub 85 proceeding \"should be held in abeyance pending resolution of electric industry restructuring issues by the legislature or until some future event warrant[ed] further consideration of the issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On 22 August 2000, NCUC issued an order in Docket No. E-2, Sub 760, a proceeding that concerned a proposed merger of CP &amp; L and Florida Progress Corporation. This order approved the merger and a concomitant issuance of securities but included several conditions. Of these, Regulatory Condition 21 provided\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CP &amp; L shall not enter into contracts for the sale of energy and/or capacity at native load priority and/or under such terms and conditions as to cause the purchasing entity to fall within the definition of \"native load\" in the Integration Agreement without first giving the NCUC and the Public Staff written notice 20 days in advance of such a contract being executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   NCUC's justification for imposing this notice obligation was to provide a mechanism through which NCUC meaningfully could enforce the requirement \"that CP &amp; L's retail native load customers receive priority with respect to, and the benefits from, CP&amp;L's existing generation and that CP &amp; L's wholesale activities not disadvantage its retail ratepayers from either a quality of service or rate perspective.\" Because this proceeding was not generic, the notice provision applied only to CP&amp;L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   CP &amp; L did not resist the imposition of this provision. However, after the order approving the merger of CP &amp; L and Florida Progress Corporation was issued, the Public Staff, CP &amp; L, and NCEMC filed a motion requesting that NCUC amend the order to include Regulatory Condition 20a. This proposed modification provided that if CP&amp;L complied with the twenty-day notice requirement in Regulatory Condition 21 and NCUC did not affirmatively order CP&amp;L not to enter into such wholesale contracts, then \"the retail native loads of these wholesale buyers that are served pursuant to said future contracts between those wholesale buyers and CP&amp;L also shall be considered CP&amp;L's retail native load for purposes of Conditions 19 and 20\" of the order. NCUC accepted new Condition 20a by order dated 8 November 2000, amending its 22 August 2000 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Thereafter, pursuant to Regulatory Condition 21, on 31 January 2002, CP&amp;L filed in Docket No. E-2, Sub 798 a twenty-day notice of intent to enter into two wholesale contracts for the sale of electricity at native load priority. When objections were raised, CP &amp; L argued that while NCUC \"retains authority to address retail rates and cost allocation issues, the Federal Power Act authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to regulate interstate wholesale electric power transactions\" and that \"FERC's authority over such transactions is exclusive `and is not shared with state regulatory agencies.'\" NCUC authorized CP&amp;L to go ahead with the proposed contracts by order dated 26 February 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The substantive and jurisdictional issues raised in Docket No. E-2, Sub 798 prompted NCUC to initiate on 11 March 2002 a new proceeding, Docket No. E-100, Sub 85A, for the purpose of investigating,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   NCUC's jurisdiction with respect to wholesale contracts at native load priority and the extent to which that jurisdiction either complements or conflicts with FERC's jurisdiction in that field; the extent to which NCUC's jurisdiction is preempted once a wholesale contract at native load priority is signed; and what action NCUC could undertake to protect retail ratepayers as to retail rates and reliability. After receiving briefs from interested parties, NCUC concluded in an order entered in Docket No. E-100, Sub 85A dated 10 July 2002 that \"it has jurisdiction and authority under State law to review, before they are signed, proposed wholesale contracts by a regulated North Carolina public utility granting native load priority to be supplied from the same plant as retail ratepayers.\" NCUC further concluded that it has authority \"to take appropriate action if necessary to secure and protect reliable service to retail customers in North Carolina.\" In addition, NCUC determined that this jurisdiction and authority is not preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly thereafter, CP&amp;L, Duke Power, and NCEMC filed a motion asking NCUC \"to reconsider and clarify the Order, to clearly state that [NCUC] has no jurisdiction to either prohibit a North Carolina utility from entering into a wholesale contract or to delay such utility entering into a wholesale sale contract.\" NCUC denied the motion, and CP&amp;L, Duke Power, and NCEMC appealed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. That court found that, under the Federal Power Act (FPA), Congress granted FERC exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of the wholesale sale of electric energy in interstate commerce. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals vacated the 10 July 2002 order that NCUC had issued in Docket No. E-100, Sub 85A on the grounds that such orders were preempted by the FPA and violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

The North Carolina Attorney General, Public Staff-NCUC, Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc., and Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates II appeal on the basis of the dissent. Because this Court denied appellees' petition for discretionary review of additional issues, we consider only the issue raised in Judge Wynn's dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before we begin our analysis of the issues raised in this appeal, we review the relationship between North Carolina's Public Utilities Act, N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 62-1 to -333 (2003), and the FPA. The General Assembly has determined that \"the rates, services and operations of public utilities ... are affected with the public interest and that the availability of an adequate and reliable supply of electric power ... to the people, economy and government of North Carolina is a matter of public policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20S.E.2d%2077\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 62-2(a).

As described above, in Docket No. E-2, Sub 733, CP &amp; L applied to NCUC for certificates that would permit construction of additional generating capacity in Rowan and Richmond Counties. CP &amp; L's need for these plants was created in part by its proposed contracts to sell power to two new wholesale customers at native load priority. NCUC granted the requested certificates. However, when it issued the certificates, NCUC also required \"[t]hat CP &amp; L shall fully consider the wholesale market for future generation resource additions that will be used in whole or in part to serve retail customers whether by formal RFP or other measures that ensure a complete evaluation of the market\" and that \"CP &amp; L shall ensure that its retail electric customers will not be disadvantaged in any manner, either from a quality of service or rate perspective, as a result of its participation in the wholesale power market.\" To ensure CP &amp; L's compliance with these requirements, NCUC's order concerning CP &amp; L's proposed merger with Florida Progress Corporation, Docket No. E-2, Sub 760, contained Regulatory Condition 21 (quoted above), which required a twenty-day notice to NCUC and the Public Staff of any proposed contract for the sale of wholesale power at native load priority.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While the 10 July 2002 order is now at issue rather than the two proceedings described immediately above, those proceedings were the impetus behind NCUC's initiation of Docket No. E-100, Sub 85A that resulted in the 10 July 2002 order. For example, evidence in the No. E-2, Sub 733 certificate proceedings indicated that unless CP &amp; L added the requested megawatt capacity to its system, its capacity margin would fall to negative 1.4 percent, even though reliability analysis showed a target capacity margin of thirteen percent was appropriate for CP &amp; L to meet its customers' requirements. When acting on a utility's petition for construction, NCUC needed this information to fulfill its statutory duties under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 62-110.1(c) and (d) to take into account both estimated future electrical energy demands and the petitioning utility's arrangements with other utilities. Furthermore, because the electric power CP &amp; L would be selling at wholesale in an interstate market was to be generated from the same facilities that served its retail customers, knowledge of the proposed wholesale contracts was relevant to NCUC's duties to ensure that utility companies provide adequate and reliable service to the people of North Carolina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 62-2, -32, -33, -42;\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Accordingly, we believe NCUC's actions in the No. E-2, Sub 733 and Sub 760 proceedings and NCUC's declaration of authority in the 10 July 2002 order were consistent both with the agency's duties and with the powers conferred upon it by the Public Utilities Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, NCUC's power to examine a utility's proposed contract granting native load priority to a wholesale customer does not conflict with FERC's authority to make prudence inquiries concerning wholesale rates and charges. Under the FPA, all wholesale rates must be just and reasonable and filed with FERC. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(a), (c) (2000). FERC has the power to review such rates and charges, as well as the contracts that affect them, to ensure they are not \"unjust, unreasonable, [or] unduly discriminatory or preferential.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20S.E.2d%20772\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 824e(a) (2000). If, after conducting such an inquiry, FERC finds that the rates or charges in question violate these provisions, the agency is then required to \"determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, ... or contract\" and fix or enforce \"the same by order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20S.E.2d%20772\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, section 824e(d) grants FERC authority to \"investigate and determine the cost of the production or transmission of electric energy by means of facilities under the jurisdiction of [FERC] in cases where [FERC] has no authority to establish a rate governing the sale of such energy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20S.E.2d%20772\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 824e(d) (2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In contrast, NCUC's review of a proposed grant of native load priority for wholesale customers serves a different purpose. NCUC's review allows it to remain apprised of pertinent matters of local concern, including the adequacy of the state's supply of electricity, North Carolina's public utilities' capacity and reserve margins, and any need for additional generating capacity. As\n   FERC has noted, issues of local energy service, such as generating facilities and reliability of production, traditionally have been left to the states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order No. 888, 61 Fed.Reg. at 21,626 nn. 543-44;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1). Therefore, while NCUC's review takes into account the intrastate consequences of the proposed contract, it does not duplicate FERC's inquiry into the prudence and fairness of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The proceedings in Docket No. E-2, Sub 798 further illustrate that NCUC's responsibilities do not clash with those of FERC. In Sub 798, CP &amp; L filed the twenty-day notice mandated by Regulatory Condition 21 of Docket No. E-2, Sub 760, advising of its intent to enter into two wholesale contracts for the sale of power at native load priority. The Public Staff reviewed the contracts and, concluding that the contracts would not disadvantage CP &amp; L's retail customers, raised no objections to CP &amp; L's proposed activities. NCUC's twenty-day requirement did not inhibit CP &amp; L from entering into the contracts or infringe upon the rates, charges, costs or other terms of the proposed sales. Although\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   Edison Electric Institute argues that such notice requirements hamper a utility's ability to respond quickly to the demands of a volatile market, we believe that NCUC has the expertise to consider the possible economic impact of such notice conditions and the authority to impose them under appropriate circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   NCUC's ability to conduct a pre-sale review for the purpose of evaluating the consequences of a proposed wholesale contract, when such review does not include the power to set rates in an interstate wholesale contract for the purported purpose of protecting North Carolina consumers or to conduct a prudence inquiry, distinguishes the instant case from\n   <em>\n    Appalachian Power Co. v.

This conflict could lead to a chaotic situation quite similar to that which led to enactment of the FPA itself. For example, multiple North Carolina utilities under NCUC's jurisdiction are also regulated by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. If states are not preempted from performing a pre-execution review, South Carolina could perform its own review and impose conditions regarding certain contracts that might conflict with potential North Carolina orders. Like Rhode Island and Massachusetts in\n   <em>\n    Attleboro,\n   </em>\n   North Carolina and South Carolina could attempt to impose conflicting orders concerning the same subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See Attleboro,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137597\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/83/\">\n    273 U.S. at 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137597\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/83/\">\n    47 S.Ct. at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6137597\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/83/\">\n    71 L.Ed. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The United States Supreme Court has made clear that the preemptive consequences of FERC jurisdiction over wholesale contracts extend to more than merely rate regulation and include the type of review contemplated by NCUC. In\n   <em>\n    Nantahala,\n   </em>\n   the United States Supreme Court held that NCUC could not circumvent FERC by using retail ratemaking power, stating, \"When FERC sets a rate between a seller of power and a wholesaler-as-buyer, a State may not exercise its undoubted jurisdiction over retail sales to prevent the wholesaler-as-seller from recovering the costs of paying the FERC-approved rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Nantahala,\n   </em>\n   476 U.S. at 970, 106 S.Ct. at 2359, 90 L.Ed.2d at 956. In the instant case, NCUC is attempting to bypass FERC wholesale jurisdiction by using traditional regulatory authority. FERC's wholesale rate jurisdiction, however, goes beyond the actual rate itself, and NCUC may not use its traditional authority\n   to undermine that jurisdiction. Accordingly, FERC provides the exclusive forum for disputes over wholesale contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co.,\n   </em>\n   a state regulator attempted to remedy a perceived failing in a FERC-approved transaction.\n   <em>\n    Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co.\n   </em>\n   involved a FERC decision to allow a utility to recover a high cost of power in a wholesale agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775193\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/354/#p374\">\n    487 U.S. at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775193\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/354/#p374\">\n    108 S.Ct. at 2435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775193\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/354/#p374\">\n    101 L.Ed.2d at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This provision, however, does not prevent federal preemption of the instant NCUC order for three reasons. First, as the majority notes, the United States Supreme Court has definitively stated that the FPA's saving clause is a mere \"policy declaration\" that \"cannot nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Conn. Light &amp; Power Co. v. FPC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6155922\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/515/#p527\">\n    324 U.S. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6155922\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/515/#p527\">\n    65 S.Ct. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6155922\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/324/515/#p527\">\n    89 L.Ed. 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1158-59 (1945). And the FPA specifically grants FERC jurisdiction over wholesale electricity sales.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, the FPA's saving clause still serves a vital purpose, as states are able to exercise significant regulatory power over utilities despite being preempted from regulating wholesale contracts. For example, as the majority notes, if NCUC finds a utility's service to be \"inadequate, insufficient or unreasonably discriminatory,\" it can \"enter and serve an order directing that such additions, extensions, repairs, improvements, or additional services or changes ... be made ... within a reasonable time prescribed.\" N.C.G.S. \u00a7 62-42(a) (2003). NCUC can also require certificates of public convenience and necessity before allowing the construction of generating facilities, N.C.G.S. \u00a7 62-110.1(a), and it can take into account the utility's arrangements for the interchange and purchase of power when acting on a petition for construction. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 62-110.1(d). But the FPA's saving clause does not permit states to regulate in areas preempted by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the FPA's saving clause applies only to areas \"which are not subject to regulation by the States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). When the FPA was originally enacted in 1935, the wholesale electricity market as it operates today did not exist. In 1996 FERC issued an order to infuse competition into the interstate wholesale electricity market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FERC Order No. 888, 61 Fed.Reg. 21,540 (May 10, 1996) (\"Promoting Wholesale Competition Through Open Access Non-Discriminatory Transmission Services by Public Utilities; Recovery of Stranded Costs by Public Utilities and Transmitting Utilities\"). The FERC order required that utilities controlling transmission facilities file open access non-discriminatory tariffs for the use of the facilities, thus opening up the wholesale power market to competition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In issuing its order, FERC's goal was to \"remove impediments to competition in the wholesale bulk power marketplace and to bring more efficient, lower cost power to the Nation's electricity consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FERC's order, combined with changes in technology, allowed for the emergence of a national wholesale market in electricity.\n   <em>\n    See generally New York v.

In other words, NCUC is attempting, in the present case, to regulate contracts in a federally-inspired, rapidly evolving market that did not exist at the time the FPA was enacted. The regulation of modern wholesale contracts in the manner attempted by NCUC, therefore, cannot be said to constitute a power \"traditionally\" exercised by the states. Rather, Congress has specifically granted FERC authority to regulate this rapidly evolving market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 824d(a), 824e(a).

The majority reasons that since FERC's and NCUC's authorities derive from different sources and apply to different concerns, they do not pose a potential for conflict. In the majority's view, pre-contract review is a legitimate exercise of NCUC's traditional authority to regulate utilities to insure reliability of service for consumers, whereas FERC's prudence review ability is a legitimate exercise of FERC's authority under the FPA to insure that wholesale rates and the contracts affecting them are \"just and reasonable\". 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 824d(a), 824e(a). But the concurrent federal and state regulatory inquiries the majority envisions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Rather, the potential for conflict is clear when a proposed interstate wholesale electricity contract is concurrently reviewed by two separate regulatory authorities to determine whether the contract is \"just and reasonable\" as well as \"fair to consumers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As an illustration, the majority examines the proceedings in Docket No. E-2, Sub 733 regarding regulatory conditions imposed upon Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (CP &amp; L). Those proceedings are relevant, however, only as background. They do not have any bearing on the order in question, NCUC's 10 July 2002 order from Docket No. E-100, Sub 85A. Regardless of how NCUC actually applied a pre-contract review pertaining to CP &amp; L, the 10 July 2002 order contains language propounded by NCUC that asserts plenary pre-execution authority over wholesale contracts. The United States Supreme Court has stated: \"The test of whether both federal and state regulations may operate, or the state regulation must give way, is whether both regulations can be enforced without impairing the federal superintendence of the field.\"\n   <em>\n    Fla. Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11717019\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/132/#p141\">\n    373 U.S. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 S.Ct. at at 1217,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11717019\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/132/#p141\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d at 256-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, NCUC is attempting to undermine FERC authority by granting itself regulatory jurisdiction over the same terms of the same contracts that FERC governs pursuant to the FPA. The majority states that \"NCUC's twenty-day requirement did not inhibit CP &amp; L from entering into the contracts or infringe upon the rates, charges, costs or other terms of the proposed sales.\" This may be true, but the majority does not consider that the jurisdiction claimed by NCUC\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have allowed it to do any of those things, which would clearly come into conflict with FERC's prudence review of the same contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Contrary to the majority's assertion, NCUC's authority to monitor utility service reliability and reserve capacity is not at issue here. As noted above, NCUC has the obligation to monitor long-range electricity supply and demand and has the power to require utilities to submit reports concerning power generation, expected demand, and dealings with other power providers. N.C.G.S. \u00a7 62-110.1(c), (d). All of this can be effectuated without impermissibly interfering with wholesale contracts. As a result, NCUC has the authority to keep apprised of the effects of a utility's wholesale contracts after they have taken effect, but NCUC is clearly preempted by federal law from reviewing,\n   modifying, or rejecting such contracts before their execution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The majority properly observes that NCUC is preempted from conducting a prudence review or overruling FERC, yet allows NCUC to conduct pre-execution review of wholesale interstate electricity contracts. Exactly what regulatory actions NCUC may take pursuant to the majority's newly-created review authority is left unexplained. The majority states that state regulatory review allows NCUC to \"remain apprised of pertinent matters of local concern, including the adequacy of the state's supply of electricity, North Carolina's public utilities' capacity and reserve margins, and any need for additional generating capacity.\" The modal ability to \"remain apprised\" of the terms of proposed wholesale contracts, however, does not concomitantly vest NCUC with authority to modify the terms of such contracts through the \"back door.\" In short, if NCUC is preempted from conducting a prudence review, as the majority acknowledges, NCUC cannot modify or reform the proposed terms of such contracts. Accordingly, NCUC is preempted from exercising the potentially open-ended authority it purports to exercise in its 10 July 2002 order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The majority attempts to distinguish two cases which are, in fact, directly on point. Both cases involve attempted review and modification of wholesale agreements by state regulatory agencies. In\n   <em>\n    Appalachian Power Co. v. Public Service Commission,\n   </em>\n   the Public Service Commission of West Virginia tried to require a utility to submit a FERC-approved wholesale contract for prudence review.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1694554\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/812/898/\">\n    812 F.2d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899-902 (4th Cir.1987). The Fourth Circuit found the state's regulatory assertion to be preempted, holding, \"Because it is fundamentally at odds with the scheme Congress has established in the FPA to allow the states to change the arrangements filed with or established by FERC, we find the authority the [Public Service Commission] asserts here violative of the supremacy clause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1694554\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/812/898/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1694554\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/812/898/\">\n    at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Utah v. FERC\n   </em>\n   involved an attempt by the Utah Public Service Commission to require modification of a FERC-approved wholesale agreement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478040\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/444/\">\n    691 F.2d at 445-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tenth Circuit held the state's action to be preempted, stating that \"once a utility becomes involved in sales of interstate commodities it brings itself under the regulatory authority of the FERC, and its remedy is to obtain review and to appeal ultimately to the Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478040\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/444/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478040\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/444/\">\n    at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, this case demonstrates that a state utility commission is preempted from interfering with FERC-regulated wholesale contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The majority attempts to distinguish these two cases on the ground that they both concerned executed, FERC-filed agreements, while NCUC is purporting to assert pre-execution review authority over wholesale interstate contracts. The preemption holdings of\n   <em>\n    Appalachian Power\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Utah,\n   </em>\n   however, did not hinge on the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of the state's attempted regulation of wholesale contracts, and the majority's reasoning to the contrary is unconvincing. Put simply, if a state is preempted from reviewing, modifying, or rejecting a wholesale agreement after execution, it is obviously preempted from attempting the same action before execution. Congress has determined that FERC is vested with exclusive regulatory authority over wholesale electricity contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And it is not within the authority of this Court to revise the FPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   FERC has asserted its jurisdiction over these contracts in the form of pre-approved terms and conditions for competitive wholesale transactions. Federal preemption bars concurrent state regulation when, as here, NCUC's attempted regulation presents \"an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Hines,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359179\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/52/#p66\">\n    312 U.S. at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359179\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/52/#p66\">\n    61 S.Ct. at 404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"359179\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/312/52/#p66\">\n    85 L.Ed. at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the majority is correct in its reasoning, however, state regulators could arbitrarily exert power to influence utilities' decisions regarding wholesale contracts before such contracts are executed. For example, in a pre-execution review, NCUC could unilaterally set conditions for a utility attempting to enter into a wholesale agreement that would not affect the contract rate or terms\n   <em>\n    per se,\n   </em>\n   but that would effectively prevent the utility from executing the contract. Congress has provided FERC with exclusive authority over wholesale contracts,\n   and NCUC's asserted pre-execution review authority presents a clear obstacle to this congressional objective in that it allows NCUC to functionally override FERC-simply by regulating first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   It is undisputed that NCUC plays a crucial role in protecting North Carolina's captive retail electricity consumers. NCUC has broad statutory authority to accomplish this important objective. Congress has exclusively entrusted the regulation of wholesale interstate electricity contracts, however, to FERC. Undoubtedly, NCUC has the authority to require notice of the terms of such contracts, but it cannot otherwise regulate them. Although NCUC may seek federal review of a contract perceived to be \"unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential,\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e(a), it cannot vest itself, consistent with federal preemption doctrine, with jurisdiction to conduct pre-execution review of wholesale interstate electricity contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Justice BRADY joins in this dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
