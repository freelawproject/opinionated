Trejo had brought suit against Compton, a prison vocational instructor, claiming that a table router accident in carpentry class that left him with severed fingers was caused by Compton\u2019s deliberate indifference to his safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">Trejo first argues that the district court erred in denying his request for appointment of counsel. A trial court is not required to appoint counsel for an indigent plaintiff asserting a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 unless the case presents exceptional circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court, in a written order, considered the factors for determining whether to appoint counsel in this case and its decision was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Trejo\u2019s request for counsel is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">Regarding Trejo\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law, we cannot conduct the proper <em>de novo </em>review<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> without a copy of the transcript of the trial proceedings. We have held that \u201c[t]he failure of an appellant to provide a transcript is a proper ground for dismissal of the appeal.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in that case the court noted that the appellant, after the district court denied his motion for a transcript, did not reurge the motion with this court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, in contrast, Trejo did reurge his request for the transcript at the Government\u2019s expense with this court. We denied his request, finding the trial transcript was not necessary for Trejo\u2019s preparation of his brief. It is now plain that the transcript is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">Accordingly, we ORDER that the transcript be provided to Trejo at the Government\u2019s expense and allow both Trejo and Compton time to file briefs prepared with the benefit of the transcript.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
