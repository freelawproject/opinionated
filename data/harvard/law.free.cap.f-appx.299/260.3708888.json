The district court ruled that the civil action had not accrued because Tate did not allege or prove that the criminal proceedings had terminated in his favor, citing <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and <em>Brooks v. City of Winston-Salem, N.C., </em>85 F.3d 178 (4th Cir.1996). In his informal brief, Tate fails to address this dispositive issue. Therefore, Tate has waived appellate review of that issue. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (limiting review to issues raised in the informal brief); <em>see also Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (finding failure to raise issue in opening brief constituted abandonment of that issue). Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. <em>See Tate v. Hart, </em>No. 5:06-ct-03067-H (E.D.N.C. Oct. 10, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
