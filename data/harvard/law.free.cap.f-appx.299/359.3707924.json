He argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements he made to authorities both at the time he was detained by authorities and after he signed a <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>waiver. He specifically asserts that his statements at the time of his detention were not unsolicited and that his post-waiver confession was involuntary because it was induced by a promise of help from a federal agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-24\">The voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statement is reviewed de novo, but the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying the voluntariness determination are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>367 F.3d 452, 460-61 (5th Cir.2004). This court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and must take into account the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation. <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>62 F.3d 118, 121 (5th Cir.1995). \u201cWhere a district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion is based on live oral testimony, the clearly erroneous standard is particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>strong because the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness.\u201d <em>United, States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.8d 193, 197 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Vela-Melendez has not shown that his post-waiver confession was involuntary. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, there was no promise of help by a federal agent to Vela-Melendez. Because Vela-Melendez\u2019s post-waiver confession was properly found to be admissible, any error in failing to suppress his statements at the time he was detained was harmless. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>408 F.3d 214, 221 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Chapa-Garza, </em>62 F.3d at 122 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-18\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-25\">. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
