Miami-Dade Housing Agency, </em>501 F.3d 1241 (11th Cir.2007), mandated the dismissal. Appellant challenges the court\u2019s decision, arguing that <em>Pintando </em>is inapposite. We agree that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">In <em>Pintando, </em>the plaintiff invoked the district court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343, by seeking relief under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367, by seeking relief for violations of state law. After the defendant moved for summary judgment, the plaintiff moved the court for leave to amend his complaint. The court granted his motion, and he filed an amended complaint which deleted the Title VII claim and reasserted the state law claims. The court granted the defendant summary judgment on the state law claims, and the plaintiff appealed. We held that the amended complaint deprived the district court of supplemental jurisdiction; plaintiffs <em>voluntary </em>abandonment of the Title VII claim operated to divest the court of its federal question jurisdiction and with it the court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction to litigate the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In the case at hand, and as we observed in <em>In re Bayshore Ford Truck Sales, Inc., </em>\u201c[a]t the time the law suit was filed, the [district] court had subject matter jurisdiction based on the [plaintiffs\u2019] federal statutory claims.\u201d 471 F.3d 1233, 1241 n. 16 (11th Cir.2006). After the court <em>involuntarily </em>dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Automobile Dealers\u2019 Day in Court Act, the fact that plaintiffs, in their amended complaint, <em>voluntarily </em>deleted the claims brought under the Robinson-Patman Act, did not preclude the court from continuing to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">We see no difference in the instant scenario than a scenario in which the plaintiffs complaint contains one federal claim and one state law claim within the court\u2019s supplemental jurisdiction, and the court dismisses the federal claim under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), (c), or 56 and then decides, in the exercise of the discretion \u00a7 1367 affords it, to litigate the state law claim to judgment. We could not say that the court lost its subject matter jurisdiction once it dismissed the federal claim. Take the scenario one step further and suppose that the court, after announcing that it was retaining jurisdiction, allows the plaintiff to amend its complaint to restate the state law claim. Would this destroy the court\u2019s jurisdiction? We think not. That is, in effect, what occurred here \u2014 what we observed in <em>In re Bayshore Ford Truck Sales, Inc. </em>\u2014 plaintiffs amended their complaint, reasserting their state law claims, after the court dismissed involuntarily one of their federal statutory claims. If the district court is correct\u2014 that it lost jurisdiction once plaintiffs amended their complaint to restate their state law claims \u2014 then this court, in <em>In re Bayshore Ford Truck Sales, Inc., </em>surely missed the mark; it should have vacated the district court\u2019s order enjoining West-gate Ford Truck Sales, Inc. from prosecuting the Ohio class action, and instructed the district court to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. This court was fully aware of the fact that, at the time the case came before it on appeal, the only claims still pending before the district court were plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract claims; yet, it proceeded to entertain, and adjudicate, the appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The district court properly exercised its supplemental jurisdiction after involuntarily dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the Automobile Dealers\u2019 Day in Court Act. The fact that plaintiffs amended complaint did not contain their Robinson-Patman Act claims did not oust the court of supplemental jurisdiction. The judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
