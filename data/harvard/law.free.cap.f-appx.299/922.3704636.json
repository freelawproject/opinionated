He also appeals the reasonableness of his 60-month sentence imposed upon the revocation of his supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">Williams argues that the district court erred by failing to advise him of his rights (1) to confront adverse witnesses, (2) to be protected from compelled self-incrimination, (3) to testify and present evidence, and (4) to compel the attendance of defense witnesses. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 11(b)(1). Williams further argues that he was prejudiced by the district court\u2019s error because the government\u2019s case relied on wiretap evidence and possible testimony from co-defendants, experts, and other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Because Williams did not \u201cobject to a Rule 11 violation, we review only for plain error. To establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The \u201cdefendant ... must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">\u201cA court accepting a guilty plea must comply with Rule 11 and specifically address three \u2018core principles,\u2019 ensuring that a defendant (1) enters his guilt plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. The defendant\u2019s plea colloquy will generally be upheld if it adequately addresses Rule ll\u2019s core principles, even if the court failed to address a specific Rule 11 issue. <em>See United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">Here, Williams\u2019 written plea agreement included a paragraph outlining that he had the rights (1) to confront and cross-examine the government\u2019s proof, (2) to testify on his own behalf, but that he could not be compelled to do so, and (3) to present witnesses and evidence on his own behalf. Williams\u2019 right to compel witness attendance was not discussed at the Rule 11 hearing. Because the district court nevertheless adequately addressed Rule ll\u2019s three core principles and Williams has not shown that, but for the court\u2019s error, he would not have pleaded guilty, Williams\u2019 guilty pleas are not invalid. We accordingly affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">Williams next argues that the district court unreasonably imposed the statutory maximum sentence upon revoking his supervised release. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>7 recommended guidelines range for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Silva, </em>448 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We review for reasonableness the sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">A defendant whose supervised release term is revoked may not be required to serve \u201cmore than [60 months] in prison if the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a Class A felony____\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines recommends a range of 27 to 33 months for a Grade A violation with a category II criminal history if the defendant was on supervised release as a result of a sentence for a Class A felony. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2007). \u201cWhere the original sentence was the result of a downward departure ..., an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d \u00a7 7B1.4 cmt. n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Here, neither party disputes that the revocation of supervised release was mandatory, that Williams\u2019 original offense was a Class A felony, or that the applicable statutory maximum sentence was 60-months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court also explicitly considered the Chapter 7 guideline range. The court determined, however, that the range was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">The court instead imposed the statutory maximum sentence, which was reasonable under the circumstances. Williams previously received a substantial downward departure. His original sentence of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment was reduced to 148 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because he subsequently committed numerous violations while on supervised release, his upward departure for violating supervised release was warranted. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 7B1.4 cmt. n. 4. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 60-month sentence upon revoking Williams\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
