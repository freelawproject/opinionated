Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii), the IJ was authorized, in light of the totality of the circumstances, to base a credibility determination on the inconsistency between Jean-Baptiste\u2019s testimony and her prior statements. The record supports, and does not compel a conclusion contrary to, the determination that Jean-Baptiste\u2019s testimony was not credible and that Jean-Baptiste should have provided available evidence corroborating her otherwise credible testimony about her arrival in and life in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Because the IJ found that her testimony was not credible, Jean-Baptiste\u2019s uncorroborated testimony was insufficient to sustain her burden of proving her eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-18\">Jean-Baptiste argues that she established that she was persecuted or had a well-founded fear of persecution on account of, or at least in part on account of, an imputed political opinion. Because she did not raise this issue before the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-19\">In her petition for review, Jean-Baptiste has not raised, and thus has abandoned, any argument challenging the denial of her application for withholding of removal, the determination that the harm she suffered constituted persecution, and the determination that she failed to establish that being a family member of someone who had disappeared is one of the protected grounds. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-20\">Accordingly, Jean-Baptiste\u2019s petition for review is DENIED IN PART and DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
