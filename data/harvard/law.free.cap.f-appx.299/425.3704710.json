He was sentenced within the guidelines range to a 68-month term of imprisonment. Roman asserts that the district court failed to explain adequately its sentence and to consider that his criminal history was the result of his drug addiction. Because he faded to object on this basis in the district court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(July 25, 2008) (No. 08-5514). Under the circumstances of this case, the district court\u2019s explanation for imposing a sentence within the guidelines range is adequate to satisfy us \u201cthat [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-25\">Roman also contends that his sentence was excessive. Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the 16-level enhancement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is entitled to little deference because, like the crack cocaine guidelines at issue in <em>Kimbrough, </em>it is not empirically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>grounded and is therefore flawed, leading to systematic over-punishment, even in the \u201cmine-run case.\u201d Accordingly, he suggests that the presumption of reasonableness that usually attaches to within-guidelines sentences should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Our reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal a suggestion that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to guidelines sentences imposed under \u00a7 2L1.2. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by our decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case. After reviewing for procedural errors and considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we hold Roman fails to rebut that presumption of reasonableness. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
