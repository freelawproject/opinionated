On appeal, he argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his person and residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-25\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, this court reviews factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>382 F.3d 489, 494 (5th Cir.2004). The district court found that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception applied and denied Brown\u2019s motion to suppress. The good-faith exception provides that \u201cevidence obtained by officers in objectively reasonable good-faith reliance upon a search warrant is admissible, even though the affidavit on which the warrant was based was insufficient to establish probable cause.\u201d <em>United States v. Satterwhite, </em>980 F.2d 317, 320 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">Brown argues that the good-faith exception does not apply because the state magistrate who granted the search warrant was misled by \u201creckless, material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>omissions\u201d in the supporting affidavit. However, there is no indication in the record below that Brown argued that the affidavit was false or misleading. Because Brown failed to raise this issue below, he has waived it on appeal. <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>467 F.3d 912, 918-20 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Brown also argues that the affidavit was \u201cso lacking in indicia of probable cause that ... reliance upon it was objectively unreasonable.\u201d In general, \u201c[a]n officer may rely in good faith on the validity of a warrant so long as the warrant is supported by more than a \u2018bare bones affidavit.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros, </em>112 F.3d 1272, 1278 (5th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Alix, </em>86 F.3d 429, 435 (5th Cir.1996)). In the instant case, the warrant was not based on a \u201cbare bones\u201d affidavit. Even if we were to find that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause, it still is sufficient to establish the \u201cfacial validity\u201d of the warrant. <em>See United States v. McKnight, </em>953 F.2d 898, 905 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, Brown has not shown that the district court erred in applying the good-faith exception and denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We previously ordered supplemental briefing on several sentencing issues. However, the district court recently granted the Government\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion and reduced Brown\u2019s sentence, which effectively granted Brown the relief he sought in his supplemental briefs. Therefore, we do not address Brown\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
