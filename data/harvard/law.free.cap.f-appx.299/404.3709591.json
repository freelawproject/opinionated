Barraza-Munoz argues that in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), his sentence should be vacated and remanded. He asserts that this court\u2019s precedent improperly restricted the district court\u2019s ability to deviate from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Guidelines absent extraordinary circumstances, a standard rejected in <em>Gall. </em>Barraza-Munoz also challenges the imposition of a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, asserting that the Guideline is flawed and not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">At sentencing, Barraza-Munoz generally argued that the guidelines range was excessive for this offense and that he should receive a below-guidelines sentence, but he did not raise the specific challenges to his sentence that he raises here: that the sentencing regime was unduly restrictive and the 16-level enhancement flawed and not entitled to deference. Accordingly, we review those arguments for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 387-88 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Barraza-Munoz fails to provide evidence sufficient to support either of his claims, and the record does not reveal any additional support. We follow our holdings on similar challenges in <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez </em>and <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>and we conclude that Barraza-Munoz has failed to demonstrate any reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
