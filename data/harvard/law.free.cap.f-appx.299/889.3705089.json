Next, Chupurdy argues that the court erred in its application of the two-level increase for possession of a firearm, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) because, he claims, the weapons he admitted that he possessed were kept aboard his 78-foot catamaran, the \u201cCAT\u2019S MEOW,\u201d solely for protection from pirates. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>I. LAW &amp; ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">A. Section lB1.8\u2019s Cooperation-Agreement Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination of the drug quantity for which Chupurdy is accountable. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005). Where a defendant alleges a violation of \u00a7 1B1.8 in the district court, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cFor a factual finding to be \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 this court, \u2018after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Section 1B1.8 provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-8\">[w]here a defendant agrees to cooperate with the government by providing information concerning unlawful activities of others, and as part of the cooperation agreement the government agrees that self-incriminating information provided pursuant to the agreement will not be used against the defendant, then such information shall not be used in determining the applicable guideline range</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a). However, the provision expressly provides that, <em>inter alia, </em>it \u201cshall not be applied to restrict the use of information ... known to the government prior to entering the agreement.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(b)(l). In addition, we have held that \u201cso long as the information is obtained from independent sources ..., it may be used at sentencing without violating \u00a7 1B1.8.\u201d <em>Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1244. \u201cHowever, \u2018the government may not evade U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8(a) where the evidence was elicited solely as a result of, or prompted by, the defendant\u2019s cooperation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">The district court did not clearly err in holding Chupurdy accountable for 3,488.2 kilograms of marijuana, which included the marijuana equivalency of 47.09 kilograms of hashish oil that was found in the two storage sheds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Law enforcement agents had obtained search warrants for the storage sheds prior to Chupurdy\u2019s arrest and disclosure, and one of the agents testified at Chupurdy\u2019s sentencing hearing that (1) agents were preparing to execute the warrants at the time of Chupurdy\u2019s disclosure, and (2) the warrants would have been executed regardless of whether Chupurdy agreed to cooperate. Thus, Chupurdy\u2019s disclosure did not prompt agents to search those locations. In other words, the hashish oil discovered in the storage sheds was not elicited <em>solely </em>as a result of Chupurdy\u2019s cooperation, even though agents were unaware of its existence prior to Chupurdy\u2019s disclosure. <em>See Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1244. As such, the district court\u2019s calculation of Chupurdy\u2019s base offense level did not violate \u00a7 1B1.8(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">B. Two-level firearm increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s findings of fact under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for clear error, and the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1280-81 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cThe district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>court\u2019s factual findings for purposes of sentencing may be based on, among other things, evidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). Application Note 3 of the provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-5\">The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense. For example, the enhancement would not be applied if the defendant, arrested at his residence, had an unloaded hunting rifle in the closet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3). \u201cThe government has the burden under \u00a7 2D1.1 to demonstrate the proximity of the firearm to the site of the charged offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir.2001). The government need not prove that the firearm was used to facilitate the distribution of drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 1289-90. \u201cIf the government is successful, the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that a connection between the weapon and the offense was \u2018clearly improbable.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Chupurdy\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is without merit. Chupurdy concedes that the government met its burden, thus, Chupurdy was required to demonstrate that a connection between the weapons and the offense was clearly improbable, which he has failed to do. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289. Although Chupurdy claims that the weapons were onboard the CAT\u2019S MEOW to protect the crew from pirates, his claim does not diminish the likelihood that the weapons also could have been used to protect the large quantities of drugs that were being transported.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289. Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err in applying the two-level increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\">. As a result of the charges in two separate indictments filed in the Southern District of Georgia (\"CR407-00223\u201d) and the District of South Carolina (\"CR407-00312\u201d), Chupurdy pled guilty to: (1) importation of 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a), CR407-00223/Count 2; (2) conspiracy to import 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963, CR407-00312/ Count 1; (3) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, CR407-00312/Count 2; and (4) money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), CR407-00312/Count 3. Chupurdy received concurrent sentences of 220 months\u2019 imprisonment for all four convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\">. Some of the hashish oil (24.23 kilograms) was recovered from a search of Chupurdy's smaller Bertram boat that had been taken to one of the storage sheds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b915-16\">. The hashish oil that was found at the bottom of the ocean was not included in the calculation of Chupurdy's base offense level. Thus, to the extent Chupurdy argues otherwise, his argument lacks merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b916-8\">. This is true regardless of the other crew members\u2019 failure to admit to the weapons\u2019 whereabouts and Chupurdy\u2019s forthcomingness with authorities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
