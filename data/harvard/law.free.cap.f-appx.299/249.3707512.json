The conviction arose out of a routine traffic stop; Freeman was stopped by Officer Hogue because he was operating a moped in excess of the thirty miles per hour permitted for such a vehicle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the stop, Hogue observed that Freeman lacked not only a license plate but a driver\u2019s license, registration, and insurance. Freeman consented to a pat-down, during which a firearm fell out of Freeman\u2019s pants onto the concrete. The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>triet court denied Freeman\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">On appeal, Freeman contends that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress the firearm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that because the arresting officer had neither articulable facts nor probable cause for the stop, the stop violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Legal conclusions underlying the denial of a motion to suppress are reviewed de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Branch, </em>537 F.3d 328, 337 (4th Cir.2008). \u201cObserving a traffic violation provides sufficient justification for a police officer to detain the offending vehicle for as long as it takes to perform the traditional incidents of a routine traffic stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 335. In the course of a routine traffic stop, an officer can ask for driver\u2019s license and registration and perform a computer check on these before issuing a citation. <em>United States v. Farri- or, </em>535 F.3d 210, 217 (4th Cir.2008). \u201cAny further investigative detention, however, is beyond the scope of the <em>Terry </em>[392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) ] stop and therefore illegal unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion of a serious crime or the individual consents to the further detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Freeman\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that Hogue was not qualified to determine whether the moped was capable of a speed higher than thirty miles per hour on hilly terrain; therefore, his determination that Freeman was speeding was a mere hunch that did not justify the traffic stop. However, as the district court found, Hogue tested Freeman\u2019s speed with a radar gun and followed him for two miles to assess the moped\u2019s speed, which was over forty-five miles per hour. Based on that evidence, Hogue concluded that Freeman\u2019s moped was propelling itself in excess of thirty miles per hour, and therefore was a motor vehicle subject to state licensing and registration requirements. Based on these facts, we conclude that the district court did not err in concluding Officer Hogue had a reasonable suspicion that Freeman was violating the law and the stop was therefore justified. <em>Branch, </em>537 F.3d at 335. Accordingly, the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">We affirm Freeman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-15\">. Under North Carolina law, a moped is excluded from the definition of a motor vehicle. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-4.01(23) (2007). Pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-4.01(27)(dl) (2007), a moped is defined in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 105-164.3(22) (2007), as follows: \"A vehicle that has two or three wheels, no external shifting device, and a motor that does not exceed 50 cubic centimeters piston displacement and cannot propel the vehicle at a speed greater than 30 miles per hour on a level surface.\u201d Under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-51(9) (2007), a moped is \"exempt from the requirement of registration and certificate of title\u201d applicable to motor vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">.
