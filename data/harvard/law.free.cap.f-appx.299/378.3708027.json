Rhymer was sentenced to 57 months of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release. Rhymer now appeals, challenging only her sentence. She does so on two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">First, Rhymer contends that the district court erred in determining the intended loss amount for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1. Specifically, Rhymer contends that the aggregate credit limit of four unused credit-card convenience checks should not have been included. This is especially so, she asserts, because the credit limit was not used in determining the intended loss amount related to an unused credit card in Rhymer\u2019s possession at the time of her arrest. Rhymer insists that the two devices are functionally equivalent and that they should have been treated the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Our decision in <em>United States v. Sowels, </em>998 F.2d 249 (5th Cir.1993), is applicable here. In <em>Sowels </em>we upheld the use of the aggregate credit limit of the unused stolen credit cards to determine the intended loss amount. <em>Sowels, </em>998 F.2d at 250-52. As Rhymer was arrested before she ended or withdrew from the offense, the fact that the checks were unused does nothing to rebut the evidence that she intended to access the credit limits available via the unused stolen convenience checks. <em>See id. </em>at 251. Under <em>Sowels, </em>the district court also could have used the credit limit to determine the intended loss amount relative to the unused credit card to which Rhymer refers. The fact that it chose not to do so, however, does not justify or require reducing the intended loss amount relative to the unused credit card convenience checks. The district court did not clearly err in determining the intended loss amount for purposes of \u00a7 2B1.1. <em>See United States v. Messervey, </em>317 F.3d 457, 464 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">Second, Rhymer contends that the district court improperly applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i). That enhancement applies when the offense involves \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain other means of identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is undisputed that Rhymer used another woman\u2019s personal information to obtain a false identification card that bore Rhymer\u2019s photograph and a name slightly different from the name of the woman whose information was stolen. It is also undisputed that Rhymer intended to negotiate a third party\u2019s check using that false identification card.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">Rhymer nevertheless asserts that \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) is inapplicable because she obtained the woman\u2019s personal information legally, and the Guideline requires that the victim\u2019s identifying information be obtained through unlawful means. Although there is no caselaw addressing this point, the plain text of the Guideline does not support Rhymer\u2019s contention. As Rhymer\u2019s use of the woman\u2019s personal information to obtain an identification card <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>bearing a false name was not authorized, the enhancement applies on its face. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) and cmt. n. 9(C)(i), (ii)(I) and (II).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Rhymer further contends that \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i) is inapplicable because she did not use the false identification card in the commission of the instant offense. The Sentencing Guidelines define the term \u201coffense\u201d more broadly than does Rhymer. An offense generally includes the offense of conviction and any relevant conduct under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(H). Here, Rhymer used the false identification card in an attempt to avoid detection or responsibility for the offense of conviction, and the false identification card was used in connection with an ongoing series of offenses involving stolen mail. Thus, Rhymer\u2019s acquisition and use of the card were properly considered as conduct relevant to the offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.3(a)(1) and (2); <em>United, States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). The district court did not err in applying the two-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(10)(C)(i). <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
