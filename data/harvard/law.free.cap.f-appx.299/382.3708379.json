He argues that his conviction should be vacated on plain error review because a Border Patrol agent testified, under questioning from Pope\u2019s attorney, that Pope had invoked his right to remain silent after authorities read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pope relies on the holding in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-20, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), that a prosecutor may not use a defendant\u2019s silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, to suggest, for impeachment purposes, that the defendant\u2019s exculpatory story was made up at a later time.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">The testimony arose after the Border Patrol agent testified that Pope admitted being present during at least part of the time during which the trailer he was hauling, containing marijuana, was being loaded. Pope\u2019s attorney tried to undermine that testimony by pointing out that the agent never wrote down Pope\u2019s statement in his report. Pressing the agent, the attorney asserted that the agent \u201ccould have had [Pope] sign a statement ... based on ... what you stated he told you?\u201d The agent explained that such was not possible, because Pope refused to make a statement after he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Pope concedes that his refusal to make a statement after being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights was not mentioned again, even in the government\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Because Pope\u2019s attorney elicited the agent\u2019s testimony, <em>United States v. Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d 1378, 1383 (5th Cir.1975); <em>see also Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619 n. 11, 96 S.Ct. 2240 (citing <em>Fairchild, </em>505 F.2d at 1383), we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-13\">. <em>See Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (\"[W]hen an individual is taken into custody ... [h]e must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
