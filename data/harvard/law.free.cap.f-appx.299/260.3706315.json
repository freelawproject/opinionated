We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that the complaint is subject to dismissal without prejudice for insufficient service of process.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-24\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court in its analysis of the service of process issue. <em>See Shaw v. Beaufort County Sheriffs Office, </em>No. 9:05-cv-03253-SB, 2007 WL 2903940 (D.S.C. Oct. 1, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-20\"> Because we agree with the district court that service of process was not properly effected, we have not considered, and do not address, the court's alternative conclusion that Shaw\u2019s complaint fails on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
