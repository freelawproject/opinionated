The district court sentenced Griffin to 180 months in prison, which was the statutory minimum sentence as a result of Griffin\u2019s prior convictions for \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d and his status as an armed career criminal. \u00a7 924(e)(1). On appeal, Griffin argues that the district court erred in concluding that his prior felonies constituted crimes of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-19\">The Government has filed a motion to dismiss Griffin\u2019s appeal, arguing that this appeal is barred by the appellate waiver provision in Griffin\u2019s written plea agreement. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Griffin waived his right to appeal his conviction and sentence on any ground whatsoever. Although Griffin acknowledges the appellate waiver provision in his plea agreement, he argues that during his rearraignment and in his objections to the presentence report, he reserved his right to challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-20\">This court reviews de novo whether a waiver of appeal bars an appeal. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). To determine the validity of an appeal waiver, this court conducts a two-step inquiry, asking 1) whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary and 2) whether, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at issue. <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). In determining whether a waiver applies, this court employs ordinary principles of contract interpretation, construing waivers narrowly and against the Government. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>United, States v. Palmer, </em>456 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In the present case, Griffin signed the plea agreement, certified that he read the agreement, reviewed the agreement with his attorney, and understood and voluntarily consented to the agreement. At his rearraignment, Griffin confirmed that he read and signed the plea agreement, including the appellate waiver provision, and that he understood and agreed to its terms and conditions. Thus, Griffin\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The record further reflects that, during Griffin\u2019s rearraignment, defense counsel asserted a reservation of rights, which was ambiguous at best. In response to the PSR, however, defense counsel resolved any ambiguity when he asserted the following: \u201cDefendant denies that his prior convictions of strong arm robbery are factually or legally sufficient to trigger [the armed career offender enhancement] and reserves his right to challenge said conclusions at his sentencing hearing.\u201d Griffin\u2019s attorney\u2019s comments did not alter the plain language of the waiver. <em>See Bond, </em>414 F.3d at 544; <em>Palmer, </em>456 F.3d at 488. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
