Carter\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s text order denying his motion to compel performance of a cooperation agreement Carter alleged he had with the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-24\">We cannot discern from the record the basis for the district court\u2019s order. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand this case for further proceedings. On remand, the district court should first consider whether it has jurisdiction to consider Carter\u2019s motion. If the district court finds it has jurisdiction, the court should then instruct the Government to respond to Carter\u2019s motion and proceed accordingly. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-25\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
