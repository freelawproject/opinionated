After careful review, we deny his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">When considering a petition to review a BIA final order, we review legal issues <em>de novo. Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001). The BIA\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 (11th Cir.2001). Under this test, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1284 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse a factual finding by the BIA, [we] must find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion, but that it compels one.\u201d <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). We review only the BIA decision except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) opinion or reasoning. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. In this case, the BIA expressly adopted the IJ\u2019s decision and expanded on the decision in its own opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">An alien, who is present in the United States, may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of DHS have discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJAL\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself ... of the protection of, that country <em>because of </em>persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The alien carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">While the INA does not define persecution, we have held that \u201c[p]ersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). A well-founded fear of future persecution may be established by showing a reasonable possibility of personal future persecution that cannot be avoided by relocating within the subject country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1), (2); <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231. If the BIA finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of his country, he cannot demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(b)(1)-(2), 208.16(b)(1)-(2); <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">The well-founded fear inquiry has both a subjective and objective component \u2014 that is, the applicant must show that his fear is \u201csubjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. \u201cThe subjective component is generally satisfied by the applicant\u2019s credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he objective prong can be fulfilled either by establishing past persecution or that he ... has a \u2018good reason to fear future persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). \u201cDemonstrating such a connection requires the alien to present specific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he ... will be <em>singled out </em>for persecution on account of\u2019 a statutory factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1287 (quotations omitted). \u201c[E]vidence that either is consistent with acts of private violence or the petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas ..., does not constitute evidence of persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, when family remains in the country of origination without persecution, the petitioner\u2019s fear of future persecution may be undermined. <em>See id. </em>at 1259.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">On the record here, substantial evidence supports the determination that Marin was not eligible for asylum because he did not show that he reasonably feared future persecution on account of his political opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Marin admitted that he was not a member of a political party and his assistance to a politically involved uncle was \u201cnothing like in the campaign or voting or anything like that.\u201d Further, Marin\u2019s testimony and statements indicated that the FARC desired to recruit him because of his computer skills and did not resort to actions beyond phone calls and in-person, nonviolent requests. That the FARC targeted Marin because he failed to cooperate does not constitute persecution on account of political opinion. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1258 (holding that a petitioner\u2019s failure to cooperate with guerillas does not constitute evidence of persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Moreover, these phone calls and in-person requests do not compel the conclusion the Marin will be singled out for future persecution on account of his political opinion. <em>See Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1239 (holding that persecution is more than incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation). Nor can we ignore the fact that Marin\u2019s mother continued residence in Cali, Colombia without persecution. <em>See Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1259. In short, substantial evidence supports the determination that Marin was not entitled to asylum because he failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of political opinion. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-15\">. During his appeal to the BIA, Marin filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal and brief, which we liberally construe. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-16\">. Because Marin concedes on appeal that he did not demonstrate past persecution before the IJ, and does not develop in his appellate brief arguments related to the subjection to withholding of removal or protection under United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, he has abandoned these issues. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-7\">. Because substantial evidence independently supports the conclusion that Marin did not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on his political opinion, we need not address whether the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
