Nguyen argues that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court failed to account for a fact that should have received significant weight, that is, that the assault was not an act of premeditated retaliation but instead was triggered by the victim\u2019s \u201cstaring down\u201d Nguyen.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain a duty to consider the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews the sentence imposed for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-18\">We must first determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the district court\u2019s decision is procedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... takfing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A <em>post-Booker </em>discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-21\">Although Nguyen argued in favor of a sentence below the guidelines range, he has failed to rebut the presumption that the sentence imposed was reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>The record reflects that the district court carefully considered Nguyen\u2019s arguments, read letters of support on Nguyen\u2019s behalf, and heard testimony from both Nguyen and his sister. The district court noted, however, that the offense was a \u201cvery serious\u201d one that has the effect of deterring individuals from reporting crimes and cooperating with the Government. Further, the district court considered the factors and statutory concerns set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the seriousness of the offense, Nguyen\u2019s criminal history, as well as the need to protect the public, to provide respect for the law, and to provide adequate deterrence against future criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The district court considered the proper factors and adequately explained the sentence being given. In light of the deference due to the district court\u2019s sentencing decisions, there was no abuse of discretion. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Nguyen\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
