In addition, he argues that the IJ erred by requiring Torres to establish country-wide persecution and the feasibility and practicality of relocating in Peru. Finally, Torres argues that the IJ erred by requiring him to show proof of his membership in a political party to support his claim of persecution based upon imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">We review the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Nreka v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005). Because the BIA in this case affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s analysis as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>Id. We </em>review legal issues <em>de novo, Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247-48 (11th Cir.2001), and \u201cadministrative fact findings under the highly deferential substantial evidence test,\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Under the substantial evidence test, we must \u201creview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. Under this test, we must affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal punctuation omitted). To reverse the BIA\u2019s factual finding, we not only must conclude that the record supports such a conclusion, but compels it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-18\">\u201cThe testimony of the applicant, if credible, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), 208.16(b). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>sence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2006). We have held that the IJ must \u201cdetermine credibility, and [we will] not substitute [our] judgment for that of the IJ -with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, we will defer to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding as we would any factual finding, unless the evidence compels us to do otherwise. <em>Id. </em>That said, \u201cthe IJ must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">In addition, the IJ \u201cmust make clean determinations of credibility.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201 (holding that the IJ\u2019s references to Yang\u2019s claim as a \u201cridiculous fabrication\u201d and Yang\u2019s testimony as \u201cextremely inconsistent\u201d did not constitute an adverse credibility finding). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citations omitted). \u201c[A]n adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application\u201d when there is no other evidence of persecution. <em>Id. </em>However, an adverse credibility determination does not alleviate the IJ\u2019s duty to consider other evidence produced by the asylum applicant. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf an applicant produces evidence beyond his own testimony, it is not sufficient for the IJ to rely solely on an adverse credibility determination in those instances.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>440 F.3d at 1255. \u201c[T]he weaker the applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang, </em>418 F.3d at 1201. \u201c[I]f the [IJ] does not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. If the factfinder determines that corroborating evidence is available, we cannot reverse such finding unless compelled to do so. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">\u201cAn alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum, which the Attorney General has discretion to grant if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u2018refugee.\u2019\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005) (citing INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1), (b)(1)). In pertinent part, INA \u00a7 101 defines a refugee as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqQ\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ... who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). A refugee seeking asylum \u201ccarries the burden of proving [her] statutory \u2018refugee\u2019 status and thereby establishing asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">\u201cTo establish asylum eligibility based on political opinion or any other protected ground, the alien must, with credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of her political opinion or any other protected ground, or (2) a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that her political opinion or any other protected ground will cause future persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1230-31. We have held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-11\">To establish asylum based on past persecution, the applicant must prove (1) that she was persecuted, and (2) that the persecution was on account of a protected ground. To establish eligibility for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution, the applicant must prove (1) a \u2018subjectively genuine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>objectively reasonable\u2019 fear of persecution that is (2) on account of a protected ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-6\"><em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1236 (11th Cir.2006) (internal citation omitted). Nevertheless, an alien need not demonstrate that he would, in the future, be singled out for persecution if he can demonstrate, among other things, that \u201cthere is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated\u201d to him on the basis of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, [petitioner] must have established that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened on account of a statutorily protected factor if returned to [the country of removal].\u201d <em>Silva, </em>448 F.3d at 1243 (citing INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)). \u201cWhere an applicant is unable to meet the Veil-founded fear\u2019 standard for asylum, [s]he is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of [removal].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets in original) (quoting <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">While the INA does not specifically define persecution, this Court has acknowledged that \u201c\u2018persecution\u2019 is an \u2018extreme concept,\u2019 requiring \u2018more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u2019 and that \u2018[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (citation omitted) (brackets in original). \u201cNot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000). We have held that the accumulation of two beatings, threatening phone calls, and being kidnaped for 18 days amounted to past persecution. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 766 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. In this case, the IJ provided specific and cogent reasons for his adverse credibility determination, which was supported by a number of inconsistencies in Torres\u2019s initial application, asylum interview, and testimony. Thus, substantial evidence supports the denial of Torres\u2019s claim for asylum. Because Torres has not met his burden of proof with respect to the asylum claim, he also has not met his burden with respect to his claim for withholding of removal under the INA. Because Torres testimony was incredible and never established past persecution, the IJ correctly never shifted the burden to the government to establish countrywide persecution or the feasibility and practicality of relocation in Peru. Finally, there is nothing in the record to substantiate Torres\u2019s claim that the IJ required Torres to show proof of his membership in a political party to sustain persecution based upon imputed political opinion. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
