The district court denied Moreno Ruiz\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. \u201cOnce the district court certifies that an IFP appeal is not taken in good faith, prisoners, like nonprisoners, cannot appeal unless prepared to pay the full filing fee, deposits, and other costs.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-200 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Moreno Ruiz is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-14\">The district court dismissed Moreno Ruiz\u2019s Bivens<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. Moreno Ruiz argues that the district court erred in ruling on his complaint before he could conduct discovery. Moreno Ruiz has not made even speculative allegations as to what information discovery would have revealed and has therefore not demonstrated the requisite prejudice to prevail on such a claim. <em>See Gorham v. Wainwright, </em>588 F.2d 178, 180 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-15\">Moreno Ruiz was deported while this case was pending. Accordingly, to the extent that he seeks injunctive relief or specific performance regarding his complaints about the conditions of his confinement, his claims are moot. <em>See Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">Moreno Ruiz argues that the district court failed to consider several issues raised in his original complaint that were not renewed in his amended complaint. Ordinarily, an amended complaint supersedes an original complaint and renders it of no legal effect \u201cunless the amended complaint specifically refers to and adopts or incorporates by reference the earlier pleading.\u201d <em>King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1994). Moreno Ruiz\u2019s amended complaint describes itself as \u201cexpanding\u201d the complaint. Even if this language was sufficient to preserve the claims in Moreno Ruiz\u2019s original complaint, his claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Moreno Ruiz argues that his right to privacy was violated because he was denied a comfortable tee-shirt and was given only a rough, red shirt with which to cover himself in front of female guards; he was not given two hours of outdoor recreation time daily; and he was not taken to see a barber for almost three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\u201c[T]he Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the imposition of conditions of confinement on pretrial detainees that constitute punishment.\u201d <em>Collins v. Ainsworth, </em>382 F.3d 529, 540 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). However, \u201cthe Constitution is not concerned with a <em>de minimis </em>level of imposition on pretrial detainees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] pretrial detainee cannot be subjected to conditions or restrictions that are not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, Miss., </em>74 F.3d 633, 640 (5th Cir.1996) <em>(en </em>banc). Moreno Ruiz has not alleged facts that support his claim that the conditions \u201care not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose\u201d or that the conditions about which Moreno Ruiz complains are more than <em>de minimis </em>inconveniences that do not implicate his constitutional rights. <em>See Collins, </em>382 F.3d at 545; <em>Hare, </em>74 F.3d at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Moreno Ruiz also argues that his due process rights were denied when he was placed in protective administrative segregation for eleven days without a hearing. This complaint implicates \u201can episodic act or omission\u201d and is therefore reviewed under the deliberate indifference standard. <em>See Edwards v. Johnson, </em>209 F.3d 772, 778 (5th Cir.2000). Moreno Ruiz has alleged no facts to support a determination of deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Moreno Ruiz argues that he was denied access to the courts because the law library at the El Paso Processing Center did not comport with minimum constitutional standards; he was not provided a phone book when he requested one; and the prison did not mail, free of cost, two envelopes from Moreno Ruiz to the U.N.\u2019s High Commissioner of Human Rights in Switzerland. Moreno Ruiz has not alleged how the lack of the legal materials, lack of access to a phone book, and denial of free-of-eost postage caused him an actual injury as is required to prevail on a denial of access to the courts claim. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>see also Mann v. Smith, </em>796 F.2d 79, 83-84 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">As Moreno Ruiz has not demonstrated that his appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits, his request for <em>in forma pauperis </em>status is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Moreno Ruiz is warned that the filing of further frivolous appeals will result in sanctions. <em>See Farguson v. MBank Houston, N.A., </em>808 F.2d 358, 359 (5th Cir. 1986). These sanctions may include dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. In light of this sanction warning, Moreno Ruiz is directed to review any other appeals pending in this court and to withdraw any appeal that is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
