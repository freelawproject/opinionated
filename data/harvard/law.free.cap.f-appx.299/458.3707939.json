In the complaint, which was filed on May 23, 2005, Anderson alleged that he was injured on May 3, 2004, when he was attacked by another inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">The defendant, Warden Tim Wilkerson, filed an answer and a motion for summary judgment. Based on the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court concluded that Anderson\u2019s complaint was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The district court granted Warden Wilkerson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Anderson\u2019s complaint with prejudice as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-22\">Anderson argues that his complaint was not untimely. Anderson is correct. The record reveals that Anderson\u2019s pursuit of administrative remedies relating to the May 3, 2004, attack concluded on June 27, 2004. The one-year Louisiana prescriptive period was tolled during the pendency of Anderson\u2019s administrative complaint. <em>See Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153,160 (5th Cir.1999). Therefore, Anderson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint, filed on May 23, 2005, was not barred by the applicable statute of limitations. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-23\">The judgment of the district court is hereby vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-24\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
