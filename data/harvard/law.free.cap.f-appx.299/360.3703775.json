Culpepper appeals the November 19, 2007 Final Judgment of the district court, separately rendered to effectuate the court\u2019s Order on Report and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge of October 22, 2007, overruling Culpepper\u2019s objections, approving and accepting said Report and Recommendation, granting the several dismissal motions of the various defendants, and dismissing Culpepper\u2019s myriad claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>against the multitude of defendants. As Culpepper and all parties defendant have urged that oral argument not be heard in this appeal, we have carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including, without limitation, the exhaustive Report and Recommendation of the magistrate judge and the Order of the district court thereon, as a result of which we are convinced that the Final Judgment of the district court should be affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
