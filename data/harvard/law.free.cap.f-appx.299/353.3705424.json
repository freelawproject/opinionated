He was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release. On appeal, Jimenez-Herrera argues only that his prior state conviction of possession of a controlled substance did not constitute an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">We do not reach the merits of the issue that he presents. Because Jimenez-Herrera has prior to this date been released from federal custody and removed from the United States, he is subject only to an undischarged term of supervised release. We cannot grant what he requests because resentencing would require him to be present at a hearing to consider a new sentence; his deportation creates a legal bar to such an appearance. <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007). This appeal has therefore become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b378-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
