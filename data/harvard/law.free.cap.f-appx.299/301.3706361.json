In Appeal No. 08-6527, Polk\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Counsel questions whether the district court erred in concluding that Polk posed a substantial risk of danger to others as a result of his mental disorder. Polk has filed a pro se supplemental informal brief in each appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-21\">After a hearing, the district court found by clear and convincing evidence that Polk \u201ccontinues to suffer from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another.\u201d (J.A. at 33). Our thorough review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that continued civil commitment was warranted. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 856 (4th Cir.2005) (providing standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">Accordingly, we affirm the order of the district court. We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-18\"> We have reviewed carefully the issues raised in the pro se supplemental informal briefs and find them to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
