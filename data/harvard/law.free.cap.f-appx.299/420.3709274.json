He appeals these convictions as well as the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment imposed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">Whitehead argues that the district court erred in its determination that his confession was voluntary. He contends that law enforcement officers coerced his confession by threatening to arrest his wife if he did not provide information regarding his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">\u201cWhile the ultimate determination of voluntariness is a question of law reviewed de novo, this court must accept the factual conclusions underlying the district court\u2019s determination of voluntariness unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d 142, 170 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cA confession is voluntary if, under the totality of the circumstances, the statement is the product of the accused\u2019s free and rational choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">The district court heard testimony from a law enforcement officer regarding the events surrounding Whitehead\u2019s arrest, and it also heard Whitehead\u2019s version of the events. Consistent with the testimony of the law enforcement officer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>district court found that the officers had not threatened to arrest Whitehead\u2019s wife. The district court found that the officers attempted to accommodate Whitehead by making sure that the children present in the house would have proper care. The district court also found, based on Whitehead\u2019s demeanor and history, that Whitehead could not have been persuaded to make a statement based on a promise that his wife would not be arrested if he cooperated. These factual findings, which underlie the district court\u2019s ultimate determination that Whitehead\u2019s confession was voluntary, are not clearly erroneous. <em>See Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d at 170; <em>United States v. Shabazz, </em>993 F.2d 431, 438 (5th Cir.1993). Whitehead has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his confession was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Whitehead also argues that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) because his prior Texas convictions for delivery of a controlled substance and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance are broader than the definition of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d found in the federal statutes. This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Sandle, </em>123 F.3d 809, 811-12 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cAlthough Sandle would have us look to the more restrictive definition of \u2018controlled substance offense\u2019 under section 4B1.2(2) of the Sentencing Guidelines, we have no need to utilize the guidelines where the statute plainly mandates a more severe sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 812. Whitehead\u2019s Texas convictions meet the definition of \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Whitehead\u2019s contention that an offense involving the possession of a controlled substance should not be used for enhancement under \u00a7 841 absent a showing of intent to engage in the transfer or trafficking of drugs is likewise foreclosed by <em>Sandle. </em>\u201cNothing in the statutory definition of \u2018felony drug offense\u2019 suggests that the term is limited to those possession offenses involving an additional intent element.\u201d <em>Sandle, </em>123 F.3d at 812. Whitehead\u2019s convictions under Texas law for possession of cocaine were properly considered prior felony drug offenses under the enhancement provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
