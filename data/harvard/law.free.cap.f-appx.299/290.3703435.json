Christian seek to appeal the district court\u2019s orders denying relief on their tax refund suit and related constitutional claims, as well as its post-judgment orders denying their motions for reconsideration and recusal of the district court judge. We have reviewed the record\u2018and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Christian v. United States, </em>No. 1:06-cv-01437-MJG (D.Md. Feb. 1, 2008; filed Jan. 9, 2008 and entered Jan. 11, 2008; March 12, 2008). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>In light of this disposition, we deny as moot the Appellee\u2019s motions to strike and for extension of time to file a second brief. We also deny the Appellants\u2019 motions to strike the Appellee\u2019s brief, for judicial notice, to compel a stipulation of facts, for summary judgment, and to suspend Fed. R.App. P. 2. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
