He argues that the BIA should have exercised its authority under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003) to reopen the removal proceedings against him sua sponte and remand his case to allow the immigration judge to consider his application for the Temporary Protected Status program. The BIA held that Perdomo-Ulloa\u2019s motion was untimely and did not warrant the reopening of the removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-21\">This court cannot undertake review of an agency\u2019s discretionary determination where there is \u201cno meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). There are no guidelines directing the BIA\u2019s decision whether to reopen removal proceedings on its own motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). Therefore, this court has no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny Perdomo-Ulloa\u2019s untimely motion to reopen. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-22\">Accordingly, Perdomo-Ulloa\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
