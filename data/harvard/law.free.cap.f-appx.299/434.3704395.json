Strempel disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423, and Strempel challenged the denial in district court. The court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s denial, a decision that Strempel appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">On March 12, 2004, Strempel applied for disability insurance benefits, alleging a disability onset date of November 26, 2001, due to migraine headaches, depression, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and hypertension. Following the Commissioner\u2019s initial denial of Strempel\u2019s claims, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing on September 13, 2005, at Strempel\u2019s request. Strempel appeared at the hearing and testified with the assistance of an attorney. Her husband, Gerald Ray Strempel, also testified. A vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d) was present and testified as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-18\">On December 16, 2005, the ALJ rendered a decision unfavorable to Strempel, finding that she was not disabled within the meaning of the Act and was not entitled to the requested benefits. The ALJ first found that Strempel had engaged in substantial gainful activity during the period from March through December 2003 and that she was therefore not disabled during that period. Next, the ALJ considered the remainder of the period since Strempel\u2019s asserted disability onset date. The ALJ determined that the migraine headaches, depression, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and hypertension Strempel alleged were \u201csevere\u201d within the meaning of Social Security regulations, but that they were \u201cnot \u2018severe\u2019 enough to meet or medically equal,\u201d either singly or in combination, one of the impairments listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">In so determining, the ALJ found Strempel\u2019s allegation that she is completely unable to sustain competitive work to be \u201cless than credible.\u201d Although he gave her the \u201cbenefit of the doubt as to her subjective complaints of pain and depressive symptoms\u201d and took her obesity into account, the ALJ determined that Strempel retained the residual functional capaci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ty (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform a significant range of \u201clight work\u201d as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567. Citing the Physical Residual Functional Capacity Assessment performed by Dr. James Wright, the state agency medical consultant, on April 23, 2004, the ALJ found that Strempel \u201cretained and retains the residual functional capacity to lift and/or carry 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently, stand and/or walk 6 hours in an 8-hour workday, push and/or pull limited to the weights given above, with no other limitations noted.\u201d He further found that she \u201cwas and is able to understand, remember, and carry out detailed, but not complex[,] instructions, [and] respond appropriately to supervisors and coworkers in jobs that do not require independent decision making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Finally, the ALJ found that Strempel had done past relevant work as a system programmer, a project director, and an administrative assistant. He relied on the YE\u2019s testimony to find that Strempel could return to work similar to that which she has performed in the past \u2014 as a cashier, for example, or as a counter or mail clerk. The VE testified, and the ALJ concluded, that those jobs exist in significant numbers in the national economy. Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, and considering Strempel\u2019s age, educational background, work experience, and RFC, the ALJ determined that Strempel was capable of making a successful transition to such work and found her \u201cnot disabled\u201d within the meaning of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(g) and Medical-Vocational Rules 202.14 and 202.15, and not \u201cunder a disability\u201d as defined in the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">After the Appeals Council denied Strempel\u2019s request for review, she filed her complaint with the district court seeking review of the final administrative decision pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). A magistrate judge recommended that the decision be affirmed, and the district court adopted the recommendation on February 26, 2008. Strempel timely noticed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, like the district court\u2019s, is limited under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) to two inquiries: (1) whether substantial evidence of record supports the decision; and (2) whether the decision comports with proper legal standards. <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994). If substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision, the findings are conclusive and the decision must be affirmed. <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). \u201cSubstantial evidence is that which is relevant and sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept as adequate to support a conclusion; it must be more than a scintilla, but it need not be a preponderance.\u201d <em>Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 295 (5th Cir.1992). It is the role of the Commissioner, and not the courts, to resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>Brown v. Apfel, </em>192 F.3d 492, 496 (5th Cir.1999). As a result, this court \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence, but may only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Leggett v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.1995). A finding of no substantial evidence is warranted only \u201cwhere there is a conspicuous absence of credible choices or no contrary medical evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 343-44 (5th Cir.1988) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">III. Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">A claimant is \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined in the Social Security Act if she is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The Commissioner uses a sequential, five-step approach to determine whether a claimant is so disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The burden of proof is on the claimant at the first four steps. <em>Leggett, </em>67 F.3d at 564. The burden of proof shifts to the Commissioner at the fifth step to establish the existence of other available substantial gainful employment that a claimant can perform. <em>Fraga v. Bowen, </em>810 F.2d 1296, 1301-02 (5th Cir.1987). If the Commissioner identifies such employment, the burden shifts back to the claimant to prove that she could not perform the alternative work identified. <em>Id. </em>at 1302. Throughout the process, the ultimate burden of establishing disability remains with the claimant. <em>Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 165 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Strempel alleges three points of error in the district court\u2019s determination that substantial evidence supports the final administrative decision that she was not disabled within the meaning of the Act: first, that the Commissioner failed to give sufficient weight to the opinions of treating physicians; second, that the Commissioner failed to properly assess her credibility; and third, that the Commissioner did not properly assess Strempel\u2019s RFC. We will address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\n<em>A. Treating Physician Opinions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ANv\">Strempel claims that the ALJ failed to give sufficient weight to the opinions of the treating physicians. Strempel\u2019s brief contains lengthy, and highly duplicative, summaries of the opinions of her treating physicians. She summarily contends that the \u201cALJ disregarded this evidence without any explanation,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence to controvert the findings of the treating doctor.\u201d This argument ignores the ALJ\u2019s detailed discussion of Strempel\u2019s treating physicians\u2019 evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">On the contrary, the ALJ considered and evaluated the medical evidence and symptoms from Strempel\u2019s medical examinations, including those of her treating physicians. This included her subjective complaints of pain and fatigue, as well as her physicians\u2019 evaluations of her diabetes, depression, anxiety, nervousness, migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and other conditions. As the ALJ noted, Dr. David Diaz, one of Strempel\u2019s treating physicians, had found that she lacks a mental condition that imposes more than minimal limitations. He also noted that Strempel had told Dr. Diaz her migraines had been well-controlled and had become \u201cinfrequent\u201d by 2004. The record contains no evidence that Dr. Diaz believed Strempel\u2019s afflictions, either singly or in combination, prevented her from working. In fact, he reached the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Strempel further complains that the ALJ gave inadequate consideration to the records of another physician, Dr. Simona Scumpia, who prepared a new patient evaluation of Strempel. According to Dr. Scumpia\u2019s report, Strempel complained of fatigue, anxiety, dry skin, constipation, nervousness, hot flashes, cold intolerance, muscle aches, a decreased libido, blurred vision particularly with elevated blood sugars, migraines, and weight gain of 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pounds in the previous year. Dr. Scumpia also reported, however, that Strempel had denied weakness, fatigue, headaches, blurring, diplopia, visual field changes, shortness of breath, and decreased libido. Dr. Scumpia reported that she further denied high blood pressure, dysuria, polydipsia, frequency, nocturia, back and joint pain, muscle weakness, paresthesias, tingling, depression, anxiety, memory loss, crying, suicidal ideation, and hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">After examining these medical opinions, the ALJ gave \u201cthe claimant the benefit of the doubt as to her subjective complaints of pain and depressive symptoms,\u201d and found that Strempel suffered from \u201cmigraine headaches, depression, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, and hypertension.\u201d The ALJ considered these doctors\u2019 opinions and other medical and non-medical evidence (including her testimony that she mows the lawn using a riding lawnmower and helps babysit her infant grandchildren), and determined that her ability to perform \u201call or substantially all of the requirements of light work is impeded by additional exertional and/or non-exertional limitations.\u201d He nevertheless determined that she \u201cwas and is able to understand, remember, and carry out detailed, but not complex]]] instructions, [and] respond appropriately to supervisors and coworkers in jobs that do not require independent decision making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">In contesting that conclusion, Strempel contends that \u201c[t]he ALJ did not include ... the problems with functioning described by the treating doctors and underlined above for emphasis\u201d (pain, headaches, fatigue, numbness, foot swelling, cramps, nausea, temperature intolerances, generalized anxiety, urinary urgency and abdominal pain, side effects of her medication, leg pain with walking, nervousness, and drowsiness were underlined). In fact, however, the ALJ carefully considered her physicians\u2019 reports on these conditions, where they were addressed in those reports \u2014 as he noted, some \u201cwere not documented to the extent she alleges she experiences ... or not documented at all\u201d \u2014 and where they had the potential to affect her RFC. For example, although Strempel complains of muscle pain and depression, the former is not documented in the record to the extent that would be expected for someone claiming pain so severe it is disabling, and she never sought psychiatric care for the latter. Strempel has not pointed to any symptoms in the record affecting her RFC that the ALJ overlooked.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\n<em>B. The ALJ\u2019s Determination of Claimant\u2019s Credibility</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Strempel next contends that the ALJ wrongly discounted her credibility. The ALJ concluded that the record did not support Strempel\u2019s claims regarding the severity of her conditions. Specifically, he found her allegation that she is completely unable to sustain competitive work to be \u201cless than credible.\u201d As the district court noted, the ALJ in this case determined based on the evidence in the record that her conditions did not preclude her from working. This determination was based on substantial evidence, and the ALJ applied the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">At bottom, Strempel\u2019s complaint is that the ALJ did not accept her characterization of her medical history. The ALJ \u201cis entitled to determine the credibility of medical experts as well as lay witnesses and weigh their opinions accordingly.\u201d <em>Scott v. Heckler, </em>770 F.2d 482, 485 (5th Cir.1985). Here, the ALJ was entitled to discount Dr. Scumpia\u2019s notation of Strempel\u2019s complaints because they contradict Dr. Scumpia\u2019s other treatment notes and because the ALJ gave more credit to an earlier evaluation by Dr. Diaz, another treating physician. As we have often not<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ed, it is the role of the Commissioner, and not the courts, to resolve conflicts in the evidence. <em>See, e.g., Brown, </em>192 F.3d at 496. This court \u201ccannot reweigh the evidence, but may only scrutinize the record to determine whether it contains substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Leggett, </em>67 F.3d at 564. A finding of no substantial evidence is warranted only \u201cwhere there is a conspicuous absence of credible choices or no contrary medical evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>864 F.2d at 343-44 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, the ALJ carefully considering Strempel\u2019s claims, and plainly exercised a credible choice based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>C. RFC Determination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Strempel\u2019s argument that the ALJ erred in finding that she retains the RFC for a significant range of light work is similarly unavailing. First, as noted above, Dr. Wright concluded that Strempel \u201cretained and retains the residual functional capacity to lift and/or carry 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently, stand and/or walk 6 hours in an 8-hour workday, push and/or pull limited to the weights given above, with no other limitations noted.\u201d He further concluded that her \u201c[alleged limitations caused by clmt\u2019s [claimant\u2019s] sxs [symptoms] are not wholly supported\u201d by the evidence. Second, Dr. Diaz concluded in his Treating Physician Mental Functional Assessment of March 26, 2004, that she did not have a mental condition that imposed more than minimal limitations. That conclusion is consonant with his report of Strempel\u2019s March 7, 2003 visit, in which she denied anxiety and he found that her \u201c[depression is doing well on the Celexa 30mg. Sleeping well. No depression. No tearfullness or irritability.\u201d Given that the ALJ was entitled to give greater weight to the evaluation of Dr. Wright and to the substantial and long-running records of Dr. Diaz than to pieces of Dr. Scumpia\u2019s evaluation that might support her case, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s RFC finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Finding that substantial evidence and relevant legal standards support the final administrative decision to deny Strempel\u2019s application for supplemental security income benefits, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
