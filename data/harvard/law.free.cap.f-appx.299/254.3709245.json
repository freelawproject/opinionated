Haggins, a South Carolina prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge, and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Haggins v. Burt, </em>No. 4:07-cv-00931-HMH, 2008 WL 697159 (D.S.C. March 12, 2008). We also deny Haggins\u2019 motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
