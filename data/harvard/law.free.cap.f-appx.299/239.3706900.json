On appeal, Richardson\u2019s conviction was affirmed. Her sentence was vacated and remanded for resentencing consistent with the rale announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>128 Fed.Appx. 305 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished). On remand, the district court imposed a downward variance and sentenced Richardson to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court \u201cgave three reasons for imposing the variance sentence: (1) Richardson\u2019s \u2018youthfulness\u2019 at the time of the criminal conduct; (2) her good character prior to becoming the girlfriend of one of the principal members of the drug conspiracy; and (3) her post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts.\u201d <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>232 Fed.Appx. 267, 268 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished). The Government appealed, arguing that the extraordinary variance was unreasonable. This court agreed and vacated the sentence and remanded for re-sentencing. The court stated that the \u201cholding, however, does not deny the court discretion to impose a variance sentence as appropriate to support the sentencing factors found in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>See Richardson, 232 </em>Fed.Appx. at 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">On remand, the district court imposed a downward departure by moving Richardson from Criminal History Category II to Category I. The court then imposed a variance and reduced her total offense level from forty to thirty-seven. The advisory Guidelines range of imprisonment was 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court sentenced Richardson to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low end of the reconfigured Guidelines\u2019 range of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">Richardson\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court plainly erred by sentencing Richardson to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. Richardson was advised of her right to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>a pro se supplemental brief, but did not file one. The Government did not file a brief. Finding no meritorious issues for appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Appellate courts review sentences imposed by district courts for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). When sentencing a defendant, a district court must first properly calculate the Guidelines range. The Guidelines is \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. Next, the court should give the parties the opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate. The court is then instructed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of the parties\u2019 requests with respect to the sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. In the Fourth Circuit, \u201c[a] sentence within the proper Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Upon review, this court must first determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If this court finds the sentence is procedurally sound, it must next \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. This court should \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">We find the sentence was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Richardson\u2019s sentence. This court requires counsel inform his client, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If she requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Richardson. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
