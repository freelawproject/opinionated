Vereen argues that Amendment 706 to \u00a7 2D1.1 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines entitles him to a sentence reduction. He further argues that because the sentencing guidelines are advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court should have exercised its discretion and reduced his sentence. Finally, Vereen argues that recent Supreme Court case law establishes that district courts are not bound by either the guidelines or minimum statutory sentences. After carefully reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). A district court may reduce a sentence \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o) ... if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201cA reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 3582(c)(2) if ... [the] amendment ... does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (2007). A sentence \u201cmay be imposed at any point within the applicable guideline range, provided that the sentence ... is not less than any statutorily required minimum sentence.\u201d \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(2). Furthermore, the district court may not reduce, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range----\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Amendment 706, which reduced by two levels the offense levels in crack cocaine cases, calculated pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), became effective on November 1, 2007. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 706. The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2007 by incorporation into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual app. C, amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008). Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows a defendant whose guideline range was determined under \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s offense level calculations to seek a reduction in his sentence, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a sentence reduction. \u25a0 <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range when the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>received a mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1 (noting that a defendant is eligible for a reduction pursuant to an amendment listed in subsection (c) only if the amendment \u201cha[s] the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">Although the guidelines are \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 245, 125 S.Ct. at 738, the district courts are still bound by statutory minimum sentences. <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). While district courts may grant variances based on the crack-to-powder disparity, they are still \u201cconstrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed .... \u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">Vereen cannot receive a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his sentence was ultimately based on the ten-year statutory minimum sentence for a repeat drug felony offender. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). That ten-year statutory minimum sentence was unaffected by Amendment 706. <em>See United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cRegardless of the guideline amendment, the language of the statutory minimum is clear and has been unaltered by Congress.\u201d). Reducing Vereen\u2019s sentence would have been neither consistent with the guidelines\u2019 policy statement nor authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Vereen\u2019s motion for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
