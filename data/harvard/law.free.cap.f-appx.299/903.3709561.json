Buchanon asserts the district court incorrectly calculated his base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 by finding \u201crelevant conduct\u201d between the charged offense and a subsequent drug offense in September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>2007. Buchanon contends the two offenses lacked distinctive similarities, temporal proximity, and regularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">At sentencing the district court found the May and September incidents were sufficiently similar because they involved (1) the same substance, (2) an intent to distribute in part by the amount and lack of any paraphernalia for use, (3) lack of acknowledgment by Buchanon that he uses or ever used crack cocaine, and (4) substances that were both concealed in vehicles. The court found that \u201cfive months does not, to the Court, appear to be entirely remote or too remote to consider it as temporally proximate.\u201d As for regularity, the court found, \u201c[t]here isn\u2019t any indication of regularity\u201d other than two occasions in which law enforcement found cocaine base on Buchanon which \u201cindicates some regularity.\u201d The district court sentenced Buchanon to 75 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">This Court reviews \u201cthe sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and review the application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Blanc, </em>146 F.3d 847, 851 (11th Cir.1998). We review for clear error \u201cthe district court\u2019s factual findings regarding whether two [offenses] at issue in this sentencing involved the same course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, the district court must consider all \u201crelevant conduct\u201d when calculating the base offense level. U.S.S.G., \u00a7 1B1.3. \u201cRelevant conduct\u201d includes \u201call acts and omissions ... that were part of the same course of conduct ... as the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). Offenses may \u201cqualify as part of the same course of conduct if they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3, comment, (n. 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">The district court evaluates the \u201csimilarity, regularity, and temporal proximity\u201d between the two offenses and \u201cmust consider whether there are distinctive similarities between the offense of conviction and the remote conduct that signal that they are part of a single course of conduct rather than isolated, unrelated events that happen only to be similar in kind.\u201d <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhere one of these factors is absent, \u2018a stronger presence of at least one of the other factors is required.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blanc, </em>146 F.3d at 852 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 comment, (n. 9)).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">\u201cDistinctive similarities\u201d are more than general abstractions of the conduct. For instance, in <em>Maxwell </em>we held that a cocaine distribution scheme was not \u201crelated conduct\u201d to a dilaudid distribution conviction because they did not involve any of the same parties or drugs. <em>Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d at 1011. The only similarity between the two distribution schemes was that \u201cthey both involve[d] drug distribution\u201d in the general sense. <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201cto describe [the defendant\u2019s] conduct at such a level of generality ... eviscerate[s] the evaluation of whether uncharged criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>activity is part of the same course of conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">In this case, the district court found that there was no \u201cindication of regularity\u201d or if there was it was minimal. Thus, in order to find relevant conduct between the two offenses, there must be a stronger showing of either similarity or temporal proximity. The stronger showing is with similarity.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">The May 2007 and September 2007 offenses have more distinct similarities than both being involved in \u201cdrug distribution.\u201d The two offenses both involved cocaine base, an intent to distribute, lack of any drug paraphernalia, and concealment of the substance in vehicles rather than on Buchanon himself. <em>See Maxwell, </em>34 F.3d at 1011. These similarities show more than a generic level of likeness, as required by <em>Maxwell. </em>Therefore, the district court did not commit clear error in finding distinctive similarities between the two offenses. And as for temporal proximity, we have never held that a five-month separation between two offenses is too remote in time. Thus the district court did not clearly err in finding temporal proximity between the two offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Based upon the foregoing and our review of the record and the briefs, we affirm Buchanon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\">. The district court also stated it would have imposed the same sentence if the September incident were not relevant conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">I also think I should say that even if the Court were to have concluded that the 2.1 grams of crack cocaine from the September arrest were not relevant conduct, based upon all of the factors in this case, the Court would still be of the view that any sentence less than 75 months would be insufficient. And therefore, I think I would still be at the same place, which is that 75 months is the term of imprisonment that is necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing in this matter.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b929-10\">. We also find the district court\u2019s sentence of 75 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years of supervised release was substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
