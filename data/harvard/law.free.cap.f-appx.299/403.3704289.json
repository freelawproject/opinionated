Her conviction was affirmed by the Mississippi Court of Appeals. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>and, over a two justice dissent, reversed the conviction, holding that the Mississippi embezzlement statute applies only to incorporated entities and private persons, not to limited liability companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-24\">Following the reversal of her conviction, Champluvier brought a pro se action in forma pauperis against Judge Gary Evans, the judge that presided over her jury trial. The action claimed that Judge Evans violated her Constitutional rights, particularly her due process and equal protection rights, and her right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The district court dismissed her claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim and because Judge Evans enjoys immunity from civil actions for his judicial acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-25\">We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) using the same de novo standard of review applicable to dismissals made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>district court\u2019s thorough memorandum opinion dismissing Champluvier\u2019s claims. Champluvier was afforded due process in her trial, stated no equal protection claim, and did not allege that her imprisonment was in any way cruel and unusual. Moreover, Judge Evans enjoys judicial immunity. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
