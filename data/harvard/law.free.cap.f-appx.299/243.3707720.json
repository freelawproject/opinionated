Beam brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West 2003), requesting a declaration that a civil penalty imposed upon him by the State of North Carolina violates the United States and North Carolina Constitutions and that a refund of the civil penalty be ordered. The district court abstained under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), from exercising jurisdiction, concluding that Beam failed to exhaust his state judicial remedies, this case involves North Carolina\u2019s substantial interest in motor safety, and Beam will have an opportunity to raise his constitutional claims in North Carolina\u2019s state courts. For the reasons that follow, we agree and therefore affirm the district court\u2019s decision to abstain. Because Beam\u2019s complaint requests monetary relief, however, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Beam\u2019s suit and remand with instructions to stay the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">The underlying facts in this case are not in dispute. Beam drives a truck for Bar-Mar Transportation Corp. (\u201cBarMar\u201d), a small trucking firm owned by Beam and his wife. In 2005, BarMar contracted with Daystar Transportation, LLC (\u201cDaystar\u201d) to haul a large piece of industrial equipment from Pineville, North Carolina to the Tennessee border. On December 15, 2005, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) issued Daystar a permit to transport the equipment. The permit, which listed Beam as the \u201cpermittee,\u201d required the hauling truck to be accompanied by two escort vehicles with certified drivers. (J.A. at 6-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">On December 19, 2005, during the transport of the industrial equipment, a North Carolina vehicle enforcement officer issued Beam two civil penalties at a weigh station: (1) a $500 citation for \u201cOperating an Escort Vehicle Without the Required Certification\u201d because the rear escort driver could not produce an escort permit (the \u201cescort penalty\u201d) and (2) a $23,820 citation for carrying too much weight (the \u201coverweight penalty\u201d). (J.A. at 27.) Had the officer not treated the permit as invalid because of the escort penalty, the weight total would have been within the weight limit permitted by the permit. Both civil penalties were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">On January 10, 2006, Beam sent a letter to the North Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles (\u201cDMV\u201d) stating that, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1, <em>repealed by </em>2007 N.C. Sess. Laws 491, he paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>overweight penalty under protest and demanded that this money be repaid to him within 90 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 31, 2006, the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety (\u201cCCPS\u201d) responded with a letter informing Beam that an administrative review had determined that the overweight penalty was issued in accordance with state law and that the CCPS lacked authority to reduce \u201cany penalty imposed according to law.\u201d (J.A. at 11.) Further, the letter specifically informed Beam of his right to appeal the CCPS\u2019s administrative decision in North Carolina state court under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In lieu of seeking judicial review of the administrative decision in state court, on July 7, 2006, Beam filed this \u00a7 1983 action seeking a refund of the overweight penalty. Beam named as defendants George Tatum, Commissioner of the DMV; Bryan Beatty, the Secretary of the CCPS; and Lyndo Tippett, the Secretary of the DOT (collectively \u201cNorth Carolina\u201d). He alleged that North Carolina\u2019s actions violated the Excessive Fines Clauses of the Eighth Amendment and the North Carolina Constitution, the prohibition against delegation of judicial power in the North Carolina Constitution, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">On June 26, 2007, the district court abstained under <em>Younger </em>from exercising jurisdiction and dismissed Beam\u2019s case, concluding that by filing suit in federal court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-9\">[Beam] has expressly short-circuited North Carolina\u2019s statutory scheme concerning such civil penalties. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1. Under that statutory scheme, [Beam] may protest the penalty administratively (which he did) and then file suit in Wake County Superior Court (which he did not do). In Wake County Superior Court, [Beam] ... could raise the constitutional challenges set forth in his complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">(J.A. at 91.) Beam timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-13\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court properly abstained under <em>Younger </em>from exercising jurisdiction. \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision to abstain under <em>Younger.\u201d Nivens v. Gilchrist, </em>444 F.3d 237, 240 (4th Cir.2006). <em>Younger </em>and \u201cits progeny espouse a strong federal policy against federal-court interference with pending state judicial proceedings absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 431, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982). The principle of \u201ccomity\u201d underlying this abstention doctrine includes \u201ca proper respect for state functions, a recognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a Union of separate state governments, and a continuance of the belief that the National Government will fare best if the States and their institutions are left free to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>their separate functions in their separate ways.\u201d <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 44, 91 S.Ct. 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Sensitive to principles of equity, comity, and federalism, <em>Younger </em>mandates \u201cabstention not only when the pending state proceedings are criminal, but also when certain civil proceedings are pending, if the State\u2019s interests in the proceeding are so important that exercise of the federal judicial power would disregard the comity between the States and the National Government.\u201d <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., </em>481 U.S. 1, 11, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). Further, <em>Younger </em>\u201crecognizes that state courts are fully competent to decide issues of federal law and has as a corollary the idea that all state and federal claims should be presented to the state courts.\u201d <em>Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R. Co. v. Forst, 4 F.3d </em>244, 251 (4th Cir.1993) (internal citation omitted). In sum, <em>Younger </em>abstention requires a federal court to abstain from interfering in state proceedings, even if federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, if the following three factors are present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">(1) there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding brought prior to substantial progress in the federal proceeding; that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">(2) implicates important, substantial, or vital state interests; and (3) provides adequate opportunity to raise constitutional challenges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-7\"><em>Nivens, 444 </em>F.3d at 241; <em>see Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515. We analyze each of these factors in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">First, we consider whether there is an ongoing state proceeding. The pertinent question presented in this case is whether this factor is met where a party fails to exhaust its state judicial remedies before seeking relief in federal district court. The Supreme Court has answered this question in the affirmative: \u201ca necessary concomitant of <em>Younger </em>is that a party ... must exhaust his state appellate remedies before seeking relief in the District Court.\u201d <em>Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., </em>420 U.S. 592, 608, 95 S.Ct. 1200, 43 L.Ed.2d 482 (1975). This rule applies with equal force to judicial review of state administrative proceedings. <em>See Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc., </em>477 U.S. 619, 629, 106 S.Ct. 2718, 91 L.Ed.2d 512 (1986) (holding that <em>Younger </em>abstention is appropriate where \u201cconstitutional claims may be raised in state-court judicial review of the administrative proceeding\u201d). Relying on the principles articulated in <em>Huffman </em>and <em>Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>we have similarly held that \u201ca defendant to a coercive state administrative proceeding must exhaust his state administrative <em>and judicial remedies </em>and may not bypass them in favor of a federal court proceeding in which he seeks effectively \u2018to annul the results\u2019 of a state administrative body.\u201d <em>Moore v. City of Asheville, </em>396 F.3d 385, 388 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Huffman, </em>420 U.S. at 609, 95 S.Ct. 1200) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">In this case, Beam did not exhaust his state judicial remedies. Rather, he abandoned the state review process he initiated and bypassed state court judicial review of the CCPS\u2019s administrative decision in favor of filing suit in federal court. As noted above, Beam initially challenged the overweight penalty under the procedures provided by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1, North Carolina\u2019s statutory scheme concerning such penalties. Specifically, on January 10, 2006, Beam sent a letter to the DMV pursuant to \u201cN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>demanding a refund of the amount of the overweight penalty. (J.A. at 10.) On January 31, 2006, the CCPS responded with a letter informing Beam that an administrative review had determined that the overweight penalty was issued in accordance with state law and that he had a right to appeal the CCPS\u2019s administrative decision in \u201cWake County Superior Court\u201d as provided for by N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1. (J.A. 11.) Beam, however, did not challenge the CCPS\u2019s decision in Wake County Superior Court; instead he filed suit in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Beam attempts to excuse his failure to exhaust his state judicial remedies, asserting that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1 did not and does not afford him a right to appeal the CCPS\u2019s administrative decision in state court. Specifically, he argues: (1) the North Carolina Supreme Court in <em>North Carolina Sch. Bds. Ass\u2019n v. Moore, </em>359 N.C. 474, 614 S.E.2d 504 (2005) made clear that the statute is solely a tax statute and he is seeking recovery of a civil penalty (not a tax); and (2) that the statute was repealed <em>after </em>he filed this suit, preserving only a right to litigate tax cases, not a right to sue for recovery of a civil penalty. In response, North Carolina asserts: (1) the North Carolina Supreme Court in <em>Cedar Creek Enter., Inc. v. State Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles, </em>290 N.C. 450, 226 S.E.2d 336 (1976) concluded that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1 applied to monetary penalties like the one Beam received and that <em>North Carolina Sch. Bds. Ass\u2019n </em>does not even address this issue (nor in anyway purport to overrule <em>Cedar </em>Creek); and (2) because Beam invoked his rights under this statute prior to its repeal, he can still seek judicial review in state court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">We find Beam\u2019s arguments unpersuasive, particularly given that he initially challenged the overweight penalty under the very statute he now claims does not apply to him. Moreover, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1 had not been repealed at time Beam filed the instant federal suit. Therefore, the point remains: If Beam wanted to challenge the CCPS\u2019s decision he should have continued the process he invoked under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1 and filed suit in North Carolina state court. Because he did not do so, we conclude that <em>Younger\u2019s </em>first prong is satisfied. <em>Cf. Moore, </em>396 F.3d at 395 (affirming the district court\u2019s decision to abstain under <em>Younger </em>even though the plaintiff was left without any remedy for challenging his citation because his appellate rights in state court had already expired.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Next, we examine whether the proceedings at issue implicate a substantial state interest. To satisfy this factor, the ongoing state proceedings must be \u201cthe type of proceeding to which <em>Younger </em>applies.\u201d <em>New Orleans Public Serv., Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans, </em>491 U.S. 350, 367, 109 S.Ct. 2506, 105 L.Ed.2d 298 (1989). Beam concedes that \u201cthe district court was correct in holding that [North Carolina] has \u2018a substantial interest in motor safety\u2019 ____\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 32.) He argues, however, that this interest was not genuinely implicated because Beam\u2019s only real offense was failing to ensure that the rear escort\u2019s certification was not expired. We disagree. As North Carolina points out, Beam\u2019s \u201cargument ignores the direct link between the State\u2019s desire to ensure the safety of its roadways and the requirement that escort vehicles driven by properly certified drivers accompany an overweight vehicle.\u201d (Appellees\u2019 Br. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>10.) Hence, the district court correctly concluded that North Carolina has a substantial state interest in motor safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Finally, we consider whether Beam will have an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional claims in North Carolina state court. <em>See Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 482, 102 S.Ct. 2515. As to this consideration, we agree with the district court that Beam \u201cwill receive a full and fair opportunity to litigate the constitutional claims during the state proceedings.\u201d (J.A. 98.) Thus, the three' prong test for <em>Younger </em>abstention is met.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In sum, Beam failed to exhaust his state judicial remedies, where he could have asserted his constitutional claims, and North Carolina has a substantial interest in motor safety. Therefore, we hold that the principles of federalism and comity demand application of <em>Younger </em>abstention. As we concluded in <em>Moore:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">[T]o the extent that [Beam] in this case seeks to annul or trample on the results of state administrative proceedings, he interferes with the State\u2019s interest in enforcing its substantive laws as well as its interest in enforcing those laws through available administrative procedures and in its own courts. That [Beam] did not avail himself of state-provided avenues for review can only cast aspersion on the State\u2019s capabilities and good faith and deprive the State of a function which quite legitimately is left to the state appellate bodies, that of overseeing agency dispositions of constitutional issues which arise in civil litigation over which they have jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\"><em>Moore, </em>396 F.3d at 395 (internal quotation marks, citations and alteration omitted). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in abstaining from entertaining Beam\u2019s claims in deference to North Carolina\u2019s substantial interest in motor safety.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to abstain. We note, however, that because Beam\u2019s complaint requests monetary relief, the proper resolution is to stay Beam\u2019s case pending conclusion of the state proceedings. <em>See Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>517 U.S. 706, 731, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996) (\u201c[f]ederal courts have the power to dismiss ... based on abstention principles only where the relief being sought is equitable or otherwise discretionary.\u201d); <em>see also Traverso v. Penn, </em>874 F.2d 209, 213 (4th Cir.1989) (same). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order dismissing Beam\u2019s action and remand with instructions to stay the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\">. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-8\">No court of this State shall entertain a suit of any kind brought for the purpose of preventing the collection of any tax imposed in this Article. Whenever a person shall have a valid defense to the enforcement of the collection of a tax assessed or charged against him or his property, such person shall pay such tax ... and if the same shall not be refunded within 90 days thereafter, may sue such official in the courts of the State for the amount so demanded. Such suit must be brought in the Superior Court of Wake County, or in the county in which the taxpayer resides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-15\">N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1, <em>repealed by </em>2007 N.C. Sess. Laws 491.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\">. Beam contends that the district court\u2019s decision to abstain was improper because the state proceedings in this case are not sufficiently \"coercive.\u201d We disagree. Similar to the proceedings in <em>Moore v. City of Asheville, </em>the state proceedings in this case are \"unquestionably coercive.\u201d 396 F.3d 385, 395 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b271-6\">. North Carolina forcefully reiterated this position at oral argument, stating that \"without question\u201d Beam can still raise all of his state and federal claims in state court pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 20-91.1 and that the State would \u201cabsolutely\u201d support his entitlement to raise these claims in such a suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\">. Beam also argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to take into account any existing Commerce Clause considerations. Similar to Beam\u2019s other contentions, this argument is likewise without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\">. North Carolina contends that <em>Burford v. Sun Oil Co., </em>319 U.S. 315, 63 S.Ct. 1098, 87 L.Ed. 1424 (1943) also mandated abstention. To be sure, abstention doctrines \"are not rigid pigeonholes into which federal courts must try to fit cases.\u201d <em>Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco Inc., </em>481 U.S. 1, 11 n. 9, 107 S.Ct. 1519, 95 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). The district court, however, solely relied on the principles of federalism articulated in <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), and so, although <em>Burford </em>abstention may (or may not) apply here, our analysis is limited to whether or not the district court correctly abstained under <em>Younger.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
