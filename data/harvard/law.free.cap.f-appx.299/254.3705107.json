Turner argues that the twelvemonth sentence was plainly unreasonable given that he had a job and entered a drug treatment program. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the applicable statutory maximum and is not plainly unreasonable. <em>United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437, 439-40 (4th Cir.2006). This court explained that it must first assess the sentence for reasonableness, \u201cfollow[ing] generally the procedural and substantive considerations that we employ in our review of take into account the unique nature of supervised release revocation sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438-39 (internal citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 294 (4th Cir.2008) (\u201cIn applying the \u2018plainly unreasonable\u2019 standard, we first determine, using the instructions given in <em>Gall [v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)], whether a sentence is \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d). If this court concludes that a sentence is reasonable, it should affirm the sentence. <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439. Only if a sentence is found procedurally or substantively unreasonable will this court \u201cdecide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.; see Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 294. Although the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and the requirements of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2008), \u201cthe [district] court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke its previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Crudup, </em>461 F.3d at 439 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">We find no procedural or substantive error with respect to the sentence and further find the sentence was reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
