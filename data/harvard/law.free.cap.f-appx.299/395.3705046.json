Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range that was increased pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 as a result of Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s prior conviction for a crime of violence (COV).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we consider whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Thereafter, we consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable, using an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>A sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Aguirre-Lopez first contends that <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which issued after his sentencing, abrogated the rationale of previous Fifth Circuit decisions by broadening the district court\u2019s discretion to impose a nonguidelines sentence. He argues, therefore, that the sentencing court labored under a misconception that it could not sentence him below the Guidelines in the absence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d or based on the court\u2019s disagreement with guidelines policy. Because this theory was not argued in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 20, 2008) (No. 08-5988). Nothing in the record suggests that the district court was constrained by this court\u2019s precedent from considering all of Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s arguments for a nonguidelines sentence. Accordingly, there was no plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">Citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462, Aguirre-Lopez next argues that the within-guidelines sentence imposed in his case should not be accorded a presumption of reasonableness. Aguirre-Lopez contends that the justification for applying a presumption of reasonableness in his case is undercut because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b), the Guideline used to calculate his advisory sentencing guidelines range, was not promulgated according to usual Sentencing Commission procedures and did not take into account \u201cempirical data and national experience.\u201d Aguirre-Lopez portrays the <em>Kimbrough </em>decision as having \u201csuggested\u201d that the appellate presumption should not be applied to Guidelines that did not take account of this data and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-17\">Our reading of <em>Kimbrough </em>does not reveal any such suggestion. The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 355S(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug. 20, 2008) (No. 08-5988), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case. After reviewing for procedural errors and considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we hold that Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Finally, Aguirre-Lopez that the district court erred when it refused to grant him a one-month sentence credit to reflect the time he spent in the custody of immigration officials. Although a defendant is to be given credit toward his federal sentence for the time he spent in official detention prior to being received into federal custody that has not been credited against another sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), a district court is not authorized to compute service credit under \u00a7 3585. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 335, 112 S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992); <em>Leal v. Tombone, </em>341 F.3d 427, 428 (5th Cir.2003). Rather, credit awards are to be made by the Attorney General through the Bureau of Prisons. <em>Wilson, </em>503 U.S. at 335, 112 S.Ct. 1351; <em>Leal, </em>341 F.3d at 428. Accordingly, Aguirre-Lopez\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to award him a sentence credit are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
