Richardson, a Louisiana prisoner, appeals the 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c)(l) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) dismissal of his civil rights suit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. His pro se complaint, which we construe liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged that the defendants have violated and continue to violate his Eighth Amendment rights by failing to protect him from inmate attack and failing to provide ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>quate medical care. He seeks damages and injunctive relief. Our review of the district court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1997e and \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is de novo. Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) our review is for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the district court referred to all three statutory provisions, our review is de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The district court erred in dismissing Richardson\u2019s suit without first considering his timely-filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Richardson\u2019s objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report were deemed filed and served at the moment they were forwarded to prison officials for delivery to district court, under the \u201cprison mailbox rule.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They were therefore timely filed and should have been afforded de novo review by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 686(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Most of Richardson\u2019s claims are frivolous, and thus the district court\u2019s error as to those claims is harmless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The failure of the prison to follow its own policies, including a failure to address prisoner grievances, is not sufficient to make out a civil rights claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The conduct of prison officials with regards to the conditions of the initial attack does not arguably rise to the constitutional standard of deliberate indifference to prison conditions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the medical care that appellant received after the attack was not so deficient as to support a successful civil rights claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These claims were rightly dismissed as frivolous by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">However, while his hand-written submissions do not separate out his arguments very well, Richardson has stated one claim that is not frivolous: the claim that he should not be left in ongoing, close contact with his assailant. He seeks injunctive relief to require further investigations by prison officials, in order to bring about a separation between him and his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">As to this claim, the magistrate judge wrote: \u201cPlaintiff has not shown a real and immediate threat of injury. He has only pointed to an isolated event that occurred because of a dispute over the \u2018inmate counsel\u2019s\u2019 services.\u201d But this portrayal fails to take account of the fact that, as discussed extensively in the complaint, the grudge between the appellant and the \u201cinmate counsel\u201d began before the actual assault and, according to the facts alleged by the plaintiff, continued past that event. The appellant cites not merely \u201can isolated event,\u201d but ongoing threats from his assailant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He lays out specific fears of further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>violence and claims to have been threatened and harassed by his assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Contrary to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, at the pleading stage, a plaintiff need not have <em>\u201cshown </em>a real and immediate threat of injury\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 he need only have sufficiently <em>alleged </em>a threat. The magistrate judge rightly notes that prison administrators are granted significant deference in determining prison policies, but a finding as to whether prison officials have acted sufficiently in response to the appellant\u2019s allegations should occur at a later stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">As the submissions stand, appellant\u2019s claim may not be supported by sufficient factual allegations to survive a dismissal under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), which is the PLRA equivalent of Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But usually, a claimant should be put on notice before his claim is dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is particularly important for a pro se claimant whose lack of access to legal resources appears as part of the factual basis of the case, since he was assaulted in response to repeated denials of legal help from the \u201cinmate counsel\u201d who had access to the computers designated for legal research.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>claim should have been investigated, for instance through a questionnaire or a <em>Spears </em>hearing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One way or another, he should have been put on notice that he needed to allege more facts (if any exist) to support his expressed fears.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In the end, the appellant may fail to state a claim \u2014 indeed, his claim may yet be dismissed as frivolous, if further proceedings make it clear that he has no arguable legal claim. But his submissions to date are sufficiently grounded and specific that at a minimum he should be put on notice that he must remedy the factual deficiencies in his claim before facing dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED as to all claims aside from the claim for injunctive relief necessary to protect appellant from further assaults, which is VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Due to the dismissal of a previous action in the same district court, USDC No. 1:07-CV-852, Richardson already has a \u201cstrike\u201d for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The initial dismissal of the instant action, which would have counted as another strike, will not count as a strike unless, on remand, the district court again dismisses Richardson\u2019s remaining claim, determining on the basis of additional investigation that it is frivolous or that Richardson has failed to state a claim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Any frivolous appeal from that determination will count as a third \u201cstrike\u201d against Richardson. Richardson is cautioned that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes,\u201d he will no longer be allowed to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is detained or incarcerated in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b486-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
