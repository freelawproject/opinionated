He was sentenced to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Person challenges his sentence, alleging the Government breached the plea agreement in failing to inform the district court at sentencing of the full extent of his cooperation. Finding no plain error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>A defendant alleging the Government\u2019s breach of a plea agreement bears the burden of establishing that breach by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.2000). Where a party raises the alleged breach for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 65-66 (4th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, Person must not only establish that the plea agreement was breached, but also that \u201cthe breach was \u2018so obvious and substantial that failure to notice and correct it affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 66 n. 4 (quoting <em>United States v. Fant, </em>974 F.2d 559, 565 (4th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u201c[Wjhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201cIt is well-established that the interpretation of plea agreements is rooted in contract law, and that \u2018each party should receive the benefit of its bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 413 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Ringling, </em>988 F.2d 504, 506 (4th Cir.1993)). \u201cA central tenet of contract law is that no party is obligated to provide more than is specified in the agreement itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAccordingly, in enforcing plea agreements, the government is held only to those promises that it actually made,\u201d and \u201cthe government\u2019s duty in carrying out its obligations under a plea agreement is no greater than that of \u2018fidelity to the agreement.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fentress, </em>792 F.2d 461, 464 (4th Cir.1986)); <em>see also United States v. Benchimol, </em>471 U.S. 453, 456, 105 S.Ct. 2103, 85 L.Ed.2d 462 (1985) (holding \u201cit was error for the Court of Appeals to imply as a matter of law a term which the parties themselves did not agree upon\u201d by requiring recommendation to be made \u201centhusiastically\u201d); <em>but see United States v. Brown, </em>500 F.2d 375 (4th Cir.1974) (concluding \u201cgovernment failed to keep its bargain\u201d by expressing doubts about its agreed-upon recommendation which \u201ccould reasonably be expected to be. expressed with some degree of advocacy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We have reviewed the record and conclude the Government did not breach the plea agreement. Under the plea agreement, the Government was obligated to make known to the district court at sentencing the full extent of Person\u2019s cooperation. At sentencing, the Government informed the district court that Person had signed a plea agreement, that he had been debriefed, and that he provided complete and truthful information. The Government added that it believed the information Person provided would be used at a later time to calculate another individual\u2019s guideline range and that Person would hopefully be eligible for a sentence reduction under Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. We find that the Government satisfied its obligation to apprise the court of the extent of Person\u2019s cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Person\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
