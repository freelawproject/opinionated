On appeal, Moghaddam contends that the district court erred in three respects: (1) by denying him the opportunity to testify and consult with his attorney before finding him competent to stand trial; (2) by finding him competent to stand trial; and (3) by denying him a third competency hearing after his trial began. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The conviction of a mentally incompetent defendant violates the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966). A defendant is competent to stand trial if he \u201chas a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\u201d; \u201csufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u201d; and the capacity \u201cto assist in preparing his defense.\u201d <em>Indiana v. Edwards, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2379, 2383, 171 L.Ed.2d 345 (2008) (quotation marks omitted). Once the defendant\u2019s competency has been called into question, the burden is on the prosecution to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is competent to stand trial. <em>United States v. Makris, </em>535 F.2d 899, 906 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">The record demonstrates that the district court did not deprive Moghaddam of the opportunity to testify and consult with his attorney at the hearing where he was deemed competent to stand trial. In fact, just the opposite is true; Moghaddam did receive the opportunity to consult with his attorney and testify as to his competency. Moghaddam, however, told the court that he wanted to consult with his attorney not to discuss his competency, but to discuss general matters in a convenient environment where their conversations would not be recorded. Ultimately, it was Moghaddam who chose not to testify so as to \u201cget on with the case.\u201d Moghaddam has failed to demonstrate that the district court erred in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Likewise, the district court did not err by finding Moghaddam competent to stand trial. A district court\u2019s competency determination, a mixed question of law and fact with \u201cdirect constitutional repercussions,\u201d is reviewed for clear error. <em>Makris, </em>535 F.2d at 907. The determination \u201cmay not be set aside on review unless it is clearly arbitrary or unwarranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Dockins, </em>986 F.2d 888, 890 (5th Cir.1993). The first expert to evaluate' Moghaddam concluded that 120 days of inpatient psychiatric treatment would be adequate time to achieve \u201cgood symptom relief\u2019 and \u201cstabilization,\u201d particularly for someone like Moghaddam who, according to the expert, \u201chas the underlying cognitive and even emotional abilities\u201d to be competent to stand trial. The expert psychologist who subsequently oversaw Moghaddam\u2019s inpatient treatment concluded that he was competent upon completing his 120 days of treatment. The district court also heard expert testimony that, in some respects, Moghaddam had exaggerated his symptoms. Based on the record, we cannot find that the district court\u2019s competency determination was clearly arbitrary or unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Finally, the district court did not err by failing to hold a third competency hearing for Moghaddam after his trial began. A defendant has a right to a competency hearing if \u201c \u2018the trial judge receive[s] information which, objectively considered, should reasonably have raised a doubt about [the] defendant\u2019s competency and alerted [the trial judge] to the possibility that the defendant could neither understand the proceedings or appreciate their significance, nor rationally aid his attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>in his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>819 F.2d 605, 607 (5th Cir.1987) (quoting <em>Lokos v. Capps, </em>625 F.2d 1258, 1261 (5th Cir.1980)). There is no \u201c \u2018general standard for the nature or quantum of evidence necessary to trigger a competency procedure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608 (quoting <em>Lokos, </em>625 F.2d at 1261). This court does, however, consider three factors in determining whether a competency hearing is required: \u201c \u2018[1] a history of irrational behavior, [2] the defendant\u2019s demeanor at trial, and [3] a prior medical opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lokos, </em>625 F.2d at 1261). Here, Moghaddam did have some history of irrational behavior. It was because of his irrational behavior that the district court ordered Moghaddam to receive 120 days of inpatient psychiatric treatment. However, after Moghaddam completed his treatment, the district court heard expert testimony that Moghaddam was competent to stand trial. Furthermore, the district court found Moghaddam\u2019s \u201crather dramatic theatrics\u201d before the jury incredible. The district court noted the convenient and particularly disruptive timing of Moghaddam\u2019s \u201cfeigned\u201d dizzy spell during the Government\u2019s opening statement. The district judge was in the best position to evaluate Moghaddam\u2019s conduct at that moment and assess whether his behavior was genuine or a contrivance. Considering the aforementioned factors and facts, we find no error in the district court\u2019s denial of a third competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
