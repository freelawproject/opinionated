Consequently, he argues, its provisions do not apply to his complaint concerning the denial of due process in the calculation of his PPRD. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">A district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>using the same standards that govern Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Mitchell v. Farcass, </em>112 F.3d 1483, 1489-90 (11th Cir.1997). Under that standard we \u2018View the allegations in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1490. The Supreme Court has recognized that <em>pro se </em>complaints are held to \u201cless stringent standards\u201d than pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">A civil rights action, brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, must allege that (1) the complainant was deprived of a federal right (protected by either the Constitution or federal statute) by (2) a person acting under color of state law. <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). As a general rule, in order to sustain a procedural due process violation, one must have a liberty interest created by the United States Constitution or by a state. <em>Monroe v. Thigpen, </em>932 F.2d 1437, 1441 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>(11th Cir.1991). Interests protected by the Due Process Clause may be created by prison regulations, <em>see Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 556-58, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2975, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), and state statutes and regulation, <em>Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 U.S. 480, 488, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1261, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980). The Constitution does not confer a liberty interest in parole, <em>Monroe, </em>932 F.2d at 1441, and the Florida statutes do not create a liberty interest in parole, because the decision whether to release an inmate on parole is a matter committed to the discretion of the Commission without the mandate of statute, <em>Staton v. Wainwright, </em>665 F.2d 686, 688 (5th Cir. Unit B 1982). There is no liberty interest in the calculation of Florida\u2019s \u201cpresumptive parole release date\u201d even though it is binding on the Commission, because the ultimate parole decision is a matter of Commission discretion. <em>Damiano v. Florida Parole and Probation Comm\u2019n, </em>785 F.2d 929, 932 (11th Cir.1986). <em>See also Hunter v. Florida Parole &amp; Probation Comm\u2019n, </em>674 F.2d 847 (11th Cir.1982) (holding no due process violation could be shown through an allegation that the Florida Parole and Probation Commission improperly calculated a prisoner\u2019s \u201cpresumptive parole release date\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">Where there is no liberty interest in parole, \u201cthe procedures followed in making the parole determinations are not required to comport with the standards of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>O\u2019Kelley v. Snow, </em>53 F.3d 319, 321 (11th Cir.1995). However, a limited exception to this rule exists when there is \u201cflagrant or unauthorized action\u201d by the Board. <em>Monroe, </em>932 F.2d at 1441. In <em>Monroe, </em>we held that a parole board\u2019s discretion is not unlimited, and determined that the parole board\u2019s reliance on admitted false information constituted \u201cunauthorized action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1442. Although an inmate has no due-process right to an error-free determination of parole eligibility, <em>see Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Corr. Complex, </em>442 U.S. 1, 7, 99 S.Ct. 2100, 2103-04, 60 L.Ed.2d 668 (1979), a prison official may not engage in \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d or \u201cflagrant or unauthorized action,\u201d <em>Thomas v. Sellers, </em>691 F.2d 487, 489 (11th Cir.1982), such as knowingly or admittedly relying on false information in making parole decisions, <em>Monroe, </em>932 F.2d at 1442 n. 11. However, prisoners do not state a due process claim by simply asserting that erroneous information might have been used during their parole consideration. <em>Slocum v. Georgia State Bd. of Pardons and Paroles, </em>678 F.2d 940 (11th Cir.1982). Additionally, nothing in due process concepts requires a parole board to specify the particular \u201cevidence\u201d in the inmate\u2019s file or at his interview on which it rests its discretionary determination to deny release. <em>Greenholtz, </em>442 U.S. at 15, 99 S.Ct. at 2108.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Because the Commission did not act in an arbitrary and capricious fashion by not explaining why certain aggravators were used to calculate his PPRD outside the matrix, and Walker does not have a liberty interest in certain parole procedures he alleged were not followed, the district court did not err by dismissing Walker\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Although the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) does not apply to habeas corpus proceedings, it does apply to all other civil actions brought by prisoners. <em>Anderson v. Singletary, </em>111 F.3d 801, 805 (11th Cir.1997) (explaining that \u201cCongress promulgated the PLRA to curtail prisoner tort, civil rights and conditions litigation, not the filing of habeas corpus petitions\u201d). Section 1915(b) of Title 28 requires that a prisoner who brings a civil action and requests <em>in forma pauperis </em>status must pay the full amount of the filing fee either in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>whole or in installments. This section applies to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil actions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Because Walker filed a <em>pro se </em>civil rights complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, not a habeas corpus petition, PLRA\u2019s filing fee requirements under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b) are applicable to Walker. Therefore, the district court did not err by requiring Walker pay filing fees pursuant to \u00a7 1915(b). Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-14\">. Walker also argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, because he sought discretionary review of his Presumptive Parole Release Date (PPRD) calculations by the Commission. He also argues that because review is not mandatory, his remedies should be deemed exhausted. However, because we have determined that he failed to state a claim, we will not address this alternative holding of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
