United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), his sentence should be vacated and remanded. He asserts that this court\u2019s precedent improperly restricted the district court\u2019s ability to deviate from the Guidelines absent extraordinary circumstances, a standard rejected in <em>Gall. </em>He also challenges the imposition of a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, asserting that the Guideline is flawed and not entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Although Galdamez generally argued that the guidelines range was excessive for this offense and that he should receive a below guidelines sentence, he did not raise the specific challenges to his sentence that he raises here, i.e., that the sentencing regime was unduly restrictive or that the 16-level enhancement is flawed and not entitled to deference. Accordingly, we review those arguments for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 387-88 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Given our dispositions of similar challenges in <em>Rodriguez-Rodriguez </em>and <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>we conclude that Galdamez has failed to demonstrate any reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-19\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
