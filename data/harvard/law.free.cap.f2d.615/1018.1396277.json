Atty., and Phillip\u2019 I. Morse, Sp. Asst. U. S. Atty., Charleston, W. Va., on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1113-18\">Before HAYNSWORTH, Chief Judge, and WINTER and WIDENER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1113-19\">WIDENER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1113-20\">George King appeals from an order of the district court affirming a decision by the Secretary of HEW that he was not entitled to black lung benefits sought pursuant to the regulations enacted under Part B of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, as <em>amended, </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>While our scope of review is limited to determining whether the Secretary\u2019s denial is supported by substantial evidence, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b), incorporating by reference \u00a7 205(g) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), because the Secretary failed to give proper consideration to certain evidence, we remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-21\">King submitted X-ray studies which at least four physicians interpreted as demonstrating the existence of pneumoconiosis. Two physicians gave King physical examinations and concluded that he suffered from occupational pneumoconiosis. In addition, there was testimony that King had subjective symptoms of lung impairment (shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-22\">The Secretary, in evaluating the evidence, stated that \u201c[tjhere is not one medi-cal expert who has any official certification of his radiology specialty that has classified this claimant\u2019s film as pneumoconiosis.\u201d The record shows that of the four physicians who interpreted King\u2019s X-rays as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>showing pneumoconiosis, three are in fact officially certified \u201cA\u201d readers. The Secretary had all the X-rays reread by one certified \u201cB\u201d reader who interpreted them all as either unreadable or negative for pneumoconiosis. The Secretary is entitled to weigh evidence and gave great weight to these negative findings, but his opinion does not indicate he took into consideration the rule in this circuit that contradictory X-rays benefit neither party. <em>Petry </em>v. <em>Califano, </em>577 F.2d 860, 864 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">The Secretary\u2019s decision does not give proper treatment to the findings of two physicians who gave King physical examinations and diagnosed pneumoconiosis. There is nothing in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s statement that Dr. Hamilton has a \u201cpenchant for making elaborate diagnoses based upon opaque X-ray films.\u201d The record contradicts the Secretary\u2019s statement that Dr. Hresan\u2019s diagnosis \u201cis based entirely upon an X-ray interpretation.\u201d Dr. Hresan noted a fusion of the vertabrae, examined the heart, and found that \u201cthe resp. disease affects his breathing about 50%.\u201d More importantly, Dr. Hresan\u2019s medical report, dated 3-27-73, gives the \u201cDate of First Examination\u201d as 1-4-69, the \u201cFrequency of Visits\u201d as \u201cirreg\u201d, and the \u201cDate of Last Examination\u201d as 3-26-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">This court places great reliance on the conclusions of a claimant\u2019s examining physician, e. g., <em>Hubbard v. Califano, </em>582 F.2d 319, 323 (4th Cir. 1978). The Secretary has, apparently, impermissibly limited his findings to those based on objective medical tests and weighing conflicting opinions on X-rays in contravention of his duty to consider all the evidence, as required by 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b). On remand, the Secretary will state how he treats the evidence of Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Hresan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">The Secretary must consider all the evidence and explain on the record the reasons for his findings, including the reason for rejecting relevant evidence in support of the claim. <em>Arnold v. Secretary of HEW, </em>567 F.2d 258 (4th Cir. 1977). Even if legitimate reasons exist <em>for </em>rejecting or discounting certain evidence, the Secretary cannot do so for no reason or for the wrong reason. We therefore remand this case to the district court for the purpose of further remand to the Secretary with directions to give proper consideration to all the evidence. On remand, either party may introduce additional evidence if he be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1114-9\">HAYNSWORTH, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa5\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-11\">The statement that Dr. Hamilton has a \u201cpenchant for making elaborate diagnoses based upon opaque x-ray films\u201d is unsupported on this record. It may be that the administrative law judge had encountered this elderly physician before. However, it is a shorthand means of stating why Dr. Hamilton\u2019s opinion is disregarded when derived from a film which highly qualified readers find so opaque as to be uninformative. Nor do I find Dr. Hresan\u2019s references to the heart and spine as showing reliance upon anything other than the x-ray film in reaching his conclusion about the patient\u2019s respiratory problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-12\">Since I find in the record support for the Secretary\u2019s conclusion, I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
