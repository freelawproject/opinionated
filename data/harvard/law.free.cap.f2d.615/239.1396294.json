The judge also instructed the plaintiff to submit a more detailed response to defendants\u2019 motion. On February 23, the plaintiff filed that response. On that same day, the defendants filed a brief in support of their motion. The brief made numerous references to plaintiff\u2019s deposition in support of the motion to dismiss. On the day of the hearing, plaintiff filed a rebuttal brief, also citing numerous passages from his deposition to buttress his legal position. The plaintiffs\u2019 deposition included testimony that favored his contention and some that militated against his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The district court held a hearing on February 27. Subsequently, the judge entered an order reciting that materials beyond the pleadings had been considered and dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">When matters outside the pleadings are presented to the trial judge and are not excluded, a 12(b)(6) motion is to be treated as a motion for summary judgment. Fed. R.Civ.Pro. 12(b). In such a situation, \u201cthe hearing and notice requirements of Rule 12(b) and 56(c) must be adhered to.\u201d <em>Underwood v. Hunter, </em>604 F.2d 367, 369 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Rule 12(b) <em>requires </em>that parties \u201cbe given reasonable opportunity\u201d to offer material pertinent to a motion for summary judgment. Rule 56(c) states that summary judgment motions <em>\u201cshall be served </em>at least 10 days\u201d prior to the hearing date. Combined, these rules establish that, as a rule of thumb, parties are entitled to 10 days notice that a 12(b)(6) motion is being treated as a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">Plaintiff had no such notice. The first indication plaintiff had that the trial court was considering matters outside the pleadings came when the order was issued. <em>See Underwood, supra. </em>The first indication plaintiff had that defendant intended to rely on matters outside the pleadings came four days before the time fixed for the hearing. Such notice is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Plaintiff must have the opportunity \u201cto present additional material and arguments going to the issue of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369. We will not assume that plaintiff has already produced all his ammunition. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe very intimation of mortality when summary judgment is at issue assures us that the motion will be rebutted with every factual and legal argument available.\u201d <em>Georgia Southern &amp; Florida Railway Co. v. Atlanta Coast Line Railroad Co., </em>373 F.2d 493, 498 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>389 U.S. 851, 88 S.Ct. 69, 19 L.Ed.2d 120 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">\u201cRule 12(b) <em>demands </em>that adequate no-be given to all parties when a 12(b)(6) motion is converted into a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That strict requirement was not satisfied. The order of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-14\">No member of this panel nor judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 16), the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-8\">. Several of our previous efforts in this area are listed and discussed in <em>Underwood v. Hunter, </em>604 F.2d 367, 369 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-16\">. Of course, like most other requirements under the Rules such notice can be waived by the parties. Here, there is no basis for finding a waiver of the right to notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
