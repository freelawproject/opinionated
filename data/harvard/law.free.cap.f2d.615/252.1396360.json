(DPI) and several of its franchisees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to enjoin their use of Amstar\u2019s federal registration of the \u201cDomino\u201d trademark. The complaint is based on allegations that defendants\u2019 use of the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d in connection with the sale of fast-food delivered hot pizza pies constitutes trademark infringement and a false designation of origin or representation in violation of the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq.;</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>also that said use constitutes unfair competition in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 106-701 <em>et seq., </em>and dilutes the distinctive quality of plaintiff\u2019s mark \u201cDomino\u201d in violation of the Georgia anti-dilution statute, Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 106-115.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants denied that plaintiff was entitled to any equitable relief, asserted trademark misuse by plaintiff, and counterclaimed for cancellation of plaintiff\u2019s registration of the \u201cDomino\u201d mark for salt.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court ruled in favor of plaintiff, dismissed defendants\u2019 counterclaim, and permanently enjoined defendants\u2019 use of the names \u201cDomino\u201d or \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza.\u201d Defendants then filed this appeal. We reverse because we find that the district court\u2019s decision was fundamentally erroneous since it was predicated on a holding that there was a likelihood of confusion between the use of \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d by defendants in connection with pizza store services and the use of \u201cDomino\u201d by plaintiff in connection with the sale of sugar and individual packets of condiment items.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">I. Background of Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b349-21\">Amstar Corporation holds several federal registrations for the widely known \u201cDomi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>no\u201d trademark,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the mark has been used since the turn of the century on plaintiff\u2019s various sugar products. Since 1965, plaintiff has also packaged single-serving (portion-control) envelopes of salt, pepper, sugar, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, jams and jellies, salad dressings, taco sauce, honey, cranberry sauce, tartar sauce and table syrup under the \u201cDomino\u201d mark. Plaintiff has spent more than $54 million since 1947 in advertising and promoting its \u201cDomino\u201d products, and as a result there is wide public recognition of the mark as a source of sugar products. Amstar\u2019s non-sugar, single-serving condiment packages introduced in 1965 have become the nation\u2019s largest line of portion-control items, with sales currently running at a rate of about $14 million per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Defendant DPI is the nation\u2019s largest chain of fast-food delivered pizza pie outlets, with 287 stores in 30 states and current sales exceeding $43 million annually. The chain has used the name \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d since early in 1965. Prior to that date, the pizzeria from which the chain grew was known as \u201cDominick\u2019s,\u201d named after its founder, Dominick Devarti. Devarti sold his pizzeria located in Ypsilanti, Michigan to Thomas Monaghan in December of 1960. In 1963 Devarti withdrew his permission to use the name \u201cDominick\u2019s,\u201d and for an interim period Monaghan called the store \u201cYpsilanti Dominick\u2019s.\u201d During this period Monaghan searched for a suitable new name for his pizzeria. In 1965 an employee suggested the name \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza,\u201d and Monaghan adopted the name immediately. At trial, Monaghan stated that he selected the name because it sounded Italian, it resembled \u201cDominick\u2019s,\u201d and he was unaware of any other pizzerias using the name. The company initially prospered, and in 1967 the first \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d franchise was sold. By the end of 1969, there were 42 \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d stores in operation in three states.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The plaintiff first became aware of DPI on June 24, 1970 when defendants\u2019 \u201cDomino\u2019s\u201d and \u201cDomino\u2019s plus design\u201d marks were published in the Official Gazette of the Patent Office, pending registration of the marks by the U. S. Patent Office. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063, plaintiff filed notices of opposition to registration of the marks. DPI at the time was in serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>financial difficulty, and the oppositions were not answered. Registration of the marks was therefore refused by the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In early 1971 plaintiff\u2019s counsel wrote to DPI\u2019s predecessor, Domino\u2019s Inc., requesting that the \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d mark be changed. Domino\u2019s Inc. did not respond to the letter, and plaintiff took no further action at that time. Plaintiff did, however, order credit reports on DPI for the next three years which were used in monitoring DPI\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In 1972 and 1974 DPI again sought to register the trademark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d with the U. S. Patent Office. The mark was passed for publication in the Official Gazette of the Patent Office on each occasion, signifying that an examiner of the office had concluded that the mark was entitled to registration, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1062(a). Plaintiff filed notices of opposition to each of the foregoing applications, and defendant withdrew each application. Plaintiff ultimately filed this suit against DPI in September 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In a lengthy memorandum of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the district court held that the defendants were guilty of trademark infringement (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1)), false designation of origin (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a)), and dilution, unfair competition and deceptive trade practices under Georgia law. The court detailed at length the plaintiff\u2019s use of the \u201cDomino\u201d trademark in connection with sugar, and more recently with portion-control items. It found that \u201c[cjonsumers are highly likely to associate any food products sold or available for sale in supermarkets, groceries or other food stores under the DOMINO mark with the DOMINO food products sold by plaintiff.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 31. It further concluded that \u201c[a]s a result of plaintiff\u2019s widespread use, advertising and promotion of the DOMINO trademark on a great variety of food products, the consuming public is very likely to believe that DOMINO\u2019s Pizza, sold in a separate food store outside of the supermarket, is in some way or manner sponsored by or affiliated with, or connected with, or emanates from plaintiff.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 61. The court found that the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d is \u201cso similar to plaintiff\u2019s famous mark DOMINO in sound and appearance that the public cannot always perceive any differences between them.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 63. The court concluded that, as a matter of law, \u201c[ujse of virtually identical marks for food products distributed to and in food stores to the consuming public is likely to result in confusion, mistake or deception.\u201d Conclusion of Law No. 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">On appeal, defendants contend the district court erred in concluding that use of virtually identical marks for food products is likely to result in confusion or deception, and defendants also contend that the court erred \u201cby misapplying or failing to apply the critical factors to be weighed in assessing likelihood of confusion.\u201d Brief for Appellants at 10. Plaintiff Amstar contends that the court\u2019s finding of likelihood of confusion or mistake is not clearly erroneous, and must therefore be sustained by this court. Plaintiff contends that this finding is substantiated by many factors, including the notoriety and strength of the \u201cDomino\u201d mark, the confusing similarity of the marks \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d and \u201cDomino,\u201d the related nature of defendants\u2019 goods and services to those of plaintiff, the fact that customers for both plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 goods are the general consuming public, the existence of some actual confusion, and the results of two surveys which tend to confirm the likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Based on the record before us, we are convinced that the trial court erred in enjoining defendants\u2019 use of the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza.\u201d We therefore reverse the decision of the district court, and vacate the injunction entered against defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Initially, we must determine the appropriate standard of review applicable to the district court\u2019s finding of likelihood of confusion. The determination as to whether confusion is likely has been held to present a question of law, <em>Fleischman Distilling Corp. </em>v. <em>Maier Brewing Co., </em>314 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>149, 152 (9th Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 U.S. 830, 83 S.Ct. 1870, 10 L.Ed.2d 1053 (1963); a mixed question of law and fact, <em>B. H. Bunn Co. v. AAA Replacement Parts Co., </em>451 F.2d 1254, 1261 (5th Cir. 1971), and a question of fact, <em>T.G.I. Fridays </em>v. <em>International Restaurant Group, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 895, 899 (5th Cir. 1978). This circuit has held that likelihood of confusion is a question of fact which can only be set aside if clearly erroneous. <em>T.G.I. Fridays, supra; </em>Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a). The record in the present case indicates that the district court\u2019s finding of likelihood of confusion is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The court\u2019s 54-page memorandum of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law was copied almost verbatim from proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law submitted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. While the practice of allowing counsel for the prevailing party to write the trial judge\u2019s opinion has not been proscribed by this circuit, it should nevertheless be discouraged. Even though the court, in adopting plaintiff\u2019s findings and conclusions, stated that it had \u201cindividually considered\u201d them and adopted them because it \u201cbelieved them to be factually and legally correct,\u201d a cursory reading of the district court\u2019s memorandum leaves one with the impression that it was indeed written by the prevailing party to a bitter dispute. While the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule of Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) applies to a trial judge\u2019s findings of fact whether he prepared them or they were developed by one of the parties and mechanically adopted by the judge, \u201cwe can take into account the District Court\u2019s lack of personal attention to factual findings in applying the clearly erroneous rule.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Thompson, </em>593 F.2d 1375, 1384 n.16 (5th Cir. 1979). <em>See also James v. Stockham Valves &amp; Fittings Co., </em>559 F.2d 310, 314 n.1 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Jahre, </em>472 F.2d 557, 559 (5th Cir. 1973). As was stated in James:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201c[T]he appellate court can feel slightly more confident in concluding that important evidence has been overlooked or inadequately considered\u201d when factual findings were not the product of personal analysis and determination by the trial judge. 559 F.2d at 314 n.1, <em>quoting Louis Dreyfus &amp; Cie. v. Panama Canal Co., </em>298 F.2d 733, 738 (5th Cir. 1962).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">A finding of fact is clearly erroneous \u201cwhen although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). \u201cIn other words, we reverse when the result in a particular case does not reflect the truth and the right of the case.\u201d <em>Armstrong Cork Co. v. World Carpets, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 496, 501 (5th Cir. 1979). Such is the case here. Having reviewed all the evidence in this case in light of established legal precedent, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court was mistaken in concluding that defendants\u2019 use of the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">III. Likelihood of Confusion</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Infringement of a registered mark is governed by the provisions of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), which imposes liability against \u201cuse . . . likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\u201d The same test is applicable to the deceptive trade practices claim, Ga.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 106-701 <em>et seq.; Baker Realty Co. v. Baker, </em>228 Ga. 766, 187 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1972), and common law unfair competition, <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>481 F.2d 445, 449 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>B. H. Bunn Co. v. AAA Replacement Parts Co., </em>451 F.2d 1254, 1262 (5th Cir. 1971). Likewise, defendants\u2019 use of the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d can represent a false designation of origin or false description, proscribed by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125, only if defendants\u2019 use of the mark is likely to be confused with plaintiff\u2019s \u201cDomino\u201d mark. <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Dallas Cap and Emblem Mfg., Inc., </em>510 F.2d 1004, 1013 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 868, 96 S.Ct. 132, 46 L.Ed.2d 98 (1975). Plaintiff\u2019s claims against* defendants, except the dilution claim, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>turn on the determination of whether defendants\u2019 use of the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">In this circuit likelihood of confusion is determined by evaluating a variety of factors including the type of trademark at issue; similarity of design; similarity of product; identity of retail outlets and purchasers; identity of advertising media utilized; defendant\u2019s intent; and actual confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Roto-Rooter Corporation v. O\u2019Neal, </em>513 F.2d 44, 45 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>citing Continental Motors Corp. v. Continental Aviation Corp., </em>375 F.2d 857 (5th Cir. 1967); <em>American Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Golden Flake, Inc., </em>312 F.2d 619 (5th Cir. 1963); <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. All States Life Insurance Co., </em>246 F.2d 161 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 894, 78 S.Ct. 268, 2 L.Ed.2d 192 (1957). <em>See also </em>Restatement of Torts \u00a7 729 (1938).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">An evaluation of these factors leads us to conclude that defendants\u2019 use of the trademark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d presents no likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">\n<em>1. Type of trademark</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">We consider, first, whether \u201cDomino\u201d is a \u201cstrong\u201d or a \u201cweak\u201d mark since the strength and distinctiveness of plaintiff\u2019s mark is a vital consideration in determining the scope of protection it should be accorded. \u201cStrong marks are widely protected, as contrasted to weak marks.\u201d Lunsford, Julius R., Jr., \u201cTrademark Basics,\u201d 59 Trademark Rep. 873, 878 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">At trial, defendants introduced into evidence or tendered into court some 72 third-party registrations of the mark \u201cDomino\u201d in the U. S. Patent Office. Brief'for Appellant at 18-24. These registrations were for such products as canned fruits, citrus, cigarettes, cheese, wheat flours, chrome-tanned leather, canned sardines, animal feed, envelopes, pencils, fishing line, candy mints, whiskey, ladies\u2019 hosiery and haircream. In addition, defendants presented extensive evidence of 15 third-party uses of the \u201cDomino\u201d mark from 1885 until the present. These uses included \u201cDomino\u201d cigarettes and matches, which are currently sold in grocery stores, two restaurants currently operating under the \u201cDomino\u2019s\u201d mark, a small chain of supermarkets in the Bronx, New York, with sales of $3,900,000 in 1976, and a \u201cDomino Donut Mix\u201d distributed by General Mills to commercial bakers since 1959. The district court dismissed these and other third-party uses as either long abandoned; remote as to goods or geography; small, obscure and localized; or used only in shipments to the trade. We do not believe that such extensive third-party use and registration of \u201cDomino\u201d can be so readily dismissed. The impact of such evidence is not dispelled merely because \u201cDomino\u201d cigarettes and matches are not leading brands, or because some uses of the mark \u201cDomino\u201d by third parties have not been related to food products. As was stated by one commentator, \u201cIf the owner of KODAK should permit its use by others on washing powders, shoes/ candy bars, or cosmetics, or if The Coca-Cola Company should permit COCA-COLA or COKE to be used for rain coats, cigarette lighters, golf balls, or jewelry not of its manufacture, it would not take long for even these giants in the trademark world to be reduced to pigmy size.\u201d Lunsford, <em>supra </em>at 878-79. As stated in comment g to the Restatement of Torts \u00a7 729 (1938), \u201cThe greater the number of identical or more or less similar trade-marks already in use on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>different kinds of goods, the less is the likelihood of confusion . . . The extensive third-party uses documented in this case were entitled to much greater weight than were accorded them by the district court. <em>See Armstrong Cork Co. v. World Carpets, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 496, 505 (5th Cir. 1979) (multiple uses of mark \u201cWorld\u201d discussed in denying injunctive relief); <em>American Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., </em>494 F.2d 3, 13 (5th Cir. 1974) (multiple uses of \u201cHeritage\u201d discussed in denying injunctive relief); <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>481 F.2d 445, 448 (5th Cir. 1973) (multiple uses of \u201cHoliday\u201d discussed in denying injunctive relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Defendants do not contend, nor does this court hold, that plaintiff\u2019s mark is not a distinctive, well-known mark for its sugar and related products. The third-party uses and registrations discussed above merely limit the protection to be accorded plaintiff\u2019s mark outside the uses to which plaintiff has already put its mark. <em>American Sugar Co. v. Texas Farm Products Co., </em>159 U.S.P.Q. 679, 681 (T.T.A.B.1968);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Scott Paper Co. v. Scott\u2019s Liquid Gold, Inc., </em>598 F.2d 1225 (3rd Cir. 1978) (plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the mark \u201cScott\u201d as applied to paper products does not preclude defendant\u2019s use of \u201cScott\u201d on furniture polish).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Additional support for the conclusion that the mark \u201cDomino\u201d should be accorded only limited protection outside of plaintiff\u2019s sugars and related food products can be derived from the nature of the mark itself. \u201cDomino,\u201d in spite of the district court\u2019s finding that it is \u201cnot primarily a surname,\u201d Finding of Fact No. 98, is indeed the surname of a good number of people, as a glance at a local telephone directory can verify. The word is a common English name for a game, a hooded costume, a type of mask, and a theory of political expansion. Thus, \u201cDomino\u201d is not a coined word, is not purely fanciful, and while its application to sugar may be arbitrary,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it is still not to be accorded the same degree of protection given such coined and fanciful terms as \u201cKodak\u201d or \u201cXerox.\u201d <em>Armstrong Cork Co. v. World Carpets, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 496, 505 (5th Cir. 1979) (wide use of mark \u201cWorld\u201d results in little likelihood of confusion); <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>481 F.2d 445, 448 (5th Cir. 1973) (common word \u201cHoliday\u201d is of weak trademark significance); <em>El Chico, Inc. v. El Chico Cafe, </em>214 F.2d 721, 725 (5th Cir. 1954) (27 trademark registrations of \u201cEl Chico,\u201d along with fact it was the name of a Moorish king of Granada in 1482, and is the name of a Mexican town and a river in the Philippines, make the term a weak trade name deserving limited protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\"><em>2.

Considering the total effect of the respective marks, there is little similarity between plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 marks.

The trademark examiner on one of these occasions wrote that \u201c[a] search of the Office records fails to show that the mark, when applied to applicant\u2019s services, is confusingly similar to any registered mark.\u201d Record on Appeal at 2815. At the time this search was made, plaintiff had registered \u201cDomino\u201d for sugar, mustard, ketchup, salt and pepper. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-20\">\n<em>3. Similarity of products</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b355-21\">The district court stated in some detail its view of the similarities between defendants\u2019 pizza and plaintiff\u2019s sugar, salt, mustard, ketchup and other condiments. The court at one point went so far as to state the \u201cconsuming public considers sugar to be a related food product to pizza.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 84. However, we fail to see any great similarity between the respective parties\u2019 wares. \u201cAbout the only things they have in common are that they are edible.\u201d <em>California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Sunkist Baking Co., </em>166 F.2d 971, 973 (7th Cir. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\n<em>4. Identity of retail outlets and purchasers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Dissimilarities between the retail outlets for and the predominant consumers of plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 goods lessen the possibility of confusion, mistake, or deception. The dissimilarities here are substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cDomino\u201d sugar products are distributed to the public primarily through grocery stores; defendants\u2019 pizzas and soft drinks are distributed exclusively through fast-food outlets specializing in home delivery or customer pickup, but offering no facilities for sit-down service. Plaintiff attempts to narrow the gap between itself and defendants by arguing that its single-serving sugar packets, and more recently its line of single-serving condiments, are widely used in fast-food outlets and restaurants. Thus, it argues, the public has come to associate the mark \u201cDomino\u201d with restaurants and fast-food establishments. While the argument carries some weight, it is insufficient to overcome basic differences between plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 modes of distributing their products.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Although \u201cDomino\u201d sugar and individual, condiment packages are distributed to the public through restaurants and fast-food chains, they are not sold to the public by plaintiff but are generally distributed to customers by the restaurant owners. Amstar is not engaged in the direct sale of condiment packages to the public. In contrast, \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d products are sold directly to the public through \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d outlets. While the public may decide to purchase a pizza based on its perception of \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d quality, it is unlikely anyone would choose to frequent or avoid a restaurant because of the brand of condiment packages carried by the restaurant. Thus, while Amstar might broadly be classified as \u201cin the restaurant business,\u201d it is in that business at a different level than defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">There are substantial dissimilarities between the predominant purchasers of plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 products. According to surveys presented at trial, \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d patrons are primarily young (85.6% under 35 years of age), single (61%) males (63.3%). This coincides with the fact that 75% of the \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d stores throughout the country are situated in college campus towns or around military bases where the advertising for \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d is directed to the 18- to 34-year-old single male. In contrast, \u201cDomino\u201d sugar purchasers are predominantly middle-aged housewives.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">5. <em>Identity of advertising media utilized</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The district court made extensive findings of fact regarding plaintiff\u2019s advertising of its \u201cDomino\u201d mark. The court found Amstar advertised extensively in nationally circulated magazines, newspapers and trade journals, and spent substantial sums of money on radio and television commercials. It stated \u201cDOMINO is the only sugar on network television every week.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 23. In contrast to plaintiff\u2019s broadly based national advertising, defendants\u2019 advertising has a completely different focus. Because over 80% of defendants\u2019 .pizza sales involve free delivery, defendants\u2019 advertising is of two principal types: (i) store signs, flyers, delivery car signs and other like materials designed for maximum impact in the 1.5-mile delivery area of a \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d outlet, and (ii) \u201cYellow Page\u201d ads. Unlike the national audience sought by Amstar, defendants\u2019 advertising is targeted at young, male college students.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">The substantial dissimilarities between plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 advertising campaigns tend to negate any inference of unfair competition or trademark infringement. Defendants\u2019 advertising program is geared to seek out and exploit a highly localized and rather specialized class of consumers. Defendants have not sought to mine the good will established by plaintiff. In short, hardly anyone would confuse a \u201cDomino\u201d sugar ad with a \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d sales pitch, nor would they likely believe the two advertisements emanated from the same source, considering the significant differences between the advertisements in message content and presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\n<em>6. Defendants\u2019 intent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The intent of defendants in adopting the \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d mark is a critical factor, since if the mark was adopted with the intent of deriving benefit from the rep-\" utation of \u201cDomino\u201d that fact alone \u201cmay be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity.\u201d Restatement of Torts \u00a7 729, comment f (1938). Bad faith in the adoption and use of a trademark normally involves the imitation of packaging material, use of identical code numbers, adopting of similar distribution methods or other efforts by a party to \u201cpass off\u201d its product as that of another. <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. v. Diversified Packaging Corp., </em>549 F.2d 368, 382-83 (5th Cir. 1977). There is no evidence that defendants have ever attempted to \u201cpass off\u201d their goods as those of plaintiff. Evidence introduced at trial established that the name \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d was adopted because Mr. Monaghan had been told he could no longer use the name \u201cDominick\u2019s,\u201d the new name sounded Italian, and it was quite close to the old name. Although Monaghan was aware of \u201cDomino\u201d sugar at the time, he was unaware of any other pizzerias by that name. There is no evidence the name was adopted with any intent to confuse, mislead, or deceive the public.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">7. <em>Actual confusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Although evidence of actual confusion is not necessary to a finding of likelihood of confusion, it is nevertheless the best evidence of likelihood of confusion. <em>Roto-Rooter Corp. v. O\u2019Neal, </em>513 F.2d 44, 46 (5th Cir. 1975). The evidence of actual confusion in this case is minimal. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence of actual confusion amounted to two verbal inquiries as to whether \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d was related to \u201cDomino\u201d sugar, and one misaddressed letter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In view of the fact that both plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 sales currently run into the millions of dollars each year, these isolated instances of actual confusion are insufficient to sustain a finding of likelihood of confusion. <em>Armstrong Cork Co. v. World Carpets, Inc., </em>597 F.2d 496, 506 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Scott Paper Co. v. Scott\u2019s Liquid Gold, Inc., </em>589 F.2d 1225, 1231 (3rd Cir. 1978). Indeed, the fact that only three instances of actual confusion were found after nearly 15 years of extensive concurrent sales under the parties\u2019 respective marks raises a presumption against likelihood of confusion in the future. <em>FS Services, Inc. v. Custom Farm Services, Inc., </em>325 F.Supp. 153, 162 (N.D.Ill.1970), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>471 F.2d 671 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">At trial, both parties introduced survey evidence on the issue of likelihood of confusion. The trial court characterized the defendants\u2019 survey as \u201cabout as contrived a survey as I have ever run across,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but found plaintiff\u2019s survey \u201cproperly conducted and fair.\u201d Finding of Fact No. 90. Our own examination of the survey evidence convinces us that both surveys are substantially defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s survey was made by Dr. Russ Haley, Professor of Marketing at the University of New Hampshire. It was conducted in ten cities among female heads of households primarily responsible for making food purchases. Each participant was shown, in her own home, a \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d box and was asked if she believed the company that made the pizza made any other product. If she answered yes, she was asked, \u201cWhat products other than pizza do you think are made by the company that makes Domino\u2019s Pizza?\u201d Finding of Fact No. 90(d). Seventy-one percent of those asked the second question answered \u201csugar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>While the possible confusion level shown by the Haley study is high, there are several defects in the survey which significantly reduce its probative value. First, one of the most important factors in assessing the validity of an opinion poll is the adequacy of the \u201csurvey universe,\u201d that is, the persons interviewed must adequately represent the opinions which are relevant to the litigation. <em>American Basketball Ass\u2019n v. AMF Voit, Inc., </em>358 F.Supp. 981, 986 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>487 F.2d 1393 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 986, 94 S.Ct. 2389, 40 L.Ed.2d 763 (1974); <em>Hawley Products Co. v. United States Trunk Co., </em>259 F.2d 69, 77 (1st Cir. 1958). The appropriate universe should include a fair sampling of those purchasers most likely to partake of the alleged infringer\u2019s goods or services. <em>American Basketball, supra; Hawley Products, supra. </em>Of the ten cities in which the Haley survey was conducted, eight had no \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d outlets, and the outlets in the remaining two had been open for less than three months. Additionally, the persons interviewed consisted entirely of women found at home during six daylight hours who identified themselves as the member of the household primarily responsible for <em>grocery </em>buying. As plaintiff\u2019s sugar is sold primarily in grocery stores, participants in the Haley survey would have been repeatedly exposed to plaintiff\u2019s mark, but would have had little, if any, exposure to defendants\u2019 mark. Furthermore, the survey neglected completely defendants\u2019 primary customers \u2014 young, single, male college students. Thus, we do not believe that the proper universe was examined, and the results of the survey must therefore be discounted. <em>Handbook of Recommended Procedures for the Trial of Protracted Cases, </em>25 F.R.D. 351, 429 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Of additional concern, plaintiff\u2019s survey was a \u201cword association\u201d test. Participants in the survey were confronted with the \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d mark, and more or less asked if it brought anything else to mind. We have previously held that such a procedure degenerates \u201cinto a mere word-association test entitled to little weight.\u201d <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>481 F.2d 445, 448 (5th Cir. 1973). We do not believe the Haley survey presents any meaningful evidence of likelihood of confusion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The trial court discounted defendants\u2019 survey for largely the same reasons just discussed \u2014 it was conducted on the premises of \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d outlets and therefore did not examine a proper survey universe, and the questioning procedures used were improper. Thus, defendants\u2019 survey is likewise not probative of the presence or absence of confusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court was clearly in error when it held defendants\u2019 use of the trademark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d was likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception. In the absence of any solid evidence of actual confusion, the limited strength of the \u201cDomino\u201d mark outside plaintiff\u2019s line of sugars and portion-control condiments compels the opposite conclusion, especially in light of the marked dissimilarities between plaintiff and defendants in trademark design, products, retail outlets, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>purchasers and advertising. We also note that plaintiff has not been vigilant in protecting its rights in the \u201cDomino\u201d mark. Since it first began using the mark, it has failed to object to 72 third-party registrations of \u201cDomino.\u201d' When infringing third-party uses of the mark have become known, as in General Mills\u2019 use of \u201cDomino\u201d on a widely distributed doughnut mix, plaintiff has written letters requesting discontinuance of the mark, but has never brought suit against any such infringement until now. As noted by the district judge in the course of the trial, plaintiff \u201chas not maintained, has not policed its mark.\u201d Tr. 1664. Plaintiff brought this suit after nearly ten years of simultaneous use of the mark \u201cDomino\u201d by Amstar and DPI. A trademark owner that strongly believed its customers were being deceived would hardly have remained idle for such an extended period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Our conclusion that there is no likelihood of confusion in this case is fatal to most of plaintiff\u2019s claims. With no likelihood of confusion, there can be no trademark infringement, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1). Since there is no likelihood of confusing defendants\u2019 goods with those of plaintiff\u2019s, the false designation of origin claim also falls. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125; <em>Boston Professional Hockey Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Dallas Cap and Emblem Mfg. Co., Inc., </em>510 F.2d 1004 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 868, 96 S.Ct. 132, 46 L.Ed.2d 98 (1975). Common law unfair competition turns primarily on likelihood of customer confusion, and therefore defendants must prevail herein on that issue. <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>481 F.2d 445 (5th Cir. 1973); <em>B. H. Bunn Co. v. AAA Replacement Parts Co., </em>451 F.2d 1254 (5th Cir. 1971). Finally, the crux of a complaint based on the Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act is the likelihood of confusion between goods. <em>Baker Realty Co. v. Baker, </em>228 Ga. 766, 187 S.E.2d 850 (1972). This claim also is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">IV. Dilution</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Georgia\u2019s anti-dilution statute protects against \u201cdilution of the distinctive quality of the trade-mark . . . notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or of confusion as to the source of goods or services . . . .\u201d Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 106-115. Dilution, as we have previously noted, occurs \u201cwhere the use of the trademark by the subsequent user will lessen the uniqueness of the prior user\u2019s mark with the possible future result that a strong mark may become a weak mark.\u201d <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Out in America, </em>481 F.2d 445, 450 (5th Cir. 1973). The concept is not applicable in this situation, however, because \u201cit has been determined that the marks themselves are not confusing,\u201d <em>id., </em>and as discussed at length previously, \u201cDomino,\u201d outside plaintiff\u2019s line of sugars and portion-control items, has already become a weak mark. Plaintiff\u2019s claim against defendants under the Georgia statute is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">In reversing the district court and vacating the injunction entered against defendants, we do not intimate that the mark \u201cDomino,\u201d as applied to plaintiff\u2019s sugars and portion-control items, is not a widely known mark deserving substantial protection. However, \u201c[t]he right granted to the owner of a registered trademark is a monopoly and should not be extended unless the owner is clearly entitled thereto.\u201d <em>S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>266 F.2d 129, 136 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>361 U.S. 820, 80 S.Ct. 65, 4 L.Ed.2d 65 (1959). Since defendants\u2019 use of the mark \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d is not likely to confuse, mislead, or deceive the public, the district court\u2019s order and injunction to the contrary are set aside, and the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-11\">.

Texas </em>Farm <em>Products Co., </em>159 U.S.P.Q. 679, 681 (T.T.A.B.1968), American Sugar (predecessor in interest to Amstar) opposed registration by Texas Farm Products of the mark \u201cDomino\u201d for use on its cattle feed. The evidence established that American Sugar sold various sugar syrups and byproducts (principally blackstrap molasses) under the \u201cDomino\u201d mark, which were used in conjunction with or alone as cattle feed. The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board refused registration by Texas Farm Products, holding that both American Sugar\u2019s \u201cDomino\u201d products and Texas Farm Products\u2019 feed went through the same channels of trade to the same consumers. Texas Farm Products had contended that third-party uses of \u201cDomino\u201d limited American Sugar\u2019s rights in the mark. The Appeal Board\u2019s response to that argument is instructive here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aae4\">Applicant also contends that \u201cDOMINO\u201d is a weak mark as evidenced by the third party registrations and uses thereof hereinbefore referred to. This contention would be relevant, however, only if opposer were seeking protection of the mark in a field other than that in which it had previously been used, and such is not here the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APXp\">159 U.S.P.Q. at 681. Thus, the Appeal Board, while denying registration to Texas Farm Products, acknowledged that extensive third-party use of the mark \u201cDomino\u201d might mandate a different result if Amstar sought protection of the mark in a field \u201cother than that in which it had previously been used.\u201d As Amstar has never used the \u201cDomino\u201d mark in connection with the sale of fast-food delivered pizzas, this is such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b354-13\">. At one time, \u201cDomino\u201d as applied to plaintiffs sugar was descriptive, not arbitrary. There is evidence that, near the turn of the century, plaintiff sold domino-shaped pieces of hard sugar in half bales. Tr. 213-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">. Counsel for plaintiff conceded at trial that defendants did not adopt \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza\u201d with an intent to deceive, although the mark was adopted with knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s use of \u201cDomino.\u201d Tr. 1547.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\">. The two verbal inquiries were made to employees of DPI who were asked if DPI was related to Amstar. The misaddressed letter was received by a DPI employee from a doctor who had treated him. The doctor\u2019s bill was addressed to \u201cDomino Sugar.\u201d Record on Appeal at 2819.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b357-14\">. The judge\u2019s comment was made during a hearing held November 2, 1979 on a motion by defendants to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending this appeal. Hearing Tr. 63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b358-4\">. Other courts have rejected surveys performed by Dr. Haley as slanted or biased. <em>American Footwear Corp. v. General Footwear Company, Ltd., </em>609 F.2d 655, 660-61 n.4 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Charles Revson, Inc. v. Max Factor &amp; Co., </em>76 Civ. 5215, Findings of Fact Nos. 101-08 (S.D.N.Y.1977); <em>Phillip Morris, Inc. v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>188 U.S.P.Q. 289, 293-94 (S.D.N.Y.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b358-5\">. The actual results of defendants\u2019 survey are disputed. Plaintiff argues the survey shows a 6.8% confusion level, and the court in copying plaintiffs proposed Findings of Fact adopted that argument. Defendants argue the survey showed an actual confusion level of only 0.4%. They contend the 6.8% figure can be derived only by eliminating all respondents to the survey who were either not familiar with \u201cDomino\u201d sugar or who responded \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d when asked if the same entity made both \u201cDomino\u201d sugar and \u201cDomino\u2019s Pizza.\u201d They argue that such a procedure is as unwarranted as excluding the percentage of \u201cundecided\u201d voters in a political poll. While we note the conflict between plaintiff and defendants on this issue, our holding discounting the survey evidence in this case makes it unnecessary for us to resolve it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
