Act\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2041, <em>et seq. </em>The district court found that Green Goddess was exempt from the FLCRA\u2019s registration and disclosure provisions and entered judgment for the company. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-24\">Green Goddess processes and sells avocados and limes for a profit. To obtain fruit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>for its operations, it buys both harvested fruit and fruit which is still on the tree, paying farmers an agreed price per pound. If Green Goddess purchases unpicked fruit, it hires migrant workers to harvest the fruit and deducts the costs of this labor from the previously negotiated price per pound that the farmer receives. In these circumstances, Green Goddess assumes the risk of loss before harvest and completely supervises the migrant workers and the harvesting process. When the fruit is. marketed, after packing, Green Goddess retains all of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Under the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act, \u201cfarm labor contractors\u201d must comply with certain registration and disclosure requirements which, the Secretary alleges, Green Goddess has not satisfied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no question that, because of its hiring activities, Green Goddess is a \u201cfarm labor contractor,\u201d as defined by the Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> unless it falls within one of the statutory exemptions from that definition. Green Goddess claims, and the district court agreed, that the corporation is exempt from the FLORA\u2019S registration and disclosure requirements as a \u201cpacking shed operator * * * who personally engages in [hiring activities] for the purpose of supplying migrant workers solely for [its] own operation.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">The Secretary does not argue that Green Goddess\u2019 labor contracting is not \u201csolely for [its] own operation.\u201d Because the company buys the fruit from the farmers before harvest and bears all risk of profit or loss from its operation, that condition for exemption is satisfied. The only issue presented in this appeal, then, is whether Green Goddess \u201cpersonally\u201d engages in hiring activities, as required under \u00a7 2042(b)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">The contending positions are easily summarized: to the Secretary, \u201cpersonally\u201d means \u201cin person\u201d; to Green Goddess, it means \u201cdirectly.\u201d The Secretary argues that, because corporations can act only through their agents, and never \u201cin person,\u201d Green Goddess cannot \u201cpersonally\u201d eng\u00e1ge in hiring activities and does not qualify for the (b)(2) exemption. Green Goddess responds that this reading of \u201cpersonally\u201d is overbroad. It asserts that when a corporation hires directly, through its agent-employees, rather than indirectly, through some independent third party, it is acting \u201cpersonally\u201d and may claim a (b)(2) exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>The analysis is necessarily speculative. Because no legislative history explains why Congress added \u201cpersonally\u201d to the (b)(2) exemption when it amended the FLCRA in 1974,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the parties attempt to support their contending definitions through a series of inferences from semantics, statutory construction, and public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The parties\u2019 first, and simplest, level of inference is semantic. Green Goddess contends that because \u00a7 2042(a) defines \u201cperson\u201d as including corporations as well as individuals,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> corporations must be able to act \u201cpersonally\u201d for purposes of the (b)(2) exemption. The Secretary responds, and we agree, that the two words need not be given identical meanings merely because one is derived from the other. Indeed, the same word may, depending on context, have different meanings within the same statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">In a similarly semantic vein, the Secretary observes that \u00a7 2042(b)(2) applies to \u201cany operator\u201d who engages in labor contracting \u201csolely for <em>his </em>own operation\u201d (emphasis added). Because the personal pronoun \u201chis\u201d normally refers only to individuals, the Secretary reasons, \u201cpersonally\u201d must not apply to corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">This analysis, however, cuts both ways. Under \u00a7 2042(b), a \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who, for a fee, either for <em>himself </em>or on behalf of another person\u201d engages in various hiring activities (emphasis added). If the Secretary\u2019s reasoning concerning the use of \u201chis\u201d in the (bX2) exemption were applied, consistently, to the use of \u201chimself\u201d in \u00a7 2042(b), only individuals could be \u201cfarm labor contractors\u201d within the meaning of the Act; .corporations like Green Goddess would not be covered by the FLCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">We find that these semantic arguments, while ingenious, support inconclusive or inconsistent results. On balance, none is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">The second level of analysis is more complex. The parties support their definitions of \u201cpersonally\u201d by engaging in a sort of statutory exegesis, analyzing the relationship of the (b)(2) exemption\u2019s amendment to other 1974 FLCRA amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-14\">The addition of \u201cpersonally\u201d to \u00a7 2042(bX2) was first suggested in the July 1974 Senate version of the FLCRA amendments which would have changed the original (b)(2) exemption substantially. The Senate proposal would have excluded from the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cfarm labor contractor\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-15\">\u201c[A]ny farmer, processor, canner, ginner, packing shed operator, or nurseryman (A) who <em>personally </em>engages in any [farm labor contracting] activity for the purpose of supplying migrant workers solely for his own operation; or (B) who <em>indirectly </em>engages in any such activity <em>through an agent </em>or by contract where he first determines that the person so engaged possesses a certificate from the Secretary * * (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abm\">Except for the term \u201cpersonally,\u201d the language of the proposed subsection (A) was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>identical to that of the then-existing (b)(2) exemption. The proposed subsection (B), which would have exempted operators who indirectly hired through registered farm labor contractors, was completely new. In the final version of the amendments, however, the proposed subsection (B) was deleted. Congress opted, instead, for a more direct approach, punishing the use of unregistered contractors, rather than exempting operators who hired through registered contractors.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Despite the deletion of the proposed subsection (B), the term \u201cpersonally\u201d from the Senate version was added, without explanation, to \u00a7 2042(b)(2). The Secretary and Green Goddess agree that \u201cpersonally\u201d in the proposed subsection (A) and \u201cindirectly * * * through an agent\u201d in the deleted subsection (B) were mutually exclusive. They disagree, however, about the meaning of \u201cindirectly * * * through an agent.\u201d The Secretary reasons that, because operators\u2019 employees are their \u201cagents,\u201d any time they hire through their employees, rather than in person, they are acting \u201cindirectly * * * through an agent,\u201d and not \u201cpersonally.\u201d Because a corporation can act only through its agents, it cannot act \u201cpersonally\u201d under the present \u00a7 2042(bX2) and is not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">Conversely, Green Goddess contends that \u201cagent\u201d in this context means some third party not directly controlled by the employer. Under this view, a corporation is exempt as \u201cpersonally\u201d engaged in hiring if its employees contract with farm laborers, but is not exempt if it utilizes the services of an independent contractor to secure migrant workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">We find Green Goddess\u2019s arguments convincing. If the (b)(2) exemption were limited to those operators acting in person, the exemption described in \u00a7 2042(b)(3) would be meaningless. That exemption excludes from the Act\u2019s requirements \u201cany full-time or regular employe of any entity referred to in [(b)(1) or (b)(2)] who engages in any such activity solely for his employer on no more than an incidental basis.\u201d Because this language assumes that employees may act on behalf of operators exempt under (b)(2), the Secretary\u2019s contention that only those acting \u201cin person\u201d are exempt under \u00a7 2042(b)(2) must be rejected. Corporations may \u201cpersonally\u201d engage in farm labor contracting through their employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-13\">Initially, this interpretation of \u201cpersonally\u201d may seem to present potential for abuse: corporations could simply hire \u201ccrew leaders\u201d and call them \u201cemployees,\u201d sheltering the corporations from the FLORA\u2019S registration and disclosure provisions. But \u00a7 2042(b)(3) exempts only those \u201cregular\u201d or \u201cfull-time\u201d employees who engage in hiring solely for their employers \u201con no more than an incidental basis\u201d from the definition of \u201cfarm labor contractor,\u201d and \u00a7 2043(c) imposes penalties for utilizing the services of nonexempt unregistered contractors. In practice, most \u201ccrew leader-employees\u201d would engage in labor contracting activities on more than an \u201cincidental basis\u201d and would not be eligible for the (b)(3) exemption. If these employees did not register, the employer corporations would be subject to penalties under \u00a7 2043(c) for using their services. <em>Compare Usery v. Golden Gem Growers, Inc., </em>417 F.Supp. 857 (M.D.Fla.1976) <em>with Marshall v. Heringer Ranches, Inc., </em>466 F.Supp. 285, 287-88 (E.D.Cal.1979). The potential for evading the FLORA through such \u201csheltering,\u201d then, is insubstantial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>Our conclusion that corporations may act \u201cpersonally\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2042(b)(2) is consistent with the general legislative intent underlying the FLORA. The purpose of the Act and its amendments is to regulate independent \u201cmiddlemen\u201d who are in a position to exploit both operators and workers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While enforcement of the FLORA usually focuses on individual migrant \u201ccrew leaders,\u201d this circuit recently held that incorporated growers\u2019 associations that hire and pay workers who harvest crops on grower-members\u2019 farms are \u201cfarm labor contractors\u201d subject to the Act\u2019s registration and disclosure requirements. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Coastal Growers Ass'n, </em>598 F.2d 521 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In <em>Coastal Growers, </em>the defendant associations represented, at least potentially, independent intermediaries. Here, however, Green Goddess\u2019 employees who engage in hiring are not acting independently, but as agents of the corporation. There are no \u201cmiddlemen.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">We also recognize that, because most \u201cprocessors,\u201d \u201ccanners,\u201d and \u201cpacking shed operators,\u201d and many \u201cfarmers\u201d are incorporated, limiting the (b)(2) exemption to unincorporated operators would greatly restrict the scope of the exemption. The Secretary does not contend that the original (b)(2) did not exempt corporations. Instead, he argues that the purpose of the 1974 FLORA amendments was to tighten the Act\u2019s coverage and that the addition of \u201cpersonally\u201d should be construed, accordingly, to limit (b)(2) to hiring by unincorporated operators. It is likely, had Congress intended the addition of \u201cpersonally\u201d to have such significant effect, that there would have been some legislative discussion of that change. However, nothing in the legislative history of the 1974 amendments reflects any recognition of, much less support for, the asserted distinction between incorporated and unincorporated operations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The addition of a single ambiguous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>word, without more, does not warrant the conclusion that Congress intended to drastically restrict the (b)(2) exemption.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">We reject the Secretary\u2019s definition of \u201cpersonally\u201d and find that corporations may claim exemption under \u00a7 2042(b)(2). Because the FLORA is a remedial statute, exemptions from its coverage are to be narrowly construed. <em>Marshall v. Coastal Growers Ass\u2019n, </em>598 F.2d at 526. A party claiming exemption from such legislation bears the burden of demonstrating that its activities are \u201cplainly and unmistakably within [the] terms and spirit\u201d of the exemption. <em>Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc., </em>361 U.S. 388, 392, 80 S.Ct. 453, 456, 4 L.Ed.2d 393 (1960); <em>Brennan v.

We conclude, after considering semantics, statutory construction, and legislative intent, that Green Goddess has met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-6\">.

We find, though, that because the Administrator, like the Secretary, defined \u201cpersonally\u201d as \u201cin person,\u201d his interpretation of (b)(2) would render the (b)(3) exemption for employee-agents virtually meaningless. That interpretation is unreasonable, and we decline to follow it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
