CAMPBELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b99-22\">Frank Monteiro sued his former employer in the district court alleging that he had been discharged and otherwise discriminated against on account of his race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>After a non-jury trial, the district court concluded that there had been no policy of racial discrimination practiced or knowingly permitted by Monteiro\u2019s employer, Poole Silver Company (\u201cPoole\u201d); that Monteiro failed to establish that his discharge was motivated by racial prejudice; and that he likewise failed to show that he was terminated in retaliation for his opposition to unlawful employment practices, <em>see </em>section 704(a) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal Monteiro challenges only the last of the foregoing rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-23\">Poole hired Monteiro in late 1958 as a \u201cbuffer\u201d at its Taunton, Massachusetts facility. Monteiro voluntarily terminated his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>employment there about five years later because he believed that his supervisor, Norman Courcy, returned more work for rebuffing to the few black buffers than to the white employees holding similar positions. Since buffers were paid on a piecework basis, an excessive amount of returned work would cause a reduction in the wages received. The district court, however, found that the \u201ctwo workers who had in fact had the most work returned were both white.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In May 1969 Monteiro was rehired by Poole as a buffer at its newly opened plant in Fall River and given the unofficial title of \u201clead-man\u201d of the buffing department. In 1972 Monteiro was demoted, in the district court\u2019s words \u201cpartly as the result of conflict with the then assistant plant manager [Colin] Menzies.\u201d Following this incident, Monteiro lodged a grievance through the Union alleging that he had been harassed and demoted because of racial prejudice, and also filed a similar complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In settlement, Poole reinstated Monteiro to his \u201clead-man\u201d position but announced in the settlement memorandum that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cconsiderable emphasis [is being] placed on rules and regulations that must be maintained by Mr. Monteiro to insure his continued position and employment with the Poole Silver Company The following must be observed and followed .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">1) must maintain his position at the lathe. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">4) must not roam around factory at will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">7) must refrain from the continuing use of the word discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-10\">8) must not drink alcoholic beverages or be intoxicated during working hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-11\">\u201cWith the understanding of the above rules and regulations, and understanding full well that the slightest infraction of any of the above rules shall mean immediate dismissal, Mr. Monteiro agreed to the reinstatement and accepted his position of \u2018lead man.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">In mid-1973 Monteiro filed further grievances and a \u201cCharge of Discrimination\u201d with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">In May of 1974, apparently before disposition of the above-mentioned charges of discrimination, Norman Courcy, Monteiro\u2019s former supervisor at the Taunton plant, was named as supervisor of the Fall River facility. The incident leading to Monteiro\u2019s presently contested discharge occurred about nine months later, in February of 1975. According to the district court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">\u201c[T]he event probably occurred in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-14\">\u201cThe plaintiff was away from his bench. Courcy ordered him back to his bench. Plaintiff said, in substance, \u2018What about the other people walking around? You are harassing me.\u2019 Plaintiff then complained that Courcy was discriminating against him. The altercation continued in spurts of conversation. The plaintiff attempted to involve Souza, the shop steward. He also accused Courcy of doing buffing work in violation of union rules. Finally, plaintiff made a more vigorous accusation of discrimination against Courcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-15\">\u201cThe plaintiff testified that at this point Courcy said, in substance, T will not be accused of discrimination. You\u2019re fired.\u2019 Courcy testified that he said, in substance, \u2018I\u2019ll not be accused of discrimination. I\u2019m ordering you back to your bench. You\u2019re not doing what' I\u2019ve told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>you to do, so you\u2019re fired.\u2019 In any case, the plaintiff refused to punch his time-card out, and Courcy did it himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">\u201cI find that Courcy\u2019s version of this conversation, or series of conversations, is probably more accurate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Although this depiction suggests a sudden and very brief confrontation, the parties agreed during argument in this court and in their briefs that the exchanges between Courcy and Monteiro took place over a period of some thirty minutes. Courcy says he warned Monteiro repeatedly to return to his work station, and told him that a refusal to do so constituted cause for discharge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Also according to Courcy, whose recollections the district court credited, it was not until after the above exchanges that Monteiro voiced his accusations of discrimination and ultimately was asked to punch out his time card.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">After this incident Monteiro filed a second charge of discrimination with the EEOC alleging, among other things, that he was discharged in retaliation for his opposition to unlawful employer practices. The EEOC issued its \u201cDetermination\u201d in which it addressed all of Monteiro\u2019s allegations of discrimination including those made in the earlier filed charge of 1973. While finding reasonable cause to believe that Monteiro had been temporarily demoted in 1972 by former supervisor Menzies because of his race, the Commission found that Monteiro\u2019s allegation of retaliatory discharge following the Courcy incident was \u201cnot substantiated by the evidence of record.\u201d Monteiro was subsequently issued a Notice of Right to Sue and commenced this action in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">As noted, the district court rejected all of Monteiro\u2019s claims, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>both that no policy of racial discrimination had been practiced or knowingly permitted by Poole, and that the plaintiff had failed to sustain his burden of proving that his discharge was motivated by racial prejudice. Monteiro does not appeal from either of these conclusions. He appeals solely from the court\u2019s rejection of his further contention that his discharge was in retaliation for his protected opposition to unlawful employment practices. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>The district court said the following about that issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">\u201cThere remains the question of retaliatory discharge. It is likely that the plaintiff\u2019s accusation of discrimination was one of the factors in bringing about his discharge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">\u201cI rule, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in this case is not protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). That section prohibits retaliation against an employer [sic] \u2018because he has opposed any [unlawful employment] practice.\u2019 This prohibition encompasses informal as well as formal opposition. <em>Hearth v. Metropolitan Transit Commission, </em>436 F.Supp. 685, 688-689 (D.Minn.1977). In my opinion, this section applies to orderly opposition and not to an isolated flare-up. It applies to situations in which the employee has a conscientiously held belief that there was racial discrimination. That may have been the plaintiff\u2019s belief, but it is at least as likely that the plaintiff decided that the best defense to correction from the superintendent was a strong offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-14\">\u201cI find this discharge to be essentially the result of a challenge by a volatile and voluble employee to the authority of a hard-nosed and short-fused supervisor. The result may have been unfortunate, but an action under Title VII does not provide a remedy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">Monteiro takes issue with the district court\u2019s statement that section 704(a) \u201capplies to situations in which the employee has a conscientiously held belief that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>was racial discrimination.\u201d Monteiro, citing <em>Hearth v. Metropolitan Transit Commission, </em>436 F.Supp. 685, 688 (D.Minn.1977), argues that \u201cinformal opposition by an employee who <em>reasonably believes </em>that he has been the victim of unlawful discrimination\u201d is protected. <em>See also Sias v. City Demonstration Agency, </em>588 F.2d 692 (9th Cir. 1978) (agreeing with <em>Hearth). </em>But this verbal distinction is of no assistance to Monteiro. The question in <em>Hearth </em>was whether, in order to prevail on a claim of retaliatory discharge, the plaintiff had to show that the employment practice complained of was <em>in fact </em>a Title VII violation. In holding that plaintiff need only reasonably believe that discrimination was being practiced before acting in \u201copposition,\u201d the <em>Hearth </em>court held that opposition conduct did not lose protection merely because the allegedly unlawful employment practice was later determined not to be violative of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The question here is not the same. The district court\u2019s rejection of Monteiro\u2019s claim of retaliatory discharge did not rest simply upon the fact that it found no actual discriminatory behavior on the part of his employer. Rather, the court went on to conclude, in substance, that Monteiro had not shown that his accusations of discrimination were voiced in good-faith \u201copposition\u201d to perceived employer misconduct; the court instead saw those accusations as likely having been raised as a smokescreen in challenge to the supervisor\u2019s legitimate criticism. In these circumstances, it is immaterial whether Monteiro was required to demonstrate that he harbored a \u201creasonable belief\u201d of discriminatory employer behavior or a \u201cconscientiously held belief\u201d of such misconduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under either standard \u2014 the employer\u2019s conduct being non-discriminatory in fact \u2014 the plaintiff must show that his so-called opposition was in response to some honestly held, if mistaken, feeling that discriminatory practices existed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the field of labor relations we have held that while the filing of a labor related civil action by employees is ordinarily a concerted activity protected by section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the employees forfeit that protection by filing such an action in bad faith. <em>Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>486 F.2d 686 (1st Cir. 1973). <em>Cf. NLRB v. Interboro Contractors, Inc., </em>388 F.2d- 495, 500 (2d Cir. 1967) (discussing whether employee\u2019s voicing of complaints of employer\u2019s alleged violation of collective bargaining contract is protected concerted activity and distinguishing complaints made for \u201clegitimate union purposes\u201d and those \u201cfabricated for personal motives\u201d). Section 704(a) is similarly unavailable to protect an employee who makes unfounded claims of discrimination in order to excuse non-compliance with legitimate employer demands. We interpret the court\u2019s language that \u201cit is at least as likely that [Monteiro] decided that the best defense to correction from the supervisor was a strong offense\u201d to mean that, under the traditional civil standard, Monteiro did not establish that in raising accusations of discrimination he was opposing conduct honestly perceived as unlawful. Where the motive of an employee in voicing allegations of employer misconduct is in issue, the trier\u2019s credibility determinations are entitled to great weight. <em>See Leviton, supra </em>at 690; Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Here, where no transcript has been provided, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>findings are virtually beyond review. <em>See United States v. One Motor Yacht Named Mercury, </em>527 F.2d 1112 (1st Cir. 1975); Fed.R.App.P. 10(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Monteiro further argues that the district court\u2019s conclusion that he did not harbor a conscientiously held belief of the existence of racial discrimination during his confrontation with supervisor Courcy is \u201cspeculative and inconsistent with and not supported by the court\u2019s factual findings,\u201d and that the court \u201cfailed to take its own factual findings into account in reaching its legal conclusion . . . .\u201d Monteiro contends, in essence, that the district court\u2019s references throughout its opinion to Monteiro\u2019s perceptions of discrimination and his actual subjection to discriminatory practices in the past compelled it to find that Monteiro\u2019s \u201cbelief that he was being discriminated against on the basis of his race when he confronted Courcy . . . was both reasonable and conscientiously held.\u201d Especially in the absence of a transcript, we cannot find merit in this argument. That on past occasions Monteiro was an actual or imagined victim of racial prejudice may have led him more easily to believe that he was being discriminated against, but did not compel the district court to find that he was responding to a belief of present discriminatory behavior when he confronted Courcy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In a related argument, Monteiro contends that the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cIt is likely that the plaintiff\u2019s accusation of discrimination was one of the factors in bringing about his discharge\u201d required the court to make a finding of retaliatory discharge violative of section 704(a). The short answer to this contention has already been discussed, namely that Monteiro\u2019s accusation of discrimination, being unfounded in fact and insincerely raised, did not constitute \u201copposition\u201d conduct entitled to the protection of section 704(a). Moreover, the finding below that Monteiro\u2019s accusation of discrimination was \u201cone of the factors in bringing about his discharge\u201d falls short of a finding that the accusation was a determinative factor in the discharge decision. While in <em>Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, </em>545 F.2d 222, 234 n.8 (1st Cir. 1976), we noted that we had \u201cno occasion to consider whether a discharge based on several reasons, at least one of which is impermissible under section 704(a), violates an employee\u2019s rights,\u201d it is by now clear, where motives are mixed, that the impermissible motive must be a determinative factor in the employer\u2019s decision if plaintiff is to prevail in proceedings of the present nature. <em>See Loeb v. Textron, </em>600 F.2d 1003, 1019-20 (1st Cir. 1979) (age discrimination). The court here was persuaded that Monteiro\u2019s termination was \u201cessentially the result of a challenge by a volatile and voluble employee to the authority of a hard-nosed and short-fused supervisor.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That it also found the insincere accusation of discrimination to be a factor in the termination decision does not undermine its ultimate ruling that no section 704(a) violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Monteiro isolates one further passage of the district court\u2019s findings in framing his challenge to that court\u2019s rejection of his retaliatory discharge claim. He contends that the district court erred in stating that section 704(a) \u201capplies to orderly opposition and not to an isolated flare-up.\u201d By itself, and out of context, the court\u2019s statement is doubtless too all-encompassing. Employee overreaction in \u201can isolated flareup\u201d might, in some other circumstances, be protected. <em>Cf. Trustees of Boston University v. NLRB, </em>548 F.2d 391 (1st Cir. 1977). However, Monteiro\u2019s failure to demonstrate that he responded in opposition to actual or even supposed unlawful employment practices makes further discussion of that issue unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\n<em>The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-14\">. Section 704(a) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">\u201cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">. The district court found that \u201cMenzies was in part motivated by racial prejudice\u201d in his treatment of Monteiro, but noted that Monteiro \u201cdoes not seek present redress on this account\u201d and that Menzies had since left the company. The court further found no evidence that racially discriminatory policies had been practiced or permitted by Poole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-17\">. The district court observed that \u201cWhile this condition [is] of very questionable enforceability, it may illuminate the relationship\u201d which existed between Monteiro and his employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. Poole points in its brief to the following provision of the collective bargaining agreement governing union-management relations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">\u201cArticle VIII</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">Discharge of Employees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">\u201cSection 1: The right to discharge employees shall remain a right of the Employer, except that no discharge shall be made without just cause. Just cause shall include, but shall not be limited to, among others, the following</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ao\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-17\">c. Insubordination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-18\">d. Refusal to work.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-5\">. The proposed \u201creasonable belief\u201d standard is, if anything, less favorable to plaintiff than the subjective standard articulated. The articulated standard would give plaintiff the benefit of an <em>unreasonable </em>belief that discrimination was being practiced so long as the belief was conscientiously held. To decide this case, we need not choose between the two standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. In his brief Monteiro contends that it is sufficient to make out a section 704(a) claim if \u201ca reasonable man standing in the plaintiffs posi<em>tion </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>given the plaintiffs observations and the circumstances surrounding the practices or actions he has opposed \u2014 would have believed that he had been the victim of unlawful discrimination.\u201d If Monteiro is arguing that it is enough that some reasonable person might have sensed discrimination even though this plaintiff actually did not, such an argument is without merit. Assuming, as is true in the present case, that the employer\u2019s actions to which the employee was responding were in fact nondiscriminatory, Title VII does not shield disruptive conduct taken in bad faith simply because some other worker might have been properly motivated in acting similarly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b103-13\">. It is apparent from the court\u2019s opinion that it accepted Poole\u2019s articulated reasons \u2014 Monteiro\u2019s refusal to work and his insubordination\u2014 as constituting the motivating reasons for discharge. <em>See generally, McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>v. <em>Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Sweeney v. Board of Trustees of Keene State College, </em>604 F.2d 106, 108 (1st Cir. 1979). Monteiro has presented us with no reason to disturb those findings. <em>See Sweeney, supra </em>at 109 (applying clearly erroneous standard).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
