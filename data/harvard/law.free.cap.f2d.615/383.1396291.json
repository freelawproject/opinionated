The district court held to the contrary, correctly in my present view. In view of the importance of the holding and the extraordinarily harsh and unusual nature of the forfeiture penalty, the issue merits en banc consideration. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from our denial of the defendants\u2019 application for rehearing en banc.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-28\">Before I discuss the statutory provisions in particular, it is appropriate to note, in the context of American history, the unusual nature of the present forfeiture provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sion. It hearkens back to pre-Revolutionary English law, when by forfeiture those who fell into Crown disfavor were subject to not only execution, imprisonment, or fine, but also to loss of their entire estate, whether inherited or however acquired. As this court stated in <em>United States v. Rubin, </em>559 F.2d 975, 991 n.15 (5th Cir. 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azl\">Unlike <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings against contraband or articles put to unlawful use, \u00a7 1963 operates against the person of the defendant and includes within the punishment for his crime forfeiture of a portion of his estate. Such a provision, while known to the common law of England and the colonies, is foreign to the federal criminal law. The 91st Congress recognized that, in passing \u00a7 1963, it was partially repealing a statute passed by the First Congress, which in its present form provides that: \u201cNo conviction or judgment shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture of estate.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3563. <em>See United States v. Mandel, </em>408 F.Supp. 679 (D.Md.1976); S.Rep. 91-617, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 79-80 (1969), (hereinafter S.Rep.); 116 Cong.Rec. 35205, 35208 (remarks of Rep. Mirka, Rep. Ryan).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><em>See generally </em>Taylor, <em>Forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963 </em>\u2014 RICO\u2019S <em>Most Powerful Weapon, </em>17 Am.Crim.L.Rev. 379 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL7\">Having this in mind, and also the principle that criminal laws and penalties are to be strictly construed, I am unable to agree with the persuasively-reasoned majority opinion that a section 1963 forfeiture, a most harsh and unusual penalty, was legislatively intended to be mandatory upon conviction. In the absence of stronger indication of Congressional intent to the contrary, the preferable construction of section 1963 is not to deprive the district court of any discretion whatsoever with regard to imposition of this penalty, in conformity with the usual statutory discretion accorded it with regard to the imprisonment and fine penalties provided by the same statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter <em>shall </em>be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both, and <em>shall </em>forfeit to the United States (1) any interest he has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962, and (2) any interest in, security of, claim against, or property or contractual right of any kind affording a source of influence over, any enterprise which he has established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of section 1962. (Italics added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">On its face, this section of the statute seems to mandate at least some fine or imprisonment (within statutory limits), as well as mandating forfeiture, with no suspension permitted for the sentence thus mandated. However, as the panel notes, the district court is empowered to suspend any imprisonment or fine imposed by virtue of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In terms, this enactment permits the suspension only of jail sentence, but it has been judicially interpreted to allow the suspension also of fines. Because the statute is silent as to forfeitures, however, the panel infers that a sentencing court is without authority to suspend this feature of a sentence, even though the suspension provision is equally silent as to suspension of a fine. I would not read into section 1963 any legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>intent to limit the usual power of the trial court, \u201cwhen satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the public as well as the defendant will be served thereby,\u201d to \u201csuspend the imposition or execution of sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">In the light of the usual discretion of the sentencing judge in the imposition of any sentence, I would not infer any Congressional intent, unless much more clearly stated, to deprive the judge of discretion in the imposition of the forfeiture penalty. In virtually all criminal penalties provided in Title 18, the word \u201cshall\u201d in the penalty provision is used in pro forma drafting style <em>\u2014\u201cshall </em>be fined ... or imprisoned\u201d is the terminology in virtually all the statutory sentence provisions. The circumstance that this sentencing formula word \u201cshall\u201d is used with regard to the forfeiture provision of the present statute does not, it seems to me, by itself indicate any Congressional intent to deny sentencing discretion to the trial court with regard to forfeiture, any more than it does with regard to imprisonment or fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">I am re-enforced in this view (a) by a particular provision in the racketeering statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 <em>et seq., </em>as well as (b) by the sweep of the statutory crime so broadly defined as, without judicial supervision, to raise the spectre of selective enforcement of the federal crime, in order to secure forfeitures for what in essence are local state crimes, by members of the executive branch less well-intentioned than those who brought the present prosecution. I cannot at the present believe it was the intention of Congress to leave to a prosecutor alone the determination to achieve forfeiture of an accused\u2019s property by prosecuting him under the federal racketeering statute for what, as statutorily defined with regard to the present case, represents only two or more violations of local bribery statutes or of somewhat esoterically applied federal crimes, themselves punishable by imprisonment or fine, but not by forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">First, having regard to the unusual nature of the forfeiture penalty and to the strict construction required of penal statutes, I believe, as did the trial judge, that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963 itself evidences an intention to afford the sentencing judge his usual sentencing discretion with regard to forfeitures. Subsection (c) provides: \u201cUpon conviction of a person under this section, the court shall authorize the Attorney General to seize all property or other interest <em>declared forfeited </em>under this section <em>upon such terms and conditions as the court shall deem proper.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Despite the panel\u2019s persuasive reasoning to the contrary, I, like the trial judge, feel that this statutory language allows the \u2022 sentencing judge discretion to provide the terms and conditions of forfeiture within the broad discretion thereby statutorily indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Second, with regard to the \u201cracketeering\u201d crime denounced by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 <em>et seq., </em>we ourselves noted in <em>United States v. Rubin, </em>559 F.2d at 991:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">Besides the unprecedented nature of the forfeiture sanction, the uncertain reach of \u201cpatterns of racketeering activity\u201d \u2014 the gravamen of a \u00a7 1962 offense\u2014 requires interpretive caution in this area. While addressed to organized crime, the Act is not limited in application to members of that undertaking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">In the present case, the defendants were convicted of a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), as being employees of or persons associated with an enterprise affecting interstate commerce who directly or indirectly participated in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs \u201cthrough a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d In 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5), a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d is defined as \u201cat least two acts of racketeering activity.\u201d With regard to the conduct of the present defendants, \u201cracketeering activity\u201d is statutorily defined, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1), as (A) \u201cany act . . . involving . bribery . . ., which is chargeable under State law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\u201d and (B) \u201cany act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of Title 18, United States Code:\u201d mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; interstate travel and the use of interstate instrumentalities with intent to commit bribery under state law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The context facts show that, accepting the jury finding, R. J. L\u2019Hoste &amp; Company, Inc., and the defendants, its employees and officers, corruptly influenced a local governmental unit to give them no-bid \u201cemergency work\u201d contracts and corruptly performed these contracts. The local bribery in violation of state law, and the routine business use of the mails and of interstate travel in performing the work (and affording a Las Vegas trip to a corrupted official), apparently brings within the literal sweep of the federal racketeering statute conduct which many might regard as exemplifying garden variety, local political corruption rather than federally cognizable interstate racketeering.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">It is well to note, at this time, that no matter how isolated and minor two \u201cracketeering\u201d incidents might be in the context of the entire business conducted by the enterprise, the federal statute literally construed is violated, and the defendant\u2019s entire interest in the enterprise is subject to forfeiture under the statute. I emphasize this, because it is not readily conceivable to me that the Congress intended automatic forfeiture of an entire ownership in a business enterprise, however and whenever acquired (whether by inheritance or by legitimate business operations), irrespective of the magnitude of the \u201cracketeering\u201d conduct involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">For all we know, the overwhelming bulk of the business of the present contracting corporation was entirely legitimate in nature, and the corrupt contracts only a miniscule portion of it. Yet, according to the panel holding \u2014 and even if, instead of the extended conduct here shown, only two minor incidents of bribery have been shown over ten years \u2014 and no matter how minor and incidental may have been the accused\u2019s personal participation in the bribery of pub-lie officials by his employees \u2014 , the defendant L\u2019Hoste\u2019s entire interest in the corporation is forfeited upon conviction of this crime. Private ownership of property is too fundamental a value of our political and economic philosophy for me to believe that Congress ever intended that a lifetime\u2019s legitimate earnings or an inherited estate invested in a legitimate business enterprise should, to the prejudice of wife and child as well as the accused,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> be automatically forfeited upon a conviction resulting from a federal prosecutor\u2019s decision to prosecute local bribery under the federal racketeering statute, or to utilize it instead of the (rather esoterically applied) mail-fraud statute as a basis for federal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">I must therefore respectfully dissent, with respect to whether forfeiture is mandatory upon conviction, from the denial of the defendant\u2019s application for an en banc rehearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-5\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651 provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">Upon entering a judgment of conviction of any offense not punishable by death or life imprisonment, any court having jurisdiction to try offenses against the United States when satisfied that the ends of justice and the best interest of the publicas well as the defendant will be served thereby, may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABd\">Probation may be granted whether the offense is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both. If an offense is punishable by both fine and imprisonment, the court may impose a fine and place the defendant on probation as to imprisonment. Probation may be limited to one or more counts or indictments, but, in the absence of express limitation, shall extend to the entire sentence and judgment.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-6\">. Nor do I at this time consider the possibility that forfeiture, unevenly and disproportionately applied if mandated as automatically applicable, raises Eighth Amendment issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b480-7\">. As the trial court noted, the community property system of Louisiana vested in the wife an interest in property acquired during the marriage. Likewise, Louisiana\u2019s forced heirship provisions regard the property of an individual, although fully subject to his administration, as property which must descend to his children; it is, in a sense, the property of the family rather than of the individual himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
