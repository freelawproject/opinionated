Sorensen, Sr., Arthur W. Sorensen, Jr., and Robert C. Sorensen (hereinafter the \u201cSorensen appellees\u201d), Steven H. Hnatvik, and Willie K. Thomas. We disagree in part and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-21\">Appellant\u2019s decedent, Darryl Mouat, was killed on October 29,1973, while operating a truck on the New York State Thruway, when a tractor-trailer driven by appellee Hnatvik crossed the median strip and struck the Mouat truck. Appellee Thomas owned the Hnatvik tractor. The trailer was owned, at least previously, by Gray Line, and bore its ICC permit number. Gray Line had leased the trailer to Thomas, whose driver was making a delivery of newspapers for Gray Line at the time of the accident. The Sorensen appellees acquired certain Gray Line interests and ICC rights, and some of its vehicles and trailers, three weeks before the accident, and there was apparently a bill of sale covering the trailer in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>A Pennsylvania executor brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Pennsylvania survival and wrongful death statutes,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but only against Gray Line. The decedent and the sole beneficiary of his estate, a minor daughter, were citizens of Pennsylvania. Suit was also brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering, against all appellees. The Pennsylvania suit was settled with the approval of the Pennsylvania court for $140,000, $130,000 being applied to the survival action and $10,000 to the wrongful death action. A release executed in Pennsylvania and running to Gray Line was expressly \u201cwithout prejudice to plaintiff to proceed against Willie K. Thomas and Steven H. Hnatvik\u201d in the pending federal court action, with no mention being made of the Sorensen appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">The district court dismissed the complaint by applying New York conflict-of-laws rules, as it was required to do, <em>Klaxon Co. </em>v. <em>Stentor Electric Manufacturing Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 496, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941), and finding, under <em>Babcock v. Jackson, </em>12 N.Y.2d 473, 240 N.Y.S.2d 743, 191 N.E.2d 279 (1963), Pennsylvania law applicable to what the judge conceived as the issues in the case: whether particular defendants were financially responsible for the accident, whether an employer is a joint tortfeasor with his employee, and whether the release to Gray Line operated to release all other defendants below. The judge found the Pennsylvania common-law rule of respondeat superior applicable, rather than the vicarious liability imposed upon all vehicle owners under N.Y.Veh. &amp; Traf.Law \u00a7 388.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This finding implicitly exonerated the Sorensen appellees', whose only connection with the accident was their possible status as vendees of the trailer. The district judge also held that an employer is not a joint tortfeasor with his employee, relying on the case of <em>Builders Supply Co. v. McCabe, </em>366 Pa. 322, 77 A.2d 368 (1951), although it preceded the adoption by Pennsylvania of the Uniform Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>held that such an employer is merely secondarily liable to the primarily liable operator or employee. By virtue of this holding appellant could not benefit by the Uniform Act\u2019s provisions that a release of one joint tortfeasor does not release others unless the release so provides.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Then, returning to Pennsylvania\u2019s common law, the district court held that the release of one secondarily liable tortfeasor, Gray Line, even with a reservation of rights, constituted a release of all parties, citing <em>Union of Russian Societies of St. Michael and St. George v. Koss, </em>348 Pa. 574, 577, 36 A.2d 433, 434 (1944), and distinguishing cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that dealt with tortfeasors who allegedly committed independent and separate tortious acts. We do not see the case in quite the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">I. <em>The Effect of the Release</em></p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">We agree with the district court that under <em>Babcock v. Jackson, supra, </em>and related cases, <em>see Rosenthal v. Warren, </em>475 F.2d 438 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 856, 94 S.Ct. 159, 38 L.Ed.2d 106 (1973), with respect to the effect of a release New York would look to the law of the state with the \u201csuperior interest\u201d in having its policy or law applied. Thus the effect of this Pennsylvania release, executed by a Pennsylvania plaintiff, in respect to a Pennsylvania estate\u2019s claim for relief, is a matter that would ordinarily be governed by Pennsylvania law. This is true despite intimations in Ehrenzweig, <em>Releases of Concurrent TortFeasors in the Conflict of Laws: Law and Reason Versus the Restatement, </em>46 U.Va.L. Rev. 712 (1960), that the better rule of law is, as urged by Dean Prosser,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to permit recovery after the release of one joint tortfeasor (with or without a reservation of rights),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that this better rule should always be applied by the forum state.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is clear that the New York conflict-of-laws cases have not taken this \u201cBetter Rule of Law\u201d approach. <em>Rosenthal v. Warren, supra, </em>475 F.2d at 441 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">There remains a question whether, in some revisitation of renvoi, the New York courts would look \u2014 in their \u201cinterest analysis\u201d approach \u2014 to the whole law of Pennsylvania (including Pennsylvania\u2019s conflict-of-laws rules), <em>see Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 8, or only to the local Pennsylvania law on releases. Even if the New York courts did look to the whole law, however, we believe a Pennsylvania court would follow its own substantive law to determine the effect of a release given by its citizen(s), even if the accident occurred out-of-state. <em>Bittner v. Little, supra </em>note 10, is, we believe, no longer likely to be followed, because the second <em>Restatement </em>generally determines the effect on one joint tortfeasor of a release given to another by reference to the local law of the state which has the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d to the occurrence and the parties. <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7\u00a7 170, 145, and 6. The second <em>Restatement </em>is so authoritative that the Pennsylvania courts would, we feel, still apply the analogy of \u00a7 170 even if the district judge were correct in suggesting that this is not strictly speaking a case of <em>joint </em>tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>Thus we must look to Pennsylvania local law. Several factors become relevant here. The first is the status of Gray Line as a tortfeasor. Under Pennsylvania law, a release \u201cgiven to one not show'n to be liable does not release a tort feasor.\u201d <em>Union of Russian Societies of St. Michael and St. George, supra, </em>348 Pa. at 578, 36 A.2d at 435. Here, the released party, Gray Line, has denied liability in the release agreed to by plaintiff. But this denial is not determinative because, if the law is such that the other appellees may gain thereby, they retain the right to keep Gray Line among the named defendants and ultimately show its tortfeasor status. <em>Davis v. Miller, </em>385 Pa. 348, 123 A.2d 422 (1956).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus our remaining conclusions must be based on the assumption that Gray Line will ultimately be shown to be a tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">We must turn then to the relationships between Gray Line and the other appellees. Does Pennsylvania law dictate that the acting, primarily liable employee is released by a release to his general employer? Does it also dictate that the secondarily liable specific employer (Thomas) or the vicariously liable vendees of the trailer (the Sorensens) are similarly released? The key issue is whether or not these other appellees are joint tortfeasors with Gray Line for purposes of the Uniform Act, 42 Pa.Cons. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 8326, which, as we have noted, provides that the release of one <em>joint </em>tortfeasor does not release others. We hold that all appellees were joint tortfeasors for these purposes,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and therefore we hold that none of the other appellees was released by the release to Gray Line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-8\">Our general conclusion is supported by the' language of the Act itself, which defines the term \u201cjoint tortfeasors\u201d quite broadly. The term \u201cmeans two or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to persons or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d 42 Pa. Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 8322; <em>see, e. g., Smith v. Raparot, </em>101 R.I. 565, 225 A.2d 666 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-9\">Looking more specifically at the various appellees, we note that the possible liability of the Sorensen interests and of Thomas (driver Hnatvik\u2019s full-time employer) is, like the liability of Gray Line, secondary or vicarious. It has long been held that two parties who are each secondarily liable are considered joint tortfeasors as between each other. <em>E. g., Gordon v. S. M. Byers Motor Car Co., </em>309 Pa. 453, 459, 164 A. 334, 336 (1932); <em>see Grasberger v. Liebert &amp; Obert, Inc., </em>134 Pa.Super. 78, 4 A.2d 186, <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>335 Pa. 491, 6 A.2d 925 (1939). More importantly, there is the case of <em>Mazer v. Lipshutz, </em>360 F.2d 275 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 833, 87 S.Ct. 72, 17 L.Ed.2d 68 (1966) <em>(Mazer II), </em>where the Third Circuit held that a release given to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>hospital for the negligence of a head technician in charge of a hospital blood bank, reserving rights, <em>inter alia, </em>against the operating room surgeon, did not release the surgeon even though the technician was also subordinate to him during the operation. The court relied on Pennsylvania law to the effect that a servant may have two masters at one time, <em>McConnell v. Williams, </em>361 Pa. 355, 361, 65 A.2d 243, 245 (1949), a proposition which, if it is not universal, should be. <em>Mazer </em>holds then that the two <em>masters </em>are joint tortfeasors for purposes of the Uniform Act. <em>See also Mazer v. Lipshutz, </em>327 F.2d 42, 54-55 (3d Cir. 1963) <em>(Mazer I). But cf. Sheppard v. Atlantic States Gas Co., </em>72 F.Supp. 185 (E.D.Pa.1947), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>167 F.2d 841 (3d Cir. 1948). We find <em>Mazer </em>to be controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">As for the driver Hnatvik, whose liability is primary, rather than secondary, his status in relation to Gray' Line is furthest from that of a \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d in the traditional sense. And there is, in addition, at least one case, <em>George v. Brehm, </em>246 F.Supp. 242 (W.D.Pa.1965), which reads the Act as not applying to a case involving one primarily and one secondarily liable defendant. The court there held applicable the common law rule that release of a primarily liable tortfeasor also releases one who is secondarily liable. <em>Id. </em>at 246. Nevertheless, regardless of the continued vitality of the specific rule stated in <em>George, </em>we feel certain that the courts of Pennsylvania would no longer apply the converse rule, releasing a primarily liable wrongdoer whenever there has been a release of a secondarily liable party. To do so would be anomalous, since such a release would then, based on our prior conclusions, not release other secondarily liable parties, but would release the primarily liable wrongdoer. We therefore hold that Hnatvik, like the other appellees, was a joint tortfeasor for purposes of Pa.Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8326, and has not been released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">As to the effect of the release on any damages received by appellant in the New York wrongful death action, a question which may face the district court, we think the New York courts would again look at the law of Pennsylvania. Assuming that the tortfeasor status of Gray Line is demonstrated, \u00a7 8326 would apply and require a reduction of any awards against other appellees by the amount already received from Gray Line. At minimum, there would be a reduction for the $10,000 already received for wrongful death. We leave to the district court the issue whether there should be a further reduction based on the $130,-000 \u201csurvival\u201d recovery in Pennsylvania\u2014 either because\u2019 some portion of that sum was actually for wrongful death and was improperly or erroneously otherwise labeled in the settlement agreement, or because some portion overlaps with a \u201cconscious pain and suffering\u201d recovery in New York. If, on the other hand, Gray Line is shown not to be a tortfeasor, there would be no reduction, since the benefit of this payment by a non-tortfeasor would not inure to a liable defendant. <em>E. g., Davis v. Miller, </em>385 Pa. 348, 123 A.2d 422 (1956).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-8\">II. <em>The Vicarious Liability Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-9\">There remains a question whether, regardless of the release, the claim against the Sorensen interests must be dismissed because it is solely vicarious \u2014 based on mere ownership \u2014 rather than based on respondeat superior as Pennsylvania law requires. As we noted, New York law, N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.Law \u00a7 388, does provide for purely vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-10\">We do not think that New York\u2019s \u201cinterest analysis\u201d leads inevitably to the proposition that a New York forum court would look to the law of the victim\u2019s place of domicile (Pennsylvania) to determine the liability of the owner of the negligent vehicle. To the contrary, New York would seem to have the greater interest in determining who is liable for accidents taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>place within its borders. The New York statutory policy extending liability beyond its original respondeat superior limits alone speaks strongly to this. One major purpose of this change was to help ensure that innocent accident victims would have a solvent defendant from whom to recover. <em>See Continental Auto Lease Corp. v. Campbell, </em>19 N.Y.2d 350, 280 N.Y.S.2d 123, 227 N.E.2d 28 (1967) (dictum). But in addition, New York sought to discourage owners from lending or leasing vehicles to irresponsible drivers; it has pursued that goal by imposing liability irrespective of agency or employment. <em>See White </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>398 F.Supp. 130, 136 (D.N.J.1975); <em>Aarons v. Standard Varnish Works, </em>163 Misc. 84, 296 N.Y.S. 312, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>254 App.Div. 560, 3 N.Y.S.2d 910 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">When we compare Pennsylvania\u2019s interest in the vicarious liability issue with that of New York, it becomes clear that Pennsylvania\u2019s interest is relatively minimal. If Pennsylvania law applies, the beneficiary represented by appellant, a <em>citizen </em>of that state, may suffer a substantial financial <em>loss </em>since the Sorensen interests will not be liable. New York, on the other hand, has a real interest in deterring loans and leases of vehicles to irresponsible drivers using New York roads, a local interest that is quite similar to a state\u2019s interest in the standard of care applied to accidents within its borders. <em>See Babcock v. Jackson, supra, </em>240 N.Y.S.2d at 750-51, 191 N.E.2d at 284-85 (dictum) (negligence principles of state where accident occurred should apply).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus we believe that the Sorensen interests may be held vicariously liable and that they stand in essentially the same position for our purposes as does Willie Thomas, the tractor owner and full-time employer of the driver Hnatvik.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">Judgment reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">. The Act is codified at 42 Pa.Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 8321-8327, formerly at Pa.Stat.Ann. tit. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 2082-2089.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1039-22\">.

The Pennsylvania Survival Act permits an executor to recover the pecuniary loss <em>to the decedent himself, </em>and thus to his estate, as well as damages for his conscious pain and suffering. 20 P.S. \u00a7 320.621.

The New York law is broader in some respects because it imposes liability on both the owners of a tractor and those of its trailer, as well as on a vendee, from the moment he takes possession.

Ironically, the case Professor Ehrenzweig\u2019s article criticizes, <em>id. </em>at 713, is a Pennsylvania diversity case where the court rather woodenly applied the law of the place of the accident (Virginia) to hold a release of one to bar action against other tort-feasors. <em>Bittner v.

Interestingly, when a plaintiff and one tortfeasor agree to a release that <em>concedes </em>liability, at least in effect, by calling for a reduction in any further recoveries against other defendants by the amount already received, that concession <em>is </em>determinative. <em>Griffin v. United States, </em>500 F.2d 1059, 1071-73 (3d Cir. 1974). The concession is a benefit bargained for by the released party, to avoid further litigation. A pro rata reduction may also be the result when the tortfeasor status of a release party is clear from the circumstances. <em>See Mazer v. Security Ins. Corp., </em>507 F.2d 1338 (3d Cir. 1975) (en banc) <em>(Mazer III).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1042-6\">. If the converse were true, the question would be whether the Pennsylvania common law rule that release of one releases all, <em>Hilbert </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>395 Pa. 270, 149 A.2d 648 (1959) (judgment); <em>Thompson v. Fox, </em>326 Pa. 209, 192 A. 107 (1937) (settlement), applies not only to joint tortfeasors but also to tortfeasors that are related in other ways. <em>Union of Russian Societies of St. Michael &amp; St. George, supra, </em>at first blush, appears to give us a negative answer, 348 Pa. at 578, 36 A.2d at 434 (\u201cNor is it material whether the tort-feasors involved committed a joint tort or concurrent or successive torts, because the principle which underlies the rule is that the injured person is given a legal remedy only to obtain compensation for the damage done to him, and when that compensation has been received from any of the wrongdoers, his right to further remedy is at an end.\"). This case of course begs the question whether he has obtained compensation when he has settled with one party, a question that at least in <em>Frank v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., </em>522 F.2d 321, 323-28 (3d Cir. 1975), was thought to be determinative after enactment of the Uniform Act under <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Wilt, </em>410 Pa. 356, 188 A.2d 722 (1963), <em>quoted in id. </em>at 325-26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">. As we noted above, the release to Gray Line did not contain a concession of liability. Therefore, a showing of liability in court, or some objective indication of liability, <em>see Griffin v. United States, </em>500 F.2d 1059, 1071-73 (3d Cir. 1974), is required before a reduction under \u00a7 8326 in the damages paid by other tortfeasors will take place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1044-8\">. New York\u2019s interest in applying its vicarious liability statute to this accident is thus stronger than its interest in applying the statute when New York-registered vehicles injure out-of-state people in out-of-state accidents. Even in that situation, however, courts have applied the New York statute. <em>See White </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>398 F.Supp. 130 (D.N.J.1975); <em>Johnson v. Hertz Corp., </em>315 F.Supp. 302 (S.D.N.Y.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1044-6\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Azq\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-7\">I concur in the result. I agree that all appellees were joint tortfeasors and that \u201cnone of the other appellees was released by the release to Gray Line\u201d, if by \u201cother appellees\u201d is meant appellees other than The Gray Line appellees. I would not speculate as to what the courts of Pennsylvania may decide in the joint tortfeasor field. It is clear, however, that Gray Line bought its peace vis-a-vis the Mouat Estate and that the consequences thereof should be governed by the laws of Pennsylvania.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
