On petition for panel rehearing, the majority opinion is modified by inserting the following paragraph after the thirteenth line, in the first column, on page 545:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-14\">Where the information leading to the formulation of the officer\u2019s reasonable belief is supplied by a confidential informant, a defendant at a motion to suppress hearing may challenge the validity of the information under <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964), and <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969). <em>See generally Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>473 F.2d 599, 605-06 n.3 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 953, 93 S.Ct. 323, 37 L.Ed.2d 1007 (1973). The inquiry to be made is simple and straightforward: Were the officers who decided to act on the information supplied by the confidential informant aware at the time they chose to act of \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d making the informant \u201creliable\u201d and his information \u201ccredible\u201d? The record discloses that Agents Rassey and Goodowens were' aware of such underlying circumstances. The confidential informant\u2019s record of past reliability was known to Agent Rassey and is unchallenged by appellants\u2019 counsel. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra </em>at 542-43. Additionally, Agent Rassey was aware that the informant had known both \u201cJimmy\u201d and Ricky Lyons for a number of years, that the informant had spoken to \u201cJimmy\u201d in the Detroit area during or just before Christmas 1977, that the informant on January 14, 1978, had spoken with \u201cJimmy\u201d by telephone and had been given a telephone number in the Atlanta, Georgia, \u2019 area where \u201cJimmy\u201d and Ricky Lyons would be within the next twenty-four hours, and that during a subsequent telephone conversation with \u201cJimmy\u201d the confidential informant had heard Ricky Lyons\u2019 voice in the background. Agent Rassey passed much of this information along to Agent Goodowens. The knowledge of both the confidential informant\u2019s past reliability and the precise methods by which he gathered his information in this case provided sufficient underlying circumstances from which the agent properly could conclude that the informant was reliable and the information he supplied was credible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-18\">In all other respects, the petition for panel rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-19\">A member of the court in active service having requested a poll on the reconsideration of these causes en banc, and a majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>of the judges in active service not having voted in favor of it, the petition for rehearing en banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b738-4\">KRAVITCH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AkaR\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">I disagree with the majority that the tenuous information appended to the panel opinion satisfies the teachings of <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli. </em>The more important problem, however, is the extension of the rule announced in <em>United States v. Cravero, </em>545 F.2d 406 (5th Cir. 1976), a rule of questionable validity and wisdom even in the less egregious circumstances present in that case. Expansion of this rule constitutes a disturbing erosion of the Fourth Amendment rights of third parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
