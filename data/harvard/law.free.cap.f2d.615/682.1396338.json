Redstone Federal Credit Union, </em>615 F.2d 679 (5th Cir. 1980). In finding a violation of Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.7(a)(7), the district court held that, by analogy, the requirements of <em>Pollock v. General Finance Corp., </em>535 F.2d 295, 299-399 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>petition for rehearing denied, </em>552 F.2d 1142, <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 891, 98 S.Ct. 265, 54 L.Ed.2d 176 (1977), were fully applicable to open-end transactions under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-21\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Elzea v. National Bank of Georgia, </em>570 F.2d 1248, 1249 (5th Cir. 1978), supports Redstone\u2019s contention that <em>Pollock </em>should be limited to its peculiar facts. Nevertheless, the district court\u2019s finding of a TILA violation is correct. Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>tion 226.7(a)(7) of Regulation Z requires that a creditor disclose to the customer, in a single written statement,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\"><em>The conditions under which the creditor may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the account, </em>and a description or identification of the type of the interest or interests which may be so retained or acquired. [Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The disclosure-on-the-same-page rule of <em>Harris v. Tower Loan of Mississippi, Inc., </em>609 F.2d 120, 122-23 (5th Cir. 1980) and <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Krauss Co., Ltd., </em>572 F.2d 544, 546 (5th Cir. 1978), is not applicable to open-end credit arrangements. <em>See Charles, </em>572 F.2d at 546 n. 1. However, the emphasized language of the regulation clearly requires that the creditor disclose more than the fact of its retention of a security interest. Here, the disclosure statement fails to disclose on its face either the after-acquired property clause or the 10-day limitation on its operation. While the reverse side of the document discloses an after-acquired property clause, even that portion of the document fails to reveal the 10-day limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Thus, neither side of the statement meets the requirement of section 226.7(a)(7) that the lender disclose \u201c[t]he <em>conditions under which </em>the creditor may retain or acquire any security interest in any property to secure the payment of any credit extended on the account . . . \u201d Therefore, the carryover application of <em>Pollock </em>is unnecessary, because the regulatory language itself mandates the additional disclosure by the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">For these reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
