Haney pleaded guilty to two counts of distributing heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The sentencing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>found that Haney was suitable for handling under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. Accordingly, Haney was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) until discharged by the Federal Youth Correction Division of the Board of Parole as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c). Additionally, the sentencing judge imposed a special parole term of three years. It is the imposition of the special parole term of three years that precipitates the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">Haney later filed a motion to amend and correct sentence. He asked that the imposition of the special parole term of three years be stricken from his sentence. His argument was that the special parole term provided in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) could not be imposed in connection with a commitment under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b). The sentencing judge disagreed, and denied Haney\u2019s motion to amend and correct sentence. The sentencing judge was apparently of the view that a commitment pursuant to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) did not preclude the imposition of the special parole term provided for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Haney now appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">As mentioned, Haney pleaded guilty to violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The sentencing section of that statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-6\">Any sentence imposing a term of imprisonment under this paragraph shall, in the absence of such a prior conviction, impose a special parole term of at least 3 years in addition to such term of imprisonment</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">As indicated, the sentencing judge determined not to sentence Haney under the provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), and committed Haney to the custody of the Attorney General under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b). That statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8X\">If the court shall find that a convicted person is a youth offender, and the offense is punishable by imprisonment under applicable provisions of law other than this subsection, the court may, in lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law, sentence the youth offender to the custody of the Attorney General for treatment and supervision pursuant to this chapter until discharged by the Division as provided in section 5017(c) of this chapter; .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Another provision of the Federal Youth Corrections Act which has present pertinency is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c). That statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-11\">A youth offender committed under section 5010(b) of this chapter shall be released conditionally under supervision on or before the expiration of four years from the date of his conviction and shall be discharged unconditionally on or before six years from the date of his conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">We are not here concerned with whether a sentencing judge who commits a defendant to the custody of the Attorney General under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) <em>should </em>have the power to also impose a special parole term. Perhaps it would be wise to authorize him to so do. That decision, however, is up to Congress. Our problem is whether, under existing statutory law, a sentencing judge presently <em>has </em>the power to impose a special parole term in connection with a commitment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b). Under the existing statutes, we conclude that a sentencing judge does not now have that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">The Federal Youth Corrections Act does <em>not </em>itself provide for a special parole term. That phrase, special parole term, is mentioned, however, in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). In that regard, the statute provides that \u201cany sentence imposing a term of imprisonment <em>under this paragraph </em>shall . impose a special parole term of at least 3 years in addition to such term of imprisonment . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The sentence imposed in the instant case was <em>not </em>imposed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), but under the Federal Youth Corrections Act. Therefore, the sentencing judge could not impose the special parole term provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), since Haney was not sentenced under that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Furthermore, the commitment provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b), which statute makes <em>no </em>mention of any special parole term, is, under the statute, to be \u201cin lieu of the penalty of imprisonment otherwise provided by law.\u201d Finally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5017(c), which governs the discharge of a youth offender committed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b), provides that such offender \u201cshall be discharged <em>unconditionally </em>on or before six years from the date of his conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">We conclude that as a matter of pure statutory construction, a sentencing judge may not commit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(b) and in connection therewith impose the special parole - term provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The sentencing judge has certain discretion which allows him to go one route or the other, but he may not combine the sentencing features of the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Our resolution of this matter is supported by <em>United States </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>543 F.2d 721 (9th Cir. 1976). In <em>Myers </em>the Ninth Circuit held that where a sentencing judge chooses to sentence a defendant under the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act, he is foreclosed from adding onto the sentence thus imposed the special parole term provided for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">We do not regard <em>Durst v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 542, 98 S.Ct. 849, 55 L.Ed.2d 14 (1978) as dispositive of the present controversy. In <em>Durst </em>the sentencing judge placed youth offenders on probation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5010(a) and as a condition of probation ordered restitution and payment of a fine. The Supreme Court upheld the conditions imposed by the sentencing judge in connection with the granting of probation. <em>Durst </em>is not the present case. In our view, a fair reading of the several provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5010(b) and 5017(c) precludes the imposition of a special parole term on Haney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">The judgment and order denying Haney\u2019s motion to amend and correct sentence is reversed, and the cause remanded with directions to modify the sentence previously imposed by striking therefrom the special parole term of three years.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
