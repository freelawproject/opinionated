HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b771-26\">Appellant was the vice-president in charge of trucking for E.T. Barwick Indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>tries, Inc., a carpet manufacturer. During 1972 and 1973, Barwick trucks were engaged in a practice known in the industry as \u201cillegal backhauling.\u201d Appellant was not prosecuted for his involvement in the illegal scheme; rather, he was indicted for failing to include in his tax returns for 1972 and 1973 income allegedly received by him from those who had been provided with the illegal service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In his opening statement, defense counsel admitted appellant\u2019s involvement in the illegal activities. He also conceded that appellant had received the illegal payments, but told the jury that the defense would establish that the money was received for and ultimately spent on behalf of Barwick, and therefore did not constitute income to appellant. The relevant portion of the opening statement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">This is the critical fact in this case, and it\u2019s the most difficult thing for a jury. This is what you are going to have to decide about the case. That money was used, I think we can prove it to your satisfaction, the money was used, went to Mr. Downs\u2019 checking account, was used to pay people off throughout the system to make it work, pay off that scale that you see on the interstate highways when you go between Atlanta and Tennessee, pay off those truck scale men that run the system to make sure that E.T. Barwick Company, without the ICC, knowing it is coming back to Atlanta, knowing it is full of goods, knowing it is breaking the law, that money was used to make the system work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">I think we will be able to prove it, that money was spent by Mr. Down on behalf of E.T. Barwick Industries. That is not good. That is not right. But that\u2019s not what he is charged with. He is charged with income tax evasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Record, vol. III, at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">At the close of the government\u2019s case, appellant moved for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was denied. The defense then exercised its right not to offer any evidence and rested. During the closing argument, the prosecutor, apparently prompted by the straw man erected in defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, made two comments which, appellant contends, require us to reverse his convictions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The first allegedly improper remark directly related to defense counsel\u2019s opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">Ladies and gentlemen, you probably noticed right from the beginning of this case the flavor of the case as it was presented, right at the very start. You will recall the opening statement by Mr. Martin, counsel for the defendant, when he said, oh, yes, the defendant was doing wrong here, that it will be shown; but he said at the same time that doesn\u2019t mean he was doing wrong here, of course, denying any kind of tax liability or tax implications, but at the same time admitting he was a wrongdoer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-13\">Record, vol. IV, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">Counsel objected to the comment, claiming that the prosecutor was attempting to argue to the jury that appellant was a habitual criminal. Appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied, but the jury was instructed to disregard that part of the prosecutor\u2019s statement \u201cin which he alluded to the defendant as being a wrongdoer.\u201d Record vol. IV, at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">Even assuming that the prosecutor tried to paint appellant as a \u201cbad man,\u201d a new trial is not required. At the very least, all but the last eleven words of the prosecutor\u2019s comment is attributable to the opening remarks of defense counsel. The bulk of the statement merely was a rehashing of what appellant\u2019s attorney had first said. The error, if any, was invited by appellant\u2019s attorney, and, therefore, cannot now be claimed as grounds for reversal. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>604 F.2d 361, 366 (5th Cir. 1979). With respect to the last part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the comment \u2014 \u201cbut at the same time admitting that he was a wrongdoer\u201d \u2014 the trial court\u2019s instruction adequately protected appellant from any potential prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Later in his closing argument, the prosecutor reminded the jury that appellant\u2019s attorney, Mr. Martin, \u201cchose not to present a defense.\u201d Record, vol. IV, at 11. Appellant again unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial. The jury was instructed that the defendant in a criminal case is not required to present a defense, and that they should disregard the prosecutor\u2019s comment. Record, vol. IV, at 15. It is urged that the comment was an impermissible reference to appellant\u2019s failure to testify, and that it had the effect of shifting the burden of proof, at least in the minds of the jurors, to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">We do not think that the comment \u201cwas manifestly intended or was of such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dearden, </em>546 F.2d 622, 625 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 902, 98 S.Ct. 295, 54 L.Ed.2d 188 (1977); <em>accord, United States v. Harbin, </em>601 F.2d 773, 777 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. Chandler, </em>586 F.2d 593, 603 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 927, 99 S.Ct. 1262, 59 L.Ed.2d 483 (1979); <em>United States v. Ward, </em>552 F.2d 1080, 1083 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 850, 98 S.Ct. 161, 54 L.Ed.2d 119 (1977). It appears more likely that the prosecutor was attempting to point out to the jury that the government\u2019s case was unrebutted. That type of argument does not violate the defendant\u2019s right not to testify. <em>United States v. Dearden, </em>546 F.2d at 625. And we find no merit to the contention that the statement had the effect of shifting the burden of proof in the minds of the jurors. Any prejudice which might otherwise have resulted from the comment was prevented by the court\u2019s instruction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-9\">.
