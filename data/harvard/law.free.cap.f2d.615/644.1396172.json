R. 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b738-25\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b738-26\">In 1971, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a commitment to insure a $2,143,000 mortgage for the construction of the Casa Claire apartment project in Mesquite, Texas, pursuant to \u00a7 221(d)(4) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17157(d)(4) (1976). Section 221(d)(4) is a program of mortgage insurance enacted by Congress to \u201cassist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>private industry in providing housing for low and moderate income families and displaced families.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17157(a). Under this program, a private lender provides permanent financing for construction of a housing project, and the Secretary insures the mortgage and agrees to buy it out in the event of default. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 17157 (b) and (g) (1976). The program is funded from the General Insurance Fund, a mortgage insurance fund created in 1965 from a number of pre-existing mortgage insurance funds. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1735c (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The \u201cinitial closing\u201d of the Casa Claire apartment project occurred on March 16, 1971, and construction began and proceeded on schedule. In May, 1972, construction was almost complete when the project owners defaulted on their mortgage interest payments. The mortgagee foreclosed on the apartment project and eventually deeded the property to the Secretary in order to obtain the mortgage insurance. The Secretary succeeded to all the rights and obligations of the lender under the building loan agreement, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17157(g) (incorporating 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1713[g]), and paid the mortgagee $1,884,465.80 for the sum it had paid out and $91,179.22 for the interest thereon, in satisfaction of the insurance claim. The Secretary did not disburse the $186,590.00 adjusted balance of the original mortgage amount. Of this money, $148,-849.00 represented construction retainages or \u201chold backs,\u201d which were portions of each installment payment for completed construction withheld by the mortgagee from the contractor until the project was finished and specified conditions were met. Industrial Indemnity, as the contractor\u2019s surety and assignee, brought suit to recover the construction retainages which had never been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">The district court ruled that it was without subject matter jurisdiction and transferred the case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c) (1976)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the United States Court of Claims. Rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction under Section 1 of the National Housing Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702 (1976), the district court based its order on two recent Ninth Circuit opinions, <em>Marcus Garvey Square, Inc. v. Winston Burnett Construction Co., </em>595 F.2d 1126 (9th Cir. 1979), and <em>DSI Corp. v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, </em>594 F.2d 177 (9th Cir. 1979). These cases held that 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702 did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity and a grant of jurisdiction to the district court because: (1) after the Secretary took assignment of a mortgage, undisbursed mortgage proceeds did not constitute a separate fund, independent of the United States Treasury, from which recovery could be made, and (2) the claims on their merits could not be charged against the fund backing the mortgage insurance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the trial court, faced with a division of authority among the circuits<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the absence of a Fifth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ruling on the jurisdictional issue, and concerned that the Court of Claims might determine that it, too, lacked authority to hear the case, certified an interlocutory appeal which was accepted by this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) (1976). We reverse and remand for trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Section 1 of the National Housing Act, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702 (1976) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-5\">The Secretary shall, in carrying out the provisions of . <em>[inter alia, </em>the National Housing Act], be authorized, in his official capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">For Industrial Indemnity\u2019s claim to be against the Secretary, and therefore within the scope of the \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause, as opposed to a suit against the United States that could not be brought in federal district court,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> any judgment for the plaintiff must be recoverable from funds in the possession and control of the Secretary that are severed from Treasury funds and Treasury control. <em>Dugan v. Rank, </em>372 U.S. 609, 620, 83 S.Ct. 999, 1006, 10 L.Ed.2d 15 (1963); <em>Land v. Dollar, </em>330 U.S. 731, 738, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 1012, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947); <em>Federal Housing Administration v. Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 250, 60 S.Ct. 488, 492, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940); <em>S. S. Silberblatt, Inc. v. East Harlem Pilot Block, </em>608 F.2d 28, 36 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Marcus Garvey Square, Inc. v. Winston Burnett Construction Co., </em>595 F.2d 1126, 1130-31 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>DSI Corp. v. Secretary of </em>Housing and <em>Urban Development, </em>594 F.2d 177, 179-80 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the Court of Claims, of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-11\">(2) Any other civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">We find that the present suit is against the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and not against the United States. A judgment against the Secretary establishing plaintiff\u2019s entitlement can be paid out of money in the General Insurance Fund<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that is a separate fund in the control and possession of the Secretary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Trans-Bay Engineers &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Hills, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 551 F.2d 370 (D.C.Cir.1976) (Special Risk Insurance Fund supporting High Risk Insurance Program of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-1 (1976) was separate fund in control and possession of Secretary for purposes of sovereign immunity under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702); <em>S. S. Silberblatt, Inc. v. East Harlem Pilot Block, </em>608 F.2d 28, 35 (2d Cir. 1979) (claim involving 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-1 program held to be against Secretary of Housing and Urban Development because judgment for plaintiff could be paid out of High Risk Insurance Fund appropriated under National Housing Act and in control or subject to the discretion of the Secretary). The judgment would not \u201c \u2018expend itself in the public treasury,\u2019 \u201d <em>Dugan v. Rank, supra, </em>372 U.S. at 620, 83 S.Ct. at 1006, <em>quoting Land v. Dollar, </em>330 U.S. 731, 738, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 1012, 91 L.Ed. 1209 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>(1947), but on funds in the accounts of the government\u2019s officers charged with HUD\u2019s application of funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">The Section 1702 \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause also requires that the lawsuit relate to the Secretary\u2019s duties under the National Housing Act, for it authorizes suit against the Secretary only in his \u201cofficial capacity\u201d of \u201ccarrying out the provisions . . . \u201d of the Act. <em>See Federal Housing Administration </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>309 U.S. 242, 248, 60 S.Ct. 488, 492, 84 L.Ed. 724 (1940). Suit by a building contractor\u2019s surety and assignee over payment for construction work on a housing project insured by the Secretary in a program authorized by the National Housing Act clearly satisfies this criterion. <em>See Bor-Son Building Corp. v. Heller, </em>572 F.2d 174, 179-81 (8th Cir. 1978) (\u201c \u2018in carrying out\u2019 clause in [\u00a7 1702] waiver [of sovereign immunity] is not to be disregarded. . \u201d but is satisfied by contractor\u2019s suit against Secretary in connection with construction work on federally insured housing project). Sovereign immunity was thus waived by the Secretary under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702, and the present action could be brought in \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The plaintiff argues that Section 1702 itself established jurisdiction in the federal district court below. There is some authority that Section 1702 is both a waiver of sovereign immunity and a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to the federal district court. <em>See e. g., Ferguson v. Union National Bank, </em>126 F.2d 753 (4th Cir. 1942); <em>George H. Evans &amp; Co. v. United States, </em>169 F.2d 500, 502 (3d Cir. 1948). However, we believe that such an approach confuses the waiver of sovereign immunity and a grant of subject matter jurisdiction. As we read 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702, it is plainly no more than a waiver of sovereign immunity and requires another statute to grant jurisdiction in order to make a court competent to hear a case against the Secretary otherwise authorized by Section 1702. <em>Marcus Garvey Square, Inc. </em>v. <em>Winston Burnett Construction Co., </em>595 F.2d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">We find that the district court below had jurisdiction of the present case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) (1976). That statute grants district courts \u201cfederal question\u201d jurisdiction to hear civil actions where the matter in controversy \u201carises under the Constitution, laws or treaties of the United States . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Industrial Indemnity, in bringing suit against the Secretary and demanding payment of the retainages, in part under the theory that it has an equitable right to recovery in order to avoid unjust enrichment of the Secretary, asked the court to determine whether the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has an obligation to it based upon equitable rights generated by HUD\u2019s course of activities pursuant to the National Housing Act, including the contracts sponsored and prescribed for others as a condition of federal aid. This claim of right is dependent in part on federal common law, and on the rights and obligations of parties under Section 231(d)(4) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 17151(d)(4) (1976). Since a case \u201carises under the laws of the United States\u201d if the disposition of issues stated in the complaint requires the application of federal common law, <em>Illinois v. City of Milwaukee, </em>406 U.S. 91, 100, 92 S.Ct. 1385, 1391, 31 L.Ed.2d 712 (1972), or requires the interpretation of relevant statutes, there is federal question jurisdiction for the district court below to hear this case. <em>Trans-Bay Engineers &amp; Builders, Inc. v. Hills, </em>179 U.S.App.D.C. 184, 191-192, 551 F.2d 370, 377-78 (D.C.Cir.1976). To the extent that this conclusion is inconsistent with the rulings in <em>Marcus Garvey, supra, </em>595 F.2d at 1131-32, and <em>DSI Corp., supra, </em>594 F.2d at 179-80, we respectfully disagree with the view adopted by the Ninth Circuit in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">REVERSED AND REMANDED for determination of the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-6\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-7\">If a case within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims is filed in the district court, the district court shall, if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to the Court of Claims, where the case shall proceed as if it had been filed in the Court of Claims on the date it was filed in the district court.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b739-8\">. The Ninth Circuit cases involved suits against the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for, <em>inter alia, </em>construction retainages or other construction costs in projects having mortgages insured by the Secretary pursuant to Section 236 of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-l (1976). Section 236 established a program to provide rental housing to low income families at subsidized rentals funded by the Special Risk Insurance Fund, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-3 (1976). That the insurance in these cases was issued under a different program and supported by a different fund than that in the present action is not relevant to analysis of the jurisdictional and sovereign immunity issues now before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b739-13\">. <em>Compare, e. g., S.
