Harbaugh and John P. Harbaugh, husband and wife, appeal from a final judgment entered in the Northern District of Illinois (Honorable Abraham Lincoln Marovitz, <em>District </em>Judge), granting defendant Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its favor and denying plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court had before it the pleadings, interrogatories and answers thereto and numerous affidavits and exhibits. It found, quite accurately, that, as the parties agreed, there was \u201cno genuine issue of material facts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-20\">This controversy arises out of asserted violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691 <em>et seq. </em>(1974) (\u201cECOA\u201d). A \u201cFirst Cause of Action\u201d brought by Helen D. Harbaugh alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>the refusal of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company (hereinafter \u201cContinental\u201d or \u201cthe bank\u201d), to issue to her a Master Charge credit card constituted \u201cdiscrimination against plaintiff on the basis of her sex or marital status\u201d, an alleged violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(a) and (b) (1974) and 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 202.2 and 202.3(1) (1978) and that the issuance of a Master Charge card to John P. Harbaugh was \u201ca refusal to grant a separate account to Pier] on the basis of her sex or marital status.\u201d (Compl. IK X and XI). These acts, plaintiff claims, caused \u201cgreat mental distress, humiliation and aggravation\u201d to her damage. (Compl. IK XII and XIII). A \u201cSecond Cause of Action\u201d brought by the husband John P. Harbaugh alleges that the issuance to him of an unsolicited Master Charge credit card was a violation of his rights under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1642 (1974) to his monetary damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">Sometime prior to March 12, 1976, Continental sent an unsolicited application for a Master Charge credit card to Mr. John P. Harbaugh. The Harbaughs crossed out the word \u201cMr.\u201d, typed above the deleted \u201cMr.\u201d the word \u201cMrs.\u201d, and inserted certain statistical information about Mrs. Harbaugh such as her employment as a teacher, her employer (the Chicago Board of Education), and her salary. As thus prepared, the application was signed \u201cMrs. John P. Harbaugh\u201d dated March 12, 1976, and sent to Continental. In this form Continental forwarded the application to Credit Information Corporation <em>of </em>Chicago (\u201cCICC\u201d), a company used by Continental for credit report purposes. CICC made a practice of not using \u201ccourtesy\u201d titles<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in its credit investigations. Accordingly, when it requested a confidential employee\u2019s report from the Chicago Board of Education, the Board replied that it had no record of a John P. Harbaugh as an employed teacher. Continental so advised Mrs. Harbaugh who straightaway supplied the desired information. Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s employment being confirmed, Continental issued two credit cards in the name of John P. Harbaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-6\">Mrs. Harbaugh was aware that she had the authority to use the credit cards received and retained by them and that she could sign them Mrs. John P. Harbaugh or Mrs. Helen D. Harbaugh. (Deposition of Mrs. Harbaugh at 17). However, John P. Harbaugh did not regard the cards as satisfactory and wrote Master Charge on June 24, 1976 that he did not order the card and that its issuance was a \u201ctactic to avoid issuing a card to my wife, Helen D. Harbaugh\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">Asserting that Continental\u2019s acts constituted \u201c[discrimination against women in granting financial credit\u201d and amounted to \u201csexual discrimination\u201d, John P. Harbaugh on September 10, 1976 wrote to the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury Department, Consumer Affairs Division, in Washington, and invited investigation. He sent copies of his letter to his Congressman, Philip M. Crane, and to Senator Adlai Stevenson. Congressman Crane referred the matter to another federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). The FTC replied that it was \u201cunable to take any action on Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s behalf\u201d but suggested contacting the Comptroller of the Currency. Having received no reply from the Comptroller of the Currency after fifteen weeks, John Harbaugh wrote the Director, Office of Saver and Consumer Affairs, Board of Governors, Federal Reserve System, stating that he had learned that \u201cyour organization was established to help administer a wide varity [sic] of consumer legislation without being intimidated by the large banks\u201d. (Deposition of Mr. Harbaugh). Copies of this letter were sent to Senator Stevenson, Congressman Crane, and a representative of the American Association of Retired Persons. In turn, the Director of the Office of Saver and Consumer Affairs forwarded this letter to the Comptroller of the Currency. The Office of the Comptroller, without giving Continental an opportunity to state its case, gave as its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>opinion that Continental\u2019s action had violated the ECOA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691 <em>et seq. </em>(1974), Regulation B, (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202 (1978)), and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1645 (1974), and wrote Mr. Harbaugh that \u201cYou may wish to discuss with your attorney the remedies available to you under 15 U.S.C. 1640 and 15 U.S.C. 1691\u201d. Thus far, the Harbaughs had consulted the Legislative and Executive branches of government; then the Comptroller of the Currency suggested that the Judiciary be added to complete the triumvirate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">Certain other events occurred. On February 5, 1977 Continental advised John P. Harbaugh that the cards were to be reissued and requested Mr. Harbaugh to correct erroneous information. The Harbaughs returned the notice, giving the name of Helen D. Harbaugh as the applicant. On March 25, 1977, Continental reissued the two Master Charge cards in the name of John P. Harbaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">Presumably acting upon the Comptroller\u2019s suggestion, the Harbaughs brought suit on June 3, 1977. The trial judge found that \u201cOn November 18,1977, purportedly in an attempt to settle the pending lawsuit, Continental issued a Master Charge credit card in the name of Helen D. Harbaugh\u201d. The trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. From this ruling, plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">The primary thrust of Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s claim on appeal is that Continental\u2019s issuance of a credit card in the name of John P. Harbaugh was a discriminatory denial of credit on the basis of her sex or marital status, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It should be noted that Mrs. Harbaugh does not claim that she could not <em>use </em>the Master Charge card issued in the name of her husband.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s claim is that Continental unlawfully discriminated by refusing to open a credit account which would reflect her individual credit transactions and establish her own credit history, separate and apart from her husband. She stated that her intent in applying for a Master Charge card was to have her own account and her own credit rating in case something should happen to her husband. (Deposition of Mrs. Harbaugh at 29).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-13\">In response, Continental asserts that Mrs. Harbaugh was the recipient of credit from the bank. Before issuing the cards, Continental investigated her credit and verified her employment. However, Continental admits that while Mrs. Harbaugh did get her own account at the bank, she did not establish a separate credit history at the credit bureau. As Mr. Sheahen of CICC stated in his affidavit, an account in the name of \u201cMrs. John P. Harbaugh\u201d would have the identical effect as a card in the name of \u201cJohn P. Harbaugh\u201d: no independent credit history would thereby be established for Helen Harbaugh at the credit bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-14\">Thus, this case poses the question of whether a creditor, using a computer format which excluded all courtesy titles, is under a statutory duty to correct or supplement the manner in which it processes a credit application by a married woman in her marital name in order to insure that she receive a separate credit history. In other words, Mrs. Harbaugh makes two alternative claims under the ECOA: (1) the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>was under an affirmative duty to use the courtesy title \u201cMrs.\u201d in opening her account <em>or </em>(2) if the courtesy title of \u201cMrs.\u201d was deleted, the bank was under a duty to insure that she receive a separate credit history in her own name. The bank apparently could fulfill its duty under the second alternative either by voluntarily ascertaining from her a proper means of identification other than \u201cMrs. John P. Harbaugh\u201d or by advising her of its practice of deleting courtesy titles in processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">We reject the claim that the bank was under an affirmative duty to use the courtesy title \u201cMrs.\u201d in opening Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s account. The ECOA and its corresponding regulations expressly prohibit a creditor from requesting an applicant\u2019s sex or marital status.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, a creditor\u2019s mandatory requirement that an applicant supply a courtesy title would violate the intent of the statute. However, neither the statute nor the regulations address the question of a creditor\u2019s response to a courtesy title <em>voluntarily </em>supplied by a married woman applying in her marital name. As there is no affirmative requirement in the legislation requiring a creditor to utilize a courtesy title in opening or maintaining an account, Continental was not required to use the courtesy title supplied by Mrs. Harbaugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">We also reject Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s alternative claim that, if Continental chose a computer format which deleted courtesy titles, it was under a duty to correct the \u201cinherent discriminatory effects\u201d of such a practice. Mrs. Harbaugh asserts that, when Continental received her application in the name of \u201cMrs. John P. Harbaugh\u201d, it was put on notice that processing of the application without the courtesy title \u201cMrs.\u201d would deny her the individual account she sought. Thus, she argues that Continental was under a statutory duty either to inform her of its practice of deleting courtesy titles or to voluntarily ascertain her first given name before opening the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">Without statutory or regulatory authorization, we decline to impose these affirmative duties on a creditor such as Continental. In this respect, we note that certain affirmative duties are imposed on creditors by Regulation B. See 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10 (1978). Under 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.10(b), for every account established prior to June 1, 1977, creditors were required to send a notice that married women are entitled to have their credit histories reported in their own name. The notice informed the recipient that credit information relating to the account could be reported in the name of both the wife and the husband if both used or were responsible for the account. In this case, there is no allegation by plaintiffs that Continental failed to send them such a notice as required by law. Indeed, Mrs. Harbaugh stated that she had responded to such notices sent by Marshall Field, Carson Pirie Scott, and Bank Americard. (Deposition of Mrs. Harbaugh at 31). In view of the fact that the Federal Reserve Board promulgated regulations establishing a mechanism whereby creditors were required to inform married women how to\u2019establish their own credit histories, the imposition of more stringent duties upon the creditor (as urged by Mrs. Harbaugh), is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-12\">Nor is there a statutory requirement that a creditor voluntarily inquire as to a married woman\u2019s given first name upon receiving an application in her marital name. Such a requirement would place the creditor in an untenable position. Had Continental written to Mrs. Harbaugh, re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>questing that she supply her first name, it would have been risking an accusation that it had violated two sections of Regulation B: \u00a7 202.5(d)(3), which prohibits creditors from requesting information with respect to the applicant\u2019s sex and \u00a7 202.5(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which prohibits the creditor from any statements which would discourage a reasonable person from pursuing an application. Furthermore, had the bank investigated into other source documents to discover the applicant\u2019s first name, and then issued a card in a name <em>other </em>than that supplied by the applicant, the bank could possibly be accused of issuing an unsolicited credit card, in violation of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1642 (1974). Thus, we find that the bank did not err by failing to inquire as to Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s given name.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">There is no proof (and none was even offered by plaintiffs) that Continental in its actions discriminated in any way against the Harbaughs as they charged \u201con the basis of . sex or marital status . .\u201d \u2014 hence there has been no violation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-6\">We find it unnecessary to discuss plaintiffs\u2019 other claims, which are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">Judgment Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">. A courtesy title is defined, for example, as Mrs., Mr., Miss, Ms., Captain, Colonel, Judge, etc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691(a)(1) (1974) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-8\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-9\">(1) on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1266-10\">. The evidence shows that credit cards and their form of issuance were not unknown to the Harbaughs. Thus, Continental\u2019s practice of ^ putting the card in the name of John P. Harbaugh and issuing two cards, one for the husband and one for the wife, was well known to them. In view of these facts, Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s failure to use the card as issued did not stem from any belief that she was not entitled to use it. Further, Ed Skonicki, Second Vice President of Continental in charge of the credit granting and collection functions of the Charge Card Division, asserted that \u201cHad she chosen to do so, Mrs. Harbaugh could have used the Master Charge card as issued to her\u201d. Skonicki Affidavit, Exh. 2, H 10. On appeal, Mrs. Harbaugh does not challenge this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">. Regulation B, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5(d)(1) (1978), provides that if an applicant applies for an individual account, \u201ca creditor shall not request the applicant\u2019s marital status. . Furthermore, \u00a7 202.5(d)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-9\">\u201cA creditor shall not request the sex of an applicant.

An application form shall otherwise use only terms that are neutral as to sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-14\">The Illinois Credit Card Issuance and Use Act is even more restrictive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1267-16\">\u201cNo question requesting any information concerning an applicant\u2019s marital status shall appear on any credit card application . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1267-17\">Ill.Rev.Stat., Ch. 121\u00bd, \u00a7 385.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5(a) (1978) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-11\">\u201cA creditor shall not make any oral or written statement, in advertising or otherwise, to applicants or prospective applicants that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1268-8\">FAIRCHILD, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A4nq\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-9\">The majority opinion seems to concede that Mrs. Harbaugh was denied a separate credit account (and, by implication, that Mr. Harbaugh was issued an unrequested card) but finds no violation of the Act, holding that the Act does not specifically require the bank to establish an individual account for Mrs. Harbaugh since she applied using the name \u201cMrs. John Harbaugh.\u201d But it was not Mrs, Harbaugh who created the difficulties she encountered \u2014 it was the bank\u2019s computers, some of which, at least, have not been programmed to identify Mr. John Doe and Mrs. John Doe as two different persons. Thus an application from Mrs. Doe (or Mrs. Harbaugh) causes a credit card to be issued in the husband\u2019s name only. The statutory requirements are clear\u2014 there is no exception for good faith computer programming deficiencies. It is the bank\u2019s obligation to comply with the law, making whatever adjustments in its application forms or computer programs necessary to meet the requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-15\">Aside from what seems to me to be a fairly straightforward example of a denial of credit, there are several aspects of this case that particularly intrigue me.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-16\">First, as the majority opinion notes, there were at least two alternative choices available to the bank when Mrs. Harbaugh\u2019s application was received even given the claimed inflexibility of the bank\u2019s computers. The bank could have established an account in the name of Helen Harbaugh (which it had learned was her name) or it could have written to her explaining the problem and asking for instructions. The bank, however, did neith\u00e9r. Instead it established an account in the name of \u201cJohn Harbaugh.\u201d The majority seems to hold that the latter course of action was more in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the Act than either of the first two would have been. I strongly disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-17\">Second, although the bank asserts that its practice of deleting courtesy titles \u201cis in accordance with the aims of the equal credit opportunity laws to ensure that the credit granting process is \u2018neutral as to sex\u2019 \u201d (appellee\u2019s brief, p. 14) the bank does use courtesy titles in some of its dealing with cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>tomers and indeed used courtesy titles in its dealings with the Harbaughs. The application which Mr. Harbaugh received in the mail had the name \u201cMr. John Harbaugh\u201d already typed in. Mrs. Harbaugh crossed out \u201cMr.\u201d and typed in \u201cMrs.\u201d, signing the application the same way. When the bank (now omitting the courtesy title) could not obtain verification that \u201cJohn Harbaugh\u201d was employed by the Chicago Board of Education it wrote a letter not to \u201cJohn Harbaugh\u201d but to \u201cMrs. John Harbaugh\u201d to inform her of its inability to verify her employment. Obviously at least some of the bank\u2019s computers (or perhaps some of its employees) are trained to use courtesy titles and the bank apparently considers it appropriate to use them in some instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">The third point that intrigues me is the suggestion that a married woman\u2019s designation of herself as, for example, \u201cMrs. John Doe\u201d is so extraordinary that a credit lending institution cannot reasonably be expected to process a credit application from someone who refers to herself in that fashion. There are over sixty million married or widowed women in this country who Emily Post and Amy Vanderbilt still insist are properly addressed only as \u201cMrs.\u201d followed by their husband\u2019s names.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The strictures of etiquette are more relaxed today than they were forty years ago when the Harbaughs were married, but the older usage is not so archaic that a credit lending institution can simply ignore its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">Finally, I note that the majority is affirming on a ground not relied on by the district court and, indeed, not argued by the bank on appeal. As the majority opinion notes, the bank\u2019s argument both in the district court and here has been that Mrs. Harbaugh was not denied credit because the Master Charge cards sent to the Harbaugh home with the name John P. Harbaugh on them were <em>her </em>cards, issued in <em>her </em>name (albeit without her courtesy title) and for her use. The district court, granting summary judgment to the bank, accepted this argument but also held that it would have been a violation of the Act if the bank had issued a card to \u201cHelen Harbaugh\u201d because one section of Regulation B (12 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.7(b)) requires creditors to use the <em>surname </em>(birth-given, spouse\u2019s or combined) of the applicant\u2019s choice. The bank prudently chose not to defend that aspect of the district court order and the majority has now, I believe with equal wisdom, rejected the only other ground on which the district court judgment rested.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority nonetheless affirms the judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-9\">The statutory requirements are clear. Mrs. Harbaugh was denied credit in violation of those requirements. The bank should not be permitted to hide the violation behind its choice of computer formats. I would reverse the decision of the district court and remand the case for entry of judgment in favor of the Harbaughs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">. I would not reach the question of what sort of adjustments might be required. I note, however. that this entire lawsuit could have undoubtedly been avoided if the bank\u2019s application forms included a note that courtesy titles are not used on charge cards and suggesting, therefore, that applicants be certain that the first and last names on the application are the names desired on the account. Instead, as noted further, the bank sends out partially completed application forms which include the courtesy titles of the potential applicants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1269-7\">. Amy Vanderbilt describes the use of \u201cMrs.\u201d followed by a woman\u2019s given name instead of her husband\u2019s name as an \u201cinsult\u201d to proper social nomenclature and an \u201cindignity.\u201d Amy Vanderbilt, <em>Amy Vanderbilt\u2019s Etiquette </em>(New York: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1972, pp. 42, 544). Etiquette authorities would also insist, of course, that it is normally improper for a woman to use \u201cMrs.\u201d in her signature (as Mrs. Harbaugh did). There are exceptions, however. To quote Emily Post</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa0j\">\u201cThe only times when a woman actually uses \u2018Mrs.\u2019 in her signature are in a hotel register, on a business telegram, <em>on a charge account, </em>or in a letter ordering a purchase from a store. <em>And then it must be \u2018Mrs. John Smith.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-12\">Emily Post, <em>Emily Post\u2019s Etiquette, </em>12th revised edition by Elizabeth L. Post (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnails, 1969).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">. It is, of course, irrelevant that Mrs. Harbaugh had the right to use the cards issued in her husband\u2019s name. That right arose only out of her marital status. The Act gives married women the right to obtain their own credit, independent of their marital status.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">. Unless, of course, one accepts the proposition that John P. Harbaugh is the name of Helen Harbaugh, and the cards issued to John P. Harbaugh are therefore her cards, it necessarily follows that Mr. Harbaugh correctly claimed he had received an unsolicited card.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
