The Board has cross applied for enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Huron Copysette, Inc., is a company engaged in the manufacture of paper products in Leitchfield, Kentucky. The Board found that the company attempted to avert the unionization of its employees by the Cooper\u2019s International Union of North America, AFL-CIO. Specifically, the Board found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act by coercively interrogating employees concerning their \u00dcnion activities and by threatening plant closure and less favorable working conditions if the employees voted for a union. The Board also found that the company violated \u00a7 8(a)(3) and (1) by terminating employee William Howell because of his Union activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The record when considered as a whole substantially supports the Board\u2019s findings. Shortly after the Union organizing campaign began, company officials began coercively interrogating and threatening employees as to the consequences of bringing in the Union. Further, there is substantial evidence that the termination of employee William Howell was prompted by anti-union reasons, rather than by valid considerations as the company contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
