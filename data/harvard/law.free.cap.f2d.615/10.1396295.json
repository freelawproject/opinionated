S. v. Dien, </em>609 F.2d 1038 at 1047 (2nd Cir.). Here, however, they did not, as indicated by DiGravio\u2019s not searching the room immediately upon entering. <em>Id. </em>We think that this does not change the law of <em>United States v. Christophe, </em>470 F.2d 865, 869 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 964, 93 S.Ct. 2140, 36 L.Ed.2d 684 (1973) and similar cases relative to cursory searches although the statement in <em>Christophe </em>made no mention of exigent circumstances. In any event the law very plainly requires exigent circumstances. <em>Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 763, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 2040, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), so far as we are aware, has never been overruled. <em>See also United States v. Mapp, </em>476 F.2d 67 (2d Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Mangeri, </em>451 F.Supp. 73, 76-78 (S.D.N.Y.1978); <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>403 F.Supp. 297, 302-03 (S.D.N.Y.1975), <em>aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part sub nom., United States v. Armando-Sarmiento, </em>545 F.2d 785 (2d Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In respect to the seized boxes all that we held was that a warrant to open them was required. The cardboard boxes were closed and sealed with tape. The van was immobilized and Agent DiGravio had the keys. The van was only a short distance from the courthouse. The sole question was whether a warrant should have been obtained to open the cartons. <em>Arkansas v. Sanders, </em>442 U.S. 753, 99 S.Ct. 2586, 61 L.Ed.2d 235 (1979) held that the answer to this was affirmative, citing <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 481, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2045, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971) and, <em>inter alia, United States v. Chadwick, </em>433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53 L.Ed.2d 538 (1977). The various arguments of the Government here were dealt with in our opinion, 1044-46, and in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The only really arguable point is whether <em>Arkansas v. Sanders </em>made new law. We think it did not, as the Court itself defined the question as whether \u201cthe warrantless search of respondent\u2019s suitcase falls on the <em>Chadwick </em>or the <em>Chambers/Carroll </em>side of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 442 U.S. at 757, 99 S.Ct. at 2589. Being guided by \u201cestablished principles,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Court there applied <em>Chadwick </em>retroactively to an April 23, 1976 Little Rock, Arkansas police search. Presumably <em>Peltier </em>prospectivity did not come into play because of <em>Coolidge. A fortiori </em>a search as is involved here after <em>Chadwick </em>must require a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">To be sure, <em>United States v. Ochs, </em>595 F.2d 1247 (2d Cir. 1979), followed <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970), and said that <em>Chadwick </em>\u201cdid not affect the viability of <em>Chambers </em>on facts such as these.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1254; <em>but see, e. g., United States v. Stevie, </em>582 F.2d 1175, 1179, 61 L.Ed.2d 876 (8th Cir. 1978) (en banc) <em>cert. denied, </em>443 U.S. 911, 99 S.Ct. 3102 (1979), cited in <em>Ochs, </em>595 F.2d at 1254 n. 5: <em>Ochs </em>sought to distinguish <em>Chadwick </em>by arguing first that the briefcases in <em>Ochs </em>were not locked (and presumably therefore their owner had a lesser expectation of privacy). <em>Id. </em>at 1255. But here as in <em>Chadwick </em>the cartons were taped. The second distinction is that the owner of the car in which the briefcases were found, one Narday, could have appeared at the police station and demanded the car and its contents, <em>id., </em>thus making the circumstances \u201cexigent.\u201d Here there was no such exigency. The cartons had been lawfully seized from the van.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Finally the Government argues that the panel misstated the evidence relative to the defendants\u2019 admissions as to the contents of the cartons. The agent\u2019s testimony at the submission hearing was to the effect that when he confronted Dien with the fact that he had seen the boxes loaded into the van at 262 Fifth Avenue, Dien replied that he did not know where in the building \u201cthe marijuana came from\u201d and described \u201cthe individual that helped load the marijuana in the van.\u201d Later when Gendler was told that the agents planned to return to 262 Fifth Avenue to arrest the person who had helped load the boxes, Gendler suggested that the agent \u201ckeep the marijuana and turn him and Dien loose.\u201d These admissions are said to have reduced the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy under <em>United States v. Candella, </em>469 F.2d 173, 175 (2d Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\"><em>Candella </em>is a case where the suspect \u201cpointed to the exact spot where the guns were located and told the officers where they were,\u201d and on this basis the guns were held admissible under the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine. Nothing so definitive is presented in the Government\u2019s petition. To be sure, Dien\u2019s admissions would probably lead any reasonable person to believe that there was marijuana in the boxes, but they do not, on their face come close to the direct pointing which occurred in <em>Candella. </em>There was no reason not to submit the evidence to the judgment of a neutral magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We adhere to our previous decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
