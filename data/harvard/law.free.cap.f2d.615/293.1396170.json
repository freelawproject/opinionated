Local R. 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-24\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">The tug SHEILA MORAN collided with the F/V MISS JERLENE, injuring the latter and plaintiff Portacci. Portacci brought suit in admiralty, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333 (1976), for damages sustained. Following a bench trial, the district court determined that the vessels\u2019 \u201cmutual fault\u201d had caused the collision; Portacci\u2019s recoverable damages accordingly were reduced by 50%. This result satisfied neither party, both of whom appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-26\">The district court made unusually specific findings of fact. The SHEILA MORAN failed, <em>inter alia, </em>to sound a warning signal or to have proper running lights. The MISS JERLENE failed, <em>inter alia, </em>to have a working radio or to keep a proper lookout. The vessels\u2019 operative omissions combined jointly to cause the collision. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>record supports these findings, which we affirm. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">We have difficulty, however, with the district court\u2019s equal apportionment of damages. Under <em>United States v. Reliable Transfer Co., </em>421 U.S. 397, 95 S.Ct. 1708, 44 L.Ed.2d 251 (1975), this disposition was proper only if \u201cthe parties [were] equally at fault\u201d or if \u201cit [was] not possible fairly to measure the comparative degree of their fault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 95 S.Ct. at 1716. Here, the district court found only that the vessels were \u201cmutually at fault.\u201d R. 136. Standing alone, this finding can not sustain the judgment. \u201cMutual fault\u201d certainly does not imply equal fault; the former describes 10%-90% just as accurately as it does 50%-50%. <em>Cf. California v. Italian Motorship Ilice, </em>534 F.2d 836 (9th Cir. 1976) (\u201cMutual Fault-Equal Contribution Rule\u201d requires that \u201cwhen there is a mutual fault . the damages must be equally allocated regardless of the degrees of comparative fault\u201d). Nor does the district court\u2019s order anywhere state that specific apportionment is not practicable in this case. Although the judge made some comments to this effect toward the end of trial, Tr. 626-27, it is the final order and judgment which we review.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The cause is REMANDED so that the district court can apportion damages in accordance with <em>Reliable Transfer, supra, </em>making appropriate findings of fact. In all other respects, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
