On direct appeal, Cheek argued that she had been denied her Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against her when the trial judge refused to allow a question by her counsel attempting to probe the bias of one of the prosecution\u2019s chief witnesses. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the question and affirmed the conviction. <em>Commonwealth v. Cheek, </em>374 Mass. 613, 373 N.E.2d 1161 (1978). On petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the district court for the District of Massachusetts concluded that Cheek had been denied her right of cross-examination by the trial court\u2019s ruling and ordered that her petition for habeas corpus be granted unless the Commonwealth provided a new trial by October 31, 1979. The district court has stayed its order pending this appeal by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On the afternoon of June 6, 1971, Lawrence Rooney shot and killed Ezra McClain in McClain\u2019s Malden, Massachusetts apartment. Also present at the time of the murder were Dorothy Cheek and Janet Coviello, McClain\u2019s girlfriend. Rooney and Cheek were convicted in connection with the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Rooney\u2019s murder of McClain was the culmination of a series of events beginning early that morning at Cheek\u2019s apartment. Rooney complained to one Brant, who had come to the apartment to borrow Cheek\u2019s car, that someone had stolen $436 from him the night before and said that he suspected McClain. Rooney and Brant went to McClain\u2019s apartment, where Rooney accused McClain of stealing his money. The two men argued and then began a fight, during which McClain stabbed Rooney. Rooney, bleeding profusely, returned with Brant to Cheek\u2019s apartment. Cheek and Brant first tried, without success, to stop the bleeding and then drove Rooney to the hospital for treatment. After Rooney\u2019s wounds had been ministered to at the emergency room, Rooney and Brant dropped Cheek off at her apartment and then drove to Rooney\u2019s brother\u2019s house, where Rooney picked up a shotgun and put it in the back seat of the car. In the meantime, Cheek had gone to McClain\u2019s apartment to try to determine what had happened between McClain and Rooney. Brant and Rooney met Cheek as she was returning from McClain\u2019s and the three of them then drove back to McClain\u2019s apartment, with Brant and Rooney in the front seat and Cheek in back with the shotgun. Brant, testifying for the Commonwealth, stated that during the drive Cheek reported that McClain had said he was not sorry he had stabbed Rooney and that he wished he had killed him. This, according to Brant, enraged Rooney. Cheek denied making any such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Brant also testified that when he, Rooney, and Cheek arrived at the apartment he left Rooney and Cheek in the car, walked to a drug store, called a taxi, and went home. According to Cheek, however, Brant remained at the car after they arrived. She stated that when she realized Rooney intended to harm McClain, she left the car and went to the apartment to warn McClain. She testified that not until the apartment door opened did she see Rooney coming up the stairs with the shotgun. Janet Coviello, who was in the apartment with McClain, testified that she heard a knock on the door and then heard Cheek say, \u201cEzra, let me in, I have something important to tell you.\u201d According to Coviello, Cheek\u2019s voice conveyed no sense of urgency. McClain opened the door, and Rooney, followed by Cheek, entered and fired twice at McClain, missing with the first shot and mortally wounding him with the second. During this incident, Coviello reported, she was screaming while Cheek watched silently. After the shooting, Cheek and Rooney left together in Cheek\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">One factor in determining whether the prosecution had proved that Cheek had the requisite mental state to be convicted of murder was her behavior immediately prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>to the shooting. At trial, therefore, one of the important questions for the jury was whether Cheek had in fact left the car ahead of Rooney in order to warn McClain. If the jury chose to believe Brant\u2019s testimony that he left Cheek and Rooney sitting in the car, her story might have appeared less plausible. If, on the other hand, the jury believed her assertion that Brant and Rooney stood talking outside the car while she slipped out from the back seat, they were more likely to credit her version of what followed: that she ran up the stairs ahead of Rooney to warn McClain.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">After extensive testimony on direct from Brant, petitioner\u2019s counsel asked two or three questions eliciting the answers that Brant knew what had happened between Rooney and McClain, knew of Rooney\u2019s anger, yet procured the shotgun. Then counsel asked Brant: \u201cWere you yourself ever charged with anything in connection with this case?\u201d This question prompted the following exchange among the prosecutor, Lobel, the court, and Cheek\u2019s counsel, Hutton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP4\">\u201cMR. LOBEL: Objection, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHp\">THE COURT: I will strike it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">MR. HUTTON: My exception please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afm\">THE COURT: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Cheek\u2019s counsel neither pressed his inquiry further by asking additional questions nor explained the basis for the question in order to obtain a more definitive ruling from the court. He asked Brant no further questions on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Petitioner argues that the trial judge\u2019s ruling infringed her Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against her by denying her counsel the opportunity to inquire into a possible basis for bias on the part of Brant. In advancing this argument, she relies on <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), in which the Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional importance of the right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses to reveal sources of bias. <em>Davis </em>concerned an attempt to question a witness with respect to his probationary status. The Court stated that the defendant should have been allowed to elicit testimony about this status since the witness\u2019s fear of revocation of his probation might have induced him to make a false identification of the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 311, 94 S.Ct. at 1108. Petitioner also points to <em>United States ex rel. Annunziato v. Manson, </em>425 F.Supp. 1272, 1275 (D.Conn.), <em>aff\u2019d </em>566 F.2d 410 (2d Cir. 1977), in which the district court, applying <em>Davis, </em>granted habeas corpus because the defendant had been denied his \u201cconstitutional right ... to show bias arising out of a government[al] offer of leniency or immunity.\u201d In affirming the ruling of the district court, the Second Circuit stated that when the government, at the time of a witness\u2019s testimony, is able to exert leverage against the witness, the defendant is entitled to establish this fact so that the jury may consider it in assessing the witness\u2019s credibility. 566 F.2d at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">On direct appeal from her conviction, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that Cheek was foreclosed from raising her constitutional claim on appeal. While the Commonwealth permits parties to engage in a reasonable cross-examination to show bias, it requires records of criminal convictions to attack credibility by showing prior bad conduct. Here, said the court, it was not clear whether counsel was inquiring into bias or prior bad conduct <footnotemark>**</footnotemark>, and counsel neither explained his purpose nor pursued the point after the ruling. The court concluded that the judge had made no \u201cunequivocal adverse ruling\u201d subject to review. The court stated that under Massachusetts law, \u201cWhere the judge is unable to see the relevance or purpose of a question, the cross-examiner may reasonably be expected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>to make some explanation as to how he expects to show bias by means of the witness\u2019s answer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Cheek, supra, </em>374 Mass. at \u2014, 373 N.E.2d at 1163. To consider on appeal the judge\u2019s exclusion of an answer to the question, when he had not been given an explanation of its purpose, said the court, \u201cwould defeat \u2018an important policy which requires parties to give sufficient notice so that the trial judge may reconsider his or her ruling.\u2019 <em>Pires </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>373 Mass. 829, - n. 5, 370 N.E.2d 1365, 1371 (1977).\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Cheek, supra, </em>374 Mass. at \u2014, 373 N.E.2d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">On petition for habeas corpus, the district court, citing <em>Davis v. Alaska, supra, </em>concluded that although petitioner had violated an established Massachusetts procedural rule by failing to explain her intended line of questioning, the trial judge had nevertheless committed constitutional error in excluding the answer to the question. The court then applied the rule of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), that failure to comply with state procedural rules at trial bars federal habeas corpus review \u201cabsent a showing of \u2018cause\u2019 and \u2018prejudice\u2019 \u201d, and found that both prongs of the <em>Sykes </em>test were satisfied. First, the court said, the importance of Brant\u2019s testimony and the possible impeachment value of establishing a factual basis for bias constituted sufficient \u201cprejudice\u201d. Second, the court concluded that the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s reliance on the trial judge\u2019s ability to see the purpose of the question was adequate \u201ccause\u201d for his failure to press the line of inquiry any further or to offer any explanation to the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We have difficulty with the threshold question whether the trial judge committed any constitutional error. In most cases in which a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural default bars federal habeas corpus review, the determination that there has been a denial of a constitutional right is independent of the question of petitioner\u2019s compliance with state procedural rules. In this case, however, the question whether there was in fact any error is inextricably entwined with the state\u2019s procedural requirements. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded (and we are not free to question) that because counsel never made clear to the trial judge that he was seeking to elicit evidence of bias and because there was a ground on which the judge could properly have sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the trial judge had not definitely precluded this line of questioning. In this regard, the cases relied on by appellant, <em>Davis v. Alaska, supra, </em>and <em>United States ex rel. Annunziato v. Manson, supra, </em>are distinguishable since defense counsel in those cases had made the purpose of their questions clear, and the trial judges had definitely ruled against allowing questions directed toward showing bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Appellant asserted at oral argument that a state procedural rule must yield when it conflicts with the right of cross-examination protected by the Sixth Amendment. The right to cross-examine, however, \u201cis not absolute and may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal process.\u201d <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 295, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). Such limitations on cross-examination have been narrowly circumscribed, since the Court has stated that it will examine closely any competing interest invoked to limit cross-examination in order to protect \u201c[the] integrity of the factfinding process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Berger v. California, </em>393 U.S. 314, 315, 89 S.Ct. 540, 541, 21 L.Ed.2d 508 (1969)). Thus, in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>the Court concluded that the state\u2019s interest in protecting the confidentiality of a juvenile offender\u2019s record \u201ccannot require yielding of so vital a right as the effective cross-examination for bias of an adverse witness.\u201d 415 U.S. at 320, 94 S.Ct. at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">The district court extrapolated from the holding in <em>Davis </em>and concluded that the right of cross-examination should not be limited by \u201ca factor so nebulous as counsel\u2019s estimate of the trial judge\u2019s understanding.\u201d We disagree with this assessment of the Massachusetts court\u2019s ruling. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>The competing policy at stake here is markedly different from that which the <em>Davis </em>Court found subordinate to the right of cross-examination. In <em>Davis </em>the trial court had limited cross-examination of the government witness in order to protect him from the embarrassment of having his prior juvenile record exposed. The sole interest served by that ruling was that of the witness. In this case, on the other hand, the Commonwealth\u2019s policy of requiring an explanation of an otherwise ambiguous question is central to the truth-seeking function of the trial. Hearsay, evidence of bad character or propensity to commit crimes, and evidence that may unduly prejudice the jury are generally excluded because of their adverse effect on the reliability of the fact-finding process. A judge attuned to guarding against the admission of such evidence may not readily recognize that a particular question that might have been asked for an impermissible purpose was in fact asked in furtherance of a constitutionally protected line of questioning. The Massachusetts rule does not require counsel to \u201cestimate\u201d the judge\u2019s understanding; it merely requires that he explain the purpose of a question so that the judge may have no doubt about what he is excluding. This burden is small compared to that which would fall on a trial judge who otherwise risks admitting evidence properly excludable or excluding evidence properly admissible because he must guess the theory underlying counsel\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Nor is the rule applied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unique or idiosyncratic. In <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>531 F.2d 1303 (5th Cir. 1976), a federal district judge had sustained an objection to a question of a government agent asking if he knew that the prosecution\u2019s major witness, an informant, had been earlier charged with an offense involving 800 pounds of marijuana. The situation was precisely that which developed in the case at bar. The incident would, in the court\u2019s view, have probably been admissible to show that \u201cwith the possession charge hanging over [the informer\u2019s] head like the Sword of Damocles\u201d, the informer might well have been pressured into \u201cmaking\u201d cases for the government. <em>Id. </em>at 1306. But a mere arrest without a conviction would be clearly inadmissible to show general lack of credibility and, while there had been \u201cvague references\u201d to the objective of showing bias, \u201cdefense counsel never articulated his theory as to the admissibility of the mere arrest of the witness in such terms as to present the issue which he now propounds on this appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307. In finding no reversible error, the Fifth Circuit stated: \u201cIt is axiomatic that the trial court must be apprised of the purpose of any inquiry to which objection is made. That is, the objective of questions propounded on cross-examination must be revealed to the trial court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">We would find it incongruous to hold that the trial judge committed error by prohibiting cross-examination to show bias when neither counsel nor the context in which he asked his question made his purpose clear to the judge. Reversal for denial of the right to show bias on cross-examination thus requires both an affirmative assertion of that right and a knowing decision by the judge to deny or limit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\n<em>The order of the district court granting appellee\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\"> Had counsel anticipated and received a \u201cno\u201d answer to his question whether Brant had been charged, it would have become clear that he was seeking to elicit evidence of bias. It is also plausible, however, that counsel anticipated a \u201cyes\u201d answer to his question. In such event, even though there had been ample testimony as to Brant\u2019s conduct such a question might have been asked in order to show that this conduct was regarded by the Commonwealth as worthy of prosecution, and that such \u201cbad conduct\u201d demonstrated the untrustworthiness of his testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
