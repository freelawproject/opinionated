East, United State District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b943-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The Secretary of Labor appeals the denial of a petition for an order restraining Silver Creek Packing Co. from violating the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act (FLORA or \u201cthe Act\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2041, <em>et seq. </em>The district court found that Silver Creek was exempt from the FLCRA\u2019s registration and disclosure provisions and entered judgment for the company We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Silver Creek.picks and packs cantaloupes for a profit. For a \u201cpacking expense,\u201d which reflects the company\u2019s costs and includes a fixed profit margin, the company harvests, processes, and markets the melon crops of individual growers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Silver Creek does not directly assess farmers for the \u201cpacking expense,\u201d but deducts its fee from the proceeds realized from marketing the produce, returning the balance to the grower. Because Silver Creek takes its fee \u201coff the top,\u201d the individual grower bears the loss if the market price is less than the sum of his overhead growing costs plus the corporation\u2019s \u201cpacking expense.\u201d The company takes a loss only if the market price does not cover its \u201cpacking expense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">To obtain workers for its harvesting operations, Silver Creek recruits and hires migrant laborers. The Secretary alleges that, because of its hiring activities, Silver Creek is a \u201cfarm labor contractor,\u201d subject to the registration and disclosure requirements of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Silver Creek responds, and the district court held, that the company falls within an exemption from the FLCRA\u2019s coverage as a \u201cpacking shed operator * * who personally engages in [hiring activities] for the purpose of supplying migrant workers solely for [its] own operation.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(bX2).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-16\">In this appeal, the Secretary contends that Silver Creek neither \u201cpersonally engages\u201d in labor contracting nor hires migrant workers \u201csolely\u201d for its operations. Both conditions are necessary for exemption under \u00a7 2042(b)(2); neither alone is sufficient. Accordingly, if either of the Secretary\u2019s contentions is valid, Silver Creek is not exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">We reject the Secretary\u2019s argument that Silver Creek does not \u201cpersonally\u201d engage in labor contracting. The arguments presented on this issue are indistinguishable from those raised by the parties in <em>Marshall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number><em>v. Green Goddess Avocado Corp., </em>615 F.2d 851 (9th Cir. 1980), decided this day. For the reasons guiding our holding in that case, we find that Silver Creek, as a corporation, can, and . does, \u201cpersonally\u201d hire farm laborers.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Silver Creek does not, however, satisfy the second condition of the (b)(2) exemption. Its labor contracting activities are not \u201csolely\u201d for its own operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">In <em>Marshall v. Coastal Growers Ass\u2019n, </em>598 F.2d 521 (9th Cir. 1979), this court held that nonprofit agricultural cooperatives, which hired and paid workers who harvested the crops of grower-members, could not claim (b)(2) exemptions because their hiring activities were not for their own operations, but for the operations of their members. <em>Id. </em>at 524-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Silver Creek, despite its corporate structure, resembles the <em>Coastal Growers </em>cooperatives in several significant respects. First, Silver Creek deducts a fixed fee from market proceeds, and returns the balance to the grower. Second, Silver Creek never owns the fruit it handles and assumes no risk of loss unless the market falls below the packing costs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, while Silver Creek harvests and markets the produce of nonshareholders, it also processes the produce of growers who exercise control over its operations. The corporation\u2019s four shareholders are all melon growers whose crops Silver Creek handles.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Silver Creek contends that it differs from the <em>Coastal Growers </em>cooperatives because it realizes a profit. But the profit distinction is immaterial. For while Silver Creek hires migrant workers for its own operations and benefits from their efforts, that hiring is not \u201csolely\u201d for its operations. The farmers whose fruit is picked benefit directly from Silver Creek\u2019s hiring activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">This \u201cdirect benefit\u201d concept may be understood by reference to the facts in <em>Marshall v. Green Goddess Avocado Corp., supra. </em>The corporation in <em>Green Goddess </em>pays farmers for fruit while the fruit is on the tree. Green Goddess harvests the fruit, markets it, and retains all of the market proceeds. Growers, after selling their crops to Green Goddess, are indifferent about whether the crops are harvested. If the fruit rots, that is Green Goddess\u2019s loss; the grower has been paid. Consequently, when Green Goddess hires migrant workers, it is solely for its own operations. It alone has an interest in their efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">The farmers who contract with Silver Creek, however, have a direct stake in the harvesting of their crops. After the corporation deducts its \u201cpacking expense\u201d from market proceeds, the growers receive the remainder. If their melons are not picked, the growers receive nothing. Because the growers are dependent on Silver Creek\u2019s farm labor contracting, those activities cannot be \u201csolely\u201d for the corporation\u2019s operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Our application of the (b)(2) exemption conforms with the Secretary\u2019s regulations interpreting the FLORA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>is consistent with the Act\u2019s legislative intent, the regulation of \u201cmiddlemen\u201d labor contractors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Silver Creek, for a fee, provides workers to harvest individual growers\u2019 crops.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is a third party in a position to exploit both farmers and workers. It engages in precisely the kind of activity that the FLCRA seeks to regulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The district court\u2019s finding of exemption under \u00a7 2042(b)(2) falls before <em>Marshall v. Coastal Growers Ass\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-9\">.

The effect of this arrangement, unlike that in <em>Marshall v. Green Goddess Avocado Corp., </em>615 F.2d 851 (9th Cir. 1980), where the grower\u2019s profit is fixed and the corporation\u2019s profit or loss depends on market conditions, is that Silver Creek\u2019s profit is virtually guaranteed, and the farmers\u2019 income varies with market fluctuations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b943-11\">. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2042(a) and (b), defining \u201cfarm labor contractor,\u201d read in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-12\">\u201cAs used in this chapter\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-13\">\u201c(a) The term \u2018person\u2019 includes any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, or corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-14\">\u201c(b) The term \u2018farm labor contractor\u2019 means any person, who, for a fee, either for himself or on behalf of another person, recruits, solicits, hires, furnishes, or transports migrant workers (excluding members of his immediate family) for agricultural employment.

Testimony at trial established that if a truckload of melons should be destroyed between a grower\u2019s field and Silver Creek\u2019s packing shed, Silver Creek\u2019s insurance carrier would reimburse the grower, at least to the extent of the grower\u2019s fixed production costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b944-9\">. 29 C:F.R. \u00a7 41.17 reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-10\">\u201c(a) * * * The Act was intended to regulate the practices of all persons functioning in the capacity of middlemen between the farmer, processor, etc., and the migrant worker.

Where the processor or any other person acts as the conduit through whom the migrant workers are made available to third parties, even though the crops on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>migrant workers are employed are the subject matter of a contract to purchase (as distinguished from a contract of sale) and will be used in the processing, canning, etc., the exemption does not apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b945-16\">. <em>See Marshall v.
