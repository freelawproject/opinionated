Chapman, an Indian, was charged in a one count indictment with unlawfully killing one Larry Paquin (Paquin), an Indian, with malice aforethought, premeditation and deliberation, on the Zuni Indian Reservation, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1153 and 1111. The events preceding the killing are generally not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-18\">During mid June 1978, Paquin and one Brian Lasiloo were given a ride to a bar by Chapman. After the bar closed the three went to Chapman\u2019s trailer, arriving there at approximately 3:00 A.M. At or about sunrise, Paquin obtained the keys to Chapman\u2019s pickup, drove Lasiloo to his home and then drove the pickup to Arizona. When Chapman awakened later the same morning and discovered that his pickup was gone, he went to Lasiloo\u2019s house seeking his vehicle. Chapman approached Lasiloo with a shotgun, and he became furious when he couldn\u2019t find the pickup. Chapman then proceeded to beat Lasiloo with the butt of the gun. Prior to leaving Lasiloo\u2019s house, Chapman threatened to kill both Lasiloo and Paquin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-19\">Chapman later reported to the police and others that Paquin had stolen his pickup and that when he found him (Paquin), he was going to \u201cshoot\u201d or \u201ckill\u201d him. Chapman also stated that Paquin had stolen some money from him at the time he took the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-20\">Approximately five weeks later on July 29, 1978, Chapman, who had been drinking, took his pickup<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and shotgun and went seeking out Paquin in an attempt to \u201cscare him into giving me my money back\u201d. Chapman located Paquin about 4:00 P.M. at a friend\u2019s house. Witnesses there observed Paquin approach Chapman\u2019s truck and talk to him briefly. Moments later, Chapman according to a number of witnesses, \u201cpulled out the gun and fired it\u201d, killing Paquin almost instantly. When one of the observers rushed to Paquin\u2019s aid, Chapman stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>\u201cCome on. You want to be next\u201d and \u201cRemember, forget me or you will be next\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">At the time of the shooting, Benito Anastacio was a passenger in Chapman\u2019s pickup. Anastacio testified that prior to Chapman\u2019s encounter with Paquin he attempted to get out of the truck; that Chapman would not let him; that Chapman stated \u201cYou say nothing\u201d and \u201cIf I get out of there, I\u2019m going to come and get you\u201d. Anastacio also stated that immediately prior to hearing the shotgun blast Chapman told Paquin \u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you\u201d to which Paquin responded, \u201cGo ahead\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">Chapman testified that the shooting was an accident. In discussing the shooting, Chapman related:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-6\">Q [Mr. Deaton, defense attorney] Were you in your pickup?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-7\">A [Kenneth Rudolph Chapman] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-8\">Q Did you have some kind of a gun in that pickup?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-10\">Q ,, What did you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-11\">A A gun, you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-12\">Q Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-13\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-14\">Q What kind of a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-15\">A It was a sawed off shotgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-16\">Q What gauge was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-17\">A Sixteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-18\">Q And where was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-19\">A It was under the seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-20\">Q What happened when you got to the Eriacho\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-21\">A When I got to the Eriacho house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-22\">Q Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-23\">A I called Larry Paquin over to the pickup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-24\">Q How did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-25\">A I went this way to him (indicating).

In discussing the events immediately prior to the shooting, Chapman stated on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-7\">A I would say that I was feeling pretty happy, I was going to the picnic, and I decided to stop there and scare him into giving me my money back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-8\">(R., Vol. III, pp. 242-243).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">Chapman also stated that upon seeing Paquin at his friend\u2019s house, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to stop until he gave me a finger.\u201d (R., Vol. III, p. 242).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">Throughout the trial, Chapman repeatedly and consistently denied that he ever told anyone he was going to shoot or kill Paquin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">At the conclusion of all the evidence the jury was instructed on the elements of first and second degree murder. The court declined to give Chapman\u2019s proffered instruction on voluntary manslaughter. Following the verdict of guilty, Chapman was sentenced to fifty (50) years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">On appeal Chapman contends: (1) the court erred in refusing to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction inasmuch as there was evidence to support such a theory of defense; and (2) repeated comments by the prosecutor gave rise to misconduct and reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">Chapman contends that the court erred in refusing to give his proffered instruction on voluntary manslaughter. In reviewing the submission of instructions, the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-15\">MR. DEATON: May it please the Court, with respect to the Defendant, we would object to the refusal of the Court to give the crime of manslaughter as a lesser included offense and to define the crime of manslaughter; specifically voluntary manslaughter, and manslaughter as was submitted in Defendant\u2019s instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-18\">(Pursuant to certificate of designation of record on appeal, Defendant proposed instruction on manslaughter furnished to reporter is herewith set forth.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQO\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s requested instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWv\">\u201cSection 1112 of Title 18 of U.S.C.A. defines manslaughter as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIP\">\u201cManslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice. It is of two kinds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-19\">\u201cVoluntary \u2014 upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-20\">\u201cThe heat of passion, which will reduce a murder to manslaughter, must be such passion as would be aroused naturally in the mind of the ordinary reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances, as shown by the evidence in the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-21\">\u201cNeither the passion of fear, in and of itself, nor the passion for revenge, in and of itself, nor the passion induced and accompanying or following an intent to commit a felony, in and of itself, nor any combination of any one or more or all of these passions, in and of themselves, constitutes the heat of passion which will reduce a murder to manslaughter. It is true that the emotions just mentioned may be involved in a heat of passion such as substitutes impulse and rashness for judgment; but it is also true that such emotions may exist in the mind of a person who acts deliberately, and from choice, following his own reasoning, however good or bad that reasoning may be. \u201cThe Court does not permit a person to set up his own standard of conduct, or to justify or excuse himself, merely because his passions were aroused, unless the circumstances in which he was confronted, were such as would have aroused the passion of the ordinary rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>sonable person, similarly situated. So, the test to be applied, in determining whether a killing was in the heat of passion which-will reduce a murder to manslaughter, is whether or not, at the time of the killing, the reason of the accused was obscured or disburbed [sic] by passion to such an extent as would cause the ordinary reasonable person to act rationally and without deliberation, and reflection, and from such passion, rather than from judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-4\">Devitt and Blackmar, 41.14\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-5\">THE COURT: Mr. Deaton, I did not instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, because I did not feel that the evidence in this case justified the giving of that instruction. My impression is that as a matter of law, the evidence is sufficient to submit the question of provocation, special provocation to the jury, that is the reason that I didn\u2019t so instruct. Any other objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-6\">(R., Vol. III, pp. 288-290).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">Chapman argues that had the requested manslaughter instruction been given, \u201cdefense counsel would have been able to argue\u201d from the evidence that the combination of Paquin\u2019s \u201cthrowing a finger\u201d to Chapman, his remarks that \u201cI don\u2019t owe you a damned thing\u201d and \u201cIf you\u2019re going to use that, use it\u201d, when coupled with the background between the men and Chapman\u2019s drinking, \u201ccould have caused . [him to] . suddenly and impulsively . . shoot Paquin \u2018in the heat of passion\u2019 \u201d. Chapman argues that with the requested instruction, \u201cargument could well be made that the incident was \u2018in the heat of passion\u2019 notwithstanding the prior statements attributed to . [him].\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">The decision of whether there is enough evidence to justify a lesser included offense charge rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>United States v. Busic, </em>592 F.2d 13 (2nd Cir. 1978). In <em>Keeble v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973) the Court wrote of the continued vitality of the lesser included offense doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-16\">Although the lesser included offense doctrine developed at common law to assist the prosecution in cases where the evidence failed to establish some element of the offense originally charged,5 it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZPl\">5 See <em>Kelly v.

In <em>United States v. King, </em>567 F.2d 785 (8th Cir. 1977) <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 945, 98 S.Ct. 1527, 55 L.Ed.2d 542 (1978) the'court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-21\">Next, Cleora King, who was convicted of unlawful narcotics distributions in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), contends that the District Court erred in refusing her request for an instruction on the lesser-included offense of narcotics possession under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a).7</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>This Court has held that a defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction when the following five elements are present: (1) a proper request is made; (2) the elements of the lesser offense are identical to part of the elements of the greater offense; (3) there is some evidence that would justify conviction of the lesser offense; (4) the proof on the element or elements differentiating the two crimes is sufficiently in dispute so that the jury may consistently find the defendant innocent of the greater and guilty of the lesser-included offense, and (5) there is mutuality, <em>i. e., </em>a charge may be demanded by either the United States or the defense. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>492 F.2d 359, 362 (8th Cir. 1974).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1393-5\">It does not follow that a lesser included offense instruction is mandatory every time a lesser offense is included within the offense charged in the indictment. The instruction need not be given when \u201cfrom the evidence adduced at the trial there is no rational basis upon which the jury could find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Klugman, </em>506 F.2d 1378, 1380 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>see United States v. Rucker, </em>496 F.2d 1241, 1243-44 (8th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>419 U.S. 965, 95 S.Ct. 227, 42 L.Ed.2d 181 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">567 F.2d at p. 790. (Footnote omitted). <em>See also: United States v. Brown, </em>551 F.2d 236 (8th Cir. 1977); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crutchfield, </em>547 F.2d 496 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">This Court has consistently held that a defendant is entitled to adequate instructions on his defense, provided there is evidence before the jury reasonably supporting such a theory. <em>United States v. Pino, </em>606 F.2d 908 (10th Cir. 1979); <em>Devine v. United States, </em>403 F.2d 93 (10th Cir. 1968) <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 1003, 89 S.Ct. 1599, 22 L.Ed.2d 780 (1969). In <em>Pino, supra, </em>we cited and relied on <em>Keeble v. United States, supra, </em>which held that \u201c. . . the defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find him guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.\u201d Consistent with these opinions is the underlying predicate that a lesser included instruction is not necessary or appropriate <em>unless </em>justified by the evidence and it is not to be used to subject an element of mercy. <em>United States v. Trujillo, </em>497 F.2d 408 (10th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-10\">The availability of lesser included offense instructions is further dependent upon the nature of the crime charged coupled with the testimony of the defendant, if any there be, in presenting his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-11\">In <em>United States v. Smith, </em>521 F.2d 374 (10th Cir. 1975) we held that the theory of self defense was inconsistent with the crime of involuntary manslaughter; thus, a defendant in a murder case asserting self defense was not entitled to a lesser included instruction of involuntary manslaughter. In <em>Government of Virgin Islands v. Carmona, </em>422 F.2d 95 (3rd Cir. 1970) the court ruled that inasmuch as felony-murder does not necessarily entail a sudden quarrel or heat of passion, voluntary manslaughter was not a necessarily included offense for which instructions were required. <em>United States v. Wallette, </em>580 F.2d 335 (8th Cir. 1978) involved trial on first degree murder charges. The court there held that the refusal of the trial court to instruct on involuntary manslaughter was not error inasmuch as under North Dakota\u2019s reckless endangerment statute, the defendant\u2019s intentional act of pointing a loaded gun at another with the intent of shooting around the victim and scaring him, constituted a felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-12\">Courts have also scrutinized the testimony of the defendant in disallowing lesser included offense instructions. In <em>United States v. Beverly, </em>562 F.2d 201 (2nd Cir. 1977) <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1039, 98 S.Ct. 779, 54 L.Ed.2d 789 (1978), the court in holding that such an instruction was properly denied, observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>A defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense charge only if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find him guilty of the lesser offense but not guilty of the greater. <em>Keeble v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 208, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973). Here the defendant admitted possession of cocaine; the element in dispute was his intention with respect to the drug. If Beverly\u2019s testimony was believed, not only could he not be convicted of either possession with intent to distribute or of distribution, but he also could not be found guilty of simple possession because, as the trial court found as a matter of law, on those facts he would have been entrapped into committing that crime. Therefore, under <em>Keeble v. United States, supra, </em>the instruction on the lesser included offense was not to be given since no jury rationally could have found Beverly guilty of committing the crime of simple possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1394-4\">562 F.2d at p. 204.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">In <em>United States v. Sinclair, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 444 F.2d 888 (D.C. Cir. 1971) the court similarly held that the refusal to give a lesser included offense instruction was not error where the defendant\u2019s testimony is completely exculpatory and if believed, could only lead to acquittal. The court thus concluded that the kind of reconstruction of events required to support the lesser charge is neither inferable from the testimony nor pointed out by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-6\">Applying these basic principles applicable to the availability of a lesser included instruction, we hold that the trial court properly refused to charge the jury in accordance with Chapman\u2019s proffered voluntary manslaughter instruction, since there was no rational basis upon which Chapman could have been convicted of manslaughter. Paramount to our holding are these matters testified to by Chapman without equivocation: that the shooting was an accident; that he was happy at the time of the shooting; that he was going on a picnic; and that he wanted only to scare Paquin. In light of these circumstances, we must reject Chapman\u2019s argument that with a lesser included instruction he \u201cwould have been able to argue\u201d that the shooting resulted \u201cin the heat of passion\u201d. The contention fails to pass judicial muster. A defendant who testifies that a shooting occurred accidentally, that he was \u201chappy\u201d at the time of the shooting and wished only to \u201cscare\u201d the victim, cannot thereafter argue contrariwise, i. e., that the shooting occurred in the \u201cheat of passion\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">To accept Chapman\u2019s contentions we would have to endorse the proposition that Paquin, by throwing Chapman \u201cthe finger\u201d, and stating that \u201cI don\u2019t owe you a damned thing\u201d and \u201cIf you are going to use that, use it\u201d, when considered in light of the pickup theft five weeks earlier and Chapman\u2019s drinking on the day of the shooting, aroused such anger in Chapman\u2019s temperament that he shot in the \u201cheat of passion\u201d, and that such passion was the same \u201cas would be aroused naturally in the mind of the ordinary reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances\u201d. We cannot rationally, logically, or with any degree of common sense, \u00e9ndorse such a proposition. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in refusing the proffered instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">We observe, without deciding, that had Chapman opted not to testify, thereby removing from the jury\u2019s consideration his personal account of events relating to his state of mind, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Chapman, vis-a-vis the availability of the instruction, might have warranted the giving of the requested instruction on manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-11\">Chapman contends that the use of the words \u201cmurder\u201d, \u201ccrime\u201d, and \u201ccrime scene\u201d by an F.B.I. agent and assistant United States Attorney during the course of direct examination of the ag'ent gave rise to reversible error. We have carefully reviewed the text in which these words were spoken, the objections made relative thereto, and the cautionary instructions of the court. We hold that no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>To be sure, \u201c[W]e have not hesitated in the past to order a new trial when the comments made by the prosecution have been so egregious that they have irreparably prejudiced the defendant\u201d. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carleo, </em>576 F.2d 846 (10th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied </em>(1978), 439 U.S. 850, 99 S.Ct. 153, 58 L.Ed.2d 152 (1978). However, such is not the case here. Every slight excess of the prosecution does not require that a verdict be overturned and a new trial ordered. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coppola, </em>526 F.2d 764 (10th Cir. 1975). The comments complained of herein did not rise to the height of plain error.

I agree, however, that the claim of misconduct by the prosecutor and the witness does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">The Supreme Court has emphatically said that \u201c. . . it is now beyond dispute that the defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find him guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.\u201d <em>Keeble v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 208, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1995, 36 L.Ed.2d 844. And while some courts have said that the decision of whether there is enough evidence to justify a lesser included offense charge rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge, <em>United States v. Busic, </em>592 F.2d 13, 25 (2d Cir.), I cannot agree that the test is one of discretion. If there is some evidence to support a lesser included offense and the defendant requests such a charge, the court has no discretion to refuse the instruction. <em>United States v. Pino, </em>606 F.2d 908, 914 (10th Cir.); 8A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, </em>If 31.03. For the trial court in effect to weigh the evidence runs counter to the rule laid down by the Supreme Court in <em>Stevenson v. United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 16 S.Ct. 839, 40 L.Ed. 980. Although the circumstances there were much stronger for the defendant, including the fact that both men were armed, the court there stated <em>(id. </em>at 314-15, 16 S.Ct. at 839):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1395-11\">The evidence as to manslaughter need not be uncontradicted or in any way conclusive upon the question; <em>so long as there is some evidence upon the subject, the proper weight to be given it is for the jury to determine. If there were any evidence </em>which tended to show such a state of facts as might bring the crime within the grade of manslaughter, it then became a proper question for the jury to say whether the evidence were true and whether it showed that the crime was manslaughter instead of murder. . <em>The evidence might appear to the court to be simply overwhelming to show that the killing was in fact murder, and not manslaughter oran act performed in self-defense, and yet, so long as there was some evidence relevant to the issue of manslaughter, the credibility and force of such evidence must be for the jury, and cannot be matter of law for the decision of the court. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">In <em>United States v. Comer, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 219, 421 F.2d 1149, 1154 (D.C. Cir.) the court reminded us that \u201cthe jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested.\u201d Moreover, this court has previously held that a defendant is entitled to instruction on <em>any </em>theory of defense finding support in the evidence and the law, and that a refusal of such instructions is reversible error. <em>United States v. Swallow, </em>511 F.2d 514, 523 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 845, 96 S.Ct. 82, 46 L.Ed.2d 66. Further, the presence of such evidence requires an instruction on a theory of defense <em>\u201c[ejven though the evidence may be weak, insufficient, inconsistent or of doubtful credibility.\u201d Id. </em>at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>The majority \u201cobserve[s], without deciding,\u201d that had defendant not testified, especially to his assertion that the shooting was an accident, \u201cthe evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Chapman, vis-a-vis the availability of the instruction, might have warranted the giving of the requested instruction on manslaughter.\u201d This statement seems to imply that if the defendant relies primarily on the defense that the shooting was accidental, he cannot also rely on an alternative defense that the shooting was at most manslaughter since it occurred in the \u201cheat of passion.\u201d Our opinion in <em>United States v. Smith, </em>521 F.2d 374, 377 (10th Cir.), does give support to this statement on inconsistent positions. I am convinced, however, that the controlling principle as recognized by the Supreme Court in <em>Stevenson v. United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 16 S.Ct. 839, 40 L.Ed. 980, leaves no room for refusing a lesser included offense charge on such a theory in this case. In <em>Stevenson, id. </em>at 322-23, 16 S.Ct. at 842-843, the Court reasoned that the evidence there might support both a position of self-defense, showing that no crime at all was committed, and yet also it could support a finding of shooting under the influence of passion and without malice so as to be manslaughter and not murder. The Court referred to examining the testimony of \u201csome of the witnesses\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 322, 16 S.Ct. at 842, and said that the question was for the jury \u201c. . . <em>if there be any evidence fairly tending to bear upon the issue of manslaughter . . </em>. .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 16 S.Ct. at 843. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">We note that in <em>Belton v. United States, </em>127 U.S.App.D.C. 201, 206, 382 F.2d 150, 155 (D.C. Cir.), it was said that the evidence to support a lesser included offense instruction is sufficient \u201ceven though this depends on an inference of a state of facts that is ascertained by believing defendant as to <em>part of his testimony </em>and prosecution witnesses on the other points in dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added). This principle is more fully stated in <em>United States v. Huff, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 163, 168, 442 F.2d 885, 890 (D.C. Cir.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-9\">The jury is not confined in its findings to matters that are directly set forth in testimony but may base an inference of lesser offense on a \u201creconstruction that is fairly inferable\u201d from the evidence, gleaned perhaps by putting together some items from one witness, some from another, and some from the jury\u2019s own experience and sense of probabilities. And so the judge took into account that the <em>jury might reasonably make findings different from the version set forth in anyone\u2019s testimony. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-11\">And as stated in <em>Stevenson v. United States, </em>162 U.S. 313, 322, 16 S.Ct. 839, 842, 40 L.Ed. 980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-12\">The fact that the evidence might raise an issue as to whether any crime at all was committed is not in the least inconsistent with a claim that it also raised an issue as to whether or not the plaintiff in error was guilty of manslaughter instead of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1396-13\">To the trial judge and to us the evidence to support the lesser offense charge may seem weak and unconvincing. Nevertheless the jury could, I feel, have rejected the defendant\u2019s testimony that the shooting was accidental and yet believed and been persuaded by that part of the testimony that the deceased had stolen the pickup and money from the defendant (III R. 218-19), had heckled him on frequent occasions in the meantime about the thefts, had just denied owing him any money, and immediately prior to the shooting had taunted the defendant with both words and gestures <em>(id. </em>at 242), while the defendant was in a drunken condition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From these circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>stances the jury could have drawn an inference that the shooting was done \u201c[u]pon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112, although to the court the evidence may have been \u201coverwhelming to show that the killing was in fact murder.\u201d <em>Stevenson, </em>162 U.S. at 314, 16 S.Ct. at 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">Since there was some evidence to warrant a manslaughter conviction, the lesser offense instruction should have been given. On this ground I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1396-7\">. It is true that some opinions refer to evaluating the circumstances of the average sober man. <em>E.g., Hart v. United States, </em>76 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 130 F.2d 456 (D.C. Cir.). However, numerous more recent decisions have noted the factor of drunkenness as a part of the total circumstances in deciding whether a manslaughter or lesser included offense was committed as opposed to murder. <em>E.g., DeMarrias v. United States, </em>453 F.2d 211 (8th Cir.); <em>United States v. Comer, </em>137 U.S.App.D.C. 214, 421 F.2d 1149 (D.C.

In fact, the majority here has commented on the factor of drunkenness, on which there was substantial evidence in this record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
