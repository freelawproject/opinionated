HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">The University of Alabama School of Law offers a graduate course of study in taxation. Admission to the program is selective. Among other qualifications, applicants must possess a J.D. or equivalent degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. John N. Pappanastos, appellant, was denied admission to the graduate tax program \u201csolely because he [did] not [graduate] from an ABA accredited law school.\u201d <em>Pappanastos v. Board of Trustees, </em>No. 77-380-N (M.D.Ala., filed Nov. 30, 1977), at 2. Pappanastos sued the university under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1976), charging that the defendants\u2019 accreditation requirement denied him equal protection of the laws. U.S.Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. From a summary judgment in favor of defendants, Pappanastos appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">As in all cases implicating the equal protection clause, \u201cwe must first determine what burden of justification the [challenged] classification . . . must meet.\u201d <em>Zablocki v. Redhail, </em>434 U.S. 374, 383, 98 S.Ct. 673, 679, 54 L.Ed.2d 618 (1978), quoting <em>Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County, </em>415 U.S. 250, 94 S.Ct. 1076, 39 L.Ed.2d 306 (1974). The proper degree of judicial \u201cscrutiny,\u201d <em>see Trimble v. Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 777, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 1468, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), is a function of two variables: first, the' nature of the right affected; and second, the identity of the plaintiff. If the classification \u201cinterferes with the exercise of a fundamental right or operates to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>peculiar disadvantage of a suspect class,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 312, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2566, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (per curiam) (footnote omitted), \u201cstrict\u201d judicial scrutiny is then the standard of review. <em>E. g., Dunn v. Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972) (voting); <em>Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 U.S. 365, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971) (alienage). Otherwise, the question is whether the classification bears \u201ca rational relation to a legitimate state interest.\u201d <em>Ohio Bureau of Unemployment Services </em>v. <em>Hodory, </em>431 U.S. 471, 489, 97 S.Ct. 1898, 1908, 52 L.Ed.2d 513 (1977). <em>See, e. g., Holt Civic Club v. City of Tuscaloosa, </em>439 U.S. 60, 99 S.Ct. 383, 58 L.Ed.2d 292 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Not surprisingly, Pappanastos concedes that the \u201crational relationship\u201d test controls this case. Admission to appellees\u2019 tax program is no \u201cbasic civil right of man,\u201d <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942); nor can it be said that graduates of unaccredited law schools suffer \u201csuch disabilities, or [are] subjected to such a history .of purposeful unequal treatment, or [are] relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection from the majoritian political process.\u201d <em>San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 28, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1294, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973). Appellant bases his attack on the alleged \u201cirrationality\u201d and \u201carbitrariness\u201d of the accreditation prerequisite: no state purpose is advanced, appellant contends, by keeping him ignorant of tax law, particularly since he is already a practicing Alabama attorney. The constitutional issue, however, does not turn on appellant\u2019s personal credentials. <em>See, e. g., Idaho Department of Employment v. Smith, </em>434 U.S. 100, 98 S.Ct. 327, 54 L.Ed.2d 324 (1977) (per curiam); <em>Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976) (per curiam); <em>Berman v. Florida Medical Center, Inc., </em>600 F.2d 466 (5th Cir. 1979). We must ask, rather, whether \u201cany state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify\u201d the challenged admission standard. <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 426, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 1105, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961). <em>Accord, Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District, </em>410 U.S. 719, 93 S.Ct. 1224, 35 L.Ed.2d 659 (1973). So framed, appellant\u2019s equal protection claim is facially untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Like most selective academic institutions, the University of Alabama School of Law endeavors to accept those applicants who exhibit superior professional promise. According to its Dean, \u201cone [admission] consideration is whether the applicant has had good, solid school training.\u201d R. 144. A.B.A. accreditation signifies various and desirable scholastic attributes. <em>See </em>American Bar Association, Approval of Law Schools (rev. ed. 1979). Patently, such matters as curriculum, faculty, library facilities, class attendance, and pre-legal studies bear a rational, albeit not a perfectly precise, relation to the quality of law school education. It is for this reason that A.B.A. accredited legal education has been consistently and repeatedly declared a' constitutionally valid prerequisite for admission to the bar. <em>See Donnelly v. Boston College, </em>558 F.2d 634 (1st Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 987, 98 S.Ct. 618, 54 L.Ed.2d 483 (1977); <em>Lombardi v. Tauro, </em>470 F.2d 798 (1st Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 919, 93 S.Ct. 2734, 37 L.Ed.2d 145 (1973); <em>Hackin v. Lockwood, </em>361 F.2d 499 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 960, 87 S.Ct. 396, 17 L.Ed.2d 305 (1966); <em>Hickey v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, </em>457 F.Supp. 584 (D.D.C.1978); <em>Potter v. New Jersey Supreme Court, </em>403 F.Supp. 1036 (D.N.J.1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>546 F.2d 418 (3d Cir. 1976). Likewise, \u201cgraduation from an accredited institution as a prerequisite to being admitted to Graduate School is unobjectionable and a reasonable rule for a col-, lege or university to adopt.\u201d <em>Franklin v. Parker, </em>223 F.Supp. 724, 726 (M.D.Ala.1963) (F. Johnson, J.), <em>aff\u2019d per curiam, </em>331 F.2d 841 (5th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
