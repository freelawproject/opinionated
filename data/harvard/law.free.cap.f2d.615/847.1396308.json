They appeal a judgment for the defendants. We affirm substantially for the reasons set forth by the district judge in his opinion reported at 436 F.Supp. 1273 (N.D.Cal.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-19\">One point urged on appeal was obviated by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, </em>442 U.S. 256, 99 S.Ct. 2282, 60 L.Ed.2d 870 (1979), which upheld the right of a state to grant preference to veterans in public employment. The other points, particularly that the oral interview process discriminated against women job applicants, are fully answered in the careful analysis of the evidence by the trial judge. The court, in detailed findings that survive review under Fed.R.Civ.P. 52, found that there was a failure of proof of gender-based discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
