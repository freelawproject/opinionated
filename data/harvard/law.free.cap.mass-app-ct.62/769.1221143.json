L. c. 209A abuse prevention order against her husband, James Mitchell, a judge of the Probate Court vacated the order on the husband\u2019s motion seeking to reconsider or vacate it. We consider in this appeal by the wife the appropriate standard for deciding a motion to reconsider or vacate a c. 209A order, and whether the husband\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support the judge\u2019s decision. We conclude that it was not and, therefore, that it was error to vacate the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>After suffering from more than ten years of verbal and physical abuse inflicted by the husband, the wife, on December 20, 2001, filed a complaint for protection from abuse under c. 209A, supported by her affidavit and three police reports.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An ex parte abuse prevention order was issued that same day directing the husband to (among other things) refrain from abusing or contacting the wife. The husband appeared pro se at a hearing on January 3, 2002, the date on which the initial order was fixed to expire, and after hearing, the order was extended for one year, to January 3, 2003. The husband did not appeal from the extended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">On June 20, 2002, the husband filed a verified motion requesting the court \u201cto reconsider or vacate\u201d the order dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>January 3, 2002; in the motion he stated that the wife had contacted him repeatedly by telephone since the issuance of the order and had spent time with him in Los Angeles while attending the funeral of his mother.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the husband\u2019s view, the wife\u2019s repeated \u201ccontact[s]\u201d with him and her \u201csuccessful requests\u201d to spend time alone with him while they were in Los Angeles \u201cclearly indicate that she does not fear physical or verbal abuse from [him] and did not fear such abuse in the past.\u201d The husband requested that the abuse prevention order be vacated retroactive to January 3, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">A hearing, at which no testimony was taken, was conducted by the same judge who had issued the order of January 3, 2002. The judge had before her the husband\u2019s affidavit, the wife\u2019s verified opposition to the husband\u2019s motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and an affidavit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>the husband\u2019s sister filed by the wife which, in large part, corroborated the wife\u2019s description of events and statements concerning her fear of the husband.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The motion to reconsider or vacate was marked \u201callowed\u201d in the margin. No written findings were made, nor was any oral explanation given at the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201c[Preservation of the fundamental human right to be protected from the devastating impact of family violence\u201d is the public policy of this Commonwealth, reflected in numerous statutes addressing the problem of domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>violence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 327 (1999). <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 356 (2002). Cf. <em>Custody of Vaughn, </em>422 Mass. 590, 595 (1996) (in which, in a somewhat different setting, the Supreme Judicial Court defined this fundamental right as nothing less than \u201cthe right to live in physical security, free from the fear that brute force will determine the conditions of one\u2019s daily life\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">General Laws c. 209A sets out a statutory scheme intended to protect victims of abuse, as defined by the statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> through the issuance of abuse prevention orders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>434 Mass. 331, 334 (2001) (\u201c[violence brought on by, or exacerbated by, familial relationships was the \u2018mischief or imperfection to be remedied\u2019 by c. 209A\u201d); <em>C.O. </em>v. <em>M.M., </em>442 Mass. 648, 651 (2004); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 883, 886 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Section 3 of c. 209A<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> contemplates the possibility of modification of such orders \u201cat any subsequent time upon motion of either party.\u201d It also refers to the vacating of orders, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>provides that the fact abuse has not occurred during the pendency of an order shall not, in itself, constitute sufficient grounds for allowing an order to be vacated. See <em>Brossard </em>v. <em>West Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dept., </em>417 Mass. 183, 185-186 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rauseo, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 699, 709 (2001); <em>Lonergan-Gillen </em>v. <em>Gillen, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 750 (2003); Guidelines for Judicial Practice: Abuse Prevention Proceedings \u00a7 6.04 commentary, at 98 (Dec. 2000) (\u201cBoth parties have the right to ask the court to modify an existing order, by either increasing or decreasing the severity of the terms, or by terminating or vacating the order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The husband\u2019s motion to reconsider or vacate may be construed to contain requests for two distinct forms of relief. First, the husband appears to assert in his motion that the wife\u2019s actions and conduct subsequent to the extension of the abuse prevention order indicate that she was not truthful when she stated in her affidavit and through counsel at the c. 209A hearing on January 3, 2002, that she was in fear of him. In the husband\u2019s view, this was new evidence that required that the c. 209A order be <em>vacated retroactively </em>from January 3, 2002, as the order should never have entered. The husband also asserts in his motion that the wife\u2019s actions and conduct during the pendency of the c. 209A order indicate that she is not presently in fear of him, and that therefore there is no ongoing need for the order, which should, accordingly, be terminated. Such an assertion seeks <em>prospective </em>relief from the c. 209A order.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">We think that a request for either form of relief may be made pursuant to c. 209A, \u00a7 3. Chapter 209A does not, however, articulate any standard relative to requests to modify, vacate, or terminate an abuse prevention order. In considering the wife\u2019s argument that the order should not have been vacated, we address separately the husband\u2019s bases for relief and the standard appropriate to each request.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">(a) <em>Request to vacate c. 209A order retroactively. </em>Where, as here, a party seeks through asserted \u201cnew evidence\u201d to vacate retroactively an abuse prevention order, we think that principles analogous to those applicable to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b)(2) (1975) (hereinafter rule 60[b][2]), and to the identical Mass.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Civ.P. 60(b)(2), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), provide a useful guide to judges deciding whether to grant the relief sought.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">A request for relief from final judgments or orders under rule 60(b)(2) may be granted on the basis of \u201cnewly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under [Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P.] 59(b).\u201d Relief on the basis of newly discovered evidence under either rule 59 or rule 60(b)(2) requires the same showing. See <em>Cullen Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., 399 </em>Mass. 886, 894 n.17 (1987); <em>VanAlstyne </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 340, 347, 349 n.3 (1983); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.5 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Applying the foregoing concepts, we think that a motion that seeks to vacate retroactively an order issued under c. 209A \u201con the ground of newly discovered evidence cannot properly be granted unless it is found that the evidence relied on was not available to the party seeking [relief] for introduction at the original trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence, and that such evidence is material not only in the sense that it is relevant and admissible but also in the sense that it is important evidence of such a nature\u201d that it likely would have affected the result had it been available at the time. <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>312 Mass. 495, 497 (1942). See <em>VanAlstyne </em>v. <em>Whalen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 349-351. See also <em>Cullen Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., 399 </em>Mass. at 894; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Kelly, 12 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 937, 938 (1981) (applying common-law principles of cases cited in <em>DeLuca </em>to motion for new trial on ground of newly discovered evidence in domestic relations proceeding); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.5 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Here, even if we were to assume that the wife\u2019s conduct subsequent to the issuance of the c. 209A order somehow constitutes newly discovered evidence (a doubtful proposition), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>that evidence served only as an after the fact challenge to the wife\u2019s credibility at the c. 209A hearing. It is settled that \u201ca new trial will not ordinarily be granted on the ground of newly-discovered evidence which goes only to impeach the credit of a witness at trial.\u201d <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>312 Mass. at 500, quoting from <em>Hopcraft </em>v. <em>Kittredge, </em>162 Mass. 1, 13 (1894); <em>Blaikie </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., </em>375 Mass. 613, 619 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>441 Mass. 822, 831 (2004).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record before us to support a departure from this general rule. Nor, as we shall discuss more fully, <em>infra, </em>was the husband\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d \u2014 of sporadic contacts with the wife during the pendency of the c. 209A order \u2014 such that it would likely have affected the result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>De-Luca </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., supra </em>at 497; <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 923, 924 (1981); Smith &amp; Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 59.5 (1977 &amp; Supp. 2003). The order to vacate was not justified on the basis of the husband\u2019s claim of newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">(b) <em>Request for relief from prospective application of the order. </em>The husband\u2019s motion construed as a request for relief from prospective application of the abuse prevention order calls for a somewhat different analysis.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such a request falls generally into that category of cases invoking the court\u2019s power to modify or prospectively to terminate an abuse prevention order. As we have indicated, that power finds expression in c. 209A, \u00a7 3, and is also embodied in the last section of Mass.R.Dom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Rel.P. 60(b)(5) (1975), which authorizes a judge to relieve a party from a final order if \u201cit is no longer equitable that the [order] should have prospective application.\u201d See generally <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 34 n.1 (1982) (alimony). See also <em>Sjomeling </em>v. <em>Stuber, </em>615 N.W.2d 613, 615-617 (S.D. 2000) (no abuse of discretion in denial of motion to set aside a protective order).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">There is scant authority discussing the specific standard for modifying or terminating provisions of a c. 209A order. In determining the appropriate standard applicable to such determinations, we look to cases interpreting the statute and also seek guidance from the rules of procedure and statutes and decisions in related areas of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">We have said that \u201c[i]n deciding whether to modify or renew an abuse prevention order, a judge\u2019s discretion is \u2018broad.\u2019 \u201d <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 356 (2002), quoting from <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 635 (2000). Cf. <em>Lonergan-Gillen </em>v. <em>Gillen, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. at 748-749 (\u201c[t]he proper exercise of judicial discretion involves making a circumstantially fair and reasonable choice within a range of permitted options\u201d). In <em>Kraytsberg </em>v. <em>Kraytsberg, </em>441 Mass. 1021 (2004), the Supreme Judicial Court (in an appeal from a judgment of a single justice of that court denying a petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3) summarized an unpublished Rule 1:28 memorandum and order in which we said that the appellant \u201cneither articulated any reasons why the [abuse prevention] order should be vacated nor suggested that anything of substance had occurred since the order was issued that would have allowed the District Court judge to decide to vacate her order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Statutes governing divorce and children bom out of wedlock provide that certain orders, including those pertaining to alimony and custody, may be modified upon a showing respectively, of a \u201csubstantial\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or a \u201cmaterial and substantial\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> change in circumstances (and, in certain child-related matters, upon an additional finding that the modification will be in the child\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>interests). See, e.g., G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28; G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20; <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665, 674 (2003); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 718-719 &amp; n.2 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The provision in Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b)(5) authorizing a judge to relieve a party from a final judgment if it is \u201cno longer equitable that the judgment have prospective application\u201d is identical to that in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) and derives from the traditional power of a court of equity to modify its decree in light of changed circumstances. See <em>Frew </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>540 U.S. 431, 441-442 (2004).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swift &amp; Co., </em>286 U.S. 106, 119 (1932) (a case predating the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure), the United States Supreme Court said, regarding a request to modify an injunction contained in a consent decree: \u201cThe inquiry for us is whether the changes are so important that dangers, once substantial, have become attenuated to a shadow. . . . Nothing less than a clear showing of grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen conditions should lead us to change what was decreed . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In the years after <em>Swift </em>was decided, the \u201cgrievous wrong\u201d standard was frequently cited as the test for determining whether relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>should be granted where \u201cit is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\u201d See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. at 34 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">More recently, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that the \u201cgrievous wrong\u201d language in <em>Swift </em>\u201cwas not intended to take on a talismanic quality,\u201d <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. 367, 380 (1992) (involving an institutional reform consent decree), and stated that Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(5) permits a \u201cless stringent, more flexible standard.\u201d <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. at 380. See <em>Frew </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>540 U.S. at 441-442. The Court held that, under this flexible standard, \u201ca party seeking modification of a consent decree must establish that a significant change in facts or law warrants revision of the decree . . . .\u201d <em>Rufo </em>v. <em>Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </em>502 U.S. at 393, 384.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 60.47[2][c] (2004) (under the analogous provision in Fed.R.Civ.P. 60[b][5], factors to be considered in determining whether there is a \u201csignificant change in circumstances\u201d vary with type of case and whether complete dissolution of an injunction is sought or only a modification; \u201cif a party seeks to have a decree set aside entirely, he or she has to show that the decree has served its purpose, and there is no longer any need for the injunction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">In <em>Alexis Lichine &amp; Cie. </em>v. <em>Sacha A. Lichine Estate Selections, Ltd., </em>45 F.3d 582, 586 (1st Cir. 1995), the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, commenting on <em>Swift </em>and <em>Rufo, </em>observed that the two cases distinguish between decrees protecting \u201c \u2018rights fully accrued upon facts so nearly permanent as to be substantially impervious to change\u2019 and decrees [that] involv[e] \u2018the supervision of changing conduct or conditions and are thus provisional and tentative.\u2019. . . <em>Swift </em>illustrates the former and <em>Rufo </em>the latter. We view this not as a limited dualism but as polar opposites of a continuum . . . .\u201d The Federal rule 60(b)(5), the court in <em>Alexis Lichine &amp; Cie. </em>stated, \u201csets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>forth the umbrella concept of \u2018equitable\u2019 that both <em>Swift </em>and <em>Rufo </em>apply to particular, widely disparate fact situations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">We draw on the foregoing principles to reach our conclusion that the standard for determining whether prospective relief from a c. 209A order is warranted must be a flexible one. The level of impact on the underlying risk from harm that a c. 209A order seeks to protect against will vary from case to case; a flexible approach that incorporates the \u201ccontinuum\u201d paradigm set out in <em>Alexis Lichine &amp; Cie., </em>supra, is necessary to enable a court to deal effectively with the myriad circumstances that may arise during the pendency of an abuse prevention order. A request to modify a provision of the order that bears only tangentially on the safety of the protected party (e.g., certain orders for visitation or support) will fall at one end of the continuum, whereas a defendant\u2019s request to terminate an abuse prevention order <em>in its entirety </em>will fall at the other end. The greater the likelihood that the safety of the protected party may be put at risk by a modification, the more substantial the showing the party seeking relief must make.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">In deciding whether to grant or deny a party\u2019s request for relief, the basis on which the order was initially issued is not subject to review or attack. Rather, the court must consider the nature of the relief sought keeping in mind the primary purpose of a c. 209A order: to protect a party from harm or the fear of imminent serious harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The husband\u2019s claims amounted to a collateral attack on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>abuse prevention order that, at least for the one-year period of its duration, was final. Such an abuse prevention order, entered after a hearing that satisfies due process requirements, see, e.g., <em>C.O. </em>v. <em>M.M., </em>442 Mass. at 656-659, should be set aside only in the most extraordinary circumstances and where it has been clearly and convincingly established that the order is no longer needed to protect the victim from harm or the reasonable fear of serious harm.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Furthermore, if the judge determines that it is appropriate to allow a motion to vacate or terminate a c. 209A order, the decision should be supported by findings of fact. Cf. <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. at 356 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Taking as true the admissible averments of fact in the husband\u2019s verified motion, the evidence that the wife might have acquiesced in some contact with the husband (occasioned, in large part, by the unusual circumstance of the husband\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral) does not suffice to meet the husband\u2019s heavy burden of demonstrating that the order was no longer needed to protect the wife. Whether measured against a clear and convincing standard of proof, or proof by some lesser standard,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the evidence was insufficient to establish that the order was no longer needed to protect the former wife from harm or reasonable fear of serious harm, and it was therefore error to terminate the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">3. <em>The remedy. </em>As we have stated, the abuse prevention order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>issued against the husband was to expire on January 3, 2003. Had the order not been vacated (erroneously) on July 11, 2002, the wife would have had the opportunity to seek an extension of the,order on the date it was set to expire upon a showing of \u201ccontinued need\u201d for the order and without a showing of new abuse. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3; <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 929, 929 (1999); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 889. She should be afforded the same opportunity now.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The order allowing the motion to reconsider and vacate the abuse prevention order is reversed. The wife may, within thirty days of the issuance of the rescript, seek a new order under c. 209A, the issuance of which shall be dependent upon the wife\u2019s sustaining her burden of demonstrating a continued need for the order. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 889-890. The judge may consider evidence subsequent to January 3, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-10\">We accept as fact the wife\u2019s averments in her affidavit, including that the husband had kicked and hit her, pulled her hair, and threatened to kill her if she attempted to \u201cget anything\u201d through separation or divorce or if she divulged to the court certain information concerning the parties\u2019 finances, and that she was terrified of the husband and feared for her life. This is because there were no contrary findings made in connection with the issuance of the c. 209A order, which ordered the husband (1) not to abuse the wife; (2) to have no contact with the wife, in person, by telephone, in writing, or otherwise, and to stay at least fifty yards away from her \u201ceven if the [wife] seems to allow or request contact\u201d; and (3) to surrender any guns or licenses to the local police department because \u201c[t]here is a substantial likelihood of immediate danger of abuse.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b801-6\">More specifically, the husband averred that he and the wife had engaged in numerous conversations which included both \u201cchit chat\u201d and discussions concerning the parties\u2019 pets (all of whom were in the husband\u2019s care and needed medical attention) and various civil litigation matters in which the parties were involved. The husband also averred that following the death of his mother in Los Angeles on May 15, 2002, the wife asked him if she could attend the funeral and proposed that they fly to California together; between May 18 and May 25, 2002, while in Los Angeles, he and the wife spent time alone (attending a movie and riding in an automobile) and with others (including at his mother\u2019s memorial service, burial, and a reception), often at the wife\u2019s request; he had dinner with the wife and his sister on May 19, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-7\">In her opposition, the wife denied or otherwise challenged the husband\u2019s averments or his characterizations of events and stated that she continued to be in fear of him. She said, among other things, that she had not voluntarily initiated contact with the husband other than to check on the medical condition of the parties\u2019 pets. As for the trip to Los Angeles following the death of the husband\u2019s mother, the wife stated that upon receiving an invitation from the husband to attend the services, she consulted with the husband\u2019s sister, brother-in-law, and father, who invited her to attend, as they considered her to be part of the family. The husband\u2019s family also assured the wife that steps would be taken to ensure her safety. This included paying for a separate flight for her to attend the funeral; arranging for the husband to stay at a hotel while she stayed with members of the husband\u2019s family; and attempting to keep the parties separated as much as possible within the circumstances of attending the funeral and related family events. Continuing, the wife stated that there were only two occasions when she was physically alone with the husband (at a movie she had planned to attend with the husband\u2019s sister, who backed out at the last moment, and during an automobile ride after the husband\u2019s sister sent the husband to pick her up) and that on neither occasion did she choose to be alone with him. The wife said that she was in fear of the husband during the movie and was afraid that the husband would harm her during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>automobile ride because he blamed her for getting lost, drove at high rates of speed, and raised his voice at her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">In her affidavit, the husband\u2019s sister stated that the wife did not wish to be alone with the husband when she arrived in Los Angeles, that the wife asked that the husband be put up in a hotel so that he would not be in the same home with her, that the wife was \u201cshaken\u201d and \u201cupset\u201d after the two instances she was alone with the husband, and that she (the husband\u2019s sister) made sure that the wife was not alone with the husband during the remainder of the wife\u2019s stay. In addition, the husband\u2019s sister stated that, in her view, the wife\u2019s fears for her safety if the restraining order were lifted were \u201cnot unfounded.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b802-9\">During the hearing the judge posed the following questions, which may provide some insight into the bases for the judge\u2019s decision: \u201cWhat does [the wife] say about the California trip?\u201d and \u201cDid she in fact go out to dinner with him and to the movies?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b802-10\">No argument is raised that the present case is moot. See generally <em>Matter of Sturtz, </em>410 Mass. 58, 59 (1991) (courts will not, ordinarily, decide moot cases). In any event, we do not consider the matter to be moot, as the wife continues to have a personal stake in the outcome on appeal. Although, in theory, it remains open to the wife to apply for a new c. 209A order, that alternative is not fully equivalent to our review of the judge\u2019s order vacating the order that previously protected her.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">The standard for extending a c. 209A order does not require a showing of new abuse. See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7 3; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 776, 778 (2003). See also <em>Rauseo </em>v. <em>Rauseo, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 913 (2001) (\u201c[a]t a hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s request for an extension of an order ... the plaintiff is not required to re-establish facts sufficient to support that initial grant of an abuse prevention order\u201d). Were the wife to apply anew without the support of further incidents of abuse (and without the benefit of an appellate court decision concluding that the prior order should not have been vacated), a judge acting on her application would quite possibly feel bound by the findings implicit in the vacating of the prior order, that then-existing evidence did not warrant continuing it. Moreover, although relief on an initial c. 209A complaint is limited to one year, \u201cat a renewal hearing, a judge\u2019s discretion is broad.\u201d <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Macklin, </em>430 Mass. 633, 635 (2000) (permanent order may issue at renewal hearing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-6\">See, e.g., G.

See G. L. c. 209A, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 3B. As two leading commentators have observed: \u201cIn terms of the relief available under the Abuse Prevention Act the statute is sui generis.

See note 1, <em>supra. </em>We reiterate, however, that in proceedings to vacate, terminate, or modify a c. 209A order, the nonmoving party has no burden to establish the basis for the issuance of the underlying order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Although our analysis indicates that a lesser burden may be imposed upon a defendant seeking to modify certain provisions of an abuse prevention order rather than to have it terminated, we do not intend to suggest that such applications to modify should be routine. While we recognize that some situations may warrant adjustments to the order due to changed circumstances, see note 19, <em>supra, </em>the opportunity to modify an order may not be abused. Unwarranted requests to modify may themselves be a form of abuse and create a burden on the courts as well as on the opposing party.
