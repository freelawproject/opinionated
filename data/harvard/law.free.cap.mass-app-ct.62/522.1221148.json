Delaney on November 21, 1997, has priority \u201cto the amount of $30,000, and no more,\u201d over the mortgage deed to the same property granted by Delaney to Gerrity Company, Incorporated (Gerrity), and recorded on May 19, 1998. Gerrity cross-appeals from so much of the judgment that declares that the Moores\u2019 mortgage has priority in the amount of $30,000. All the arguments before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>us concern the question of Gerrity\u2019s knowledge of Delaney\u2019s transactions with the Moores. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The Moores negotiated with Delaney for the purchase of property situated at 2-4 Wintergreen Farm Road in Pembroke and for the construction of a house to be built by him on that site. The price set out in their original purchase and sale agreement for the land and house was $311,000. The Moores gave Delaney $200,000 as a down payment, and Delaney executed a mortgage in favor of the Moores for that amount as security for their deposit. Although Robert W. Galvin (Robert W), an attorney with the law firm of Galvin &amp; Galvin (Galvin) notarized Delaney\u2019s signature, he did not read the mortgage; the mortgage was not recorded by either Delaney or Robert W. (unrecorded mortgage).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">During the time of the negotiations between Delaney and the Moores, Delaney was experiencing financial difficulties that led him to seek additional financing from Compass Bank for Savings (Compass), also the Moores\u2019 choice of lending institution for the financing of their new home. However, Compass refused to extend a loan to Delaney, partly because of the fact that the large amount of the down payment made by the Moores was deemed sufficient to cover the cost of the construction of their house.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Delaney then sought financing from Gerrity, a commercial lending institution. In support of his loan application, Delaney provided a purchase and sale agreement from the Moores that he had altered to reflect that the purchase price for the land and construction of a house thereon was $359,900, and that the Moores had provided a down payment in the amount of $30,000, to be secured by a mortgage. Delaney did not provide Gerrity with a copy of the mortgage. Gerrity\u2019s agent, Peter Young, reviewed the paperwork on Delaney\u2019s loan application, which included a copy of the altered purchase and sale agreement, and retained Galvin for the purpose of checking the Plymouth County registry of deeds to ascertain whether there were any prior liens on the property. Although a title search revealed that there were some workmen\u2019s liens, there was nothing to reflect a mortgage in the Moores\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">In May of 1998, Gerrity granted Delaney the requested loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>on the condition that he execute a mortgage on the property in favor of Gerrity with priority over all other liens and mortgages. Acting as Delaney\u2019s attorney, Galvin negotiated with his creditors concerning Gerrity\u2019s priority and recorded a mortgage on the property in favor of Gerrity in the amount of $251,000. Gerrity then advanced Delaney $182,750.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Due to the failure of the sale of the property to occur and after notice of Delaney\u2019s financial difficulties, the Moores, in early 1999, investigated and discovered that their 1997 mortgage had not been recorded. Attempting to rectify the situation and protect themselves, the Moores recorded their mortgage on February 5, 1999. About seven months later, Delaney was indicted by a grand jury and, on November 30, 2000, pleaded guilty to forgery, uttering, and larceny. The Moores then brought this action seeking to establish the priority of their mortgage, and Gerrity counterclaimed for the full value of its mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">2. <em>The Moores\u2019 appeal. </em>General Laws c. 183, \u00a7 4, makes clear that \u201can unrecorded mortgage is invalid as against third parties who do not have \u2018actual notice\u2019 of it.\u201d <em>Tramontozzi </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amicis, </em>344 Mass. 514, 517 (1962). Because the Moores claim that their unrecorded mortgage had priority over Gerrity\u2019s, they have the \u201cburden of proving that [Gerrity] had actual notice of\u201d their earlier mortgage. <em>Ibid. </em>In support of their contention that they met their burden of proving that Gerrity had actual notice of the unrecorded mortgage, the Moores make two arguments: (1) the $30,000 mortgage note referred to in the altered purchase and sale agreement that Delaney provided to Gerrity was sufficient to establish that Gerrity had notice of the unrecorded mortgage; and (2) Galvin\u2019s actual knowledge of the prior unrecorded mortgage must be imputed to Gerrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">a. <em>Knowledge provided by the purchase and sale agreement. </em>The altered purchase and sale agreement made reference to a down payment in the amount of $30,000, which was to be the subject of a mortgage. On that basis, the Moores argue that when Young, Gerrity\u2019s agent, reviewed the chain of title at the registry of deeds and did not find the mortgage referred to in the purchase and sale agreement, he should have inquired of the Moores about the referenced mortgage. Put another way, the Moores argue that Gerrity\u2019s knowledge of the reference in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>purchase and sale agreement to a mortgage, standing alone, was sufficient to establish the priority of their mortgage. See <em>Connihan </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>111 Mass. 270, 271 (1873) (\u201c[n]otice or knowledge of the existence and of the terms of an agreement for the sale of land is . . . sufficient to prevent one who has it from acquiring rights in fraud of that agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The unrecorded mortgage cannot bind persons who are without actual notice of the facts therein recited. \u201cKnowledge of facts which would ordinarily put a party upon inquiry is not enough.\u201d <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>301 Mass. 125, 128 (1938). See <em>Tramontozzi </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amicis, </em>344 Mass. at 517; <em>General Builders Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Arlington Co-op. Bank, </em>359 Mass. 691, 697 (1971). Gerrity had no obligation to go beyond the registry record and make inquiry of the Moores about any reference in the purchase and sale agreement. Consequently, Gerrity cannot be charged with \u201cactual notice\u201d of the terms of the unrecorded mortgage referred to in the altered purchase and sale agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">b. <em>Galvin\u2019s knowledge imputed to Gerrity. </em>Robert W. and Robert E. Galvin (Robert E.) represented Delaney and Gerrity in one transaction while Robert E. represented Compass in another. More specifically, Robert W. notarized Delaney\u2019s signature on the Moores\u2019 $200,000 mortgage while Robert E. received a copy of the parties\u2019 purchase and sale agreement during Galvin\u2019s representation of Compass on the Moores\u2019 application to Compass for financing of their purchase of the property from Delaney. Robert E. also performed a title search of the property for Gerrity in respect to Gerrity\u2019s subsequent loan to Delaney. The sole questions now before us are whether, at the time Gerrity retained Robert E. in May, 1998, to perform a title search of the property in question for purposes of deciding whether it would extend a loan to Delaney, Robert W. had knowledge of the contents of the unrecorded mortgage and, if so, whether that knowledge could be imputed to Robert E. and then to Gerrity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Hintlian, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 805 (1976) (\u201cattorney\u2019s knowledge was properly imputed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>[client]\u201d). Cf. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>James, </em>280 Mass. 43, 47 (1932); <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>359 Mass. 711, 717 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The Moores\u2019 claim of imputed knowledge fails. In the first instance, Robert W. was not retained by Delaney for the purpose of conducting a title search. Robert W. did no more than notarize Delaney\u2019s signature on the unrecorded mortgage. Moreover, the trial judge expressly found that in notarizing Delaney\u2019s signature, Robert W. did not read the mortgage above the signature line. That being so, Robert W. had no knowledge about the unrecorded mortgage that could be imputed to Robert E. and, therefore, to Gerrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">3. <em>Gerrity\u2019s cross appeal. </em>Because the altered purchase, and sale agreement, which made reference to a mortgage in favor of the Moores in the amount of $30,000, was never recorded, Gerrity argues that the judge erred in subordinating its mortgage in that amount while also recognizing the priority of its mortgage over that of the Moores\u2019 unrecorded mortgage in the amount of $200,000. We think Gerrity\u2019s argument misconstrues the purpose and scope of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 4, that is, to allow persons without actual knowledge to the contrary to rely upon registry records. See <em>General Builders Supply </em>v. <em>Arlington Co-op. Bank, </em>359 Mass. at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">While Gerrity had no actual knowledge of the unrecorded $200,000 mortgage, it did have actual knowledge of the altered purchase and sale agreement between Delaney and the Moores. However, the alteration pertained only to the amount of the purchase price and the Moores\u2019 down payment. The provision setting out the fact that the down payment was to be secured by a mortgage remained unchanged by Delaney. Because Gerrity had actual knowledge of the existence of the $30,000 mortgage referenced in the altered purchase and sale agreement, we conclude that the fact that the purchase and sale agreement was unrecorded is irrelevant. There is nothing in <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>301 Mass. at 128-129; <em>Tramontozzi </em>v. <em>D\u2019Amicis, </em>344 Mass. at 517; or <em>General Builders Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Arlington Co-op. Bank, </em>359 Mass. at 697, that mandates that we conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">If either the Moores or Gerrity have any potential and possibly interesting claims against Galvin because of Robert W.\u2019s and Robert E.\u2019s various roles in representing Delaney, Compass, and Gerrity, such claims are not made a part of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
