L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5)?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Here, the employee\u2019s claim was ultimately denied and dismissed, after de nova evidentiary hearings before a Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) administrative judge, on the ground that the employee had failed to prove he had actually sustained a corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>pensable industrial injury as alleged (falling off a two-story roof and being thereafter unable to work because of back pain). At the same time, the administrative judge rejected as unproven the complaint by the workers' compensation insurer, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, that the employee's claim was fraudulent under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 14(2) (the insurer asserting that the employee had fabricated or staged the supposed accident).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">On both parties\u2019 administrative appeals, the reviewing board summarily affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s denial of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. A majority of the three-person board, however, while \u201cacknowledging] it as a close call,\u201d upheld the employee\u2019s contention that the administrative judge committed error in failing to award him a \u00a7 13A(5) attorney\u2019s fee for \u201cprevailing\u201d against the insurer\u2019s fraud complaint, a conclusion the dissenting member thought contrary to DIA regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Procedural facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The employee, Craig M. Richards, filed a claim with the insurer shortly after he reported that on May 10, 1996, he had fallen from a two-story roof as he attempted to climb down a ladder from the roof while on an inspection for his employer, Ultimate Chimney Sweep. The accident left him, he contended, with constant back pain and totally unable to work. The insurer proceeded to pay him benefits from May 11, 1996, through October 10, 1996, when it terminated payments on the ground that an impartial medical examiner had released him to perform light work. The employee then filed a claim for continuing benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34 (temporary, total incapacity), from October 10, 1996, which the insurer denied. Following a conference before the administrative judge in early February, 1997, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, during which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the insurer first raised the issue of the employee\u2019s fraudulent staging of the incident, the administrative judge awarded the employee \u00a7 34 benefits<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from May 10, 1996, to November 18, 1996, and also ordered the payment of \u00a7 35 (partial incapacity) benefits<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from and after November 19, 1996.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">Both the employee and the insurer appealed the conference order, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 10A(3) and 11, the employee seeking additional compensation and medical benefits and the insurer reiterating its complaints that benefits should be discontinued because no compensable injury had occurred and that the employee had committed \u00a7 14(2) fraud.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">On February 25, 1999, after three days of evidentiary hearings, the administrative judge did not credit the employee\u2019s testimony regarding his claim, and concluded that the employee had failed to establish that he had \u201csustained an industrial injury on May 10, 1996\u201d; moreover, notwithstanding the questionable nature of the employee\u2019s claim,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the administrative judge was \u201cnot persuaded that there [was] a \u00a7 14 violation by\u201d the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Appealing to the reviewing board (see G. L .c. 152, \u00a7 11C), the employee attacked the administrative judge\u2019s wholesale denial of his claim as arbitrary, capricious, and lacking in evidentiary support, and faulted the administrative judge for not awarding him attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 13A, on the grounds that \u201cthe Insurer\u2019s claim for fraud against the employee was denied\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>and \u201cthe Insurer was seeking money back and the employee was allowed to keep that money [and therefore] prevailed on retaining benefits sought to be returned.\u201d (But see note 7, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The insurer cross-appealed, relying on the evidence in the record and the administrative judge\u2019s unchallengeable credibility determinations to support the denial of the employee\u2019s claim for benefits. As to the attorney\u2019s fee issue, the insurer contended that an employee \u201cprevails\u201d only when an administrative judge orders compensation or does not discontinue previously ordered benefits, neither of which occurred here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The insurer did not respond to, much less dispute, the employee\u2019s assertion that he had prevailed by being allowed to retain the benefits he had previously received and which the insurer had \u201csought to be returned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Because the administrative judge\u2019s denial and dismissal of the employee\u2019s claim for benefits had been grounded on credibility findings supported by the evidence, the reviewing board summarily affirmed that aspect of the administrative judge\u2019s decision. The reviewing board was divided, two to one, however, on the attorney\u2019s fee issue. The majority relied on recent administrative precedent for the principle that an employee who successfully defends against an insurer\u2019s claim of \u00a7 14(2) fraud has prevailed by avoiding the imposition of thousands of dollars of costs and penalties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority saw support for this principle in judicial authority pronouncing the general proposition that an employee prevails if he succeeds on any significant litigation issue, thereby achieving some of the benefit sought in the controversy. (See discussion of this authority, <em>infra.) </em>The majority also perceptively noted that interpreting \u00a7 13A so as to deny a fee in these circumstances would be irrational and implicate issues under the equal protection guarantees of the Massachusetts and United States Constitutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>that would be avoided by applying the appropriate statute and regulation. Cf. <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Indus. Accidents, </em>421 Mass. 70, 72-73 (1995) (constitutional questions are not be reached if the issue can be resolved by statutory interpretation). It ordered the case recommitted to the administrative judge for assessment of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The dissenting member of the reviewing board agreed with the insurer, deeming a fee clearly precluded in this case by the language of 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (see note 9, <em>supra), </em>and finding support for denial of a fee in other judicial authority supposedly so construing the regulation (see note 14, <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The insurer has appealed to this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12(2),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> solely on the issue of the propriety of the attorney\u2019s fee award. On the statute and the particular facts presented, we do not view the issue as a close call and affirm the reviewing board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>As always, \u201cthe statutory language itself,\u201d <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 255 (1994), quoting from <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977), is our fundamental starting point in attempting to ascertain the intent of the Legislature when the meaning or application of one of its statutes is at issue. As we recently stated: \u201c \u2018Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to the legislative intent\u2019 . . . and \u2018the courts [will] enforce the statute according to its [plain] wording\u2019. . . . [W]hen a statute speaks with clarity to an issue[,] judicial inquiry . . . , in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished . . . [and] \u2018we need not look beyond the words of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Martha\u2019s Vineyard Land Bank Commn. </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors of W. Tisbury, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27-28 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), plainly and unambiguously provides for an attorney\u2019s fee award in two distinct scenarios (see note 1, <em>supra): </em>\u201c[w]henever an insurer [a] files a complaint <em>or </em>[b] contests a claim for benefits\u201d (emphasis added) and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>employee prevails against the complaint or contest. Here, the insurer indisputably filed a \u00a7 14 fraud complaint<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> against the employee, in addition to a complaint (alleging the employee had not suffered a compensable injury) that contested his claim for benefits. The employee unquestionably prevailed with respect to the \u00a7 14 fraud complaint, achieving (in the words of the reviewing board majority) \u201can unequivocal and unambiguous success\u201d against that complaint. No further analysis is required under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Were any ambiguity detectable in the application of \u00a7 13A(5), however, the reviewing board\u2019s interpretation of that statute to mandate an attorney\u2019s fee award to an employee when an insurer\u2019s fraud complaint against the employee is defeated \u2014 an interpretation that \u201cis entitled to [our] substantial deference,\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), and to \u201cgreat weight\u201d on appeal, <em>Gonzalez\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 39, 41 (1996) \u2014 would resolve it. The reviewing board noted the contrast between the generality of the term \u201ccomplaint\u201d in \u00a7 13A(5) (applicable to \u00a7 11 hearings) and the specificity of the term as used in \u00a7 13A(4) (applicable to conferences).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The reviewing board also refused to apply 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) so literally as to restrict and contradict the scope and generality of the plain language of the statute and properly held that regulation inapplicable to cases such as this,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>insurer seeks but fails to achieve substantial penalties against the employee.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The reviewing board was additionally correct in finding support for its fee decision in the general principle set forth in our decisions in <em>Connolly\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 35, 38 (1996), and <em>Cruz\u2019s Case, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 26, 28 (2001) (\u201cIn worker\u2019s compensation cases . . . the employee is considered the prevailer if he \u2018succeeds on any significant litigation issue, achieving \u201csome of the benefit\u201d sought in the controversy\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Accord <em>Conroy\u2019s Case, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 268, 273-274 (2004). Cf. <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 684, 687 (1985) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>(G. L. c. 152 should be construed whenever possible in favor of employees). The reviewing board accurately described \u201cthe denial of the insurer\u2019s \u00a7 14 fraud complaint [as] an unequivocal and unambiguous success on a significant litigation issue,\u201d because, \u201c \u2018[i]f the employee\u2019s avoiding thousands of dollars of costs and penalties and criminal prosecution is not \u201csome of the benefit\u201d sought in the controversy,\u2019 we do not know what is.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Although it is unnecessary to our analysis, we note that the reviewing board\u2019s common-sense view of what \u201cprevailing\u201d encompasses would apply here, a fortiori, because the employee\u2019s actual success surpassed the mere avoidance of \u00a7 14 consequences, in so far as the administrative judge did not order refund or repayment of the substantial monetary benefits the employee had received pursuant to the award made by the February, 1997, conference order (cf. <em>Conroy\u2019s Case, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. at 277); the insurer never sought or obtained a recoupment order pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3); and the insurer has since lost the ability to seek recoupment of those payments.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the reviewing board dated August 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever an insurer files a complaint or contests a claim for benefits and ... the employee prevails at [a] hearing [pursuant to c. 152, \u00a7 11,] the insurer shall pay a fee to the employee\u2019s attorney in an amount equal to three thousand five hundred dollars plus necessary expenses.

Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) (1992), which states in relevant part: \u201cIn any proceeding before [an administrative judge], the claimant shall be deemed to have prevailed, for the purpose of M. G.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 10(1), provides that proceedings within the division of dispute resolution are commenced \u201con the receipt of a claim for compensation, [or] a complaint from the insurer requesting a modification of discontinuance of benefits, <em>or a complaint from any party requesting resolution of any other issue arising under this chapter </em>....\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Whereas \u00a7 13A(5) speaks generally (\u201c[w]henever an insurer files a complaint\u201d), \u00a7 13A(4) is of more restrictive scope (\u201c[w]henever an insurer files a complaint <em>to reduce or discontinue an employee\u2019s benefits\u201d </em>[emphasis added]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The reviewing board\u2019s discretionary authority to hold a contradictory regulation inapplicable to proceedings such as this is expressly granted by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 5. See <em>Corriveau </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 925-926 (1997). Cf. <em>LaRoche </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 419, 420-421 (2002) (a rule or regulation may not override a statute). The dissenting member\u2019s reliance on this court\u2019s ruling in <em>Gonzalez\u2019s Case, </em>41 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Ct. 39 (1996), for the proposition that 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.19(4) governs all meanings of \u201cprevail\u201d as used in \u00a7 13A(5), was misplaced, because, unlike the employee here \u2014 who was the beneficiary of a conference award of benefits ultimately totaling over $30,000 \u2014 <em>Gonzalez </em>was a case \u201cwhere no worker\u2019s compensation [benefits] ha[d] been ordered [or received] at any stage of the statutory proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. The reviewing board\u2019s decision in this case, in conjunction with that in <em>Talbot </em>(see note 10, <em>supra), </em>can be viewed as establishing administrative policy by adjudicatory proceedings which effectively restricts the reach of \u00a7 1.19(4) to cases involving ordinary compensation claims and discontinuance complaints. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Util., </em>383 Mass. 675, 679 (1981); <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co., </em>v. <em>Department of Telecommunications &amp; Energy, </em>440 Mass. 625, 635-636 (2004). We further note the contrast between the nonexclusive language of \u00a7 1.19(4) (\u201cthe claimant shall be deemed to have prevailed . . . when\u201d), and other sections of the regulations (e.g., <em>\u201cAction against a Third Person </em>as used in M. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 41, <em>shall be limited </em>to\u201d certain types of actions; <em>\u201cCash Award </em>as used in M. G. L. 152, \u00a7 13A[10], <em>shall </em>mean\u201d certain specifically enumerated forms of benefits; <em>\u201cHearing </em>as used in M. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A[2], <em>shall be restricted to\u201d </em>certain proceedings, all in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 [emphasis added]), which demonstrate that the commissioner of the DIA knew how to narrow and make precise the scope and meaning of terms used in DIA regulations (see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 5) when he so intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b737-6\">See, for collateral confirmatory principles, <em>Davey Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc., </em>351 Mass. 59, 63 (1966) (statutes imposing fines or penalties are to be construed strictly and not extended by implication); <em>Massachusetts Auto Body Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>409 Mass. 770, 781 (1991) (\u201can agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule is entitled to deference.
