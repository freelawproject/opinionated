L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 42, from a District Court decision upholding the determination of the Division of Employment and Training (DET) that the plaintiff, Ashok K. Gupta, was ineligible to collect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>unemployment compensation benefits under G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), because he had been discharged for having engaged in \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of [his employer\u2019s] interest.\u201d Gupta contends that (1) the DET erred as matter of law when it disqualified him for benefits based on the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d prong of \u00a7 25(e)(2), because his employer had expressly discharged him for a \u201cwork rule violation,\u201d the alternative basis for ineligibility under \u00a7 25(e)(2); and (2) even if it was proper to deny him unemployment benefits on the ground of \u201cdeliberate misconduct,\u201d the DET\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and was additionally erroneous because the review examiner used an \u201cobjective\u201d rather than a \u201csubjective\u201d standard to determine his state of mind. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><em>Background.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Gupta, a native of India, was employed at Lightbridge, Inc. (Lightbridge), as a credit analyst from November 10, 1999, until his discharge on August 20, 2001. Lightbridge operates a telephone call center where sellers of cellular telephones (dealers) obtain credit checks on prospective customers. Gupta\u2019s responsibilities included answering calls from dealers and running credit checks. Lightbridge\u2019s customer service procedures set forth the company\u2019s expectations of its employees\u2019 behavior in handling dealer phone calls. The procedure at issue here explicitly states that \u201c[a]ny incidences, i.e. disconnecting calls, not answering calls, unprofessional conduct while on the phone ... or anything that causes an adverse business impact on Lightbridge, Inc. (complaint from client or agent, financial loss or client loss, etc.) may result in corrective action.\u201d Gupta, however, claimed never to have received a copy of these procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Prior to his termination, Gupta had been the subject of two complaints from dealers as a result of their interactions with him. The first incident occurred on December 24, 1999. After a dealer asked Gupta to repeat himself, he replied, \u201c[w]hat do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>you mean I\u2019m speaking to you in English,\u201d and disconnected the call, ignoring the dealer\u2019s request to speak with a supervisor. Gupta received a verbal warning and an \u201cEmployee Corrective Action Form\u201d (corrective action form) in consequence of this complaint, both instructing him to find a supervisor \u201cimmediately no matter the reason\u201d upon request by a dealer and admonishing that he would be subject to disciplinary action for \u201c[a]ny further infractions of this or any other company policy.\u201d Gupta signed the corrective action form, acknowledging that the situation had been reviewed with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">The second warning came on January 3, 2000, after a different dealer called Lightbridge crying and reporting that Gupta had been rude and uncooperative. Gupta was again spoken to and received another corrective action form, which noted that he had already received a verbal warning, that as an analyst he was aware that he was \u201cresponsible for providing polite, friendly and helpful customer service,\u201d and that he knew \u201cto ask for assistance from a Lead [operator] or Supervisor.\u201d This second corrective action form stated that \u201c[a]ny further violations of this company policy or any other company policies will result in additional disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u201d Gupta again signed the form to signify his understanding of Lightbridge\u2019s concerns and expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The incident resulting in Gupta\u2019s termination occurred on August 17, 2001. While on the phone, a dealer referred to Gupta as \u201c[y]ou stupid Indian.\u201d Gupta replied to that statement by declaring, \u201cHold on you idiot.\u201d He then placed the dealer on hold and attempted to locate a supervisor. Unable to find a supervisor, he returned to the call, but it had been disconnected. A short time later, the same dealer called again, but upon hearing Gupta\u2019s voice the dealer said, \u201cJesus,\u201d and hung up. Gupta\u2019s conduct on this occasion caused Lightbridge to suffer financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>Under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, the District Court, as well as this court, is obliged to give due weight to the DET\u2019s experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in applying the law to the circumstances of the case, must accept findings of the DET review examiner that were supported by substantial evidence, and must affirm conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>not shown to be infected by error of law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7); <em>Keough </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>370 Mass. 1, 3-5 (1976); <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. 94, 96 (1979). In determining whether the agency\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, a reviewing court is highly deferential to the agency. <em>Hotchkiss </em>v. <em>State Racing Commn., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 695 (1998). To satisfy the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement, the agency\u2019s conclusion need not be based upon the \u201cclear weight\u201d of the evidence or even a preponderance of the evidence, but rather only upon reasonable evidence, that is, \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Lisbon </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 257 (1996), quoting from G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1(6). We have no difficulty affirming the District Court and DET determinations under those circumscribed appellate standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>The DET\u2019s alleged error of law. </em>By letter dated August 20, 2001, Lightbridge terminated Gupta\u2019s employment for his \u201cviolation of the Customer Service Procedures,\u201d referencing his rude behavior to a customer on August 17, 2001. Although the DET review examiner found that \u201cthe employer failed to present substantial and credible evidence to show that the claimant\u2019s discharge was due to a knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced policy or rule\u201d (because he accepted Gupta\u2019s claim never to have been given a copy of those policies), he nonetheless concluded that Lightbridge had sustained its burden of producing substantial evidence establishing that Gupta had engaged in \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard\u201d of Lightbridge\u2019s interest. While not alleging any surprise or procedural unfairness in the DET\u2019s reaching that conclusion, Gupta argues that it was nonetheless legal error to find him ineligible for unemployment benefits based on the \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d prong of G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when Light-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>bridge had said it had discharged him for a knowing work role violation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">General Laws c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), as amended by St. 1992, c. 26, \u00a7 19, clearly and expressly provides alternative bases for denial of unemployment benefits: either (a) where an employee\u2019s termination was the result of \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest,\u201d or (b) when termination resulted from \u201ca knowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced role or policy of the employer.\u201d See <em>Eastern Mass. St. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>350 Mass. 340, 343 (1966); <em>Massachusetts Broken Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>430 Mass. 637, 640 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The DET correctly interpreted the inclusion of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in G. L. c. 151 A, \u00a7 25(e)(2), to mean that Gupta would be ineligible to receive unemployment benefits if substantial and credible evidence presented by the employer established that the conduct that resulted in his discharge was <em>either </em>\u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d <em>or </em>a \u201cknowing violation\u201d of a company role. See <em>Tri-County Youth Programs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Acting Deputy Director of the Div. of the Employment &amp; Training, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 405, 408 (2002) (\u201cAs to interpretation of statutes governing the [DET], we defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute within which it operates\u201d). That interpretation is particularly apt in light of the Legislature\u2019s intent, when it promulgated the two-pronged disqualification provision in 1992, to \u201cbroaden the grounds for benefit disqualification,\u201d <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. 805, 811 (1996), and its intent generally \u201cto deny benefits to a claimant who has brought about his own unemployment through intentional disregard of standards of behavior which his employer has a right to expect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810, quoting from <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Gupta argues (without benefit of Massachusetts authority) that the DET review examiner was legally precluded from denying him unemployment benefits because Lightbridge failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>support its original justification for his termination \u2014 a knowing violation of a company procedure \u2014 with substantial evidence. We deem such artificial parsing of the proceeding unmeritorious when substantial evidence in the record established that the identical acts causing his termination also constituted deliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>375 Mass. 434, 437-438 (1978); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Deputy Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 228-229 (2003). See also <em>Hickey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 259, 263 (1995) (a correct administrative agency decision may be sustained on appeal on any sound ground supported by the record). The DET did not err as matter of law in holding Gupta to be ineligible for unemployment compensation based upon the very same misbehavior that had precipitated his discharge, i.e., his rude and discourteous behavior toward a customer, in disregard of prior warnings, that caused his employer a financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><em>The DET\u2019s finding of \u201cdeliberate misconduct.\u201d </em>Gupta complains that the DET\u2019s denial of his unemployment benefits was not only unsupported by substantial evidence but also improper because the review examiner used an \u201cobjective,\u201d rather than the proper \u201csubjective,\u201d test to determine his state of mind. Both arguments are without merit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201cWhen a discharged worker seeks [unemployment benefits], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the issue before the board is not whether the employer was justified in discharging the claimant but whether the Legislature intended that benefits should be denied in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. at 95. See <em>Cantres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>396 Mass. 226, 228 (1985); <em>South Cent. Rehabilitative Resources, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 180, 184 (2002). The phrase \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard of the employing unit\u2019s interest\u201d has been interpreted to cover any \u201cintentional conduct or inaction which the employee knew was contrary to the employer\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. at 810, quoting from <em>Goodridge </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>375 Mass. at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The denial of benefits is dependent upon proof of \u201cthe claimant\u2019s state of mind in performing the acts that caused his discharge.\u201d <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. at 97. See <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. at 810. To disqualify the employee from the receipt of benefits, the employer has the burden to present substantial evidence demonstrating both \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d and \u201cwilful disregard\u201d of the employer\u2019s interest. <em>Ibid. </em>The employee\u2019s state of mind at the time of the misconduct is an issue in both parts of the requisite analysis. <em>Ibid. </em>In ascertaining the employee\u2019s state of mind from all the facts and circumstances in the case (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>a reviewing tribunal must focus on \u201cthe worker\u2019s knowledge of the employer\u2019s expectation, the reasonableness of that expectation and the presence of any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>387 Mass. 776, 780 (1982), quoting from <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. at 97. In short, it must be determined whether substantial evidence supported the inferences that Gupta intended to and did disobey a direct order from Lightbridge and, if so, whether he knew or should have known that his prohibited conduct would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tolerated. See <em>Torres </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, supra </em>at 781. On this record, substantial evidence supported such inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The record before the review examiner established that, by the time of the August 17 incident, Gupta had twice been reprimanded for rude and inappropriate behavior toward dealers, conduct that Lightbridge considered to be in violation of its policy that employees be invariably polite and courteous to all callers. He had received both verbal warnings and corrective action forms, each containing references to the inappropriate behavior, to proper procedure, and to punishment for future violations, which he himself signed as an acknowledgment of his understanding. Gupta admitted that he knew it was Light-bridge\u2019s policy for employees to be polite and courteous regardless of the circumstances and that if a caller became abusive, the proper action was to seek a supervisor and transfer the call. Because of Gupta\u2019s conceded knowledge, the DET properly determined that his rude remark and conduct on August 17 constituted \u201cdeliberate misconduct in wilful disregard\u201d of Light-bridge\u2019s interests disqualifying him from unemployment benefits under G.L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Gupta cites to the <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra, </em>to support his claim that the DET did not properly weigh a mitigating factor \u2014 namely, the dealer\u2019s \u201cethnic slur\u201d (\u201cyou stupid Indian\u201d) \u2014 which, he claims, must be viewed as negating his intent to engage in \u201cdeliberate misconduct.\u201d He contends that Lightbridge\u2019s expectation that he and other employees would never be rude to callers was unreasonable in a situation in which an employee is provoked by a caller\u2019s ethnic insult. He argues that his curt response to the dealer \u2014 \u201cHold on you idiot\u201d \u2014 was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>purposeful action, but rather, as in <em>Still, </em>an unintentional, spontaneous, emotional reaction to the insult, so that he could not be found to have to possessed the requisite state of mind for which he could be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Contrary to his argument, the review examiner carefully considered the dealer\u2019s language but found it insufficiently mitigating in the circumstances. Moreover, Gupta\u2019s reliance on <em>Still </em>is not only unavailing but is undermined by that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>423 Mass. at 807, the court considered whether a nurse, who had been discharged for obscenely swearing at a patient in violation of her employer\u2019s stated rule, could be disqualified from receiving benefits under the \u201cknowing violations\u201d prong of G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e)(2). The court determined that because the nurse\u2019s outburst was provoked by the patient\u2019s ugly racial slur after she had been performing her job under extremely stressful circumstances on that day, largely because of that specific patient, she had not \u201cknowingly\u201d violated the employer\u2019s rule, but had emotionally reacted on the spur of the moment without real awareness. <em>Id. </em>at 814-816. The court, however, additionally concluded that \u201cmitigating circumstances alone will not negate a showing of [disqualifying] intent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 815, and was careful to limit the reach of its decision by stating that \u201can employee who violates an employer\u2019s policy by using abusive language, with conscious awareness of the act, and its probable consequences, has committed a \u2018knowing\u2019 violation, regardless of circumstances or prior work history.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court further observed, in language that plainly distinguishes the unique facts in <em>Still </em>from Gupta\u2019s case, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">\u201cif the act occurred in response to provocation, or while the employee was under extreme stress, and the employee had never committed such an act previously, a factfinder might reasonably conclude that the employee had in fact acted unintentionally. Conversely, if the employee had used abusive language previously, and had been warned of the consequences, this might indicate to the factfinder that the latest violation was intentional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">\n<em>Ibid.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>In contrast to the situation in <em>Still, </em>the employer\u2019s evidence here established that Gupta had in fact been insulted and provoked by other callers in the past but had been able to refrain from rude responses in each incident. Furthermore, as noted above, he had on at least two prior occasions engaged in rude behavior toward customers whom he perceived to be insulting and had been notified, verbally and in writing, that such behavior violated Lightbridge\u2019s policy and expectation that all employees were required to treat callers in a courteous and professional manner in all circumstances and could result in termination if repeated. Despite these prior warnings, he responded to a customer\u2019s verbal abuse during the August 17 incident with a rude remark (but also by seeking a supervisor, thereby confirming his recognition of the employer\u2019s policy). The review examiner correctly concluded that, although Gupta had been insulted by the caller, \u201che could easily have averted this situation by putting the caller on hold without the rude remark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">We acknowledge the possibility that there may be circumstances in which a racial or ethnic insult is so vile and provocative that, even if an employer has the right to demand superhuman restraint from the employee who is its target, the employee who responds to it in like fashion would not necessarily be deemed to have engaged in deliberate misconduct or to have acted in wilful disregard of his employer\u2019s interests. Cf. <em>Still </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Employment &amp; Training, supra. </em>Compare G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 74 (unemployment compensation statute is to be construed liberally to achieve its purpose); <em>Howard Bros. Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>333 Mass. 244, 248 (1955) (general purpose of the statute is to pay benefits to \u201cpersons who are out of work . . . through no fault of their own\u201d). This, however, is not such a case. Upon examination of the record before the review examiner, we are persuaded that the DET\u2019s denial of Gupta\u2019s unemployment benefits for having engaged in \u201cdeliberate misconduct\u201d that disregarded (and in fact harmed) his employer\u2019s interest was amply supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The facts set forth herein derive from uncontested findings made by the DET hearing department review examiner in the December 14, 2001, decision denying Gupta unemployment benefits.
