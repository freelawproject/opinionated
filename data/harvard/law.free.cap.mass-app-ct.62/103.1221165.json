Two children were bom of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>At the time of trial, the parties\u2019 primary assets were a general store and the former marital home. The parties opened the general store in April, 1994. Although the husband was instrumental in the \u201cset-up\u201d of the store, and worked there from time to time (as well as at a second store operated briefly by the parties), the wife managed the store throughout the marriage and was primarily responsible for its operation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time of trial, the store provided the wife and children with a gross weekly income of $690, their sole source of support.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>The store had a fair market value of about $145,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The parties purchased the former marital home prior to the marriage, the wife contributing $8,500 to $10,000 and the husband $35,000 toward the purchase of the property. At the time of trial, the house had a fair market value of $240,000 and a mortgage of $182,000 for an equity value of $58,000. Each party also owned a motor vehicle (the wife, a 1999 Ford Expedition with an equity value of $12,100, and the husband, a 1994 minivan worth $1,900) and other assets of nominal value.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On the evidence presented, the judge found that the parties\u2019 total estate was worth $216,900, and concluded that an \u201cequitable division of the estate is Vs to Husband and Vs to Wife.\u201d After adjusting the husband\u2019s one-third share of the estate ($72,300) by $2,800 to take into account assets presently in the husband\u2019s possession, the judge found that the husband was entitled to assets worth $69,500. Continuing, the judge stated in her \u201crationale\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">\u201cWife needs the store to provide for the children. Husband testified he could not earn enough money to pay child support for the children of the ages of eight and five. The children will need support from both parents. The basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>child support order is $50.00 per week, and the youngest child will need support until the age of eighteen. Therefore, I am having Mother retain a portion of Father\u2019s assets to pay that support. The children and Wife need medical insurance, and Husband has that available through his employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">The judge ordered, in paragraph eight of the corrected judgment, that \u201c[u]pan the payment [on or before December 18, 2002,] of $35,000.00 to the Husband by the Wife, [the Wife] shall be the sole owner of the home and business. The remaining $34,500.00, which represents Husband\u2019s one third share of the marital assets,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] shall be retained by the Wife in lieu of thirteen years of child support at $50.00 per week.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge also ordered the husband to provide medical insurance for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">2. <em>The valuation of the marital estate. </em>At oral argument, the husband conceded that the judge\u2019s allocation of the marital assets was fair and equitable, but argued (as he also did in his brief) that the judge erred in calculating the total value of the marital estate. Specifically, the husband asserts that the \u201ctrue value\u201d of the marital assets was $253,164,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cwhen you add the $4,400.00 appropriated by the Wife from the [parties\u2019] joint [checking] account[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] . . . and $31,864.00 she withdrew from the equity in the house for her personal benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The husband appears to assert that his one-third share of the marital assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>(before adjustments) should have been fixed by the judge at $84,388. We fail to discern error.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Contrary to the husband\u2019s assertion in his brief, there is no indication in the record before us that the refinancing proceeds of approximately $31,864 were used \u201cexclusively for [the] wife\u2019s benefit.\u201d Indeed, the husband, through counsel, conceded at oral argument that he could not answer whether the credit card balances were accumulated jointly or individually by the wife, and he appeared to acknowledge subsequently that the automobile loan and credit card balances were joint marital debts. Similarly, the record is devoid of evidence that the $4,400 taken by the wife from the joint checking account was used exclusively for her personal benefit. We note, in addition, that although the wife purchased a sport utility vehicle subsequent to the parties\u2019 separation and her refinancing of the marital home, the wife\u2019s equity in the vehicle at the time of trial, which the judge considered in calculating the value of the marital estate, appears to have been derived from the trade-in value of another vehicle. In the circumstances, and on the argument presented, we cannot say that the judge (who was cognizant that the wife had violated the automatic restraining order established by Rule 411 of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court [2000] by refinancing the home) erred by failing to increase the value of the marital estate by $36,264.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">3. <em>The retention of assets in lieu of child support. </em>The husband argues that the judge erred in (1) fixing his child support obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>tian at $50 per week when he was in \u201cfull compliance\u201d with the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines (guidelines), i.e., that he owed no child support to the wife under the guidelines,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (2) fashioning an order which, essentially, requires him to prepay thirteen years of child support. The husband also asserts that any order that deprives him of his fair share of the marital estate is inequitable. We agree that the provisions of the corrected judgment relating to child support must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">At the outset, the wife, through counsel, suggested at oral argument that the judge\u2019s order concerning the transfer of funds to her in lieu of child support might be viewed as an additional allocation of assets under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34 (taking into account the present and future needs of the children), rather than as child support to be computed strictly under the guidelines. In our view, however, such a position is inconsistent with the judge\u2019s repeated references to \u201cchild support\u201d in her rationale, her stated intention to award the husband one-third of the marital assets, and the reference in her conclusions of law to her authority to secure a spouse\u2019s duty to provide support for minor children.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That said, it is simply unclear how the judge arrived at the \u201cbasic child support order\u201d of $50 per week. That amount, as the husband notes, does not appear to be consistent with the presumptive guidelines support order in this case, particularly when the husband\u2019s court-ordered payment of family group health insurance is taken into account.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge made no finding that the application of the guidelines would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>unjust or inappropriate in this case. See Child Support Guidelines, preamble. In the circumstances, the matter must be remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings on the question of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Although it is possible that a recalculation of child support on remand will obviate the need to consider the possible inclusion of a \u201csecurity\u201d provision in the judgment, we comment on the judge\u2019s order allowing the wife to retain approximately one-half of the husband\u2019s share of the marital assets in lieu of thirteen years of child support. It is settled that a Probate Court judge has \u201cbroad discretion to fashion judgments in divorce proceedings that will best protect the interests and welfare of the parties\u2019 minor children,\u201d see <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>409 Mass. 292, 298-299 (1991); <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, </em>427 Mass. 52, 55 (1998); <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. 182, 190 (1998), and may enter appropriate orders designed to secure a spouse\u2019s duty for future support.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 12-14 &amp; 36 (regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>attachments and security for payment of support). See also <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>409 Mass. at 298-301. Compare <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>425 Mass. 693, 694-696 (1997) (judge may not assign marital property to third persons, even of the marriage). \u201cWhether to enter such orders in a given case, as well as the specific form that any order or orders should take, are matters within the judge\u2019s broad discretion, to be exercised upon consideration of all relevant circumstances.\u201d <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>409 Mass. at 300. See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 83 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In the circumstances presented here, we think the order fashioned by the Probate Court judge does not constitute a reasonable exercise of the judge\u2019s discretion and is inequitable. By providing the wife, in effect, with fifty dollars of weekly child support <em>as well as </em>the present benefit of thirteen years of that support (all without any constraint upon her as to the use of the monies, cf. <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Koon, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 22, 26 n.9 [2004], or apparent contemplation of the possibility of future changes in the parties\u2019 or the children\u2019s circumstances), while effectively reducing the husband\u2019s one-third share of the marital assets<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and depriving him of any interest income which a full assignment of assets might otherwise produce, the judge\u2019s order is distinguishable from, and in our view, traverses the boundaries of, acceptable orders for security (or requests for orders for security) discussed in cases such as <em>Pare, Passemato, </em>and <em>Rosenberg. </em>See note 11, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">4. <em>Summary. </em>Paragraph eight of the corrected judgment of divorce nisi must be vacated and the matter remanded to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings. The question of child support is to be revisited and appropriate orders entered thereon. The probate judge may conduct such further hearings as necessary. Any new order should be supported by findings of fact. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In addition to working at the store sixty to seventy hours per week, the wife undertook substantial home and child care responsibilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-9\">After the parties\u2019 separation, the husband obtained employment as a delivery person for an auto parts company. The husband listed his income at $320 per week on his financial statement, and the judge found that because of the husband\u2019s age (sixty-one years) and \u201ccircumstances\u201d (e.g., limited education and skills) he cannot earn more than $350 to $400 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-10\">On page two of her findings, the Probate Court judge states that the wife contributed $8,500 to the purchase of the marital home, while on page three of the findings, the judge states that the wife contributed $10,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\">As the judge found that the husband\u2019s one-third interest in the marital estate was $72,300, it appears that the judge intended to say \u201cwhich represents [the rest of] [h]usband\u2019s one third share of the marital assets.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As the parties\u2019 younger child was actually six years of age at the time the judgment was originally entered, the judgment provides the child with support beyond the age of eighteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">At oral argument, the husband attempted to augment this sum to include a modest tax refund.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">The judge found that at the time the parties separated, they held a joint checking account containing $4,400. The wife closed the checking account and opened a new account in her name only. There was evidence that the wife closed the account prior to the filing of the divorce complaint, i.e., when the automatic restraining order set forth in Rule 411 of the Supplemental Rules of the Probate Court (2000) would have prevented her from closing such accounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\">It is undisputed that the parties were deeply in debt during the marriage and that the wife, with the husband\u2019s assent, sought the assistance of a credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>counseling service. Much of the parties\u2019 debt was consolidated and the wife made one payment per month to the counseling service. On June 27, 2001, some two and one-half months after the wife filed her complaint for divorce, she refinanced the marital home and paid off (among other things) the amounts owed to the counseling service, a loan (in the amount of $24,205.77) on a 2000 Grand Marquis automobile purchased during the marriage, and the balances on three credit cards in her name in the total amount of $7,659.11. The wife testified that as a result of the refinancing, her mortgage increased but her monthly expenditures decreased. As for the Grand Marquis automobile, the wife testified that she had been making payments of $560 per month on the vehicle but needed a larger vehicle to assist her in the operation of the store. The wife stated that after she paid off the loan on the Grand Marquis, she tried to sell it but \u201cnobody would take it.\u201d Eventually, the wife received approximately $15,000 for the Grand Marquis as a \u201ctrade in\u201d when she bought the 1999 Ford Expedition. The wife also financed the purchase of the vehicle by taking out a loan in the approximate amount of $8,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We note that the guidelines formerly provided for a minimum order of fifty dollars per <em>month. </em>See Child Support Guidelines II-C (1998). The minimum order was increased in 2002 to eighty dollars per month. See Child Support Guidelines II-C (2002). At oral argument, the husband, through counsel, stated that the \u201ccorrect amount\u201d of support that should have been ordered by the court was eighty dollars per month, but that the husband had satisfied Ms support obligation under the guidelines by paymg medical insurance for the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\">M her brief, the wife herself voiced her understanding that the allocation of $34,500 of the husband\u2019s portion of the marital assets to her was \u201cto secure the payment of cMld support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In February, 2002, the parties entered into a stipulation, wMch became a temporary order of the court, wherein the husband agreed to provide health insurance coverage for the wife and the cMldren. Based on the husband\u2019s representation that the cost of health msurance would increase from $28 per week to $81 per week in order to cover the family umt, the wife agreed that there should not be a child support payment by the husband. At trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>husband offered evidence that his base salary, without overtime, was $320 per week (as we have stated, the judge found that the husband could not earn more than $350 to $400 per week), and that the cost to him of family health insurance was $77.84 per week. The husband used these figures, as well as a custodial parent gross income figure based on the wife\u2019s weekly income of $705 (somewhat above the amount found by the court), in the child support guidelines worksheet which he submitted to the court. Although the husband concluded that his weekly child support order was $0, we voice no opinion as to the <em>precise </em>amount, if anything, owed by the husband under the guidelines. We note only that at the time of trial the presumptive guidelines order would appear to have been less than $50 per week.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In <em>Pare </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>409 Mass. at 301, the Supreme Judicial Court directed the Probate Court judge to consider the wife\u2019s request that a portion of the husband\u2019s proceeds from the sale of the marital home be set aside as security for his future child support obligations. In <em>Passemato </em>v. <em>Passemato, </em>427 Mass. at 54-57, the court affirmed a judge\u2019s order requiring the wife to fund a college educational trust for the future benefit of the parties\u2019 three minor children (with unexpended sums to revert to the wife) in circumstances where the wife had engaged in reckless economic and social behavior and it was unlikely, in the absence of a trust structure, that sufficient funds would remain for the children to obtain college educations. In <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Merida, </em>428 Mass. at 190, the court upheld a judgment insofar as it attached $60,000 of funds held by the husband in a bank account. Said attachment meant to secure the husband\u2019s \u201cchild support obligation and for potential contribution to\u201d the child\u2019s college education expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 189-190. The court noted that the husband was allowed to keep the income from the attached assets. <em>Id. </em>at 190 n.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">The order leaves the husband, who was already in financial straits, with only modest resources to draw upon.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
