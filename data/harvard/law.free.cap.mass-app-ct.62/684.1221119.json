The reviewing board summarily affirmed an administrative judge\u2019s determination that the employee was not engaged in a purely voluntary recreational activity and thus was entitled to a closed period of temporary total incapacity and medical benefits stemming from injuries she sustained in the skiing accident. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 1(7A), 13, 30, 34. The employer sought judicial review. Because the administrative judge erred as matter of law in concluding that the employee was not barred from receiving compensation for her injury, the decision of the reviewing board must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The following relevant facts may be summarized from the administrative judge\u2019s decision. The employer, Millennium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Events Corporation, coordinates cultural, social, and recreational events for client companies. At all times relevant to this action, it employed the employee as an event coordinator. In January of 1999, the employee became the sole event coordinator for an employee appreciation program that was instituted by one of the employer\u2019s client companies. In that role, she coordinated various events for the program, including a weekend ski trip to Stowe, Vermont, for the client\u2019s employees. As the event coordinator of the Stowe trip, the employee obtained and distributed ski lift tickets, coordinated matters with the hotel, provided snacks and movies for the bus ride to Stowe, responded to the needs of the client\u2019s employees, arranged transportation from the hotel to the ski area (mountain), and arranged a bus tour of Stowe. Although the employee accompanied the client\u2019s employees on the trip, she did not accompany them to the mountain when they went skiing.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">After returning from the trip, the employee met with the president of the employer, Gregg Nourjian. Nourjian asked the employee how the skiing went and seemed very surprised when she responded that she had not skied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also asked the employee whether she had at least accompanied the skiers to the mountain and voiced his surprise to her response that she had not. Nourjian then told her \u201cthat she should at least go to the mountain to make sure that all went well for the\u201d client\u2019s employees while they were there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">In March of 1999, the employee coordinated a second ski trip to Stowe as part of the client company\u2019s employee appreciation program. This time, Nourjian gave the employee permission to have a friend accompany her on the trip. On the first day of the trip, the employee accompanied the client\u2019s employees to the mountain, and after completing her task of assuring that everyone was already skiing, the employee and her friend skied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>had lunch together, and then resumed skiing. That afternoon, while skiing with her friend, the employee severely injured her right leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The administrative judge found \u201cthat the employee was not actively guiding the tour group down the mountain, nor was she directly performing the specific functions of her work while skiing.\u201d The administrative judge found that the employer absorbed the cost of the friend\u2019s ski lift ticket into the overall cost of the event, that \u201c[t]he employer obviously wanted the employee to perform her duties but, given the nature of her job, she was also authorized to attend and enjoy the events involved along with the clients,\u201d and that \u201c[ajlthough she was never specifically directed to attend any of the events [she organized,]. . . she reasonably felt encouraged to ski on March 13, 1999, as a result of her prior conversation with\u201d Nouijian. The administrative judge then concluded that the employee had met her burden of proving that she had been injured in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">\u201c \u2018Purely voluntary participation [in any recreational activity]\u2019 is noncompensable when injury occurs during the recreational activity and the employer has done nothing more than pay for the costs of that activity.\u201d <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 245 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A). The mere fact that the employer authorized the employee to ski while she was in Stowe by paying for her equipment and lift ticket is insufficient to carry the employee\u2019s burden. There must be an objective element of compulsion on the part of the employer in order for an employee\u2019s participation in such an activity to fall outside of the exclusion set out in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A). See <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 244. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was no evidence in this case that the employer had objectively compelled or coerced the employee to ski.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">The administrative judge found that the employee was never specifically told to go skiing and that she was never specifically directed to attend any of the events that she coordinated. In his decision, the administrative judge commented that Nouijian had explained that if he had shown any surprise when he learned that the employee had not skied while she was in Stowe, it was because he did not know anyone who did not ski. The administrative judge made no finding discrediting Nourjian\u2019s explanation, which was consistent with the employee\u2019s testimony on this issue. The record and the administrative judge\u2019s findings make clear that the employee was expected to accompany the client\u2019s employees to the mountain that day and to make herself available so that she could address any of their needs. However, standing alone, the requirement that she be present at the mountain does not suggest that her participation in the skiing was anything other than purely voluntary.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The employee further argues that pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Frassa </em>v. <em>Caulfield, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 105, 110, 113 (1986), the employer was responsible for any reasonable and foreseeable injury that she sustained while she was away on the business trip because she was a so-called \u201ctraveling\u201d employee. That argument misses the mark. Indeed, in <em>Frassa, </em>we limited our analysis to the specific facts of that case, holding only that \u201c[w]e think there is no question that during reasonable travel to and from the evening meal on the night of the accident, travel clearly impelled by the nature and conditions of the employment, [the employees] could be considered to have been acting in the course of their employment,\u201d and further commenting that it was \u201cnot necessary to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>[the employees] could be considered to have been acting in the course of their employment at the places they visited after dinner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110-111. We also did not consider the reasonableness or foreseeability of their conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In any event, because \u00a7 1(7A) \u201cdoes not limit the time or place of the activity,\u201d injuries resulting from an employee\u2019s purely voluntary participation in recreational activities have been deemed by the Legislature to be outside the scope of compensability, whether performed on the employer\u2019s premises, <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 400 (1993), or while away on a business trip. Accordingly, the decision of the reviewing board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The employee testified, \u201cI said [to Nourjian], \u2018Why would I go skiing? I have never been skiing before.\u2019 He was surprised.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-8\">The employee testified that she was told \u201cthat the next time it\u2019s expected that I go to the mountain at least to show them, go to the mountain and provide them, you know, knowing where everything was,\u201d and that the reason she needed to go to the mountain with the client\u2019s employees was that \u201c[the employer] needed representation, someone needed to be there in case something happened to one of the skiers.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\">In <em>Bengtson\u2019s Case, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 241-242, the employee was injured while playing on a softball team sponsored and organized by his employer. The employee testified that he \u201cfelt obligated . . . [and] pressure [d]\u201d to play, and that his employer \u201c \u2018would urge\u2019 his attendance at games.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242. The administrative judge \u201cviewed the employer\u2019s conduct as constituting \u2018subtle coercion\u2019 and \u2018a reasonable compulsion\u2019 on [the employee] to participate,\u201d and found the employee was entitled to compensation. <em>Id. </em>at 243. This court affirmed the reviewing board\u2019s determination that the employee\u2019s injury was not compensable because it was the result of \u201c \u2018purely voluntary participation\u2019 in a recreational activity sponsored by his employer. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1(7A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The administrative judge\u2019s decision states, \u201cI acknowledge Mr. Nouijian\u2019s testimony that the interests of the employer might have been better served if the employee remained available at the ski lodge to address the needs of clients as they arose, but the employee had given out her beeper number to each of the participants and by being on the mountain, she clearly was accessible to them.\u201d However, the administrative judge\u2019s finding does not show that \u201cthe employer. . . coerce[d], encouragefd], require[d], or pressure[d] the employee [to ski].\u201d <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 400 (1993). \u201c[T]he term \u2018voluntary\u2019 in the statute pertains to the employee\u2019s participation in the activity and not the reason [s]he remained on the premises.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
