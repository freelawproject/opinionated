Susan and Sheldon continued to live together until February, 2001, and subsequently were divorced by a judgment which acknowledged that Sheldon is not the child\u2019s father. Thereafter, the Department of Revenue child support enforcement division (department), on behalf of Susan, filed a complaint against Ryan R. to establish paternity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 5; G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 3. Ryan appeals from a judgment adjudicating him the father and ordering that he pay child support in the amount of $285 per week retroactive to the date Susan filed for divorce from Sheldon, as well as Sheldon\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. Central to Ryan\u2019s various challenges on appeal are his claims that the complaint should have been dismissed because the Probate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction or on principles of claim or issue preclusion. We disagree and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">1. <em>Summary of facts and proceedings. </em>When Susan commenced employment with Ryan in his dental laboratory during the summer of 1993, she and Sheldon were married. The following year, Susan and Ryan began a romantic relationship that continued for some time, during which they were sexually intimate. When Susan learned she was pregnant, in March, 1997, she told Ryan and expressed her belief that he was the father; she also told her husband that she was pregnant and that he was not the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Ryan accompanied Susan to Brockton Hospital for her pregnancy test and to her first ultrasound appointment, and went shopping with her for baby furniture, but they had no further communication after Susan left his employ in August, 1997. When the child was bom, on October 24, 1997, Sheldon was listed as the father on the child\u2019s birth certificate. Because the child suffered from a number of ailments, including immune deficiencies, asthma, and an infectious illness (Kawasaki\u2019s disease), Susan did not resume full-time employment after his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>birth. She and Sheldon experienced financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy protection. Susan collected food stamps and welfare benefits for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">In February, 2001, Susan instituted divorce proceedings and Sheldon moved out of the marital home. The divorce judgment (which entered after a trial before the same judge who presided over the paternity proceedings) provides that \u201c[t]he child bom during the marriage ... is not a child of the Husband\u2019s. However, as the Husband is the only \u2018father\u2019 that the child has known during his life, and as the Husband has cared throughout the marriage for the child and there is a bond that exists between the child and the Husband, ... the Husband is the \u2018de facto\u2019 father of the child. . . .\u201d The judgment provides for visitation and orders Sheldon to pay child support in the amount of $75 per week. Also according to the judgment, the child support amount was not consistent with the child support guidelines, which were deemed inapplicable for the stated reason that Sheldon is not the child\u2019s father and because \u201cthe Wife will receive additional child support from the child\u2019s biological father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On September 19, 2000, Susan filed a pro se complaint, pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, seeking to establish Ryan as the child\u2019s father. Ryan then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that there exists an \u201cexclusive statutory scheme under which parents, such as [Susan], may seek an adjudication of paternity,\u201d and that \u201cas <em>mother </em>of the child . . . [she] . . . cannot commence an action to establish paternity under [G. L.] c. 215, \u00a7 6.\u201d On November 3, 2000, Susan, Sheldon, and Ryan entered into a written stipulation agreeing that the court should \u201cdismiss [Susan\u2019s] \u2018Complaint to Establish Paternity Pursuant to G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6,\u2019 dated \u2018September 2000\u2019 against [Ryan] <em>with prejudice.\u201d </em>On the same day, November 3, 2000, the department, on behalf of Susan, filed the complaint to establish paternity pursuant to G. L. c. 119A, \u00a7 3, and G. L. c. 209C, that is the subject of this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Claim preclusion. </em>As an initial matter, we address Ryan\u2019s argument that the parties\u2019 stipulation of dismissal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of Susan\u2019s pro se complaint, which had been brought under G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, operates to preclude the department\u2019s later action seeking to establish paternity on Susan\u2019s behalf pursuant to G. L. c. 209C. \u201cThe essential elements of claim preclusion are: \u2018(1) a final judgment on the merits in [the first] action; (2) an identity of parties or privies in the two suits; and (3) an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and later suits.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Mancuso </em>v. <em>Kinchla, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 567 (2004), quoting from <em>Aunyx Corp. </em>v. <em>Canon U.S.A., Inc., </em>978 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 973 (1993). Ryan\u2019s claim fails on the first prong, as there was no adjudication on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">It may readily be inferred from the context in which the stipulation to dismiss was made that it was not a dismissal on the merits, but addressed solely whether Susan was required to file the action pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, rather than G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6. See <em>Salem </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 638-639 (1998), citing Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26 comment c (1982) (where formal barriers, such as limitations on subject matter jurisdiction, existed in first action, plaintiff is not barred from bringing those claims in subsequent action); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 26 comment d (same, even if it later appears that determination that such barrier existed was erroneous); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 20 comment d (dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or other threshold determination, even with specification that dismissal is \u201cwith prejudice,\u201d will not bar another action by plaintiff on same claim).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>R.Civ.P. 41(b)(3), 365 Mass. 805 (1974).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>LaFratta, </em>408 Mass. 688, 692 (1990) (issue of paternity was deemed to have been fully litigated in prior action for criminal nonsupport under G. L. c. 273, where that action was settled and dismissed with prejudice upon defendant\u2019s lump sum payment of $3,000; this \u201cwas tantamount to an acquittal and thus barred future civil action brought by the department under [G. L.] c. 209C\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Even assuming without deciding that the department was acting solely on behalf of Susan in bringing the second complaint, the judge was correct in not dismissing the complaint.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">b. <em>Jurisdiction. </em>Ryan moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the Probate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because a parent of a child cannot file an action under G. L. c. 209C unless the subject child was \u201cbom out of wedlock,\u201d a requirement he argues was not met here because Susan was married when the child was bom. Denial of the motion is supported by the plain language of G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 1, as inserted by St. 1986, c. 310, \u00a7 16, which provides: \u201cFor the purpose of this chapter, the term \u2018child bom out of wedlock\u2019 shall refer to any child bom to a man and woman who are not married to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>each other. . . .\u201d See also G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 5(a), as amended through St. 1998, c. 463, \u00a7 173: complaints under c. 209C</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">\u201cmay be commenced by the mother ... or [the department] if the child is or was a recipient of any type of public assistance . . . provided, however, that if the mother of the child was or is married and the child\u2019s birth occurs during the marriage or within three hundred days of its termination by death, annulment or divorce, complaints to establish paternity under this chapter may not be filed by a person presumed to be or alleging himself to be the father unless he is or was the mother\u2019s husband at the time of the child\u2019s birth or conception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Ryan\u2019s reliance on <em>Matter of Walter, </em>408 Mass. 584 (1990), to support his argument is misplaced. The Supreme Judicial Court held in that case that a child bom to the mother while married to her husband was not \u201cbom out of wedlock,\u201d because the husband asserted his paternity and sought custody of the child. Although the mother was living with the husband at the time, he was not aware that she had become pregnant or had given birth. They thereafter separated and a divorce complaint was filed. The husband first learned about the child\u2019s existence when notified by a private adoption agency that the mother had relinquished the child for adoption. When the agency petitioned to dispense with the husband\u2019s consent to the adoption, he asserted his paternity, claiming he lived with and was having sexual relations with the mother for six years prior to and until six months after the birth of the child. The mother denied this, and named another man as the father. The agency and the child both brought actions pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, seeking to establish paternity. <em>Id. </em>at 585. On these specific facts, the court held that \u201cthe ordinary meaning of the term \u2018born out of wedlock\u2019 suggests that it does not apply where the mother\u2019s husband, who is named as the father on the birth certificate, acknowledges and asserts his parenthood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">This case presents an entirely different set of relevant facts: notwithstanding the fact that Sheldon was listed as the father on the child\u2019s birth certificate, Susan had told him from the time she discovered that she was pregnant that he was not the father; moreover, Sheldon did not assert his paternity. Where a child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>who is the subject of a c. 209C action is claimed by the child\u2019s mother to have a biological father who is not her husband, and her husband is not asserting paternity, that child was \u201cbom out of wedlock\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 209C. See <em>C.C. </em>v. <em>A.B., </em>406 Mass. 679, 688 (1990); G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">c. <em>Requirement of paternity testing. </em>Submission to genetic marker testing by \u201cthe mother, the child and the putative father\u201d is mandated by G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 17, as amended through St. 1998, c. 463, \u00a7 174, upon a proper showing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After the c. 209C complaint was filed, the department sought and obtained an order requiring Ryan to participate in paternity testing, to which he submitted over objection.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He argues on appeal that \u201ca rule of fundamental fairness requires that a court not be informed of\u201d test results before deciding the threshold issues, including the question of jurisdiction. Ryan does not direct us to any relevant authority for this proposition. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). In any case, Ryan did not seek to have the judge disqualified and he makes no claim that the judge improperly considered the evidence of paternity. Even assuming that the judge became aware of the test results prior to deciding the motions to dismiss, we presume that he fulfilled his obligation to impartially decide the motions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">d. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>During the pendency of the proceedings, Sheldon filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> arguing that he was required to defend \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>claim against him of \u2018unclean hands\u2019 and \u2018collusion.\u2019 \u201d The motion was allowed by a margin notation that also indicates \u201csee Amended Judgment.\u201d The amended judgment orders Ryan to pay Sheldon\u2019s counsel fees in the amount of $6,850, for the reason that Ryan\u2019s \u201cclaims were wholly unsubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith,\u201d as more fully explained in the judge\u2019s findings. In his brief, Ryan challenges the award of \u00a7 6F fees. An appeal from the award of fees pursuant to \u00a7 6F must be made to a single justice of this court. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Because there is nothing in Ryan\u2019s notice of appeal \u201cspecifying] that it is an appeal from the portion of the judgment awarding attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 6F, we shall treat it only as an appeal to a panel from those portions of the judgment that are within the panel\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Shriberg, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 284 (1991).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">e. <em>Award of child support. </em>After factoring in alimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>child support payments from Sheldon, as well as earned income of $15,000 per year attributed to Susan,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Probate Court judge ordered Ryan to pay child support in the amount of $285 per week and to provide medical insurance for the child. The award was based, in part, on the judge\u2019s finding, challenged by Ryan, that Ryan\u2019s income at the time of trial was $70,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The findings reflect that the judge considered significant the evidence of the annual income reported by Ryan and his wife on their jointly filed Federal tax returns, reflecting that for the years 1997 through 2000, Ryan and his wife both claimed earnings from the dental laboratory business that was owned and operated by Ryan.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judge was not required to believe testimony that the nature of the work performed by Ryan\u2019s wife as office manager for the business (the only occupation she lists on the tax returns) entitled her to a substantial salary that was equal to or greater than that of Ryan,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and the judge\u2019s attribution of income to Ryan was reasonable on the basis of the credible evidence. In any case, even had the judge determined that Ryan\u2019s income consisted solely of the amounts set forth on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>W-2 form and some or all of the interest income, it would not have been error for the judge to consider whether the income of Ryan\u2019s wife made more of the income earned by Ryan available for the support of the child. See <em>Department of Rev. </em>v. <em>Mason M., </em>439 Mass. 665, 675 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">f. <em>Other claims. </em>To the extent we do not discuss other arguments made by Ryan (viz., judicial estoppel requires dismissal; the trial judge should have attributed a greater amount of annual income to Susan), they \u201chave not been overlooked. We find nothing in them that requires discussion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Domanski, </em>332 Mass. 66, 78 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Sheldon was named a defendant as required by G.

App. Ct. 271, 273 (2004), quoting from <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23 n.2 (1988). We note that, in this case, the issue of paternity is coextensive with the claim made; the distinction between issue and claim preclusion is not determinative. Under neither theory is the issue or claim of paternity precluded. \u201c[A] stipulation of dismissal with prejudice is not the equivalent of a final judgment on the merits for the proposes of issue preclusion.\u201d <em>Jarosz </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>436 Mass. 526, 529 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">We therefore need not decide whether, by virtue of G.
