(Fieldstone) to perform work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>within 100 feet of a protected resource area.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fieldstone sought Superior Court review in the nature of certiorari. G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. The parties filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. A Superior Court judge allowed the commission\u2019s motion, and a judgment entered affirming the decision of the commission. Fieldstone appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We conclude that the commission impermissibly based its denial of Fieldstone\u2019s application upon a policy imposing a \u201cno-build\u201d zone not otherwise found in the town by-law or any regulations promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>Fieldstone seeks to develop a five lot residential subdivision located off Porter Road in Andover, and filed a notice of intent (hereafter, application) with the commission seeking authorization to perform work on the land within 100 feet of a protected resource area. At issue is Fieldstone\u2019s proposed construction and installation of a detention basin within twenty-five feet of the bordering vegetated wetlands.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The basis for the commission\u2019s denial of Fieldstone\u2019s application is a policy providing for a twenty-five foot no-build zone that was not adopted as a regulation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The genesis of the policy is not apparent from the record, but it is described by the commission in its decision denying the application, as follows: \u201cEffective January 1, 1999, the Conservation Commission will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>expect proposals to locate no alteration or disturbance of land closer than 25 feet to a wetland boundary. Special justification will be required for any proposal that seeks a lesser distance. Applicants for less distances will be required to show in detail that no damage occurs to the adjacent wetland.\u201d The commission in essence decided that, because Fieldstone\u2019s proposed work was within the no-build zone envisioned by the policy, Fieldstone was required, but failed, to meet the burden imposed by the policy that there would be \u201cno damage\u201d to the protected area. The commission\u2019s implicit assumption that any alteration occurring within the twenty-five foot area would have an adverse impact on the wetlands was at the root of its determinatian that the application also could be denied under various sectians of the town by-law.</p>\n<p id=\"AAg\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>The standard of review under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, varies according to the nature of the action for which review is sought. <em>Black Rose, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>433 Mass. 501, 503-504 (2001). <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. Andover, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 124, 128 (1994). We review the commission\u2019s denial to determine whether it was arbitrary and capricious in that it acted for reasons \u201cextraneous to the prescriptions of the regulatory scheme, but are related, rather, to an ad hoc agenda.\u201d <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Reading, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 565, 568 (1996). Compare <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. 7, 18 (1979). Our review gives no special weight to the view of the Superior Court judge. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Stoughton, </em>437 Mass. 1, 5 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"Anaa\">3. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>The no-build policy. </em>We agree with Fieldstone that the commission\u2019s denial of Fieldstone\u2019s applicatian was improperly based on a policy existing outside of the regulatory framework. \u201cIn the administration of controls limiting the use of land \u2014 as with any exercise of the police power \u2014 uniformity of standards and enforcement are of the essence. If the laws are not applied equally they do not protect equally.\u201d <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Reading, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 569, citing <em>SCIT, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Braintree, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 106-111 (1984), <em>sad National Amusements, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Boston, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 305, 312 (1990).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Belger, </em>143 Mass. 598, 599 (1887) (city ordinance exceeded scope of fire prevention statute, where it gave board of aldermen \u201cthe power, by refusing a permit, to prevent the erection of any building . . . for any reason which may be satisfactory to them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Relying on these principles, we conclude that a no-build zone \u201cpolicy\u201d not lawfully adopted as a regulation, and containing no requirement of uniform application, cannot form the basis of the commission\u2019s denial in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The decision to deny the permit on the basis of such a policy was therefore arbitrary. See <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Reading, supra </em>at 572 (\u201cThe criteria [the conservation commission] applied were devised for the occasion, rather than of uniform applicability. Thus flawed, the commission\u2019s decision was arbitrary\u201d). Cf. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Rockland, </em>423 Mass. 690, 696 (1996) (\u201cA planning board exceeds its authority if requirements are imposed beyond those established by the rules and regulations\u201d). Compare <em>Lakeside Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 846-848 &amp; n.6 (2002) (planning board denied waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of regulation in part due to change in policy that previously had encouraged dead-end streets; not arbitrary to enforce regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">b. <em>The town by-law. </em>The commission argues that, even if the denial was not properly based on its twenty-five foot no-build policy, its action may still be upheld because the commission, in its decision, also invoked \u00a7\u00a7 2, 7, and 8 of the town by-law as alternative bases for the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">These provisions extend to the commission the general authority to regulate activities within the 100-foot buffer zone, and set out the criteria upon which it may deny an application or approve it with conditions. There is, however, nothing in these provisions or any other provision of the town by-law creating an absolute bar to activity within the 100-foot buffer zone. Under \u00a7 2 of the town by-law, specified work in the protected area is prohibited \u201c[e]xcept as permitted by the Conservation Commission.\u201d Under \u00a7 8 of the town by-law, the commission may deny, or approve subject to conditions, an application for activities that \u201care likely to have a significant or cumulative effect upon the values protected\u201d under the town by-law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commission may, pursuant to \u00a7 8, require an applicant to maintain an \u201cundisturbed vegetative cover\u201d if within a prescribed distance from protected resources, \u201cunless the applicant demonstrates that the area or part of it may be disturbed without harm to the values protected by this by-law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The commission\u2019s findings demonstrate no consideration of the particularities of the proposed detention basin or of the evidence as to the actual or potential effect of the proposed work on the adjacent wetlands. It is apparent, despite invocation of the town by-law as the ostensible basis for its decision, that the denial was in fact based entirely on the commission\u2019s assumption that only a twenty-five foot no-build zone will ensure that the proposed work will have no impact on the wetlands.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare <em>T.D.J. Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of N. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Andover, </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. at 129 (where commission found that proposed work would impact adjacent wetlands, imposition of twenty-five foot no-cut and fifty foot no-construction condition on project was within \u201creasonable range of the commission\u2019s authority to regulate activity in the [100-foot] buffer zone\u201d). Here, the commission\u2019s reliance on such an assumption was legally insufficient to support the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Based on the foregoing, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. A new judgment is to enter annulling the commission\u2019s denial of the requested order and remanding the matter to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. See <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 830, 832 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Statewide wetland protection standards under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the Wetlands Protection Act, are not relevant to our determination in this case, which concerns, solely, the commission\u2019s action under the town by-law and a purported local \u201cpolicy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Although the notice of intent details several aspects of the proposed project that required the commission\u2019s attention, in denying Fieldstone\u2019s application the commission focused only on the fact that the proposed detention basin would be located within twenty-five feet of the bordering vegetated wetlands. We confine our review to the reasons given by the commission for the denial of the application. Cf. <em>Canter </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Westborough, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 307 (1976) (\u201cThe Superior Court\u2019s review, and ours, must be confined to the reasons for disapproval of the subdivision plan stated by the planning board\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\">Section 11 of the town by-law provides that the commission shall promulgate regulations, after due notice and public hearing, \u201crequiring the maintenance of an undisturbed vegetated buffer of not more than 25 feet from the edge\u201d of any areas protected by the town by-law. Although the commission drafted such regulations, it is not suggested that such a regulation was adopted and in effect at the time the commission acted on Fieldstone\u2019s application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The conservation commission in the <em>Fafard </em>case had promulgated a regulation requiring a twenty-five foot \u201cnatural vegetation buffer strip\u201d adjacent to the wetland and refused to issue an order of conditions because of its opinion that the proposed work outside of the twenty-five foot buffer strip would have secondary or potential impact upon the buffer area. <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Reading, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 567. The court concluded there that the conservation commission had no authority to require a buffer zone wider than the twenty-five feet established by regulation and that the conservation commission thus had acted arbitrarily in denying a permit on that basis. <em>Id. </em>at 570.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">That the policy did not require uniform application, and was subject to arbitrary invocation, is evidenced by the language of the policy itself, which provides that \u201cspecial justification\u201d could be advanced for proposals for building within the twenty-five foot zone. As one of the commission members stated at a hearing, \u201cthe 25 feet concern was not one of slavish compliance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Notwithstanding our recognition that the policy may not have been applied to all applicants, if applied in accordance with its terms as it was to Fieldstone\u2019s application, the policy operates as an absolute bar to construction within twenty-five feet of the wetlands. It is no defense to a challenge to enforcement of the policy that the commission chose not to apply it uniformly, particularly when the commission articulates no principled basis on which to apply or waive the policy in a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Sect\u00edon 1 of the town by-law provides that such values include the protection of \u201cthe wetlands, related water resources and adjoining land areas in the Town of Andover.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\">The commission found that a twenty-five foot no-build zone would afford greater protection to the resource area, and noted that this finding was based on information obtained by certain unidentified commission members at a seminar they attended, sponsored by the Massachusetts Association of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Conservation Commissions, entitled \u201cUse of Vegetated Buffers as Water Quality Technique.\u201d We recognize that in a specific instance the commission could well find that a proposed activity should be precluded because it does not, for example, \u201cavoid or prevent unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the values protected by [the] by-law [or that] no conditions are adequate to protect those values,\u201d as required by \u00a7 8 of the town by-law. Such a finding must, however, be supported by substantial evidence. <em>Lovequist </em>v. <em>Conservation Commn. of Dennis, </em>379 Mass. at 17-18. The commission\u2019s reliance on anonymous sources alone (the scientific basis of which was not identified) would not be sufficient to constitute that substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
