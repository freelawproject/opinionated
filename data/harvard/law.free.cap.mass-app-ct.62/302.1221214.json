(Nissan), signed a lease agreement to open a Nissan dealership on premises owned by the defendant, Allen M. Click. After attempting twice to exercise the purchase option in the lease agreement, Nissan filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and specific performance of the option to purchase the premises. Nissan later amended the complaint to include claims pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. In his answer, Click counterclaimed, seeking reformation of the agreement due to an allegedly mutual mistake concerning when the plaintiff could exercise the option to purchase. A judge of the Superior Court heard the dispute in a bench trial. She dismissed Click\u2019s claim for reformation and, finding that Nissan\u2019s second attempt to exercise the option was valid, ordered specific performance for the plaintiff. Further, she ordered that all rent Nissan paid after Click refused to convey the premises in accordance with Nissan\u2019s second exercise of the option should be credited toward the purchase price of the property. She dismissed Nissan\u2019s claims for damages under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, and G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The parties have cross-appealed. Nissan claims (1) that the judge erred, as matter of law, in ruling that Albrecht\u2019s first attempt to exercise the purchase option was invalidly noticed; (2) that the judge should have awarded statutory interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, on the rental payments made after the closing date and credited toward the purchase price; and (3) that the judge eired in failing to find that Click violated G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (and also in declining to award multiple damages and attorney\u2019s fees). Click raises three discrete issues: (1) that the judge applied the wrong legal standard in determining that his unilateral mistake did not entitle him to relief; (2) that the judge made a clearly erroneous finding of fact that amplified her error of law concerning the unilateral mistake; and (3) that she improperly considered whether Click would realize a profit if</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We have the benefit of careful, detailed, and lucid findings by the Superior Court judge. Such findings are, of course, entitled to deference unless clearly erroneous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Source One Assocs., Inc., </em>436 Mass. 118, 124 (2002); Mass.R. Civ.P. 52(a), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996). The judge\u2019s findings are supported by the record; we summarize them.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Glick, a businessman with twenty-five years of experience in the car dealership business, purchased 740 Boston Post Road in Marlborough in 1995 for $746,000. Albrecht, president and majority shareholder of Nissan, wanted to open a Nissan dealership there and was interested in leasing or buying the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The two met at Glick\u2019s Framingham farm for their first and only face-to-face meeting on April 3, 1996. After the meeting on April 3, 1996, there was no further direct communication between Albrecht and Glick with regard to the lease. Both men understood that there would be no enforceable agreement between them until their lawyers drafted a written lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Albrecht\u2019s attorney, Robert Holmes, drew up the first draft of the lease agreement and sent it to Glick\u2019s. attorney, Alan Greenwald, on April 5, 1996. The initial purchase option clause was on the first page in a section entitled \u201cSummary of Basic Terms.\u201d It conformed to Albrecht and Click\u2019s discussion and read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\"><em>\u201cPurchase Option: </em>Tenant shall have the right to purchase the Premises for a purchase price of One Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000) <em>at the end of the tenth year of the term of the Lease upon notice of exercise to Landlord given within six (6) months prior to the end of said tenth </em>year\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Upon receiving the first draft of the lease, Greenwald added handwritten notes detailing changes throughout the document meant to clarify its terms but not to change them substantively. On April 12, 1996, he sent a draft back to Holmes that included these changes. This draft included the language in controversy in the \u201cSummary of Basic Terms\u201d on page one, which had been modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\"><em>\u201cPurchase Option: </em>Lessee shall have the right to exercise an option to purchase the Premises for a purchase price of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>One Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000) which can be exercised <em>only within ten (10) years </em>from the Commencement Date of this Lease upon notice to LESSOR of exercise of option <em>given at least six (6) months prior </em>thereto\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The new language effectively required that the option be exercised within the first ten years of the lease, not the second ten years, as Albrecht and Click had discussed. The parties did not discuss this change to the language at any time. They exchanged additional drafts of the lease several times before settling on a version that satisfied them both. Nevertheless, the erroneous language in the purchase option clause remained intact through the drafting process and was on the first page of the lease agreement when both parties signed it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The judge credited Click\u2019s testimony that despite multiple opportunities to review the lease drafts containing the altered purchase option language, Click did not catch his lawyer\u2019s mistake. She found that he simply assumed the drafts and the lease reflected what he and Albrecht had discussed at the April 3, 1996, meeting: that the option to purchase would be exercisable after the first ten years. Unbeknownst to Albrecht or Holmes, Click wanted to put off sale of the property for tax reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">On September 10, 1997, Albrecht sent a letter to Click notifying him that Albrecht intended to exercise Nissan\u2019s option to purchase and that the effective date of exercise was February 18, 1998. However, due to concerns that the September 10, 1997, notice of intent to exercise might not be valid, Albrecht sent another such letter to Click on March 6, 2000, setting an effective date of September 15, 2000. Click refused to transfer the property on either occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">1. <em>Reformation of the option provision. </em>On the basis of the plain but mistaken language of the option provision that Click\u2019s attorney, Greenwald, modified from the initial draft and which remained in the version of the agreement that Click, himself, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>signed, the judge ruled that the contested option provision was a unilateral mistake on Click\u2019s part, not a mutual one. She also found that while Click had testified to several reasons why the change in the option language did not reflect the original intent of either party, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Albrecht knew or should have known of the mistake at the time he signed the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">On appeal Click does not quarrel with the judge\u2019s finding that the mistake was unilateral. Rather, he contends that the judge applied the wrong standard in determining whether the mistake warranted reformation so that the option could not be exercised until the end of the ten-year term of the lease. Specifically, he argues that Albrecht had reason to know of Click\u2019s mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Reformation is an appropriate remedy for an agreement containing a mistake if the mistake is mutual or was made by one party (unilateral) such that the other party knew or had reason to know of it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 756 (1993); <em>First Safety Fund Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Friel, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 583, 588 (1987); <em>Torrao </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 247, 250-251 (1988); Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 153 (1981). A party seeking recovery for a unilateral mistake must present full, clear, and decisive proof that a mistake occurred, see <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., supra, </em>and that the other party knew or had reason to know of the mistake.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>First Safety Fund Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Friel, supra. </em>If these conditions are met, a court may choose to reform the agreement at its discretion. See <em>Mickelson </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>390 Mass. 786, 791-792 (1984); <em>Torrao </em>v. <em>Cox, supra </em>at 252; 2 Farnsworth, Contracts \u00a7 7.5, at 244-245 (2d ed. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In the instant case, the judge correctly found that there was proof of mistake, demonstrated through the evolution of the purchase option language and Click\u2019s testimony that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>remained unaware of the change to the provision that his attorney made when reviewing multiple drafts of the lease agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Click\u2019s appeal challenges the Superior Court\u2019s finding that he did not meet the second criterion by clearly demonstrating that Nissan knew or had reason to know of the mistake. His argument is that while the judge stated the correct standard for deciding whether to grant reformation in an instance of unilateral mistake, she then applied that standard incorrectly. In our assessment, the judge\u2019s application of the correct standard resulted in a finding of fact, one with which Click disagrees. We will not set aside findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Source One Assocs., Inc., </em>436 Mass. at 124; Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Our careful review of the record indicates that Click did not present a shred of evidence, much less \u201cfull, clear and decisive proof,\u201d that Albrecht knew Click was mistaken about the terms of the purchase option. <em>Mickelson </em>v. <em>Barnet, supra </em>at 793, quoting from <em>Stockbridge Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Hudson Iron Co., </em>107 Mass. 290, 317 (1871). See <em>Covich </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 747-748 &amp; n.12 (1979). In addition, there was no evidence that Albrecht ever attempted to conceal the language of the purchase option or took any action to prevent Click from discovering it. On this record there is simply no factual basis to find that Albrecht or Holmes knew, or even suspected that Click believed, that the option provision drafted by his attorney said anything other than what its plain and unambiguous language expressed \u2014 that the purchase option could \u201cbe exercised only <em>within </em>ten (10) years from the commencement date\u201d of the lease (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The circumstances in which a party may void a contract on the basis of a unilateral mistake are limited: \u201cif he does not bear the risk of the mistake . . . and (a) the effect\u2018of the mistake is such that enforcement of the contract would be unconscionable, or (b) the other party had reason to know of the mistake or his fault caused the mistake.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 153. Here, Click has not called to our attention anything that persuades us that Albrecht had reason to know of the mistake. With respect to his theory of unilateral mistake, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>judge did not err when she dismissed Click\u2019s claim for reformation and ordered specific performance for Nissan.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">2. <em>Martell\u2019s notes. </em>George Martell, the vice president and chief operating officer of Woburn Foreign Motors, another dealership owned by Albrecht, attended the April 3, 1996, meeting and took notes, which he later copied and gave to both parties. The notes included the basic terms of the discussed lease, including the phrase, \u201cOption to purchase for $1.1 million after year 10 with 6 months notice of intent.\u201d Click contends that an incorrect factual finding by the judge allowed her to dismiss prematurely a point central to Click\u2019s argument, i.e., that Mar-tell\u2019s notes reflected the essence of the deal as negotiated by the parties and that the parties meant for every term in the notes to appear in the lease. The judge\u2019s allegedly erroneous finding, that a provision regarding two months\u2019 free rent had changed from the time it was memorialized in Martell\u2019s notes to when it appeared in the lease, supposedly permitted her to find more readily that the change in the option language was not, in and of itself, adequate to give Albrecht \u201creason to know\u201d of a mistake in the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The argument is strained. Moreover, we note that the judge\u2019s finding on this point was not clearly erroneous. Martell\u2019s notes simply stated, \u201c60 days rent free occupancy after Nissan approval.\u201d The lease agreement included other provisions that, as Click points out in his appellate brief, allowed for <em>at least </em>sixty days rent free and ultimately provided one hundred and twenty days rent free. Such a result could be seen as inconsistent with Martell\u2019s notes, and therefore, the judge\u2019s finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">More to the point, Click suggests that because all the other aspects of Martell\u2019s notes were included in the lease, and because Martell\u2019s notes included the details of the purchase option that Click intended to include, the judge must infer that Nissan should have known that the erroneous option language that was ultimately included in the lease agreement was a mistake. However, this argument is undercut by the fact that attorney Holmes drafted the original purchase option language in accord with the specifications in Martell\u2019s notes only to have that language changed by Click\u2019s attorney, Greenwald, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>subsequently approved multiple times by Greenwald and by Glick himself. The erroneous option language, appearing in different drafts of the lease, was sufficiently obvious in its meaning and its placement on the document\u2019s first page that the judge reasonably could have inferred that Albrecht did not have reason to know of the mistake. Thus, even if the judge had made a clearly erroneous finding with regard to the rent provisions, that hypothetical mistake would not alter our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">3. <em>Profit from sale of 740 Boston Post Road. </em>Glick also argues that the judge should not have reached a conclusion whether Glick would have realized a profit from the purchase option transaction, stating \u201c[wjhether, in the judge\u2019s opinion, Glick made out well enough was irrelevant\u201d to the issue before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In the abstract that may be the case, but Glick overlooks one of the instances in which a contract incorporating a unilateral mistake can be reformed: where enforcing the agreement as written would be unconscionable. <em>First Safety Fund Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Friel, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 588; Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 153. See <em>Covich </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. at 750 n.13. Once the judge concluded that the mistake was unilateral, she had to consider all possible avenues through which the agreement might be reformed. In considering whether enforcement of the agreement as written would be unconscionable, it was logical to consider how Glick would fare were the provision enforced as written. Another judge might have found differently, but addressing this factor was not irrelevant to the ultimate issue, and therefore, it was not improperly considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">4. <em>Nissan\u2019s cross appeal: exercise of the option. </em>Having established that the Superior Court properly dismissed Click\u2019s claim for reformation, we turn to Nissan\u2019s cross appeal regarding Albrecht\u2019s first attempt to exercise the purchase option. His first letter of intent to exercise, dated September 10, 1997, set an effective date of February 18, 1998, which was less than six months after September 10, 1997. Because this notice of intent to exercise the option to purchase did not comport with plain language of the purchase option clause in the lease agreement, the judge found the notice invalid. Nissan disagrees and argues that it was effective because the closing would have taken place more than six months after September 10, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>We disagree. The method by which an option to purchase is to be exercised must be contained in the option agreement and is to be determined by the language of the option provision. See <em>Loitherstein </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 91, 96 (1980) (denying exercise of option to terminate lease because lessee did not strictly comply with literal terms of option provision); <em>Roberts-Neustadter Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 269 (1983) (finding lessee properly exercised option to purchase by complying with literal language of option, thus specific performance appropriate but for complicating circumstances); <em>Cadillac Auto. Co. of Boston </em>v. <em>Stout, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 906 (1985) (holding letter of exercise ineffective for failure to comply with strict terms of option language); Talty, Talty &amp; Braunstein, Methods of Practice \u00a7 2:9, at 40 (4th ed. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Applying this rule to Nissan\u2019s cross appeal with respect to its September 10, 1997, notice of intent to exercise, we need only look to the plain language of the purchase option in the signed lease agreement. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\"><em>\u201cPurchase Option: </em>Lessee shall have the right to exercise an option to purchase the Premises for a purchase price of One Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,100,000) which can be exercised <em>only within ten (10) years </em>from the Commencement Date of this Lease upon notice to LESSOR of exercise of option <em>given at least six (6) months prior </em>thereto\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the context of those parameters, Albrecht\u2019s letter of notice of intent to exercise, dated September 10, 1997, and specifying an effective date of February 18, 1998, was not valid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Six months after September 10, 1997, is March 10, 1998. February 18, 1998, is <em>less than </em>six months after the date of notice of intent to exercise. Therefore, Nissan\u2019s first attempt to exercise the option did not comply with the strict terms of the purchase option and was correctly found invalid by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">5. <em>Interest on rent payments. </em>Although Nissan\u2019s September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>10, 1997, letter was inadequate to trigger its option to purchase, Click concedes that Nissan\u2019s March 6, 2000, letter of notice of intent to exercise, which set the date of\" exercise as September 15, 2000, was valid under the lease agreement. If the option had been executed pursuant to the terms of the lease agreement, Nissan would have acquired the property at an October 30, 2000, closing. Therefore, the judge correctly ordered that Nissan\u2019s rent payments from October 30, 2000, to the present should be credited toward the purchase price.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Nissan argues that the judge erred in deciding not to order Click to pay interest on those rent payments as further credit toward the purchase price, money it argues Glick owes under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the judge correctly decided not to award interest to Nissan.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">On its face, the statute only provides for prejudgment interest in instances where damages are awarded. Because declaratory judgment and specific performance are remedies at equity, the awarding of interest on the basis of this statute in this case is certainly not automatic. As was noted by the judge, \u201c[t]he rent payments are not damages so much as credits which reduce the purchase price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">Further, the Supreme Judicial Court has interpreted this statute narrowly, reflecting concerns that liberal awarding of prejudgment interest could result in a windfall for the recipient, essentially functioning as punitive damages. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>TIG Premier Ins. Co., </em>47 F. Supp. 2d 87, 90-91 (D. Mass. 1999), citing <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 841 (1986). Given these concerns, the judge construed the statute properly. She correctly determined that Nissan ultimately did not lose the use of the money paid in rent, as it would not have had use of that money if it had purchased the property according to the terms of the purchase option.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Given the equitable nature of the remedies sought in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>case, the narrow scope of this statute, and the fact that the funds Nissan used to make rent payments would not likely have been available to Nissan had the purchase of the property proceeded, Nissan\u2019s request for interest pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">6. <em>Unfair and deceptive act claim. </em>Nissan also appeals from the judge\u2019s dismissal of its G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To recover under this statute, Nissan must demonstrate that Glick used an \u201cunfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act\u201d in the conduct of commerce. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. Nissan\u2019s claim is negated by the judge\u2019s unchallenged factual finding that Glick did not catch the mistake his lawyer made and did not intend to have the purchase option read as it did and, therefore, had genuine reason to seek relief under the doctrine of mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Given Click\u2019s belief that the erroneous purchase option language could be reformed by the court, his refusal to convey the property under the purchase option of the signed lease agreement was not, as argued by Nissan, \u201can attempt to avoid a clear and unequivocal contractual obligation to sell plaintiff the property.\u201d To the contrary, it was an prophylactic action taken in accordance with his earnestly held interpretation of the document and the law. As such, it was not an \u201cunfair or deceptive act\u201d under G. L. c. 93A and Nissan\u2019s claim was properly dismissed by the Superior Court. G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. See <em>Massachusetts Employers Ins. Exchange </em>v. <em>Propac-Mass, Inc., </em>420 Mass. 39, 42-43 (1995) (in deciding questions of unfairness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>under G.
