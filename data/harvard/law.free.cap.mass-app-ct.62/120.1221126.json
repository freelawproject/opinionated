The other, the defendant, was convicted by a jury of involuntary manslaughter on the theory of unlawful killing by the commission of a battery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 217 (1994). He was sentenced to six to ten years at M.C.I., Cedar Junction. His direct appeal and his appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial were consolidated, and he claims: (1) that the Commonwealth\u2019s violations of its discovery obligations denied him access to significant exculpatory evidence under the rule of <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963); (2) that a photograph admitted in evidence showing bruising of a third person was irrelevant and prejudicial and, together with improper argument of the prosecutor, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice; and (3) that his sentence must be vacated because the judge improperly considered uncharged conduct in imposing the sentence. We affirm the conviction and the order denying the new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On the afternoon of July 5, 2000, the defendant took his ten year old son and two friends to the Burbank Ice Arena in Reading for \u201cstick practice,\u201d an informal hockey practice. The defendant, watching from the stands, considered the play too rough, went down to the ice, and complained to Costin, who was playing with his three sons. Costin\u2019s response was, \u201cThat\u2019s hockey.\u201d The men exchanged words. Shortly thereafter, when the players were changing out of their hockey gear in the locker rooms, the defendant and Costin continued to argue and began to struggle physically. Other adults broke up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the fight. The defendant left the. building, leaving his son to finish changing in the locker room. He returned a few minutes later, at which time, according to Nancy Blanchard, a rink employee, he appeared angry. She tried to stop him from entering, but allegedly he pushed her aside into a wall, causing her arm to bruise. The defendant encountered Costin, and the two immediately began throwing punches at one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">There was conflicting testimony at trial: the defendant claimed he was attacked first, while prosecution witnesses said the defendant grabbed Costin first. In any event Costin, who weighed approximately 160 pounds,- ended up on the ground with the defendant, who weighed about 270 pounds, straddled on top of him. Costin was punched on the face and elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">At issue was the number of blows inflicted \u2014 Blanchard and others testified that Costin was punched \u201cmany, many times\u201d; the defendant and his witnesses claimed \u201ctwo or three.\u201d Blanchard and another witness each yelled to the defendant to stop, screaming, \u201cyou\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Costin did not succumb immediately to the blows, and, according to several witnesses, there was a period during the punching that he was moving, fighting, kicking, or flailing. By the time the defendant was pulled from Costin by bystanders, the latter was motionless. He was treated by emergency medical technicians and an advanced life support team and was taken to a hospital, where he died the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The number of blows inflicted was viewed as crucial by the defense. \u201cThe law of this Commonwealth recognizes unlawful-act manslaughter only if the unlawful act is a battery not amounting to a felony, when the defendant knew or should have known that the battery he was committing endangered human life.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sires, </em>413 Mass. 292, 302 n.10 (1992). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. at 217. Thus, if only a single punch or only minor blows were involved, this would tend to negate the defendant\u2019s knowledge or imputed knowledge that he was endangering human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The expert testimony of the prosecution and the defendant differed as to the number of blows. Dr. Stanton Kessler of the Commonwealth\u2019s office of the chief medical examiner was an expert for the prosecution. He had performed the autopsy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>described the numerous injuries on Costin\u2019s body, with particular focus on major trauma to the neck and head.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to his testimony, there were two areas of severe trauma, one to the base of the neck where the vertebral artery ruptured, cutting off one-fourth of the blood supply to the brain, and internal trauma to the left side of the head above the ear. This second injury, totally unrelated to the rupture of the vertebral artery, resulted in \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d bleeding of the brain: a brain cavity remote from the neck \u201cwas shaken up so badly that these little vessels tore and bled deep in the brain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The cause of death, in Dr. Kessler\u2019s opinion, was \u201cblunt head and neck trauma, contributory factor of bronchopneumonia\u201d (fluid in the lungs). In his opinion there were multiple blows. Although he acknowledged several times that the injury to the vertebral artery could possibly have been sustained because of one blow, there was here tearing of the ligaments \u201calmost tearing the head from the neck,\u201d indicating multiple blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The defense expert, Dr. Ira Kanfer, believed that the cause of death was rupture of the vertebral artery, a rare injury caused by minimal force, and that this had been caused by a single blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">2. <em>Discovery issues. </em>In connection with its motion for a new trial, the defense filed the affidavit of Melissa Christie, an organ donation coordinator who worked at the office of the chief medical examiner. She had, during trial, unsuccessfully attempted to communicate with the defense. She alleged that she had attended a conference of forensic examiners in Seattle, Washington, where Dr. Kessler had given a presentation on the technique for evaluating vertebral artery traumas. At that time Dr. Kessler \u201cidentified the case for the audience as being the famous \u2018Hockey Dad\u2019s\u2019 case in Massachusetts,\u201d and showed slides of Costin\u2019s injuries, stating they were slides of the victim\u2019s body. He identified the vertebral artery rupture as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>fatal injury, which he said was the result of a blow to the neck when it was hyperextended. He also indicated that the injury can occur very easily during a visit to a chiropractor\u2019s office, but according to Christie, \u201c[tjhere was nothing in his talk about substantial force or multiple blows having caused the rupture of Mr. Costin\u2019s vertebral artery.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appended to her affidavit was a copy of an abstract of the presentation, a joint paper by Dr. Kessler and another physician.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Before any witnesses testified, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude Dr. Kessler from testifying to an opinion \u201cconcerning the degree, amount or manner of force necessary to cause or alleged to have been involved in the trauma to Michael Costin.\u201d The Commonwealth had violated a pretrial discovery order to \u201cprovide to the defendant a list of its experts, their curriculum vitae, opinion, and basis for the opinion five days before trial.\u201d The judge, however, found that there was no surprise as the Commonwealth\u2019s theory had been presented by Dr. Kessler before the grand jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Based on the Christie affidavit and the abstract, the defendant claims that the prejudice from the judge\u2019s ruling only became apparent when the record was expanded to include the material submitted in support of the motion for a new trial. The Commonwealth\u2019s violations of discovery orders \u2014 failing to provide an updated curriculum vitae<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> listing the abstract and failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>provide the abstract itself \u2014 the defendant urges, denied him access to highly exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Due process is violated under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. at 87, if the prosecution fails to produce \u201cevidence which provides some significant aid to the defendant\u2019s case, whether it furnishes corroboration of the defendant\u2019s story, calls into question a material, although not indispensable, element of the prosecution\u2019s version of the events, or challenges the credibility of a key prosecution witness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>438 Mass. 672, 679 (2003), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellison, 316 </em>Mass. 1, 22 (1978). Assuming that the \u201cdefendant specifically requested the evidence that was not disclosed, \u2018a standard of prejudice more favorable to the defendant is justified.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>[412 Mass. 401, 407 (1992)]. In such circumstances, \u2018a defendant need only demonstrate that a substantial basis exists for claiming prejudice from the nondisclosure.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 412.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>438 Mass. at 679-680 (footnote omitted). The defendant, however, has the burden of establishing the requisite \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for the claim of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">After examining Dr. Kessler\u2019s testimony and the abstract, we conclude, as did the motion judge (who was also the trial judge), that the defendant has not met his burden. The abstract is not inconsistent with Dr. Kessler\u2019s testimony, and, moreover, the defendant overstates the factual importance of the experts\u2019 testimony in this case. Although the defendant urges that Dr. Kessler testified that multiple blows caused the rupture of the vertebral artery, he did not so testify. What led him to the conclusion of multiple blows was the fact that there were also other injuries including \u201cthe injury in the middle of the brain.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He stated, \u201cTaking into account the tearing of the small vessels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>in the cavity of the brain we call the ventricle. Taking into account the amount of blood and tearing of the vertebral artery and the bruising and hemorrhage in the vertebral arteries on both sides. And the hemorrhage in the neck. This is a substantial force injury. It takes a lot of trauma to tear ligaments and the ligaments at the back of the skull are tom and hemorrhaged.\u201d That the abstract reported that tearing of the vertebral artery may typically be caused by minor blows in no way contradicts Dr. Kessler\u2019s testimony that due to the severity of the injuries in this case, multiple blows were here inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Perhaps even more important, the testimony of the percipient witnesses belied the claim of one or minimal blows. No witness testified that the defendant hit Costin only once, and the defendant himself testified that there were two or three punches. Both experts pointed out that once the vertebral artery is raptured, the victim would within seconds become unconscious or brain dead. As the trial judge pointed out in his well-reasoned memorandum denying a new trial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201cthere was substantial eyewitness testimony that the victim was still moving after a minimum of two punches. There was also substantial testimony from eyewitnesses that [the defendant] punched the victim anywhere from three up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ten or more times. Therefore, the information contained in Dr. Kessler\u2019s [a]bstract would not have provided [the defendant] with effective impeachment material.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">3. <em>Newly discovered evidence. </em>\u201cA defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish both that the evidence is newly discovered and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305 (1986). This standard requires a greater showing of the likelihood of prejudice than the standard set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>438 Mass. at 679-680, applicable when evidence is not disclosed by the prosecution despite a specific request. Accordingly, the claim based on newly discovered evidence is disposed of by our previous discussion. Moreover, we note that the judge considered that the numerous phone calls allegedly made by Christie to defense counsel during the trial \u201ccould and should have alerted the defense team to the issues they now raise,\u201d thus negating the claim that the evidence was \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d that is, not previously available.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">4. <em>Admission of photograph showing bruising of Nancy Blanchard\u2019s arm. </em>The defendant argues that while Blanchard\u2019s testimony was admissible to show the defendant\u2019s frame of mind as he reentered the building and allegedly pushed her aside, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 757 (1985), the photograph showing her bruises was irrelevant, prejudicial, and only served the improper purpose of showing \u201cthat the defendant had a violent character or a general propensity for violence.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The photograph, however, corroborated Blanchard\u2019s testimony. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to find it relevant and of probative value outweighing its prejudicial effect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz-Soto, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 648 (2000). There was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in its admission,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or in the prosecutor\u2019s appealing, in closing argument, to the common sense of the jury in suggesting that bruises are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>immediately visible but may take a day or two to appear. No expert medical testimony was required to support this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">5. <em>Sentencing. </em>In sentencing the defendant to six to ten years at M.C.I., Cedar Junction, the judge, finding aggravating circumstances,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> exceeded the nonbinding sentencing guidelines. The sentence, however, was well within the statutory maximum of twenty years. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The defendant argues that the judge imposed a \u201cdraconian\u201d sentence because he impermissibly considered uncharged conduct \u2014 a 1991 incident in which the defendant\u2019s wife petitioned a District Court for protection from domestic abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the beginning of the sentencing hearing, the defendant filed a motion to preclude the Commonwealth from mentioning the incident, but the judge ruled otherwise, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88 (1993). He also stated that he would make reference to the incident in his sentencing memorandum when he read it into the record, adding, \u201cBut it played a very, very small factor in my disposition, Mr. [defense counsel], I make reference to it. I allude to it only to explain my disappointment as to a certain aspect of the case. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">In his sentencing memorandum, the judge indicated his disappointment with the attempt of defense counsel to focus on the victim as culprit and counsel\u2019s disingenuous description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>defendant\u2019s character. He then noted that he \u201crecently learned that the July 5, 2000 incident at the Burbank Arena was not the first time that [the defendant] struck another adult in front of minor children.\u201d It was in this context that the judge cited the 1991 incident and quoted the defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. at 92, the court held that a judge, in assessing the several goals of sentencing, \u201cmay consider many factors which would not be relevant at trial including hearsay information about the defendant\u2019s character, behavior, and background.\u201d While \u201c \u2018a sentencing judge may not undertake to punish the defendant for any conduct other than that for which the defendant stands convicted\u2019 . . . Massachusetts decisions have recognized the relevance at sentencing of reliable evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>370 Mass. 217, 221 (1976). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, we see no indication that the judge punished the defendant for the 1991 incident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the G. L. c. 209A materials were not sufficiently reliable to be considered by the judge is without merit. \u201cIf the defendant heard allegations by the Commonwealth which he considered false, we would expect that he would have tried to rebut them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Settipane, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 648, 656 (1977). The burden was on the defendant to show their unreliability. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The trial judge charged the jury on voluntary manslaughter as well as involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In total, he found fifteen areas of trauma, among them an \u201cabrasion on his cheek with swelling around it for about two inches,\u201d \u201cprofuse swelling and bruising. . . surrounding] the entire [left] ear,\u201d a contusion over the left eyebrow, an abrasion of the right cheek, a bruise on the nose, a \u201clarge area of hemorrhage in the muscle\u201d under the skin of the left shoulder, abrasions on the hands, a \u201cmost deep bruise... [a] hemorrhage in the muscle\u201d in the mid-lower back, and a hemorrhage in the right side of the buttock.

We note, however, from the cross-examination of Dr. Kessler that his opinion at trial appears to have been consistent with his grand jury testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The prosecution in fact provided defense counsel with an updated copy of Dr. Kessler\u2019s curriculum vitae on the morning of his testimony. There were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>conflicting affidavits as to whether the Commonwealth had pointed out to the defense the addition of the abstract to the curriculum vitae, but the judge declined to decide the question because \u201c[ejven assuming all of the facts alleged by [the defendant] are true, [he] has failed to show that the Commonwealth\u2019s nondisclosure of Dr. Kessler\u2019s [a]bstract caused him prejudice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b155-14\">As noted earlier, Dr. Kessler found not just the rupture of the vertebral artery but also a second area of \u201csevere\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d bleeding in the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-15\">The defendant in his brief attempts to show another inconsistency between the abstract and Dr. Kessler\u2019s testimony. He quotes the abstract: \u201cTo make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>this diagnosis [of traumatic rupture of the vertebral artery] there must not be any other traumatic injury to the brain, durai coverings, spinal cord, or skull.\u201d The full quote is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cThere have been numerous reports in the recent forensic pathology literature discussing traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary to vertebral artery injuries. To make this diagnosis there must not be any other traumatic injury to the brain, durai coverings, spinal cord, or skull.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">In adding the bracketed material, the defendant changed the meaning. The diagnosis referred to in the abstract is <em>traumatic basilar subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary to vertebral artery injuries, </em>rather than the diagnosis of injury to the vertebral artery itself. That this is what was meant was borne out at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">Dr. Kanfer found no evidence in the autopsy of violent shaking of the brain because what \u201cone usually sees is (1) subarachnoid hemorrhage, which we don\u2019t see here,\u201d thus indicating that such shaking, as described by Dr. Kessler, would also cause subarachnoid hemorrhaging.
