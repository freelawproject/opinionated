(JM), fired Efrain Falcon, an at-will employee, he wrongfully interfered with Falcon\u2019s employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Leger claims that the evidence does not support a conclusion that his conduct in firing Falcon from his quality control job at JM constituted \u201cactual malice,\u201d and that the judge erroneously denied his motions for a directed verdict and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>judgment notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Leger argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he was not acting within the scope of his privilege to terminate an at-will employee when he let Falcon go, and that Falcon failed to overcome that privilege with sufficient evidence that Leger acted with a \u201cspiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest.\u201d <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Emmanuel College, </em>425 Mass. 761, 764 (1997), quoting from <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, </em>412 Mass. 469, 476 (1992); <em>Sereni </em>v. <em>Star Sportswear Mfg. Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 428, 433 (1987). We conclude otherwise and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Our examination of the record discloses sufficient evidence of malice on Leger\u2019s part to support a conclusion that he fired Falcon for Falcon\u2019s refusal to comply with his instructions to interfere with a product inspection process conducted by a private, independent testing laboratory upon which government inspectors rely to insure the safety of the public. Such conduct amounted to a violation of a clearly established public policy grounded in statutes and regulations designed to minimize potential hazards of fire and shock associated with poorly insulated electrical wire. Consequently, as Leger\u2019s actions did not comport with any legitimate corporate interest, Falcon succeeded in establishing that Leger abused his privilege to fire Falcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">1. <em>Facts</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a. <em>Background. </em>JM manufactures wire and cable. In late 1994 and early 1995, Falcon and Leger worked for JM at its South Lancaster plant. Falcon began working there in 1987, mainly in the quality control department, where he was directly responsible for inspecting and testing the various types of wire and cable produced at JM to ensure that they conformed to certain safety standards prior to shipping. If during his inspections, which occurred before the wire was spooled, Falcon determined the wire to be unsafe, he would instruct the machine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>operator to correct the problem. He would also report the nonconforming wire to his immediate supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Leger was hired by JM as general manager in February, 1994, with the expectation that he would correct some problems the company was having with quality control. Reporting directly to the president of JM, he was responsible for all departments, including quality control, and for all hiring and firing decisions. Until Falcon\u2019s discharge, Leger considered him to be a reliable and competent worker, who was rewarded with several raises. Falcon indicated that the two were generally amicable toward one another and that he knew of no reason why Leger would want to cause him harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Sixty percent of JM\u2019s total output was regularly sold through distributors to the industrial market. Such industrial wiring included fire alarm cable, typically installed in residences, hotels, and high rise buildings. JM industrial wire could also end up in elevators and home appliances. Such products ordinarily must meet strict safety standards meant to prevent fire and electrical shock. JM contracted with an independent, nonprofit organization, Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL), to perform periodic, unannounced testing of its products. Certification by an organization such as UL assures government inspectors and the public that the wire complies with the requisite UL standards and is safe for its intended purposes, and also signifies that JM had agreed to manufacture its wire and cable in accordance with those specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">As a prerequisite to obtaining a UL \u201clisting,\u201d which refers to the right to mark an approved product with the UL label, a manufacturer must sign a written agreement provided by UL. Under its agreement with UL, JM paid a fee for the right to purchase and affix UL labels upon approved wire and cable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> JM could purchase an unlimited quantity of labels, the prices of which varied depending upon the type of wire for which they were intended. JM stored the labels on its premises to await the step in the manufacturing process when they were placed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>product. The UL label for use on JM\u2019s control tray cable (tray cable), the wire at issue in this case, and entered into evidence at trial indicates, among other things, that the tray cable is \u201cUL LISTED\u201d for use in accordance with certain enumerated articles of the National Electrical Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">On UL\u2019s part, the organization agreed to provide regular, unannounced inspections of Usted products at JM\u2019s South Lancaster factory. The purpose of the inspections was to determine comphance with each of the requisite safety standards prior to labeling and shipping of JM\u2019s products bearing the UL label. In certain circumstances, a batch of wire, while technically nonconforming, could still be deemed acceptable for labeUng and shipping upon further consideration by the UL inspector as long as safety was not at issue and the variance was de minimis. In any event, it was the UL inspector, not JM, who controlled the ultimate resolution by requiring JM to avail itself of various options until the problem was corrected to UL\u2019s satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">EHzabeth Goldsmith served as the UL inspector for JM during the relevant period. She testified that the set of safety standards with which wire and cable products must conform prior to UL Hsting was created by UL in consultation with wire and cable manufacturers. These standards pertain to the safe conditions under which the wire may be used, such as temperature, locations (dry or wet), and the amount of maximum voltage for proper operation. UL standards also specify such criteria as the proper type and size of conductor wire and insulation, and the type and quality of compound to be used in making the insulation for the wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">According to Leger, a twenty-two-year veteran of the cable and wire industry, assessing the safety of wire and cable essentially involves a determination that it is \u201ccapable of carrying the electricity and not producing a shock or hazard.\u201d He further asserted that a UL inspector, whom he likened to a \u201cgovernment inspector,\u201d tests specifically for the electrical safety and flammability of the listed wire, criteria that could affect public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>safety. As an example, Leger spoke of a disastrous fire at a Las Vegas hotel involving UL approved wire that forced a reassessment and, ultimately, the creation by UL of stricter mandates for wiring in such buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Part of Falcon\u2019s job in quality control was to assist Goldsmith during her unannounced visits to JM\u2019s South Lancaster facility. Goldsmith would view sample wire cuttings under JM\u2019s microscope to determine the thickness of both the copper wire and the wire\u2019s insulation at various points. On other occasions, she would send samples of compound, the raw material from which insulation is made, to UL\u2019s laboratory for compliance testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">b. <em>Events leading to Falcon\u2019s discharge. </em>On December 7, 1994, Goldsmith visited JM and inspected samples from a lot of 50,000 feet of eighteen gouge, sixteen string, two conductor, 600 volt, \u201cType TC\u201d power and tray cable. The tray cable had been wound onto twenty reels while awaiting UL labeling for shipping to Anixter, a JM customer based in Ohio. Goldsmith rejected the batch as unsafe due to nonconforming insulation and placed the whole lot on hold. On the variation notice she issued to JM, Goldsmith indicated that the problem was a \u201cvery low wall\u201d of insulation where the two conductors intersected. Goldsmith\u2019s actual measurements ranged from a low of five to a high of twelve mils.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The minimum insulation width established by UL for tray cable was thirteen mils. A wire\u2019s over-all capacity to prevent shorting increases with the thickness of the wall surrounding each conductor. Although Goldsmith did not recall the substance of her conversations with either Leger or Falcon concerning her findings that day, she remembered being \u201chorrified\u201d at how thin the insulation was. According to Falcon, Goldsmith indicated that the order could be shipped without the UL label, but that it could not be sold for use as tray cable. On the variation notice, Goldsmith wrote, \u201cLot on hold pending disposition from [followup services]. Hold for release by U.L. rep.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Following Goldsmith\u2019s December 7, 1994, visit, Leger ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>peared concerned about Anixter\u2019s urgent need for its order, which had a specified delivery date of December 15, 1994. He admitted that any delay in its shipment would have been costly to JM.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Presuming that the defects in this order could be weeded out, Leger requested that Falcon and other employees go through the wire, eliminate the defective sections from the lot, and prepare it for reinspection.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Falcon complied, only to report to Leger days later that the wire in the order appeared to be bad throughout. According to both Leger and Falcon, it was not unusual for low points to occur in the insulation at the start-up of spooling, when tensions in the spooling machine are difficult to adjust. Ordinarily, since JM tacked on and billed for five to ten percent more wire than an order called for, problems with insulation thickness could be rectified by removing a few turns of wire from the reel and adjusting the price accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Falcon believed, based upon his experience and training in quality control and his own personal knowledge of the compound used to make the insulation on the lot of tray cable in question, that no amount of weeding of defective sections would have sufficed to correct the problem with the insulation thickness. According to him, the lot was most likely rejected because of JM\u2019s practice of mixing a nonconforming, \u201ccheap\u201d type of \u201cregrinded\u201d compound during the manufacturing process. From Falcon\u2019s perspective, such conduct by JM in violating UL standards was motivated by making profits at the expense of the safety of the general public. Falcon claimed that \u201csometimes we do things that is [sz'c] not legal\u201d at JM, such as \u201cship it out the way it is\u201d when in fact the wire does not meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>UL specifications. Falcon apparently had participated in shipping out nonconforming wire in the past, even though he knew it was wrong. He further testified that unless someone informed Goldsmith, she would have no way of knowing the exact type of compound that had been used on the tray cable. When insulation compound is tested, which did not occur in this instance, it is done off site and prior to the extrusion process during which the insulation is placed on the wire.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Despite his doubts about the safety of the wire\u2019s insulation, Falcon complied with Leger\u2019s order to resubmit the rejected shipment to Goldsmith for reinspection when she returned on December 16, 1994. It was no surprise to Falcon when Goldsmith found the insulation to be faulty and once again ordered the shipment held.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Following Goldsmith\u2019s reinspection on December 16, 1994, Leger told Falcon to hide the whole batch of tray cable in the back of the factory and to conceal it with cardboard. To Falcon\u2019s knowledge, the bad batch of tray cable remained there until some time in early February, 1995, when Leger further ordered him to load all twenty reels on to a rental truck, where it stayed for some time, unchanged, and forever hidden from Goldsmith.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">On the afternoon of February 9, 1995, Goldsmith unexpectedly returned for a final, third inspection of the Anixter order. She did not inspect the wire hidden in the rental truck on this visit. Falcon was convinced that JM deceived Goldsmith by substituting and presenting for inspection a new, conforming batch of wire in its place, and that the rejected wire was mislabeled and shipped as if it had been approved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Falcon had arrived at work around 6:00 a.m. on February 9, 1995. Within an hour or so of his arrival, he approached Leger to request a raise in his hourly pay, from $9.75 to $11 an hour. According to Falcon, Leger responded that he had no problem with the raise, but said \u201cyou have to change the way you deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>with Elizabeth [Goldsmith].\u201d When Falcon asked for clarification, Leger said, \u201cYou know we most of the time use [the] wrong compound or [the] wrong wire, but you cannot tell her that, you have to cover my back and you\u2019ve got to say that we\u2019re using the right compound, the right wire.\u201d At this point, Falcon said that he could not do that, to which Leger replied, \u201cWho pays you?\u201d Falcon answered, \u201cBut that\u2019s not legal, [] to lie for you.\u201d When Goldsmith arrived at the plant later that day and inquired of Falcon about the whereabouts of the twice-rejected wire, Falcon ignored Leger\u2019s instructions to he. Rather, he told her \u201cno comment,\u201d and directed her to \u201csee Mr. Leger.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Falcon contends that this action cost him his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Leger met with Goldsmith after her February 9, 1995, inspection. Neither testified as to the substance of their conversation. Shortly after she left, Falcon claims that he labeled the old wire with UL labels, and shipped it to Anixter, per Leger\u2019s instructions. At the end of Falcon\u2019s shift, Leger called him to his office where Leger told him he had no recourse but to fire him. Leger\u2019s stated reason was the abrasive and threatening manner in which Falcon had asked for the raise in front of other employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">2. <em>UL listing and the statutory framework. </em>Tray cable wire, the type of wire at issue in this case, is intended to be installed in settings and in products that are subject to the National Electrical Code (NEC), and several NEC articles govern its use. The UL label affixed to the tray cable in this case states that the tray cable is \u201cUL listed [] for use in accordance with Articles 318, 340, 500 and 501 of the National Electrical Code.\u201d Consequently, the label indicates the tray cable complies with the law of those states, such as Massachusetts, that have adopted the NEC in relevant part. See 527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 12:00 et seq. (1993). The 1993 Massachusetts electrical code, 527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 12.00 et seq., is the 1993 NEC as adopted and modified in part by the Commonwealth\u2019s board of fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>prevention regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It was in effect in December, 1994, through February 9, 1995. General Laws c. 148, \u00a7 10B, as amended by St. 1978, c. 295, provides: \u201cAny person who knowingly violates any rule or regulation made by the board of fire prevention regulations shall, except as otherwise provided, be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The intent of the Massachusetts electrical code is \u201cthe practical safeguarding of persons and property from hazards arising from the use of electricity,\u201d 527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12:00, art. 90-1. The State building code, 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 100 et seq. (1992), the intent of which is \u201cto insure public safety, health and welfare . . . and, in general, to secure safety to life and property,\u201d controls \u201cthe standards or requirements for materials to be used in connection [with buildings] including but not limited to provisions for safety.\u201d 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 100.2, 100.4.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The building code incorporates the electrical code into its provisions. G. L. c. 143, \u00a7\u00a7 94(a), 96; 780 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 100.5 &amp; Appendix G.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Porrazzo, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 169, 171 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">According to the Massachusetts electrical code, only \u201cUsted\u201d equipment and materials (i.e., those of which a representative sample have been approved and tested by a certified, independent laboratory) are acceptable in certain installations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See, e.g., 527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12:00, arts. 240-4, 310-6, 310-8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>(a-b), and 318-3(b)(l). Further, the Commonwealth\u2019s State and municipal inspectors may rely upon a wire\u2019s label, issued by an independent testing laboratory, as \u201cproof that such equipment and materials have been tested and conform to suitable recognized industry standards.\u201d 527 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 12:00, Rule 6. See <em>id.., </em>arts. 90-4 (\u201cThe authority having jurisdiction of enforcement of the Code shall accept listed and labeled equipment or materials where used or installed in accordance with instructions included with the listing or labeling\u201d), and 110-3 (\u201cSuitability of equipment may be evidenced by listing or labeling\u201d). A manufacturer is not required to choose UL as the particular listing organization with which it contracts for its listing and certification process. See note 14, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Viewing the evidence in the tight most favorable to Falcon, <em>Cort </em>v. <em>Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 301 (1982), we conclude that it permitted a rational jury to find that Leger\u2019s actions leading up to and including Falcon\u2019s termination were improperly motivated by Leger\u2019s frustration with Falcon\u2019s resistance to his scheme to deceive a UL safety inspector. This evidence sufficed to prove the requisite malevolent intent because, as matter of law, such conduct on the part of Leger violated a well-defined public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In cases alleging tortious interference by the employee\u2019s supervisor or other company official who instigated the firing, malice means \u201cactual malice\u201d and \u201c[a]ny reasonable inference of malice must ... be \u2018based on probabilities rather than possibilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gram </em>v. <em>Mutual Liberty, Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 659, 663-664 (1981), <em>S.C., </em>391 Mass. 333 (1984), quoting from <em>Alholm </em>v. <em>Wareham, </em>371 Mass. 621, 627 (1976). See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Community Teamwork, Inc., </em>434 Mass. 761, 781-783 (2001). \u201cActual malice,\u201d in this context, requires the demonstration by a preponderance of the evidence of \u201ca spiteful, malignant purpose, unrelated to the legitimate corporate interest\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>part of the individual alleged to have been responsible for effecting the discharge. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, </em>412 Mass. at 476, quoting from <em>Sereni </em>v. <em>Star Sportswear Mfg. Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. at 433. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>418 Mass. 576, 587 (1994); <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass. 465, 479 n.16 (2001) (\u201cThere is no practical difference . . . between \u2018actual malice\u2019 and <em>improper </em>motives and means for purposes of [the tort of intentional interference by a corporate officer or supervisory employee]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">In some circumstances, malice may be demonstrated by evidence of the defendant\u2019s unjustified personal vendetta or ill will exceeding personal dislike of the employee. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>422 Mass. 686, 690 (1996) (supervisor\u2019s harassing behavior toward employee malicious where it was \u201cprompted by his resentment of [the employee\u2019s] successful challenges to his decisions and her refusal to transfer out of his department\u201d); <em>Mailhiot </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 527 (1987) (supervisor\u2019s fabricated allegations concerning employee found to be malicious). To the extent that Leger argues that Falcon presented insufficient evidence of an improper motive grounded in ill will, we are in agreement. Nothing in the record indicates that Leger\u2019s role in terminating Falcon from employment was motivated by any malicious intent to cause him harm. Nevertheless, we do not conclude, as Leger urges, that the underlying corporate activity of which Falcon complains is an \u201cinternal matter\u201d such that Leger acted completely within the scope of his responsibilities when he fired Falcon.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">It is well established that Massachusetts law does not protect at-will employees who claim to be fired for their complaints about internal company policies or the violation of company rules, even though the employees\u2019 actions may be considered appropriate and \u201csocially desirable.\u201d <em>Smith-Pfeffer </em>v. <em>Superintendent of the Walter E. Fernald State Sch., </em>404 Mass. 145, 150-151 (1989) (discharge of employee for her opposition to internal restructuring of State school for mentally retarded not actionable under public policy exception). See <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., </em>402 Mass. 555, 560-561 (1988); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Shriners Hosp. for Crippled Children, supra </em>at 474-475.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>In <em>Wright, </em>a nurse\u2019s report to a private professional organization about perceived managerial inadequacies at the hospital was ruled an internal matter to which the public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine did not apply. There, the court concluded that no statute applied to Wright\u2019s situation, and that the trial judge\u2019s view, based in part on State laws requiring reporting of patient abuse, was unsupported by the record. <em>Id. </em>at 473-474. The employee\u2019s reports did not allege any patient abuse or other conditions that would implicate mandated reporting. <em>Id. </em>at 474. Nor was the court aware of \u201cany statute that clearly expresses a legislative policy to encourage nurses to make the type of internal report involved in this case.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Similarly, in <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos., supra, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s discharge allegedly occurred as a result of three reports he made to his superiors about wrongdoing by store managers and buyers. Although the plaintiff failed to prove causation, the court noted that even if he had met his burden in this regard, two of his reports were unprotected by the public policy exception where they related solely to internal matters: the company\u2019s buyers\u2019 alleged personal use of rebate checks meant for the company and the managers\u2019 practice of presenting false damage and shortage claims to the company\u2019s own warehouse. <em>Ibid. </em>Termination based solely on the employee\u2019s third report, however, might have triggered liability as, unlike the wrongdoing described in the other two reports, the alleged fraud was perpetrated not on the company but on the outside manufacturers and suppliers with whom the company did business. <em>Id. </em>at 560 &amp; n.6. In sum, no matter how well-meaning the employee\u2019s efforts may be, and regardless of a possible public interest served by those efforts, so long as the underlying corporate activity remains confined to matters that are strictly internal to the employer, the public policy exception cannot be invoked to protect the at-will employee from discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On the other hand, \u201c[rjedress is available for employees who are terminated for asserting a legally guaranteed right (e.g., filing workers\u2019 compensation claim), for doing what the law requires (e.g., serving on a jury), or for refusing to do that which the law forbids (e.g., committing perjury).\u201d <em>Smith-Pfeffer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>v. <em>Superintendent of the Walter E. Fernald State Sch., </em>404 Mass. at 149-150 (citations omitted). In such instances, we look essentially to the substance of the complaint rather than to whom it is presented. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Emmanuel College, </em>425 Mass. at 763 (adopting logical approach that employee\u2019s good faith internal complaint of employer\u2019s violation of criminal law need not have been reported to public authorities in order to succeed under public policy exception). See also <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop Cos, </em>402 Mass. at 560 n.6 (\u201cWe assume . . . that an at-will employee who \u2018blew the whistle\u2019 within his company on wrongdoing is entitled to protection [even though before discharge he did not complain to public authorities]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Here, the evidence supported the conclusion that Falcon was discouraged, both explicitly by Leger and by the implicit threat of discharge, from reporting suspected UL violations by JM that had the potential to affect the safety of the population at large. Falcon\u2019s good faith dispute with management over an electrical product deemed to be unsafe by an independent testing laboratory concerned much more than just matters internal to JM.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Our cases have suggested that an employee could be shielded from the risk of discharge if he or she reasonably, but perhaps erroneously, reports that an employer is violating State and municipal laws and ordinances concerning public safety. See <em>ibid, </em>(court assumes, without deciding, that \u201cwhistleblowing based on a reasonable, good faith [but erroneous] belief that the employer is violating the law should be protected in particular instances\u201d). See also <em>Hobson </em>v. <em>McLean Hosp. Corp., </em>402 Mass. 413, 416 (1988) (hospital employee responsible for enforcing State safety regulations governing patient care, alleging to have been fired for performing her job accordingly, stated claim for wrongful termination under public policy exception). Compare <em>Mistishen </em>v. <em>Falcone Piano Co., </em>36 Mass. App. Ct. 243, 246 (1994). In <em>Mistishen, </em>the plaintiff alleged that she was terminated for expressing disapproval of the employer\u2019s failure to disclose to customers the poor quality of the employer\u2019s product: pianos. <em>Id. </em>at 244. In dismissing her action for failure to state a claim, we duly noted that \u201c[w]hile the act performed by the plaintiff might be viewed by some as appropriate and socially desirable,\u201d what proved fatal to her claim was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>absence of any allegation that the employer\u2019s \u201cwrongdoing put the consumer in harm\u2019s way or otherwise presented a threat to public health or safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Here, Falcon presented ample evidence that Leger\u2019s conduct, although possibly not \u201cillegal\u201d in the sense of creating criminal liability, as Falcon may have believed, nevertheless presented a threat to the public safety and was otherwise unlawful. Examination of the applicable statutes and regulations indicates that the relationship between UL safety standards and the NEC is such that any attempt to interfere with UL testing and labeling procedures is tantamount to committing a fraud upon those State inspectors who rely upon UL procedures to ensure public safety. Where Falcon\u2019s claims are grounded in regulations directly bearing on public safety, we will give weight to the statement of public policy that such regulations represent. See <em>Smith-Pfeffer </em>v. <em>Superintendent of the Walter E. Fernald State Sch., </em>404 Mass. at 151 (issue whether public policy was violated is question of law for judge, not jury). Hence, we conclude that the facts in the instant case are more akin to the allegations set forth in <em>Hobson </em>(plaintiff alleging discharge for attempting to enforce patient safety regulations, for which the court concluded liability could be imposed, if proved) than those advanced in <em>Wright </em>(professional code of ethics) and totally lacking in Smith-Pfeffer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-15\">Falcon also made a claim against JM in a separate count for wrongful termination in violation of public policy. The jury found for JM on this count. See note 15, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">We review the evidence most favorable to Falcon to determine \u201cwhether anywhere in the evidence, from whatever source derived, any combination of circumstances could be found from which a reasonable inference could be drawn in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Boothby </em>v. <em>Texon, Inc., </em>414 Mass. 468, 470 (1993), quoting from <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b384-8\">JM could lose the right to adhere UL labels to any of its products if JM were to habitually ship its customers wire that a UL inspector had rejected as unsafe and placed on hold. JM could also risk the recall of such mislabeled products, presumably at its own expense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">An inspector from UL, Elizabeth Goldsmith, testified that the only difference between the label admitted as an exhibit at trial and the label JM would have used in 1994 and 1995 was the addition of the JM name. At that time JM used a \u201cgeneric\u201d label.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) defines a \u201cmil\u201d as \u201ca unit of length equal to Viooo inch or 0.0254 millimeter used esp. for the diameter of wire.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As a rule, JM would scrap wire rejected by UL and sell it to a scrap reclaimer at a lower price than it would have received had the wire passed inspection. Washing off a UL label for resale was neither practical nor profitable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Prior to that, on December 8, 1994, Leger had written a letter to William Kline, a UL official, in which Leger acknowledged that he did \u201cnot totally disagree with [Goldsmith\u2019s] rejection\u201d of the tray cable. Leger suggested an alternative method of testing that would allow the product to be released to Anixter, so long as the low points tested within two to three mils of the specified standard. Although Goldsmith recalled that Kline may have expressed an intent to allow JM some further reduction in the minimum insulation widths on the order, she could remember nothing more about that conversation. The record is unclear as to whether JM was allowed to resolve the problem in this manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b388-12\">GoIdsmith claimed to have no reason to believe that the tray cable submitted to her at the third inspection on February 9, 1995, was not the same batch that she had previously tested and rejected on December 7 and December 16, 1994, and that it had been made compliant and could be released. She acknowledged, however, that she knew of nothing to prevent a manufacturer from shipping a product that UL had rejected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Falcon claimed that he had also referred Goldsmith to Leger on the first inspection when Goldsmith asked him what kind of compound had been used on the wire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\">See G.

Once the jury made the factual determination that JM neither deliberately mislabeled nor shipped non-UL approved cable, they proceeded no further, as instructed on the special verdict form. Thus, they did not reach the issue whether JM terminated the plaintiff in violation of any public policy. Consequently, no significance can be attached to the verdict on the count against JM, particularly with reference to Leger and the evidence presented against him individually on the count alleging tortious interference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
