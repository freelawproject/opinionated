See <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Piela, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 731 (2004). In this appeal from a judgment of modification, Philip Cooper also challenges the increased alimony award, claiming that Peggy Cooper, his former wife, failed to establish a material change in circumstances justifying increases in alimony and child support and that the increases were excessive in relation to the parties\u2019 station in life during the marriage. Philip contends that the magnitude of the modified alimony and child support orders effects an improper revision of the parties\u2019 property distribution. Also before us are Philip\u2019s appeal from a judgment finding him guilty of contempt and his challenges to various orders awarding attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">A. <em>Modification judgment. </em>1. <em>Background. </em>The parties\u2019 divorce ended a nineteen-year marriage during which three children were bom. Pursuant to their June 15, 1995, divorce judgment nisi, which incorporated and merged the parties\u2019 separation agreement, Peggy was to have primary physical custody of the children (three, ten, and thirteen years old at the time), and Philip was to pay Peggy monthly child support totaling $4,99.8 ($1,666 per month for each of the children), subject to cost-of-living adjustments and a reduction of forty percent in each child\u2019s allocated support payment as that child entered college. The parties agreed to share the children\u2019s uninsured medical and dental expenses and the cost of Hebrew school and academic tutoring. To the extent college expenses were not covered by funds maintained for the benefit of the children, the parties agreed they would each contribute to this expense in light of their financial circumstances at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The marital home in Weston was to be sold, but until then Peggy and the children were to continue to live there. The home was already on the market, at an asking price of $ 1.9 million, when the agreement was executed. The parties agreed to share in the net proceeds from the sale, after payment of the mortgages and certain other debts and after funding accounts (for expenses such as uninsured medical care, and for college) that had been established for the children. From his share of the proceeds, Philip was to pay Peggy an additional sum of $142,152, representing her share in other marital assets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Philip agreed to pay Peggy, a full-time homemaker during the marriage, $2,500 per month in alimony,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> payments not to begin until after the sale of the marital home. The house sat on the market for much longer than the parties had anticipated, and without alimony, Peggy experienced difficulty in meeting her living expenses and those of the children. A $100,000 equity line of credit, which the parties had taken out to pay the first mortgage payments of principal and interest, real estate taxes, and insurance on the house during the period it was on the market, was exhausted by January, 1996. In order to continue to meet the carrying costs of the still unsold house, the mortgages were refinanced and additional funds borrowed. A new first mortgage in the principal sum of $875,000 was used to pay off the original first mortgage in the amount of $687,000 and the $100,000 drawn against the equity fine. The house finally sold, in February, 1997, for $1.15 million. There were no proceeds subject to division after paying the mortgage and certain debts of the parties and funding the children\u2019s accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Following the sale, and because she could not find a house she could afford in Weston, Peggy purchased a smaller home in Sharon for $328,000 and moved there with the three children. Philip, who had remarried in June of 1996, purchased and extensively remodeled another home in Weston, just twelve houses away from the former marital residence. He lives there with his current wife, Lisette; their son; and Lisette\u2019s son from a prior marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">2. <em>The proceedings. </em>When the Weston house still had not sold five months after the parties agreed to sell it, Peggy filed a complaint for modification alleging as material changes in the parties\u2019 circumstances the failure of the house to sell as anticipated, increased expenses, and improvements to Philip\u2019s financial circumstances. She requested increases in child support and that Philip pay the carrying costs of the house until it sold. Peggy also asked to have alimony payments commence immediately (but did not then ask for an increase in alimony). Because the mortgage refinancing had substantially depleted the equity in the home, she sought a reallocation of her share of debts that were to have been paid out of the sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">By the time of the eventual trial on this complaint, Philip\u2019s financial circumstances had dramatically improved. In 1995, the year of the hearing on the divorce, Philip earned $270,000; he received an additional $30,000 as a member of various corporate boards. Little more than a year later, in August, 1996, Philip joined the New York investment firm Goldman Sachs, LP, as a portfolio manager; his salary, annualized, would have been $600,000 for the year. His income structure in 1997 provided Philip with a base salary of $150,000 plus cash bonuses. His 1997 bonus was $1.1 million; in 1998, it was $1.45 million. In December, 1998, upon Philip\u2019s promotion to managing director, his base salary doubled to $300,000; his bonus in 1999 was $1,947,500. In addition, following an initial public offering of the firm approved by the partners in early 1999, a number of options and shares in the common stock of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., were made available to certain executives, including Philip.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">In April, 1999, when the parties were in court in connection with Peggy\u2019s motion for temporary orders, they entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>stipulation increasing child support payments from $4,998 to $13,125 per month.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Philip continued to pay alimony under the terms of the divorce judgment, which now was $2,602 per month. Two months later, over Philip\u2019s objection, Peggy was given leave to amend her modification complaint to add a request for increased alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Following trial, which occurred over six days in September and December, 1999, the Probate and Family Court judge modified the divorce judgment by significantly increasing child support (to $13,125 per month) and alimony (by adding an amount equal to eighteen percent of Philip\u2019s bonuses), and imposing on Philip the sole financial burden of the children\u2019s education, medical expenses and costs of their extracurricular activities. Philip appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">3. <em>Discussion. </em>Our review recognizes that, in fashioning an appropriate modification judgment, the probate judge enjoys considerable discretion, and the judgment will not be reversed unless it is \u201cplainly wrong.\u201d <em>Schuler </em>v. <em>Schuler, </em>382 Mass. 366, 368 (1981). This standard is deferential to a judge\u2019s decision, but that deference is not without limit. <em>Boulter-Hedley </em>v. <em>Boulter, </em>429 Mass. 808, 811 (1999). \u201cError of law apparent on the record, such as the failure of a judge\u2019s findings to support the judge\u2019s action \u00f3r findings that have no support in the evidence, would constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 521 (2000). When the judgment to be modified incorporates an agreement of the parties, we have said that, notwithstanding that the agreement does not survive the judgment as a binding contract, we nevertheless will \u201creview the findings to determine whether the judge gave appropriate consideration to the parties\u2019 intentions as expressed in their written agreement, . . . and to any changes in their circumstances since the last modification judgment.\u201d <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>Huddleston, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 563, 568 (2001). See <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. 635, 644 (1999) (\u201cTo the extent possible, and consistent with common sense and justice, the modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>judgment should take into account the earlier, expressed desires of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">a. <em>Child support. </em>We emphasize that the circumstances to which our discussion applies are those falling far outside of the Massachusetts Child Support Guidelines, in which a noncustodial parent\u2019s very substantial income (or other sources of support) permits him or her to enjoy a highly elevated standard of living. In such cases, the ability to pay any rationally based award is conceded, and the dispute focuses on what constitutes a reasonable award.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Here, the modification judgment ordered that monthly child support payments be increased to $13,125, or $157,500 per year, with payments to continue, without adjustment for college matriculation, until the youngest child\u2019s emancipation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Philip was also ordered to pay the children\u2019s uninsured medical and dental expenses and the costs of \u201call of the children\u2019s extracurricular activities and summer camp (including, without limitation, tutoring, if applicable).\u201d The judge\u2019s stated bases for these modifications were (1) changes in the parties\u2019 circumstances, including Philip\u2019s substantially increased income as well as the delay in the sale of the Weston house and the attendant financial burdens that this imposed on Peggy; (2) the needs of the children, determined \u201cin the context of their former station in Ufe,\u201d their father\u2019s higher standard of Uving, and changes in the children\u2019s emotional and physical health since the divorce; and (3) Philip\u2019s trial stipulations, in which he agreed to be solely responsible for the costs associated with the private school and college educations of the three children and their uninsured medical and dental costs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">On appeal, PhiUp challenges as excessive the amount of the monthly child support order (at least when coupled with the increased alimony order), but makes no separate challenge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>orders that he pay college tuition and other expenses of the children. As to the claim of excessive child support, he argues that (1) the children\u2019s needs had not materially changed since the divorce, and (2) the amount of the current award, as well as the order requiring that he pay this amount without adjustment (as provided for in the parties\u2019 agreement) as each child attends college and then becomes emancipated, is \u201can example of a punitive and impermissible post-divorce mechanism for property division.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Although Philip\u2019s reliance on <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. 477 (1996), to support this proposition is misplaced,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we have elsewhere suggested that where a child support award is excessive and not rationally related to the reasonable needs of children, it \u201cmay constructively distribute the noncustodial parent\u2019s estate, provide a windfall to the child and custodial spouse, and infringe upon the noncustodial parent\u2019s right to direct the lifestyle of his or her children.\u201d <em>Pearson </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 160 (2001). On the other hand, we have said \u201cchildren\u2019s needs are to be defined, at least in part, by their parents\u2019 standard of living and . . . .children are entitled to participate in the noncustodial parent\u2019s higher standard of living when available resources permit.\u201d <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Piela, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. at 737. A determination of a child\u2019s reasonable needs will vary with the parties\u2019 circumstances. It is within the sound discretion of a probate judge who has appropriately considered the parties\u2019 circumstances during the marriage as well as at the time of any modification proceeding, and the child\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>interests, to determine whether and to what extent a child\u2019s needs are unmet by an existing order. Cf. <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>406 Mass. 236, 242-243 (1989); <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 161, 165 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Here, the probate judge appropriately took into account Philip\u2019s significantly enhanced standard of living since the divorce and changes in the circumstances of the parties that had the effect of reducing the children\u2019s standard of living when residing with Peggy. The fact that Philip agreed to be responsible for all of the children\u2019s college costs and other expenses related to their extracurricular activities and that he had, in connection with Peggy\u2019s motion for temporary orders, stipulated that $13,125 per month was an appropriate level of child support, was also relevant to the judge\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Although the award was high and we might have made a different order, in light of the foregoing we cannot say that the judge abused her discretion in making the award she did for current child support. However, we find nothing in the findings to support that aspect of the order requiring Philip to continue to pay $157,500 per year without adjustment for the emancipation of the older children. In the absence of such findings, and because the findings also reflect no consideration of the parties\u2019 intentions as to future adjustments, we vacate this provision in the judgment of modification and remand the issue for further consideration. See <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. at 645. Cf. Child Support Guidelines, preamble (providing for modification upon showing of twenty percent discrepancy between current child support order and what the guidelines would provide unless, inter alla, current order resulted from \u201can agreement of the parties and there has not been a change in the circumstances which resulted in a rebuttal of the guideline amount\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">b. <em>Alimony. </em>The modification judgment substantially increased Philip\u2019s alimony obligation. In addition to the $2,602 per month provided for by the parties\u2019 separation agreement \u2014 which, under the modification judgment, was to be paid from Philip\u2019s base salary \u2014 the judgment ordered additional alimony in an amount equal to eighteen percent of the gross cash portion of any bonus he received. Based on this order, additional, retroactive alimony was awarded for 1998 in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>$198,000, for 1999 in the amount of $261,000, and for 2000 in the amount of $350,550 (with six percent simple interest added to the awards due for 1998 and 1999). In addition, the judgment ordered that, on or before February 1, 2001, Philip was to pay alimony equal to eighteen percent of his \u201cgross income from the [Goldman Sachs] IPO award,\u201d requiring a further payment in the amount of $92,945.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">To support the increase in alimony, the judge found that during their marriage the Coopers had enjoyed a \u201cvery high standard of living.\u201d They had lived in the \u201caffluent community\u201d of Weston since 1981, owned seven \u201cexpensive\u201d cars, and an airplane in which they flew to Nantucket for dinner. The parties entertained frequently in their 7,000 square foot home, which boasted five bedrooms, six bathrooms, an au pair suite (in which a full-time au pair had resided) and guest quarters. Peggy and Philip traveled often and vacationed at \u201cexclusive resorts,\u201d and Peggy and the children went to Florida twice yearly to visit family. The children went away to expensive camps.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The judge determined that Peggy had suffered a decline in this affluent lifestyle since the divorce, moving to a more modest home, eating out less often and at cheaper restaurants and vacationing on a budget, while Philip suffered no such decline.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The judge properly focused on the parties\u2019 marital lifestyle in assessing Peggy\u2019s current needs. See <em>Kittredge </em>v. <em>Kittredge, </em>441 Mass. 28, 44 (2004); <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 611-612 (1990); <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Kehoe, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 958, 959 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, indicia of that marital lifestyle as reflected in the findings were without reference to the cost of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>maintaining it, making it difficult to assess the propriety of the judge\u2019s order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This difficulty is exacerbated by additional findings and evidence that belie the level of current support needed to maintain Peggy in the lifestyle she enjoyed while married. The judge found that, at the time of the divorce, the parties were paying approximately $9,300 per month to run the 7,000 square foot house, including $1,000 for grounds maintenance. There was evidence that Peggy\u2019s expenses and those of the children while living in Weston totaled $3,741 weekly, or $194,532 per year, an amount entirely consistent with annual household income of $300,000.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> There was no finding that the parties lived beyond their means during the marriage in order to support their affluent lifestyle.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Weishaus </em>v. <em>Weishaus, </em>360 N.J. Super. 281, 289 (App. Div. 2003) (when determining parties\u2019 standard of living during marriage, appropriate to consider earnings that supported it as well as whether it was supported by liquidation of family assets, borrowing, or gifts), <em>affd. in part, </em>180 N.J. 131, 144-145 (2004). The judge made no findings regarding the parties\u2019 intentions, as reflected in the separation agreement. See <em>Bercume </em>v. <em>Bercume, </em>428 Mass. at 643-645. There were, for example, no findings indicating to what extent the increases in Philip\u2019s income were contemplated by the parties or whether the separation agreement provided Peggy with sufficient property and support to enable her to live in the station she had enjoyed while married.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The judge\u2019s subsidiary findings do not support the ultimate finding that the alimony award does \u201cnot. . . equalize the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ties\u2019 current station in life but . . . ensure[s] that the station in life acquired <em>during the marriage </em>is maintained\u201d (emphasis in original). The total support awarded (alimony and child support was $508,000 for the year 2000) is far in excess of what the record evidence suggests would be needed to maintain the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties while married. In the absence of specific findings, grounded in evidence, that the amount was consistent with that lifestyle, the award cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">To the extent that the amount of the award relies on the judge\u2019s finding that it was made in part to \u201censur[e] future continuity of the former marital station,\u201d it also was improper. An alimony award that exceeds current need, so as to permit accumulation of assets or savings for the future, may be appropriate only when that award is made pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. \u201cUnder G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, alimony and property division are interrelated. . . . Need is a major element, but obviously not the only one, in an equitable distribution of property under \u00a7 34.\u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904 (1992). However, \u201cwhere the trial court has previously passed on the issue of alimony in the divorce judgment, the correct course of action ... is the post-divorce complaint for modification, implicating the traditional test of a material change in circumstances.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 716, 719 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We therefore vacate so much of the judgment as awards alimony in excess of that provided under the original divorce judgment. On remand, any additional award of alimony shall be made only on appropriate findings that reflect the considerations outlined in this opinion, including whether increases in Philip\u2019s income were of such a magnitude as to be well in excess of adjustments to income reasonably anticipated by the parties\u2019 separation agreement; and whether the agreement\u2019s provisions for support and property were inadequate to maintain Peggy in the standard of living enjoyed by the parties while married.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">c. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The judge awarded $252,275.93 in attorney\u2019s fees and expenses<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> incurred by Peggy in connection with her prosecution of the modification complaint, consisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>of $198,351.69 for the fees and costs of her current counsel, $16,877.24 for her prior counsel, and $37,047 in expert witness fees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Philip contends that the amount awarded for the services rendered by Peggy\u2019s current attorneys was unreasonable, in that the case was relatively straightforward and the efforts of multiple counsel likely resulted in a duplication of effort; that substantial time was devoted to successor counsel becoming educated abut the case, after taking over from prior counsel; and that Philip\u2019s conduct did not cause delay in the proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He took issue with approximately $7,000 that was assessed in connection with the expert\u2019s fees, as not \u201creasonably corresponding] with the scope of the problem presented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The probate judge has discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees in appropriate circumstances. G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38. We will not disturb an award that is \u201cnot incommensurate with an objective evaluation of the services performed.\u201d <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>385 Mass. 30, 38-39 (1982), citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>361 Mass. 733, 738 (1972). In determining the propriety of an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a domestic relations setting, we have identified as among the relevant factors to be considered \u201cthe ability of the wife\u2019s counsel, the work performed, the results secured, the time spent, the hourly rates, the existence of contemporaneous time records, the financial positions of the parties, and the husband\u2019s obstructionist conduct which prolonged the proceedings . . . .\u201d <em>Downey </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 812, 819 (2002). \u201cWe recognize that a calculation of attorney\u2019s fees requires an exercise of judgment involving the application of many factors, and that any award made will be entitled to considerable respect on review.\u201d <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 576, 582 (1983), quoting from <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 557, 560 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>(1982). See <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 542 (1985) (award should take into account \u201cthe fact that we do not have a claim of counsel against their own client, but a claim against the adversary. Therefore the fees these counsel could reasonably charge to their own clients for like services must be checked against an independent, \u2018objective\u2019 valuation of the services they rendered in fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The judge\u2019s findings reflect that, in arriving at the award, she relied upon her extensive knowledge of the case and her observation of counsel, see <em>id. </em>at 543 n.10, as well as on the affidavits of counsel and their written submissions detailing the billing rate of the attorneys and tax expert, identifying the nature of the services rendered and the corresponding amount of time spent, as well as the relationship of the services rendered to the proceedings. There is evidence in the record of the judge\u2019s thorough consideration of all of the relevant submissions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The judge said that she had \u201cconsidered the amounts involved, the importance of the issues, and the amount of time reasonably demanded of counsel.\u201d She found that the rates charged by Peggy\u2019s counsel were reasonable, in light of their experience, training, reputation, and demonstrated skills. Her findings point to the fact that in addition to trial, numerous pretrial contested motions required preparation and appearances by Peggy\u2019s attorneys, and her fees were increased due to \u201cPhilip\u2019s continued failure to comply with discovery requests.\u201d She noted as well that at trial the attorneys \u201cdivided certain tasks . . . between them in an efficient manner so as to avoid unnecessary duplication.\u201d The judge also took into account Peggy\u2019s financial circumstances and the relative differences in the parties\u2019 resources. See <em>Hano </em>v. <em>Hano, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 639, 642 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The judge considered the tax expert\u2019s experience and training, and the reasonableness of the expert\u2019s hourly rate compared to that of similarly qualified experts appearing before the court on similar issues. Cf. <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>982, 983 (1986). She found the expert to be \u201chighly qualified\u201d and that he had provided the court with \u201cinvaluable expertise with respect to the quite complex financial aspects of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The findings evince a consideration of the appropriate factors and were sufficiently supported by the evidence. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">It was also not an abuse of discretion to award Peggy attorney\u2019s fees to defend against Philip\u2019s appeal. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38; <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 932, 933-934 (1991). In awarding $30,000, the judge could take into account the \u201cimbalance of power and control\u201d between the parties throughout the proceeding, Philip\u2019s obstructionist tactics, and the parties\u2019 respective financial positions. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 864, 881 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">B. <em>Contempt judgment. A </em>judgment entered, pursuant to Peggy\u2019s complaint for civil contempt, that adjudicated Philip to be in contempt for failing to pay alimony as required by the modification judgment, and ordered that he pay attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $13,825.62. Philip appealed from the contempt adjudication and the award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">We reject Philip\u2019s argument that his failure to pay was excused during the pendency of motions seeking to stay the modification judgment. See Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 62(g) (1992) (filing an appeal \u201cshall not stay the operation . . . [ii] of any other order or judgment of the court relative to . . . alimony, support, or maintenance\u201d); <em>Keller </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>425 Mass. 774, 785 (1997) (following a denial of alimony termination, absent the allowance of a stay, the payor spouse must continue alimony payment pending the appellate court\u2019s decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">We agree, however, that an adjudication of contempt is precluded by the judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthe [hjusband eventually did pay the money, and has purged his contempt prior to the hearing.\u201d See <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Sarkis, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 152, 156-157 (2002). \u201cThe husband\u2019s appeal from this judgment therefore reduces itself to the argument that he should not have been assessed attorney\u2019s fees. There was, however, ample basis for the judge to exercise her discretion under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38, to order an award of attorney\u2019s fees payable to the wife\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>in order to mitigate expenses incurred as a result of the husband\u2019s obstructionist conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">As the judge also found, Peggy was caused to incur legal fees and costs in connection with prosecuting a contempt action to enforce the judgment; Philip sought no stay of the order until the date of the first contempt hearing in March, 2001, four months after entry of the modification judgment; thereafter, despite the probate judge\u2019s denial of Philip\u2019s motion to stay on April 2, 2001, and this court\u2019s denial of his request for stay, Philip still did not pay alimony arrears until the day of the contempt hearing on April 27, 2001. In these circumstances, the judge was warranted in awarding legal fees and costs. See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 38; <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>374 Mass. 826, 827 (1978); <em>Krock </em>v. <em>Krock, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 533 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">C. <em>Conclusion. </em>We vacate so much of the judgment of modification as orders alimony in amounts in excess of those provided for by the divorce judgment, and requires current child support to continue through the emancipation of the youngest child. We remand for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, on the issues of additional alimony and future child support. In all other aspects the judgment of modification is affirmed. The orders awarding attorney\u2019s fees in connection with the modification judgment and reconsideration thereof are affirmed. The judgment of contempt is reversed; the order awarding fees incurred in connection with that action is affirmed. The order awarding fees to defend the appeal is affirmed. Because we conclude that the appeal was not frivolous, we deny appellee\u2019s request for double costs of the appeal. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450, 455 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">In addition to the payment of $142,152, Peggy was to receive half of the parties\u2019 nonliquid private securities, which were not valued at the time of the divorce. At the time of the modification hearing, Peggy\u2019s financial statement ascribed the following values to certain of these securities: EX A Corp. ($10,000), Direct Report ($10,000), Vintage Partners ($23,944), Hubbard Harpsichords ($15,000), Health Development Corp. ($4,000), WCAS Venture Partners ($500), and Babette\u2019s LP ($2,000). In addition, she received 6,000 shares in Object Design, Inc., which the judge found had a value of $45,000 at the time of the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Alimony was subject to cost-of-living increases similar to those provided for child support, as well as downward adjustments in certain circumstances, but otherwise was to continue until the death of either party or Peggy\u2019s remarriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In the stipulation, which provides that the parties\u2019 agreement shall be made a temporary order of court, Philip also agreed that he would \u201cbe responsible for the payment of all uninsured medical and dental expenses for the children,\u201d and \u201cfor the payment of the children\u2019s college and private school education.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">At the time of the modification trial, the oldest child had just enrolled in her first year at college, and the two younger children were fourteen and seven years old.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\">It is implicit in the judge\u2019s findings that she took into account Philip\u2019s agreement to pay $13,125 per month for child support. We agree that while the stipulation for temporary orders was not binding beyond the context in which it was made, see <em>Cohan </em>v. <em>Feuer, </em>442 Mass. 151, 156 (2004), it was evidence of what the parties considered to be a reasonable amount of support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Philip also argues that findings as to the children\u2019s needs for medical treatment and therapy do not constitute changed circumstances, because \u201call of them had their origins prior to June of 1995.\u201d The findings, which describe, with respect to the three children, \u201cworsening symptoms\u201d and \u201cphysical and emotional difficulties because of the divorce,\u201d are amply supported by the evidence and are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The <em>Heins </em>case concerned an appeal from a divorce judgment awarding alimony at least in part to compensate the wife for the loss of her investment in the husband\u2019s business. <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Ledis, </em>422 Mass. at 483. There was no finding in that case that the wife was in need of alimony and it was thus not proper \u201cto use alimony as a mechanism for such a property division.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">To the extent the argument is intended to apply as well to his appeal from the alimony award, we need not reach the issue because we vacate, on other grounds, those aspects of the award appealed from. See <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Findings related to Philip\u2019s higher living standard detail vacations in Europe, Florida, and Puerto Rico, among other places. Philip continues to maintain a home for his parents in Boca Raton, Florida. For his sister, Philip and his wife Lisette purchased a house in Weston for $400,000, making a down payment of $80,000. Philip and Lisette pay the monthly payments, including interest and principal, on the $320,000 mortgage, as well as the real estate taxes. In August, 1999, Philip and Lisette made an offer to purchase a home in Nantucket for $700,000, and an office for Lisette in Weston for $400,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The judge specifically found that Peggy made no postmarital contribution to Philip\u2019s career, and that \u201cPhilip\u2019s college classmate and Lisette, his second wife, created and assisted in\u201d securing his position at Goldman Sachs. Lisette, who has a Ph.D. from Harvard and is a certified financial analyst, provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>financial consulting services to clients through Athena Capital, a business she founded in 1993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\">For example, the findings note \u201cseven expensive cars\u201d were owned by the parties. These include four retained by Philip, which the separation agreement lists as having a total value of $26,250; Peggy\u2019s automobiles are set forth in her financial statement as having a total value of $10,600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">There was evidence that in 1983 and 1991, Philip\u2019s sale of businesses resulted in substantial capital gains. The extent to which the proceeds from these sales fueled the parties\u2019 lifestyle, or were used to acquire assets, was not reflected in the findings. We also note that the record reflects that Philip\u2019s average income for the years 1991 through 1995, including capital gains realized in 1991 ($1,237,539), was consistent with his earnings in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Other than the mortgage on the house, the only significant debts listed on the parties\u2019 financial statements (attorney\u2019s fees, cost of experts, expenses of maintaining the Weston house until it was sold) were divorce-related.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Included in this amount are expenses totaling $15,684.94. There was no challenge to this aspect of the award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Philip\u2019s request that we vacate the award of $5,670 in fees incurred in connection with Peggy\u2019s opposition to Philip\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the modification judgment is unsupported by argument or citation to relevant authority. We therefore decline to address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">With respect to the award in the amount of $16,877.24 for Peggy\u2019s former attorney, Philip took \u201cno exception [to] the amount of his fees.\u201d Rather, he \u201cdisclaimed any responsibility\u201d for the consequences of what he terms the attorney\u2019s abandonment of his client, Peggy, i.e., increased fees of her current counsel resulting from the transition in legal representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The probate judge instructed counsel to identify the number of hours expended in connection with postdivorce, rather than modification, matters, which resulted in a reduction of $31,236.76 in the amount requested and awarded.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
