Fenner. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7. Mor\u00e9is\u2019s complaint was that Fenner\u2019s tenant, Browning Ferris, Inc. (BFI), was using Fenner\u2019s land unlawfully for parking, maintaining and cleaning large tracks of several types; collecting and processing refuse, cans, arid bottles; and other commercial uses. None of those uses, Mor\u00e9is said, were permitted under the zoning by-law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Oak Bluffs in the residential zoning district in which the Fenner land was located. The inspector refused the enforcement request, and Mor\u00e9is appealed from that inaction to the Oak Bluffs board of appeals (board) pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 15. The board, apparently applying the criteria of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, concerning extension of a prior nonconforming use, found that, with specifically noted exceptions (recycling), the commercial activities complained of had been carried on for many years by a predecessor owner-operator, and that the activities (other than the recycling) were not more detrimental to the neighborhood than the historic uses. The board upheld the inspector\u2019s decision, and Mor\u00e9is appealed in the Superior Court under G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. Fenner\u2019s chief defense was that his use of the site was protected by the provision in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7, establishing a six-year limitation on enforcement actions. Mor\u00e9is prevailed in the Superior Court where, after a bench trial, a judge ordered that the board take all actions necessary to enforce the cessation of all commercial and nonresidential use of the site. Fenner appeals, arguing that (1) the judge erred in determining that Fenner\u2019s use of his property was not protected under \u00a7 7 by virtue of various building permits that had issued to him and his predecessor in title; (2) the judge impermissibly substituted his judgment for that of the board; and (3) the judge\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>The Fenner property (site) consists of two adjoining lots, one with a building (building lot) and the other paved, with perimeter fencing but no building (fenced lot). The building lot, historically owned by the town and used as a school gymnasium, was sold to Everett A. Rogers in 1958. Rogers then began using the building lot (and building) for his relocated trucking business, although the land was then, and for all times relevant has been, zoned for residential use only, not permitting trucking or other commercial use. Rogers\u2019s business activities involved delivering food and beverages to local restaurants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>stores, rubbish collection, and the storage and maintenance of several kinds of trucks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In 1965 Rogers made application for a permit to build an addition for the purpose of \u201cstorage &amp; garage,\u201d at a cost of $1,500. The application did not indicate whether the use of the structure would be residential or commercial, but Rogers answered \u201cyes\u201d to the application\u2019s question, \u201cWill the building conform to the requirements of the law?\u201d No permit was offered in evidence, although the town\u2019s record indicates that some building permit was issued in 1965 to Rogers at \u201cPerkins Ave.\u201d for \u201cadditions or alterations\u201d at a value of $1,500. There is no evidence of plans for, or the location of, the permitted work on the lot, nor is there evidence that any of the permitted work \u201cas built\u201d was accomplished or approved as compliant with the 1965 permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In 1975, Rogers applied for a building permit to build a \u201cshelter for platform,\u201d at an estimated cost of $1,100. The \u201cremarks\u201d section of the application form recites, \u201cThis is just a canopy to cover existing platform.\u201d The application contains denial that the proposed work was for a building addition. As with the 1965 permit application, there was no indication as to whether the use of the structure would be residential or commercial, but Rogers answered \u201cyes\u201d to the application\u2019s question, \u201cWill the building conform to the requirements of the law?\u201d No building permit was produced. Municipal records indicate the issuance of a building permit in 1975 to Rogers at Pacific Avenue for an addition or alteration valued at $1,100. There is no evidence of plans for or location of the permitted work on the lot. As in the case of the 1965 permit, there is no evidence that the work was ever completed or accepted by the building inspector \u201cas built.\u201d In 1979 Rogers purchased the adjoining lot (the fenced lot), which he then, without any permit or other approvals, paved and began to use for truck storage.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In 1988, when Rogers became ill, he began negotiating the sale of the site to the defendant intervener Fenner, who was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the refuse and reprocessing business. In contemplation of the purchase, Fenner had discussions and correspondence with the building inspector (who, in 1988, was Alishan Haigazian) concerning the historic uses of the property and Fenner\u2019s intention to continue those uses and to relocate his refuse business to the site. Rogers died in 1989. That same year, Rogers\u2019s nephew, Richard Mavro, became building inspector. Fenner completed the purchase of the site from the Rogers estate, and subsequently, on July 6, 1989, Mavro, upon payment of a $55 fee, issued a building permit to Fenner, which recites, inter aha, \u201cpermit to build or alter ... a commercial building on Pacific Ave. &amp; Perkins to be occupied for commercial use[,] provided that [the permittee] shall in every respect conform to the terms of the application on file in this office<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> . . . [and] subject to all applicable codes and ordinances.\u201d In May of 1989, Fenner also was issued a building permit for lot 271 (the fenced lot) to \u201cbuild or alter a fence ... on Pacific Ave. ... for storage and security . . . subject to all applicable codes and ordinances.\u201d The application for the fence permit describes \u201ctype of improvement\u201d as \u201caddition,\u201d and \u201cproposed use\u201d as \u201cnonresidential. . . storage of trucks and equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">According to Fenner\u2019s testimony, in 1989 he moved his refuse business and his company\u2019s entire maintenance operation (including recycling trucks, large commercial rubbish packing trucks, and rubbish collection vehicles) to the site. The judge found that the commercial uses of the site by Rogers and Fenner (including Fenner\u2019s tenant, BFI) had never conformed to the residential zoning, nor had any form of zoning relief ever been sought. Fenner claims that his uses are grandfathered by virtue of the six-year enforcement limitation contained in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He relies upon the 1965, 1975, and 1989 building permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>and the fact that no enforcement action was sought within six years of the most recent of those permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The judge properly found that all of the commercial uses identified in this case were in violation of the zoning by-law. Any comparison between present and historic uses, other than those allowed by permit, is irrelevant. This is not a case concerning the extension of a preexisting nonconforming use pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. The case reduces to the question whether one or more of the four building permits brought the six-year enforcement limitation into play, thereby protecting the otherwise unlawful commercial uses. Compare <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Lic. Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. 205, 211-217 (1982) <em>(Cape Resort).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We first consider the burden of proof. Generally, in an enforcement action (whether initiated by the zoning enforcement officer or, as here, a third party) the burden is upon the complainant to show that the use or structure violates the by-law. See <em>Brotherhood of Alpha Upsilon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Bridgewater, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 991, 992 (1983). Here, however, the landowner raises the limitation in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 7, as a <em>defense. </em>See <em>Cape Resort Hotels, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Lic. Bd. of Falmouth, </em>385 Mass. at 219 (in asserting \u00a7 7 defense, landowner had burden of showing that its structure was being used in accordance with earlier building permits). Compare <em>Building Inspector of Chatham </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 928, 929 (1983) (in defense against cease and desist order, burden was on landowner to prove prior nonconforming use pursuant to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6). We hold that it is Fenner\u2019s burden to prove the \u00a7 7 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We have outlined, above, some details of the four \u201cpermits\u201d upon which Fenner claims protection. The first two permits were not placed in evidence, nor was there evidence that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>work authorized by the permits was accomplished within the terms of those permits. The record as to these permits is not assisted by plans or other documents from which the actual use or structure could be identified. The indication in the 1965 permit application that the proposed structure would be used for \u201cstorage and garage,\u201d and the 1975 application\u2019s description of a proposed \u201ccanopy to cover existing platform,\u201d do not even mention commercial use of the property. Neither permit, therefore, can serve as the basis for Fenner\u2019s \u00a7 7 defense. Compare <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Somerset, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 226, 228 (1991) (no \u00a7 7 protection where building permits for construction of addition and garage for house in single-family district gave no indication that structure would be used as two-family dwelling).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The 1989 permits are shown in evidence: the permit for the fenced lot is dated May 19, 1989, and that for the building lot, July 6, 1989. Fenner testified that he brought his company\u2019s recycling, refuse and crushing operations, together with commercial garbage trucks, recycling trucks, residential garbage trucks, and other equipment to the site prior to the July building permit. It is also clear from his testimony that, at least as to the building lot, Fenner engaged in the objectionable uses well in advance of the July, 1989, building permit. As to the fenced lot, it is not entirely clear whether Fenner made additional use of the lot prior to the issuance of the fence permit on May 19. It is clear, however, that Rogers\u2019s use of the fenced lot began around 1979 and that he continuously parked tractors, trailers, and other commercial vehicles there for approximately ten years before the May, 1989, permit, in violation of the zoning by-law. As with the earlier two permits, the 1989 permits, although in evidence, were unaccompanied by plans or other documentary narrative as to the existing use, proposed changes, or other activity to be accomplished within the contemplation of the permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Section 7 of G. L. c. 40A protects, by limitation of action, <em>\u201cuse allowed by said </em>permit\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or \u201cthe removal, alteration or relocation of any <em>structure erected in reliance upon said permit. . </em>.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>(emphasis added). We have carefully examined the permits and permit applications, see <em>Cape Resort, supra </em>at 219; <em>Garabedian </em>v. <em>Westland, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 437 (2003), to see whether they allowed Fenner\u2019s commercial operations (truck storage, refuse, transfer, etc.), on one or both of the lots, within the meaning of \u00a7 7, and conclude that they do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The July, 1989, permit indicated that the building in relation to which the permit was issued would be \u201coccupied for commercial use.\u201d That designation, without more, lacks the particularity required to trigger the protection of \u00a7 7. The words \u201ccommercial use,\u201d standing alone, could be read in a massively expansive way to refer to multiple nonresidential uses (e.g., incinerator, gasoline station, shopping center, garbage dump, etc.). We consider it absurd to suggest that the Legislature, in adopting \u00a7 7, would intend <em>\u201cterms </em>of the original building permit\u201d (emphasis added) to authorize any and all imaginable commercial uses on Fenner\u2019s property, with no greater specificity or description. See, e.g., <em>Cape Resort, supra </em>at 219. There, a hotel had operated as a lawful, preexisting nonconforming use in a residential district. At issue was the change in use of particular rooms in the hotel: a reading area had become a pub; a dining room had become a disco; part of an enclosed porch had become a game room; and a \u201cfrolic room\u201d had become a \u201cshow lounge.\u201d After rejecting the landowner\u2019s argument that the changes continued to enjoy the protection of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6 (see <em>Bridgewater </em>v. <em>Chuckran, </em>351 Mass. 20 [1966]), the court considered the landowner\u2019s claim that a single permit to enclose a porch provided \u00a7 7 protection for \u201cthe entire present use of the hotel\u2019s ground floor.\u201d This argument was rejected by the court, which examined the present uses \u2014 and any prior building permits that might have allowed them \u2014 on a room-by-room basis. Of the varied uses for which the landowner sought protection, the court concluded that only the show lounge was protected by \u00a7 7, because the documents accompanying an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>earlier permit application for an addition (which subsequently became the show lounge) \u201cindicated very clearly that the space would include a bar, cocktail lounge, and entertainment facilities\u201d \u2014 the specific uses in effect at the time of trial. <em>Cape Resort, supra </em>at 219. In contrast, the court concluded that a 1956 permit to enclose the porch, without evidence of the use to which the enclosed porch was put in 1956, did not meet the landowner\u2019s burden of showing that the room was being \u201c \u2018used in accordance\u2019 with the permit authorizing its enclosure.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, in the instant matter, the July, 1989, permit for a \u201ccommercial building . . . to be occupied for commercial use\u201d is insufficient to provide Fenner the protection of \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Lastly, we consider the May, 1989, fence permit application and permit documents to determine whether, in combination, they provide \u00a7 7 protection for Fenner\u2019s use of the fenced lot. The contents of each document are detailed above. Although Fenner\u2019s permit application described the \u201cproposed use\u201d as \u201cnonresidential . . . storage of trucks and equipment,\u201d the permit itself authorized Fenner only to \u201cbuild or alter a fence ... for storage and security . . . subject to all applicable codes and ordinances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The six-year limitations period in \u00a7 7 applies to both structural and use violations authorized by a building permit. However, unlike structural violations for which no permit was obtained (which enjoy a ten-year limitations period), no such protection is afforded use violations unsanctioned by any permit. See <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Somerset, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 227. The May, 1989, fence permit gave Fenner permission to build a fence, and nothing more. The permit application\u2019s reference to \u201ctrucks and equipment\u201d pertains to die lot, not the fence. The words are incidental, and superfluous to a permit application for a fence. The fact that a preexisting, unlawful, unpermitted use was incidentally described on an application to erect a fence does not, in our view, bring the unlawful use within the protection of \u00a7 7. Cf. <em>Cape Resort, supra </em>at 220 (effect of variance for parking lot was to \u201calleviate parking problems at the hotel, not to legalize all uses to which hotel buildings were being put[;] [t]he judge correctly refused to attribute any broader significance to the granting of [the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>variance\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor, upon examination of Fenner\u2019s trial testimony, is there any basis for concluding that his commercial activities, or Rogers\u2019s for that matter, were allowed by any permit, or undertaken consequent to the issuance of any permit. The unlawful uses simply have no relationship to the building permits under which Fenner seeks protection. Thus, in the instant matter, only the fence itself enjoys the protection of \u00a7 7. Because Fenner\u2019s use of the property was never allowed by a permit, there is no limitations period for actions to redress that violation of the zoning by-law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In conclusion, we hold that Fenner had the burden of proving the nature of the particular uses authorized by the earlier building permits, and that the uses for which he sought protection were allowed by the permits. He failed to do so. We affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We have examined the record and conclude that the facts as found by the judge that are relevant to our decision are supported by the evidence; other findings disputed by Fenner are irrelevant to the disposition of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">It is uncontested that neither lot has ever been the subject of zoning relief, and that Rogers never obtained authority to use the land for these commercial uses. Fenner now claims that such authority is consequent of the issuance of certain building permits, as discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The record contains no such application. Fenner\u2019s testimony described the work encompassed by the permit as repair of the roof and sides of the building.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">General Laws c. 40A, \u00a7 7, second par., first proviso, as appearing in St. 1989, c. 341, \u00a7 21, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u201c[I]f real property has been <em>improved and used in accordance with the terms of the original building permit </em>issued by a person duly authorized to issue such permits, no action, criminal or civil, the effect or purpose of which is to compel the abandonment, limitation or modification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>the <em>use allowed by said permit </em>or the removal, alteration or relocation of any structure erected in reliance upon said permit by reason of any alleged violation of the provisions of this chapter, or of any ordinance or by-law adopted thereunder, shall be maintained, unless such action, suit or proceeding is commenced and notice thereof recorded in the registry of deeds for each county or district in which the land lies within six years next after the commencement of the alleged violation of law\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b88-6\">In its original form, \u00a7 7 protected uses <em>\u201ccontemplated </em>by said permit\u201d (emphasis added).

The more restrictive word \u201callowed\u201d was substituted for \u201ccontemplated\u201d by St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 24, 180 (1972) (\u201cAllow\u201d: \u201cpermit,\u201d \u201clet.\u201d \u201cContemplate\u201d: \u201cto have in view as contingent or probable or as an end or intention\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The fact that the Legislature rewrote \u00a7 7 to protect only uses \u201callowed\u201d by a permit, rather than any use \u201ccontemplated\u201d by a permit, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>lends further support to the view that permits should not be read expansively when considering the extent of their reach for purposes of \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">We also observe that, in substance, the result requested by Fenner would essentially result in the rezoning of land, or effect the grant of a variance. These matters are unambiguously entrusted by the Legislature to the town meeting and zoning board of appeals, respectively. See generally G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 5, 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b91-9\">In light of the conclusion we reach, there is no merit to Fenner\u2019s argument that the judge impermissibly substituted his judgment for that of the board. The relevant facts, as properly found by the judge (see note 2, <em>supra), </em>cannot support a conclusion that Fenner\u2019s use of the property was protected by c. 40A, \u00a7 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
