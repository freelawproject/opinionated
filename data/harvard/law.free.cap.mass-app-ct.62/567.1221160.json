L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After hearing, the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) determined that Heineken U.S.A., Inc. (Heineken), had violated the provisions of \u00a7 25E when it discontinued the distribution of its brand items to Fahey Beverage Company, Inc. (Fahey), in May, 1999, without giving the statutorily required notice. Because the commission found that Heineken\u2019s November 17, 1999, notice failed to \u201ccure the prior lack of notice,\u201d the commission did not reach Heineken\u2019s claim, as set forth in that notice, that there existed a \u201cgood cause\u201d basis to discontinue sales to Fahey.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Heineken sought review in Superior Court, see G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, where a judge set aside the decision, concluding that Fahey was not entitled to advance notice of discontinuance because Fahey was out of business at the time Heineken stopped shipping. The judgment also dismissed Fahey\u2019s G. L. c. 93A counterclaim, on the ground that it was based on the asserted violation of c. 138, \u00a7 25E. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>The commission and Fahey filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\"><em>Background facts. </em>We draw our summary of the facts from the parties\u2019 stipulations and agreed-upon exhibits submitted to the commission at the May 2, 2000, hearing, as well as from the commission\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Heineken is an out-of-state supplier authorized by G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>c. 138, \u00a7 18B, to sell alcoholic beverages to licensed Massachusetts wholesalers. For several years prior to its attempt to discontinue sales in May, 1999, Heineken had sold its brand name products to Fahey, a small Massachusetts wholesaler licensed under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18. Fahey is a closely-held corporation with a sole place of business in Pittsfield, and William Larkin is its president, treasurer, and general manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">By 1999, Larkin, who had inherited Fahey from his father in 1957, had decided to get out of the beer business. The population of Fahey\u2019s Berkshire County distribution area was declining, his suppliers were seeking new contracts that would have required expansion, and his children were not interested in pursuing the beer business. Richard Placek, the president of Commercial Distributing Company, Inc. (Commercial), and Larkin\u2019s good friend, offered to buy the business and Larkin agreed. Commercial, like Fahey, holds a Massachusetts wholesaler\u2019s license; its Westfield operation distributes to several counties in western Massachusetts, and was larger than Fahey\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">In March, 1999, working with their attorneys and accountants, Larkin and Placek negotiated an asset purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Commercial agreed to buy essentially all of Fahey\u2019s intangible assets, including Fahey\u2019s twenty distributor agreements, as well as certain of its tangible assets. Fahey\u2019s real estate (a building housing its office and warehouse) was not part of the deal. At this point, the transaction did not contemplate that Fahey would remain in the beer distribution business. Rather, as Larkin testified at deposition, he was considering the possibility of a different business, one unrelated to the alcoholic beverages industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">When Fahey\u2019s twenty suppliers were notified that Larkin intended to sell the business and that he sought their consent to the assignment of Fahey\u2019s distribution rights to Commercial, all except Heineken consented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> During the last week of April, 1999, Heineken sent written notice to Fahey withholding its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>consent. Thereafter, the Fahey-Commercial deal was modified by an additional agreement pursuant to which Fahey promised to stay in business for the purpose of purchasing beer from Heineken and selling the beer to Commercial \u201cat laid in cost with Commercial making payment to Fahey for such purchases within 25 days of Heineken billing Fahey.\u201d We understand the term \u201claid in cost\u201d to mean Fahey passed on to Commercial the cost of purchasing the beverages from Heineken without deriving a profit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The transaction closed on May 3, 1999. All of Fahey\u2019s salespeople, two of its truck drivers, and its warehouse manager, David Tetreault, went to work for Commercial, and all of Fahey\u2019s delivery trucks were sold to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">As of May 3, 1999, those placing telephone calls to Fahey were connected to an answering machine that played a recorded message informing callers that Fahey was closed, and told those wishing to place beer orders to contact Commercial. Callers wishing to speak to Fahey could leave a message and a telephone number where they could be reached. As stipulated by the parties, \u201cFahey shut down on Friday, April 30, 1999 and Commercial picked up on Monday, May 3, 1999, and started delivering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Heineken discontinued sales to Fahey in May, 1999, without providing advance written notice to Fahey and the commission pursuant to \u00a7 25E. On June 2, 1999, Fahey applied to the commission for relief under \u00a7 25E. Following a pretrial conference, the commission issued an interim order requiring Heineken to resume shipment of its brand name products to Fahey pending the outcome of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">On November 17, 1999, Heineken sent a letter to Fahey, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>which it notified Fahey of its intent to discontinue sales effective 120 days from Fahey\u2019s receipt of the notice; the notice also asserted that it had good cause to discontinue sales and, as required by the statute, set forth the specific grounds for discontinuance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The commission concluded after hearing (1) that Heineken\u2019s unilateral decision to terminate sales to Fahey was not warranted on the facts and Heineken was not exempt from providing notice to Fahey under \u00a7 25E; and (2) that the notice dated November 17, 1999, did not cure Heineken\u2019s failure to give notice prior to its attempt to terminate sales in May, 1999, and that the commission therefore did not need to consider the merits of Heineken\u2019s claim that Heineken had good cause for termination under \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\"><em>Standard of review. </em>Our review is governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See <em>Van Munching Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 308, 309 (1996). In conducting our review, we defer to the commission\u2019s findings of fact, see <em>Olde Towne Liquor Store, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>372 Mass. 152, 154 (1977), giving due weight to the commission\u2019s experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7). We will uphold the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sian\u2019s decision if there is substantial evidence to support it. See <em>Seagram Distil. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 713, 721 (1988). \u201cJudicial inquiry under the substantial evidence test is limited to determination of whether, within the record developed before the administrative agency, there is such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the agency\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The commission\u2019s construction of the \u201cgood cause\u201d provision of \u00a7 25E \u201cis entitled to this court\u2019s deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718. We need not, however, extend deference to a decision that is based upon an error of law. See <em>Service Employees Inti. Union, AFL-CIO, Local 509 </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>431 Mass. 710, 713 (2000); <em>BAA Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 842 (2000). See also G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(c). Ultimate responsibility for interpreting the governing statute is for the courts. See <em>M. H. Gordon &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>371 Mass. 584, 588-589 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Notice requirement under \u00a7 25E. </em>Section 25E is protectionist legislation designed, at least in part, to redress the perceived economic imbalance between suppliers and wholesalers by preventing suppliers from arbitrarily terminating sales to wholesalers. See <em>Seagram Distil. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. at 716-717. With this backdrop, we consider Heineken\u2019s contention that it was exempt from the notice requirements of \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The commission rejected Heineken\u2019s claim that Fahey had ceased operations, and instead found that in May, 1999, Fahey held a wholesaler\u2019s license under G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 18, ordered brand items from Heineken, held those items in its warehouse located at its principal place of business, timely paid Heineken for its purchases, and sold them to another licensed wholesaler (an act, referred to as transshipping, that is not per se prohibited by \u00a7 25E, see <em>Somerset Importers, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 381, 387 [1990]). The commission made the ultimate finding that, \u201cwhile suspicions may have been present, Heineken had insufficient information on which to conclude rationally and fairly that Fahey had ceased to operate as a licensed wholesaler\u201d in May, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>These findings do not appear to be disputed and are supported by substantial evidence. Although Fahey apparently informed all of its suppliers that it was selling its business to Commercial, at the time Heineken refused to ship, Fahey remained in the alcoholic beverages business, albeit in a limited capacity, buying Heineken products and transshipping the products to Commercial. A telephone call to the commission would have confirmed that Fahey continued to hold a valid wholesaler\u2019s license. To the extent that Heineken relied upon Fahey\u2019s recorded telephone message as justification for cutting off shipments, there is no evidence that Heineken followed up with Fahey to determine the actual status of its business, or that it had inquired of the commission to determine whether Fahey still held a wholesaler\u2019s license. Until July 1, 1999, office and warehouse personnel were available to answer calls to Fahey, and nothing in the record suggests that beer deliveries were made to an empty warehouse. When Fahey continued to place orders for Heineken brand products, Heineken knew or should have known that Fahey had not ceased operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Heineken\u2019s contention on appeal is, in substance, that despite the fact that Fahey remained in business to this limited extent, Fahey\u2019s operation lacked economic substance and was instead a sham designed solely to prevent Heineken\u2019s ability to refuse to sell to Commercial. We need not, in the context of the present appeal, resolve the question whether the Fahey-Commercial arrangement was a sham, or if it was, whether that would constitute good cause to support discontinuance of sale. Those questions should, in the first instance, be addressed by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">It is undisputed that Heineken had made regular sales of its brand items to Fahey \u201cduring a period of six months preceding any refusal to sell,\u201d and that Fahey was at all relevant times a \u201clicensed wholesaler\u201d within the meaning of the statute. G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E. The statute provides that a manufacturer and supplier such as Heineken \u201cshall forward a notice in writing to the wholesaler, to whom it has sold any brand item, prior to discontinuing sales to such wholesaler of such brand item.\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E, inserted by St. 1971, c. 833. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001) (interpreting \u201cshall\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>mandatory).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the plain language and manifest purpose of the statute, see <em>Shamban </em>v. <em>Masidlover, </em>429 Mass. 50, 54 (1999) (statutory language must be given effect consistent with its plain meaning unless the interpretation would be contrary to the intent of the Legislature), Heineken was required to give notice to Fahey.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">While we think that a supplier should not be required to leave its products on the steps of a boarded-up warehouse when an operation has ceased to exist, these were not the circumstances facing Heineken here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A supplier harboring doubts about the legal and operating status of a wholesaling business to which it owes a duty under \u00a7 25E is not without remedy, short of a unilateral cessation of sales. We agree with the commission that the question whether the circumstances warranted discontinuance of sale should be determined by the commission. It was Heineken\u2019s obligation to provide the written discontinuance notice required by \u00a7 25E and to seek commission review of the matter. Allowing a supplier like Heineken to make unilateral decisions about a wholesaler\u2019s right to notice would defeat the equalizing purpose of the statute. The commission\u2019s determination that Heineken was required to give a written notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Fahey, a licensed wholesaler, prior to discontinuing sales in May, 1999, was not error of law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">2. <em>Determination of good cause. </em>By a letter dated November 17, 1999 \u2014 more than five months after Fahey filed its June 2, 1999, application for relief, and six months after it had first attempted to stop selling beer to Fahey \u2014 Heineken notified Fa-hey that it planned to discontinue sales to Fahey 120 days from the date of the letter and that it had good cause to do so. The letter specified the following grounds for the claim: (1) Fahey\u2019s failure to exercise best efforts in promoting the sale of Heineken\u2019s brand items, G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E(c); and (2) Fahey\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of sale between Fahey and Heineken, G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E(e). See note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Neither Fahey nor the commission has directed us to any rule, regulation, or statute that precludes the giving of notice under \u00a7 25E in the circumstances of this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Union Liquors Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 937-938 (1981) (where commission found original notice to be technically deficient, \u201cany notice deficiency was cured\u201d by subsequent notice). While we agree that the late-filed notice did not in this case avoid the determination of a violation of the \u00a7 25E notice requirements as to the attempted termination of Fahey as its wholesaler in May, 1999, there is nothing in the record to support the commission\u2019s conclusion that the November notice was an attempt on Heineken\u2019s part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>\u201cto manufacture a tenable position over six (6) months after the pending 25E proceeding was underway,\u201d in order to circumvent the notice requirements of \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Fahey had originally informed Heineken that it was selling its entire beer business. Once Fahey learned that Heineken would not accept Commercial as its wholesaler, however, Fahey changed its plans and altered the transaction so that Fahey would remain in business and Heineken would remain obligated by \u00a7 25E to continue to sell beer to Fahey that would ultimately be distributed by Commercial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If Fahey had sold its entire business, as it had originally planned, Heineken would have been under no obligation to transact business with Commercial; had it chosen to do so, the notice provisions of \u00a7 25E would not have applied for six months. Our courts have recognized that a supplier may have legitimate business reasons to evaluate \u201cprospective wholesalers for the six-month trial period provided by the Legislature in \u00a7 25E.\u201d <em>Heublein </em>v. <em>Capital Distrib. Co., </em>434 Mass. 698, 704 &amp; n.12 (2001). See <em>Union Liquors Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., supra </em>at 938 (\u201cPersons in a highly sensitive, closely scrutinized business [such as the liquor business] have need to know about and appraise the persons behind corporations with whom they are doing business\u201d). Section 25E was not intended to generate inequities against suppliers. See <em>Pastene Wine &amp; Spirits Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 612, 619 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Once Heineken learned that Fahey had not, as it was first informed, ceased to do business, it was entitled to explore the nature of the evolving Fahey-Commercial relationship and, based upon the information acquired through discovery, to bring new grounds for discontinuance of sale before the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>for disposition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Contrast <em>Union Liquors Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. at 937-938. Had the commission rendered its decision on Fahey\u2019s June, 1999, application for relief prior to the date of the November, 1999, notice, the commission would have been required to consider the issue at a subsequent, separate hearing. Section 25E allows either party to appeal to the commission for a hearing on the notice of discontinuance. It also requires the commission to \u201cmake a determination after hearing on the issue of good cause for discontinuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 937, quoting from G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Here, the hearing did not take place until May 2, 2000, and Fahey thus had nearly five months to prepare a defense to the allegations contained in the letter. The good cause issues were expressly submitted as contested issues of law in the parties\u2019 joint prehearing memorandum and were fully argued at the hearing on May 2, 2000. Although commenting on the lateness of the letter, Fahey\u2019s attorney never objected to consideration by the commission of the good cause issues. In the circumstances, the two applications were, in effect, consolidated for hearing (a procedural consequence that does not appear to be precluded by any mie or statute and which would have served the aims of efficiency and cost-effectiveness), and Heineken was entitled to a determination on the merits of its claims. See <em>Seagram Distil. Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. at 718 (the commission is charged with interpreting and enforcing the good cause provision of \u00a7 25E).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We remand this matter to the commission for a determination whether Heineken had good cause under \u00a7 25E to terminate its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>relationship with Fahey as of November 17, 1999.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We think that the questions raised by Heineken\u2019s claim of good cause for discontinuation \u2014 including whether or in what circumstances a supplier may be bound to continue to sell its brand to a wholesaler who has ceased all business operations except transshipment to another wholesaler (with whom the supplier has never done, and does not want to do, business), or whether the Fahey operation was a sham lacking in economic substance, designed solely to evade Heineken\u2019s right to refuse sale to Commercial \u2014 are best left to the commission with its expertise and specialized knowledge of the highly regulated alcoholic beverages industry. See <em>Garfield </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Security, </em>377 Mass. 94, 96 (1979); <em>Beverages Intl., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 708, 711-712 (1987). See, e.g., <em>Pastene Wine &amp; Spirits Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Ridge Vineyards, </em>ABCC No. 25E-1076 (September 30, 1992) (concluding there was \u201cno evidence that the transaction is a sham\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The Superior Court judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to enter (1) affirming so much of the commission\u2019s decision that found that Heineken\u2019s failure to give notice prior to discontinuing sales to Fahey in May, 1999, violated the notice provisions of \u00a7 25E; and (2) remanding to the commission, for further findings and rulings consistent with this opinion, the good cause issues raised by Heineken\u2019s notice of November 17, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The first paragraph of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E (as appearing in St. 1982, c. 627, \u00a7 10), makes it an unfair trade practice \u201cfor any . . . importer [i.e., supplier] ... of any alcoholic beverages, to refuse to sell, except for good cause shown, any item having a brand name to any licensed wholesaler to whom such . . . [supplier] . . . has made regular sales of such brand item during a period of six months preceding any refusal to sell.\u201d The second paragraph of \u00a7 25E requires the supplier to provide the wholesaler with at least 120 days\u2019 notice of its intention to discontinue sales.

See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 25E. The statutory scheme authorizes the commission, after notice and a hearing, to cancel a license if the licensee ceases to conduct a licensed business. See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 77. See, e.g., <em>BAA Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. at 847-848 (where package store license held by BAA Massachusetts was revoked in part on evidence that it kept no inventory or implements of sale of alcoholic beverages; that licensed site was used as storage for another business; and that although shipments of alcoholic beverages stopped at its licensed location, they were not inspected or unloaded at that point, and a BAA Massachusetts employee merely signed for deliveries and sent them to their next destination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Because the motion judge\u2019s sole reason for dismissing the c. 93A claim was that Heineken had not violated \u00a7 25E, and we agree with the commission that Heineken did indeed violate \u00a7 25E, that claim must be addressed on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Indeed, in <em>Pastene Wine &amp; Spirits Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Ridge Vineyards, </em>ABCC decision No. 25E-1090 (February 25, 1993), the commission determined that a supplier\u2019s \u201cgood cause claims . . . should have [been] raised during the first case,\u201d which involved an application for review by Pastene, the wholesaler, of Oak Ridge\u2019s cessation of sales. In that case, as was the case here, Oak Ridge had argued that no notice was required because Pastene \u201cno longer existfed] for purposes of section 25E.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(referring to <em>Pastene Wine &amp; Spirits Co. </em>v. <em>Oak Ridge Vineyards, </em>ABCC decision No. 25E-1076 [September 30, 1992]). The commission also decided that, although good cause should have been raised in the first case, this \u201cdoes not preclude Oak Ridge, if the facts warrant, from filing a good cause termination proceeding based on a cause of action arising after\u201d the date of the hearing in the first case. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The record reflects that the arrangement was initially manifested as follows: Commercial obtained Heineken products by placing an order with Suzanne Oparowski, Fahey\u2019s part-time bookkeeper; using Heineken\u2019s software system, Oparowski in turn submitted the order directly to Heineken; Heineken delivered the beer to Fahey\u2019s warehouse where Tetreault (formerly employed by Fahey but, since the closing, by Commercial) unloaded the container with one of Fahey\u2019s forklifts; Commercial\u2019s delivery trucks picked up the beer from Fahey\u2019s warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">By the time of the hearing, the Fahey-Commercial arrangement had altered again and under the terms of a joint venture agreement it appears that the beer would no longer be warehoused with Fahey before going to Commercial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\">We note that, contrary to Fahey\u2019s assertions, <em>Somerset Importers, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 387-388, does not answer the question of the propriety of the Fahey-Commercial arrangement. In that case, we held that a wholesaler\u2019s sales of brand products to a second wholesaler (its parent company) did not, without more, constitute good cause under \u00a7 25E for discontinuing the relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 387. The two wholesalers involved in that case were typical wholesaling operations. Here, in contrast, Fahey has only one supplier and its sole customer is the second wholesaler. <em>Somerset </em>leaves open the question whether the nature of the FaheyCommercial transaction may constitute the additional component necessary to provide Heineken with good cause to discontinue sales.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The commission is authorized to make determinations on the good cause issue and \u201cto grant such relief as may be appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d G.
