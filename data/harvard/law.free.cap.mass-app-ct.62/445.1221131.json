He argues also that the contraband introduced in evidence against him was obtained as a result of an unlawful search, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 396 (2004) (\u201cThe scope of a <em>Terry[</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>search is not exceeded if, during a lawful patfrisk, it is immediately apparent to the police officer. . . that a concealed item is contraband\u201d), and it was therefore error to deny his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We agree with the defendant that the absence of a written waiver of jury trial requires that the conviction be reversed. We conclude, however, that the locating and subsequent seizure of the narcotics were permissible. Accordingly, the motion to suppress was properly denied, and the evidence remains available for use in the event of a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>The motion judge permissibly found, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Yesilciman, </em>406 Mass. 736, 743 (1990), that, acting on an informant\u2019s tip that the defendant was a seller of cocaine, Boston police Sergeant Paul W. Murphy, Jr., and his partner stopped the defendant for the purpose of conducting a threshold inquiry. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30-31 (1968). During the course of a patfrisk of the suspect, Sergeant Murphy removed from the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket a wooden-handled \u201c747\u201d folding knife. Continuing the patfrisk, Sergeant Murphy felt through the suspect\u2019s clothing a hard object located between his buttocks. In his own words set forth in a subsequent affidavit, he \u201cagain felt this area of [the defendant\u2019s] clothing, and formed the opinion, based upon the totality of the circumstances, that [the defendant] was secreting drugs, namely cocaine, in his buttocks area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The defendant was arrested and transported to a police station. He was searched, and a plastic bag containing white powder was seen protruding from his buttocks.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the defendant would not permit the officers to take the packet, Sergeant Murphy applied for, and received, a search warrant, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>which the defendant was taken to a hospital for removal of the packet.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">A complaint issued, and the defendant filed a motion to suppress the packet of cocaine which was denied. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a \u201cmotion to reconsider/renew the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d That motion was denied by the trial judge on the basis that the matter had been fully considered on the initial motion. Subsequently, after conducting a colloquy, the judge accepted the defendant\u2019s waiver of jury trial. No written waiver was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">2. <em>Jury trial waiver. </em>\u201cAny defendant in a criminal case other than a capital case . . . may, if he shall so elect. . . , waive his right to trial by jury by signing a written waiver thereof and filing the same with the clerk of the court. If the court consents to the waiver, he shall be tried by the court instead of by a jury . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 6, as appearing in St. 1979, c. 344, \u00a7 19. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 19(a), 378 Mass. 888 (1979). No written waiver was filed in this case. The Commonwealth defends the conducting of a nonjury trial in these circumstances by relying on an oral colloquy between the judge and the defendant on the subject, following which the judge found that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. Because the transcript of the colloquy is incomplete, the Commonwealth has supplemented the transcript with an affidavit of the judge detailing his usual practice in such situations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>423 Mass. 62, 73-74 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Adequacy of the colloquy is, however, academic where no signed written waiver has been obtained. A written waiver is required. See <em>Ciummei </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 504, 509-511 (1979). Where the Legislature has prescribed by statute a particular method to be followed to effectuate a waiver, we are not at leave to depart from it. See <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>343 Mass. 397, 402 (1961); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Duquette, </em>386 Mass. 834, 840 n.6 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 933, 934 (1997). The Commonwealth argues, on the basis of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collado, </em>426 Mass. 675, 678 (1998), that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>defective jury waiver does not require reversal. That case did not treat the question of the absence of a written jury waiver and is inapposite. Furthermore, we are not prepared to assume merely from the expansive language in a portion of the <em>Collado </em>opinion, <em>ibid., </em>that the Supreme Judicial Court intended sub silentio to supplant the bright-line rule reflected in our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wheeler, supra, </em>one year earlier. Because there was no written waiver here, the conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">3. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant moved to suppress the cocaine found on his person. His original motion asserted generally that the \u201cwarrant-less seizure\u201d of the evidence violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. In a memorandum that accompanied the motion, he expanded somewhat on this generality by arguing that there was an insufficient basis for search of a body cavity. The motion judge determined that the police had a reasonable basis for a <em>\u201cTerry </em>stop\u201d of the defendant, and therefore could permissibly conduct a pat-down search for weapons. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 24 (1968).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The motion judge found that, in the course of the frisk, the police came upon a \u201c747\u201d folding knife in the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket. The judge further ruled that \u201c[ajfter discovering the knife, the officers had the authority to arrest the defendant and conduct a more thorough search.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">When the defendant, represented by other counsel, attempted prior to trial to renew his motion to suppress to advance his theory that the officer\u2019s seizure had exceeded the scope of the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine, the trial judge declined to consider the question on the ground that the suppression issues had been fully considered previously. This may not have been the case. In the earlier proceeding, the motion judge identified the discovery of the \u201c747\u201d folding knife as the turning point at which the police had probable cause to arrest, and thus the right to conduct a search incident to an arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mantinez, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 517-518 (1998). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>according to the motion judge, an evidentiary search was permissible.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">We think that that analysis did not go far enough. Nothing that has been brought to our attention from the record established what a \u201c747\u201d folding knife is, or, more important, whether possession of such an item is unlawful. Absent such a showing, there was no basis for determining that the police had probable cause at that point to believe that a crime had been, or was being, committed. Continuation of the patfrisk thus could only be predicated on the need to search for weapons as authorized by <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">An argument can be made that the issue has been waived because the original motion and the accompanying memorandum did not expressly refer to the \u201cplain feel\u201d issue. On the other hand, the motion does complain of a seizure of evidence without a warrant, and the ensuing hearing developed facts that indicated that a violation might have occurred. Successor counsel, still prior to trial, attempted unsuccessfully to focus the trial judge on the fact that the specific \u201cplain feel\u201d issue had not been addressed at the motion stage. Assuming, without deciding, that the issue has been preserved, we address the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The Supreme Court has determined that where a police officer engaged in a lawful patfrisk during a <em>Terry </em>stop \u201cfeels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity [as contraband] immediately apparent,\u201d a warrantless seizure of the object does not offend the Fourth Amendment. <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375 (1993). The concept, which has come to be known as the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine, is based on the principle underlying \u201cplain view,\u201d i.e., that the officer is already legitimately present and conducting a permissible search for weapons and that he cannot be required to ignore contraband that is within his sight. <em>Id. </em>at 375-376. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 211 (1995). The \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine has been accepted by the Supreme Judicial Court as consistent with art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 397 (2004). However, the \u201cdoctrine is limited; it does not permit an officer to conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>a general exploratory search for whatever evidence of criminal activity he might find. The contraband nature of the item must be immediately apparent on touch.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The present case requires a judgment whether the line between a permissible <em>Terry </em>stop patfrisk resulting in a \u201cplain feel\u201d seizure and an impermissible evidentiary search that turns up contraband has been crossed. We turn to the affidavit of Sergeant Murphy in support of his application for a search warrant,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and set forth the portion that focuses on the <em>Terry </em>stop search:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cI conducted a pat-frisk of his [the defendant\u2019s] person as I was concerned with my personal safety and the safety of that of my partner, Officer Freeman. During said pat-frisk, a wooden handled, \u2018747\u2019 folding knife was removed from [the defendant\u2019s] jacket pocket and a hard object was felt by me through his clothing, in the area between the cheeks of his buttocks. Based upon my training and experience as a Boston Police officer. . . , I have come to know that persons store drugs, as well as weapons, secr[eted] in this area of their body, to avoid detection and/or arrest, by the authorities. I again felt this area of [the defendant\u2019s] clothing, and formed the opinion, based upon the totality of the circumstances, that [the defendant] was secreting drugs, namely cocaine, in his buttocks area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We conclude that the facts as described come within the \u201cplain feel\u201d doctrine as defined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra. </em>Having already uncovered a folding knife on the suspect\u2019s person, the officer, in the course of the patfrisk, felt a hard object \u201cbetween the cheeks of [the suspect\u2019s] buttocks.\u201d It must have taken little imagination, even apart from police training and experience, for the officer to realize that the suspect was transporting something he did not want others to find. We consider that, in these circumstances, \u201c[t]he contraband nature of the item [was] immediately apparent on touch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The defendant urges that we parse the statements in the af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>fidavit that the officer \u201cagain felt this area of [the defendant\u2019s] clothing, and formed the opinion\u201d that he was secreting drugs, and determine that the need for a \u201csecond feel\u201d before identifying the item as contraband transformed the patfrisk into an impermissible evidentiary search. We read the affidavit in a commonsense manner. Doing so, it is clear that the officer immediately recognized the item, from its size, hardness, and location, as contraband. That he forthwith touched it a second time before proceeding does not remove the encounter from the category of a \u201cplain feel\u201d seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We read the <em>Dickerson </em>and <em>Wilson </em>decisions as efforts to prevent improper evidentiary searches that are rationalized on the theory that they are only <em>Terry </em>stop safety measures, while maintaining the proposition that the police need not close their eyes to contraband should they come upon it in the course of an otherwise lawful patfrisk. There is no evidence here that the initial patfrisk was unlawful; indeed, the defendant does not contend that it was. Nothing suggests that Sergeant Murphy was engaged in an evidentiary search when he came upon the item in question. His instantaneous recognition of the secreted item was consistent with the requirements of the \u201cplain feel\u201d cases. His statement that he touched the item a second time and formed an opinion \u201cupon the totality of the circumstances\u201d that he had located contraband does not alter the conclusion that the nature of the item was immediately apparent on touch. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 397. The seizure was based on a supportable police judgment made with requisite immediacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\n<em>Finding set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-16\">He was also charged with possession with intent to distribute in a school zone, G.

Given that the defendant has offered no evidence to the contrary, restricting himself to argument on the legal significance of the events, we accept the facts set forth in Sergeant Murphy\u2019s affidavit as true.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
