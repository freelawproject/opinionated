McDowell, was convicted on two indictments charging the following: operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (GUI), having been so convicted four or more times previously; operating a motor vehicle after revocation of a license for an GUI conviction; operating a motor vehicle to endanger; operating an uninsured motor vehicle; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>attaching incorrect license plates; leaving the scene of property damage (two counts); and intentionally defacing personal property pursuant to G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A (four counts). On appeal, the defendant contends only that the trial judge erred when she found the defendant guilty of four counts of defacing personal property under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A, because the Commonwealth did not prove the defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional and wilful and either malicious or wanton.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><em>Background. </em>The stipulated facts are these. On February 23, 2002, the defendant, impaired by the consumption of alcohol, got into his car, drove rapidly backward, and struck a wooden fence, a cement post, and the porch of a residence. He then drove rapidly forward, running over five-foot high hedges, and struck a parked vehicle. These acts were observed by one of the defendant\u2019s neighbors. As a police car pulled up behind the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant drove backward, striking the push bar mounted on the front of the officer\u2019s car. The officer placed the defendant under arrest; a subsequent breath test revealed the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .25. At the time of the incident, the defendant had been convicted of four or more instances of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol within the past ten years. The defendant\u2019s license had been revoked in the Commonwealth since June 8, 2000. The defendant did not have a motor vehicle liability insurance policy in effect nor was the license plate that was affixed to the defendant\u2019s vehicle assigned to such vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for defacing personal property under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A, arguing that there was insufficient evidence for a grand jury to find that he intentionally and wilfully caused the damage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argued in opposition that the statute required proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>of either wilful and malicious conduct, or wanton conduct, and that therefore proof of the defendant\u2019s wanton conduct was sufficient to indict. Subsequently, the Commonwealth filed a request for nolle prosequi of those portions of the four counts of the indictment under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A, that alleged other than wanton conduct. The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">At trial, the defendant maintained that the damage caused by his operation of the vehicle was accidental and resulted from his impaired state, and that he was therefore not guilty of defacing personal property because he did not intentionally and wilfully cause the damage as required for a conviction under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge found the defendant guilty of all counts. With regard to the four counts of defacing personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>property, the judge stated, \u201cI find the Commonwealth has presented proof beyond a reasonable doubt in order to find this Defendant guilty of wanton and reckless defacement of property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The only issue before us is whether G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A, requires, as the defendant argues, that the Commonwealth prove the defendant acted intentionally and wilfully and either maliciously or wantonly; or whether, as the Commonwealth argues, it need only prove that the defendant acted wantonly. The defendant and the Commonwealth agree that this statutory interpretation is outcome-determinative; the defendant concedes the evidence is sufficient to establish his actions were wanton, and therefore if we determine that wanton acts are sufficient to convict him under \u00a7 126A, his appeal fails. The Commonwealth has, via nolle prosequi, declined to attempt to prove other than wanton conduct on the part of the defendant, and thus it concedes that should we determine that proof of conduct other than wanton conduct is necessary for conviction under \u00a7 126A, the convictions on those counts must be reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>\u201cWillfully and maliciously or wantonly.\u201d </em>General Laws c. 266, \u00a7 126A, under which the defendant was charged and convicted, states, in part, \u201cWhoever intentionally, willfully and maliciously or wantonly, . . . injures, mars, defaces or destroys the real or personal property of another . . . shall be punished . . . .\u201d The defendant argues that \u00a7 126A sets forth three conjunctive elements constitutive of the crime that must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>proved for conviction: the first that the defendant acted \u201cintentionally,\u201d the second that he acted \u201cwillfully,\u201d and the last element, one of two alternatives, that he acted either \u201cmaliciously\u201d or \u201cwantonly.\u201d The defendant contrasts this with G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a statute that also criminalizes the destruction of personal property, and under which, he contends, it would have been proper to charge him. Section 127 distinguishes between, on the one hand, wilful and malicious damage to personal property and, on the other, wanton damage to personal property, punishing the former with up to ten years in State prison and the latter with imprisonment for a maximum of two and one-half years. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Faherty, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 150, 152 (2003). The defendant posits that because \u00a7 127 thus penalizes the wanton destruction of personal property, it would be redundant and contradictory for \u00a7 126A to penalize the same wanton conduct with a harsher penalty (up to three years in State prison and removal of a driver\u2019s license), unless \u00a7 126A requires the additional elements of intentional and wilful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant misreads \u00a7 126A, which in its view provides a list of two disjunctive elements of required intent: \u201cwilful and malicious\u201d conduct on the one hand, or \u201cwanton\u201d conduct on the other. The Commonwealth contends that, by definition, conduct cannot be both \u201cwilful\u201d and \u201cwanton\u201d because wilful conduct requires an actor to intend his conduct and its consequences, and wanton conduct requires the actor to have indifference to or disregard of the probable consequences of his conduct. Therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Commonwealth posits, a person cannot intend and also disregard the consequences of his or her conduct, and thus \u00a7 126A must provide two disjunctive elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">When interpreting a statute, we attempt to give effect to the intent of the Legislature as ascertained from the ordinary use of the language employed, the reasons for the enactment, and the main object to be accomplished. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valiton, </em>432 Mass. 647, 650 (2000). The language of the statute itself is our primary source of insight into legislative purpose. <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 584, 586 (2002). For assistance with interpretation, we may utilize other statutes relating to the same matter as the statute being construed, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 420 (2000), and we may examine the general statutory framework in which the statute in question is located. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 776-777 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Chapter 266 of the General Laws contains numerous statutory provisions punishing deliberate injury to real and personal property. Section 126A is a specific vandalism statute, punishing the person who \u201cpaints, marks, scratches, etches or otherwise marks, injures, mars, defaces or destroys the real or personal property of another including but not limited to a wall, fence, building, sign, rock, monument, gravestone or tablet.\u201d Section 126A was enacted in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Section 127 is a catch-all provision for chapter 266, punishing the person who \u201cdestroys or injures the personal property, dwelling house or building of another in any manner or by any means not particularly described or mentioned in this chapter.\u201d Section 127, the \u201cgeneral vandalism statute,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> predates \u00a7 126A and is derived from a Massachusetts statute enacted in 1836, which contained the phrase \u201cwilfully and maliciously.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The clause \u201cwilfully and maliciously\u201d was instrumental in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the development of case law distinguishing civil trespass from criminal destruction of property. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, 3 </em>Cush. 558, 560 (1849) (\u201cit would follow, that a person would be liable to be punished criminally, and with great severity, for every wilful trespass, however trifling\u201d). In order to avoid the criminal punishment of simple trespass, we have historically required the criminal destruction of property to be proved by evidence of a wilful act done with a malicious state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>110 Mass. 401, 403 (1872) (\u201cThe act, though intentional and unlawful, is nothing more than a civil injury, unless accompanied with that special malice which the words \u2018wilful and malicious\u2019 imply\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>122 Mass. 19, 35 (1877) (\u201cIt is the special depravity or special hostility towards the owner which makes a crime of that which would otherwise be a mere trespass to property\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ruddock, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 508, 512 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Wynn, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 453, 455 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 126A \u201cmust remain faithful to the purpose and construction of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>American Honda Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Bernardi\u2019s, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 425, 430 (2000), quoting from <em>Heritage Jeep-Eagle, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corp., </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 254, 258 (1995). Because the clause \u201cwilfully and maliciously\u201d was instrumental in the development of case law distinguishing civil trespass from criminal destruction of property under \u00a7 127, we decline to interpret the language of \u00a7 126A in the manner that the defendant suggests. Instead, we construe the language of \u00a7 126A as consisting of two groups: one being \u201cwillfully and maliciously,\u201d and the other, \u201cwantonly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">We must next determine whether \u00a7 126A requires proof of \u201cwillful and malicious\u201d acts as well as \u201cwanton\u201d acts, or whether the two clauses are disjunctive. Bearing in mind that \u201c[t]he words of a statute must be construed in association with the general statutory plan,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Assn. of Cosmetology Schs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Cosmetology, </em>40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 706, 711 (1996), quoting from <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Wells Yachts South, Inc., </em>406 Mass. 661, 664 (1990), we note that when interpreting \u00a7 127, the Supreme Judicial Court stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, </em>411 Mass. 167, 170 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\u201cWilful and malicious destruction of property (G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 127) is a specific intent crime. Wilfulness requires a showing that the defendant intended both the conduct and its harmful consequences, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, </em>408 Mass. 347, 352 (1990); wilful conduct is \u2018intentional and by design in contrast to that which is thoughtless or accidental.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 443 (1983), quoting J.R. Nolan, Criminal Law \u00a7 427, at 259 (1976). Malice requires a showing that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u2018motivated by \u201ccruelty, hostility or revenge.\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schuchardt, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, supra. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence must be sufficient to persuade the fact finder beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of both elements before a conviction of wilful and malicious destruction can be sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In contrast, \u201c[wjanton destruction differs substantially from wilful and malicious destruction in that wanton destruction requires only a showing that the actor\u2019s conduct was indifferent to, or in disregard of, probable consequences.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arrnand, supra </em>at 171. Given this well-established distinction between the nature of acts that constitute \u201cwilful and malicious\u201d destruction of property and those that constitute \u201cwanton\u201d destruction of property under the older statute, \u00a7 127, we hold that \u00a7 126A contains two disjunctive elements: wilful and malicious conduct, or wanton conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\"><em>\u201cIntentionally.\u201d </em>This leaves for consideration the meaning of \u201cintentionally\u201d within G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A. The Commen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>wealth argues that the word \u201cintentionally\u201d is surplusage because its meaning is encompassed in the definition of \u201cwilful\u201d conduct since \u201c[w]ilful means intentional.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383, 397 (1944). Moreover, the Commonwealth argues, an act cannot be both \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cwanton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The argument of surplusage is not a favored one. In construing a statute, we are to give meaning to each word in the legislation; no word should be considered superfluous. <em>International Org. of Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy., </em>392 Mass. 811, 813 (1984). We are to \u201cconstrue the statute to avoid any part of the legislation being meaningless or duplicative.\u201d <em>Richard Lundgren, Inc. </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 415 (1998). We are especially reluctant to consider as surplusage a term that is employed in at least eight other statutory provisions within the same chapter. See G. L. c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 96, 98, 98A, 104, 106, 107, 138, 138A. Each of these statutes criminalizes injury to property and uses the phrase, \u201cWhoever wilfully, intentionally and without right.\u201d In addition, at least four criminal and civil statutes in Massachusetts employ the clause \u201cwhoever intentionally.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These four statutes employ \u201cintentionally\u201d to require the conduct at issue to be deliberate, thus contrasting intentional or \u201cknowing\u201d conduct with unintentional, accidental conduct. See G. L. c. 64C, \u00a7 37; G. L. c. 64D, \u00a7 8; G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 139; G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 13A. That the word \u201cintentionally\u201d is not employed in \u00a7 127 is perhaps curious but does not itself render the presence of the word in \u00a7 126A mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In according meaning to the statutory inclusion of the word \u201cintentionally\u201d in \u00a7 126A, we recall that \u201c[a] fundamental tenet of criminal law is that culpability requires a showing that the prohibited conduct (actus reus) was committed with the concomitant mental state (mens rea) prescribed for the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 725 (2001). While we acknowledge some reluctance in recent case law to characterize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the prescribed intent for certain crimes as being either \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific,\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>427 Mass. 259, 268-269 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collier, </em>427 Mass. 385, 388 n.4 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henault, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 8, 13 n.7 (2002), we also note that our case law has expressly characterized the intent prescribed for the \u201cwilful and malicious destruction of property\u201d branch of \u00a7 127 as being specific intent, while the wanton destruction of property branch of \u00a7 127 is a general intent crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, supra </em>at 170-171. We discern no reason why the Legislature would have diverged from this settled prescription of intent for each of the crimes when enacting \u00a7 126A in 1994, three years after the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armand, supra. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the intent required for wanton defacement of property under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A, is general intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s intent, like other mens rea requirements, may be established circumstantially.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 919 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henault, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 13 n.7. The record here is plain that, before entering the motor vehicle and causing the property damage, the defendant \u2014 staggering while he did so \u2014 took the steps necessary to replace the battery in his car. Though we chafe at the limitations imposed by the record of a stipulated trial, we conclude nonetheless that insofar as this stipulated evidence permits the inference that the defendant intended to drive the car, heedless of the consequences, it was enough to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the requisite general intent. The defendant\u2019s intoxicated state was irrelevant to his ability to form general intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>409 Mass. 146, 155 (1991). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 593 (1985). Given this, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions under G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 126A.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-15\">This procedure has long been disfavored and \u201ccannot be justified to save court time.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>25 Mass.
