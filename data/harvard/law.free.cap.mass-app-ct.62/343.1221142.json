For purposes of these appeals, the relevant portions of their complaints include the claims for the failure to pay overtime compensation in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 30B, and G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 (count four)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; for the failure to pay call-back and stand-by pay in violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 (count five); and for their superiors\u2019 interference with their right to claim overtime compensation under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, in violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 19 (count six).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaints pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). A Superior Court judge allowed the motions on the grounds that the plaintiffs were required to exhaust their claims for compensation under the grievance and arbitration procedure provided by their collective bargaining agreement and the court was without jurisdiction to hear their claims for a violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 19, because it was a matter to be initially determined by the Massachusetts Labor Commission. On appeal, the plaintiffs press only their claims for violations of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, and G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 19. We reverse the dismissal of the claims based on a violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, but affirm the dismissal of the counts based on a violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">1. <em>Violation of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. </em>The plaintiffs argue that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the motion judge erred in dismissing their claims based on a violation of the prompt payment of wages law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because their right to overtime, call-back, and stand-by pay is based on a personal, nonwaivable statutory right that they are free to enforce judicially notwithstanding that their entitlement to this compensation is addressed in a collective bargaining agreement. See <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>410 Mass. 485, 492 (1991) (acknowledging that there are certain \u201cpersonal, substantive, nonwaivable statutory guarantee[s]\u201d that an employee need not submit to arbitration). See also <em>Barrentine </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>450 U.S. 728, 739-746 (1981) (right to minimum pay and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act is a personal, nonwaivable statutory guaranty that an employee can enforce judicially even though those subjects are covered by a collective bargaining agreement). The purpose of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, is to prevent the evil of the \u201cunreasonable detention of wages [by employers].\u201d <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assoc., Inc., </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 720 (2002). As such, it bestows upon individual workers the right to recover not only their lost wages, but also treble damages, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. While an individual may waive the requirements of the statute by a writing, the record does not disclose that the plaintiffs did so.- Nor does their collective bargaining agreement include any reference to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, or to the time when wages must be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Nevertheless, the plaintiffs\u2019 collective bargaining agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>provides for overtime, call-back, and stand-by pay and allows them to file a grievance or seek alternate dispute resolution relating to the interpretation and application of the terms of the agreement. It is well-recognized that where a collective bargaining agreement exists and the subject matter of the dispute is encompassed therein, public policy favors the resolution of the dispute between an employee and employer within the framework of the grievance and arbitration procedures. See <em>Local No. 1710, Intl. Assoc. of Fire Fighters, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Chicopee, </em>430 Mass. 417, 421-422 (1999). See also <em>Azzi </em>v. <em>Western Elec. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 410 (1985) (\u201cTo permit employees to circumvent existing grievance and arbitration procedures, by bringing actions against their employers in the first instance, does not strike us as a commendable practice\u201d). Nonetheless, it is also well-established that there are certain personal, statutory rights that can be enforced judicially even though they are incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>410 Mass at 492. See <em>DaLuz </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>434 Mass. 40, 46-47 (2001). The mere fact that those rights may be created both by contract and by statute and may be violated by the same factual occurrence does not vitiate their distinct and separate nature. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Agawam, </em>350 F.3d 279, 284-285 (1st Cir. 2003) (police officers were not required to exhaust the grievance and arbitration procedures in their collective bargaining agreement before bringing an action in the district court to collect overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In this case, we agree with the plaintiffs that the right to timely payment of wages is a distinct, independent statutory right that can be enforced judicially even though the subject matter of overtime, call-back, and stand-by pay is incorporated in the plaintiffs\u2019 collective agreement. Cf. <em>Livadas </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>512 U.S. 107, 123-125 (1994) (employee\u2019s rights under a California statute requiring timely payment of wages are independent from rights under collective bargaining agreement). The statutory right to the timely payment of wages does not involve the collective rights of employees but, rather, is designed to insure that each individual is paid promptly the wages due him or her. Cf. <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Mas</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>sachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, 377 </em>Mass. 392, 399 (1979) (right to equal employment opportunities under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, is an independent statutory right that cannot be bargained away by a union or employer); <em>Blanchette </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Westwood, </em>427 Mass. 176, 180-181 (1998) (employee not barred from pursuing an action for retaliation pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(4), even though she had proceeded to arbitration on the same facts pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The personal nature of this right is underscored by the provision of redress not only in the form of recovery of lost wages, but also treble the amount of the loss, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and costs. See <em>Barrentine </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., </em>450 U.S. at 743-745 (in determining that the right to a minimum wage and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act may be enforced judicially notwithstanding those subjects were encompassed in a collective bargaining agreement, the Supreme Court relied in part on the limited authority and power of an arbitrator to enforce the parties\u2019 agreement rather than to afford the relief available to an individual under the act). Further, the mere fact that the collective bargaining agreement must be consulted for the rate of pay does not preclude a plaintiff from pursuing his or her claims in court. <em>Lividas </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>512 U.S. at 124-125. All that is required is calculating the amounts of compensation due according to the wage rate in the collective bargaining agreement at the time payment was due. Because this right is an independent, statutory one, which was not waived, the plaintiffs were not required to pursue administrative remedies before commencing their actions in court to recover overtime and the other wages claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Having concluded that the prompt payment of wages statute creates an independent statutory right that can be enforced judicially even when, a collective bargaining agreement addresses the subject matter of compensation, we turn to the issue whether the statute applies to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this case. The time limits set for the payment of wages under \u00a7 148 apply only to Commonwealth employees who are a \u201cmechanic, workman [or] laborer\u201d or are employed in any other capacity \u201cin a penal or charitable institution.\u201d See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>words \u201cmechanic, workman and laborer\u201d and \u201cpenal or charitable institution\u201d are not defined in G. L. c. 149.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In construing the words \u201cmechanic, workman and laborer,\u201d we turn to the common meaning attributed to these words in other legislation pertaining to the rights of workers in this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">As used in the early versions of our workers\u2019 compensation statutes, \u201c[a] \u2018laborer\u2019 ordinarily is a person without particular training who is employed at manual labor . . . while \u2018workmen\u2019 and \u2018mechanics\u2019 broadly embrace those who are skilled users of tools.\u201d <em>Devney\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 270, 272 (1916). Under this definition, a supervisory janitor whose work was not of \u201cmenial\u201d character, <em>White\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 517, 521 (1917); a teacher in an industrial school, <em>Lesuer\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 44 (1917); and a call fireman, <em>Randall\u2019s Case, </em>279 Mass. 85 (1932), were not considered to be workmen, laborers, or mechanics. But see <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Cambridge Jr. College, </em>364 Mass. 367, 375-376 (1973) (assistant librarian at a junior college considered a \u201cmechanic, laborer or workman\u201d under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4)(a), as then in effect). Whether an individual comes within the classification of a \u201cmechanic, laborer or workman\u201d is dependent on the nature of the work performed by him or her. <em>Id. </em>at 372. Here, other than the descriptive titles of the plaintiffs, we know nothing about the nature of their duties. Consequently, we are unable to determine on this undeveloped record whether the prompt payment of wages law applies to the plaintiffs as mechanics, laborers, or workmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">We must also consider whether \u00a7 148 affords the plaintiffs relief because it pertains to all Commonwealth employees who are employed in a \u201cpenal or charitable institution.\u201d See note 5, <em>supra. </em>Those terms are not defined in G. L. c. 149. However, G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1, as inserted by St. 1972, c. 777, \u00a7 8, does define the term \u201cpenal institution\u201d as follows: \u201c[a]s used in [G. L. c. 125] and elsewhere in the general laws, unless the context otherwise requires ... a \u2018penal institution\u2019 [means a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u2018correctional facility.\u2019 \u201d General Laws c. 125, \u00a7 l(n), as amended by St. 1992, c. 286, \u00a7 191, defines a \u201cstate correctional facility\u201d to mean \u201cany correctional facility owned, operated, administered or subject to the control of the department of correction . . . .\u201d Here, there is no dispute that the plaintiffs\u2019 employer is DYS. DYS is a State department under the direction and control of the Commissioner of Youth Services who is appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. G. L. c. 18A, \u00a7 1. Its purpose is to \u201cprovide a comprehensive and coordinated program of delinquency prevention and services to delinquent children and youth referred or committed to the department by the courts; community services for the prevention of juvenile delinquency . . . ; and services and facilities for the study, diagnosis, care, treatment, including physical and mental health and social services, education, training and rehabilitation of all children and youth referred or committed\u201d to it. G. L. c. 18A, \u00a7 2, as inserted by St. 1969, c. 838, \u00a7 1. It is prohibited from transferring children in its custody to a \u201cpenal institution.\u201d Specifically, the forestry camp at which the plaintiffs worked was designed to provide education and training as may be deemed best for the readjustment of youths involuntarily committed to the department\u2019s care. G. L. c. 120, \u00a7 H.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Given the purposes for which the DYS was created, the plain meaning attached to the words \u201cpenal [and] charitable institution,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the narrow construction that has been afforded G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, <em>Prozinski </em>v. <em>Northeast Real Estate Servs. LLC, 59 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 599, 605 (2003), we conclude that the DYS is not a \u201cpenal or charitable institution\u201d under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. Nevertheless, as noted, because we are unable to determine if either plaintiff qualifies as a \u201cmechanic, laborer or workman\u201d on the record before us, their claims based on the failure to make timely payment of wages should not have been dismissed pursuant to rule 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>2. <em>Violation of G. L. c. 151, \u00a719. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the judge should not have dismissed their claim alleging that they had been subject to discrimination, threats, and retaliation by their supervisors as a result of pressing their claims for overtime compensation due them under G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. Although the judge dismissed this claim on the ground that it was one of an unfair labor practice that initially came within the jurisdiction of the Labor Relations Commission, we are of the opinion that the claim should have been dismissed as matter of law on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Section 19(1), as amended by St. 1973, c. 1192, \u00a7 16, prohibits an employer from \u201cdiscriminating] against any employee . . . because such employee has complained of a violation of the provisions of [G. L. c. 151], ... or because such employer believes that said employee or individual may complain of a violation of [G. L. c. 151]\u201d and allows an employee for this violation to sue for \u201cnot . . . less than one month\u2019s wages nor more than two month\u2019s wages of such individual, and the costs of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d The violation claimed by the plaintiffs is the failure to pay overtime as required by G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A. However, that statute does not apply to Commonwealth employees. The obligation to pay overtime compensation for Commonwealth employees is, instead, set forth in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 30B.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">General Laws c. 151, \u00a7 19(5), as amended by St. 1998, c. 236, \u00a7 19, also provides, in pertinent part, whoever \u201cthreatens, coerces, or intimidates any employee who has wages due under this chapter, for the purpose of causing such person to accept as payment in full a lesser sum than the full amount of the wages so due, shall have violated this section and shall be punished or shall be subject to a civil citation or order as provided in section 27C of chapter 149, and each employee so solicited or threatened shall constitute a separate offense.\u201d General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 27C, does not provide a private cause of action, but rather permits the Attorney General to seek redress for a violation of this specific section.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, the wages to which the statute refers are the minimum wages and overtime compensation provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>by G. L. c. 151 which are not at issue in this action. Consequently, this claim was appropriately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The portions of each judgment that dismiss the fourth and fifth causes of action (counts four and five) are reversed. The judgments of dismissal on the remaining causes of action are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Although count four refers to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 30B, it appears that the plaintiffs are no longer pursuing any claims for overtime compensation pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 30B, but are confining their claims for overtime compensation to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b374-13\">After the plaintiffs filed their notices of appeal, the defendants advised the plaintiffs that they would not, on appeal, be pursuing the argument that \u201cemployees who are subject to a Collective Bargaining Agreement are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>entitled to pursue remedies under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148.\u201d Because the parameters of the \u201cstipulation\u201d are unclear and because the thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument rests on the premise that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148, creates an independent judicial remedy, our discussion focuses on whether a cause of action under c. 149, \u00a7 148, sufficient to survive a rule 12(b)(6) motion, has been stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 148, as amended through St. 1992, c. 133, \u00a7 503, in pertinent part provides as follows: \u201cEvery person having employees in his service shall pay weekly or bi-weekly each such employee the wages earned by him to within six days of the termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned if employed for five or six days in a calendar week, or to within seven days of the termination of the pay period during which the wages were earned if such employee is employed seven days in a calendar week, . . . and the commonwealth, its departments, officers, boards and commissions shall so pay every mechanic, workman and laborer employed by it or them, and every person employed in any other capacity by it or them in any penal or charitable institution . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The defendant raises for the first time on appeal that the plaintiffs are not covered under the specific terms of G.

We consider the issue based on the principle that we may consider on appeal any issue that supports the result in the trial court even though it was not argued below. <em>Gabbidon </em>v. <em>King, </em>414 Mass. 685, 686 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b379-6\">We cannot envision any interpretation of the term \u201ccharitable institution\u201d that would bring the DYS within its purview.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Neither party has raised the issue whether overtime, call back, and stand-by pay are considered \u201cwages\u201d under G.
