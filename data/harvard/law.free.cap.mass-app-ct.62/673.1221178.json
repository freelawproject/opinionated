After more than two hundred years of mesne conveyances, the plaintiff, Mary Jane Pauli, as trustee of SMND Realty Trust (Pauli) \u2014 who traces her chain of title to Edmund \u2014 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the defendant, Kelly C. Kelly, as trustee of Pine Realty Trust (Kelly) \u2014 who traces her chain of title to David \u2014 are involved in a boundary dispute that bears on the ownership of a 7.7 acre parcel lying between their respective properties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A sketch of the relevant parcels, attached as an Appendix to this opinion, provides immediate visual context for the problem. Pauli owns the property directly to the south of the disputed parcel (shown as the Huldah Hall farm/Nathan Williams property). Kelly owns the property to the north of the disputed parcel (shown as the Job Hall property).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">On appeal from a declaratory judgment in favor of Pauli, Kelly argues that the Land Court judge erroneously fixed the location of the disputed property line some 393 feet north of where Kelly believes that the boundary should be. In particular, she maintains that (1) an unsuccessful attempt by Pauli\u2019s predecessor in title to fix that boundary in a previous registration proceeding bars the present action through principles of issue or claim preclusion; and (2) the Land Court judge improperly relied on abutter calls<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in a deed in the chain of title of a third party (shown as the Perez Hall property) to determine the location of the disputed boundary. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"ALW\">1. <em>Background. </em>The parties agree that Pauli\u2019s property is bounded on the north by Kelly\u2019s land and on the west by the Perez Hall property and that Kelly\u2019s property is bounded on the south by both Pauli\u2019s land and the Perez Hall property. The present controversy centers on Pauli\u2019s contention, accepted below, that the boundary shared by the parties joins with the undisputed northern boundary of the Perez Hall property to form a relatively straight fine across the southern edge of Kelly\u2019s property (represented on the diagram as the northern boundary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>of the disputed parcel). Although Kelly has previously argued that this boundary should be fixed elsewhere,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> her contention here is simply that Pauli has not carried the burden of proving that the boundary between her land and Pauli\u2019s is the northern boundary of the disputed parcel. If the Land Court judgment stands, Pauli\u2019s claim of ownership in the disputed parcel will be established as superior to Kelly\u2019s; otherwise, ownership of the parcel will remain unresolved as between Pauli and Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">None of the ancient deeds in either Kelly\u2019s or Pauli\u2019s chain of title precisely fixes their shared boundary. Instead, the deeds describe the properties primarily by estimations of acreage and abutter calls. Pauli begins the analysis of her chain of title by looking to the will of Huldah Hall (Edmund\u2019s daughter), who died in 1834 and devised \u201cto Asa Hall all my homestead farm where I now live.\u201d The probate inventory of Huldah Hall described the farm as \u201ccontaining by estimation Sixty Acres.\u201d One year later, Asa Hall granted to Nathan Williams \u201cthe same farm that was given me by will of Huldah Hall. . . and contains fifty acres be the same more or less.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The deed from Asa Hall to Nathan Williams also identified Joseph Hall, who then owned what is now the Perez Hall property, as the only western abutter. The parties do not dispute that modem surveying techniques would calculate the area of the original Huldah Hall farm to be 58.6 acres if Pauli\u2019s version of the disputed boundary is correct. Alternately, if Kelly\u2019s suggested placement were utilized, the area would total 50.4 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">2. <em>The registration proceeding and declaratory judgment action. </em>In 1987, Pauli\u2019s predecessors in title sought to establish ownership of the disputed parcel through a registration proceeding. After two days of trial, the judge issued a decision in which he concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">\u201cI find that [Pauli\u2019s predecessors] have not met their burden of proof in determining the northerly boundary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>the locus and that their petition must be and hereby is dismissed. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">\u201cIn so finding, I find only that [Pauli\u2019s predecessors] have not proven title to the disputed parcel. I make no finding as to [Kelly\u2019s predecessors\u2019] claim of title other than as herein stated, to such parcel and suggest to all parties concerned that should the disputed parcel be the matter of further litigation, such litigation should probably notice the appropriate Hall heirs as possible parties in interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The judgment provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cADJUDGED and ORDERED that [Pauli\u2019s predecessors] have not at this time provided sufficient credible evidence to prove the northerly boundary of said parcel and therefore have not proven title to said parcel as alleged. Accordingly, the . . . complaint is hereby dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Subsequently, Pauli initiated the present action,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> seeking a declaratory judgment that, at least as to Kelly, would establish the disputed boundary favorably to Pauli.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Kelly moved for summary judgment, arguing that issue or claim preclusion served to bar the action, based on the prior unsuccessful action for registration. The same Land Court judge who had presided over the registration proceeding denied Kelly\u2019s motion, reasoning that while Pauli\u2019s predecessors had been unable to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>their burden of proof for registration, \u201cclearly such finding did not determine the boundary at all, certainly not in favor of any party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Subsequently, this matter came to trial before a different Land Court judge. In the course of expert testimony, Pauli introduced an 1839 deed in the Perez Hall property chain of title (Perez Hall deed) that was in neither Pauli\u2019s nor Kelly\u2019s chain of title.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Perez Hall deed described the northern boundary of the Perez Hall property as running eastward along the boundary shared with Kelly\u2019s property \u201cto land of Nathan Williams,\u201d a predecessor in title to Pauli. The Perez Hall deed further described an eastern boundary that ran south \u201cthence in Williams line . . . one hundred fifty six rods to the road.\u201d According to these descriptions, the Perez Hall property and Pauli\u2019s predecessor shared an eastern boundary of a defined length that originated at the northwest comer of the disputed parcel, ran along the entire western edge of the disputed parcel, and continued to the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Relying substantially on these abutter calls, the trial judge ruled that the Perez Hall deed established the disputed boundary favorably to Pauli. Central to the judge\u2019s decision was her determination that despite the failure of extensive oral testimony<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to assist in fixing the boundary, the abutter calls in the 1835 deed from Asa Hall to Nathan Williams and the Perez Hall deed provided corroborating evidence that \u201cthe [disputed [pjarcel was originally part of [Pauli\u2019s property] and was never part of [Kelly\u2019s property].\u201d A judgment issued declaring that the northern boundary of the disputed parcel was the boundary between Pauli\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s parcels, in effect placing ownership of the disputed parcel in Pauli.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">3. <em>Issue and claim preclusion. </em>Kelly contends that the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>registration proceeding established conclusively that the northern boundary of the disputed parcel does not exist in the location advocated by Pauli. As a result, Kelly maintains, res judicata principles bar Pauli from again attempting to fix that same boundary to the disputed parcel in this action. This contention misconstrues what was resolved in that prior failed attempt to register title and the effect of that action on subsequent actions to resolve the boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Whether that prior failed attempt has preclusive effect is determined by G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 44, as amended by St. 1981, c. 658, \u00a7 24, which provides in pertinent part: \u201c[I]f the court finds that the plaintiff has not title proper for registration, a judgment shall be entered dismissing the complaint, and such judgment may be ordered to be without prejudice, in whole or in part, but unless so ordered it shall bind the parties, their privies and the land in respect of any issue of fact which has been tried and determined.\u201d After examining the judge\u2019s decision and the judgment dismissing the complaint in the registration action, we conclude that the complaint was not dismissed with prejudice and that the location of the disputed boundary was not \u201ctried and determined\u201d in that proceeding. Accordingly, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 44, does not bar Pauli from seeking to determine the location of that boundary in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">General Laws c. 185, \u00a7 44, makes clear that an unsuccessful registration proceeding can have two possible effects \u2014 one that is preclusive and one that is not. If the judge dismisses the action without prejudice, the failed attempt at registration has no preclusive effect and will not bar either a subsequent attempt at registration or any other method to determine or declare title. If the judge dismisses the action with prejudice, the statute precludes relitigating issues of fact that were \u201cactually tried and determined\u201d in the registration proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Here, the prior complaint for registration was dismissed \u201cwithout prejudice,\u201d even though the decision and judgment did not expressly use those talismanic words. The judge\u2019s decision focused on the inability of <em>any </em>party to prove the northern boundary of the disputed parcel and he observed that any future litigation should provide notice to other putative parties in interest. The judgment states that Pauli\u2019s predecessors in title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u201chave not <em>at this time </em>provided sufficient credible evidence to prove the northerly boundary of said parcel\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Even were we to assume, arguendo, that the express words \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d must appear in the judgment, the statute still would not bar Pauli from seeking to establish the disputed boundary here. When a boundary line is in controversy, it is \u201ca question of fact on all the evidence, including the various surveys and plans . . . where the true line originally ran, and was to be established.\u201d <em>Hurlbut Rogers Mach. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Me. R.R., </em>235 Mass. 402, 403 (1920). See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>284 Mass. 217, 222-223 (1933). Although the location of the disputed boundary was a fact at issue in the registration proceeding, G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 44, only precludes relitigation of a factual issue that was \u201cactually tried and determined.\u201d Compare <em>Lombard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>194 F.3d 305, 312 (1st Cir. 1999) (interpreting \u00a7 44). The prior attempt at registration failed because, at that time, Pauli\u2019s predecessor in title did not meet the requisite burden of proof to establish the boundary, not because the boundary was fixed elsewhere.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Compare <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Oak Bluffs, </em>419 Mass. 227, 232, 236 (1994) (subsequent suit precluded when earlier registration fully considered and resolved factual question of relevant boundary\u2019s location). Far from concluding that the disputed boundary existed in a particular location, the judgment in the registration action simply left resolution of that question of fact for another day.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Cayer, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 725, 729 &amp; n.5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>(2004) (litigant\u2019s failure to demonstrate ownership of title interest did not compel conclusion that litigant held no title interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">4. <em>Abutter calls in the Perez Hall deed. </em>Kelly next argues that the judge erred in first considering, and then giving disproportionate weight to, abutter calls in the Perez Hall deed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Rules of deed construction provide a hierarchy of priorities for interpreting descriptions in a deed. Descriptions that refer to monuments control over those that use courses and distances; descriptions that refer to courses and distances control over those that use area; and descriptions by area seldom are a controlling factor. See <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>269 Mass. 497, 499-500 (1929); <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. 251, 258-259 (1964). Moreover, when abutter calls are used to describe property, the land of an adjoining property owner is considered to be a monument. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 500; <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. at 259. Here, because the trial testimony had \u201cfailed to assist\u201d in determining the true location of the disputed boundary, the judge\u2019s decision rested, ultimately, on an interpretation of various deeds. When the judge\u2019s decision is based on an interpretation that arises \u201csolely from the documentary evidence,\u201d an appellate court has the \u201csame interpretive powers as the Land Court judge.\u201d <em>Darman </em>v. <em>Dunderdale, 362 </em>Mass. 633, 637 (1972). See <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Boston, 322 </em>Mass. 709, 715 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Applying these principles, we agree with the Land Court judge that the deeds in both Pauli\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s chain of title are facially neutral regarding ownership of the disputed parcel. With respect to descriptions that utilize monuments, various deeds describe Pauli\u2019s land as bounded on the west by the Perez Hall property, and on the north by Kelly\u2019s property. At the same time, various deeds describe Kelly\u2019s parcel as bounded on the south by the Perez Hall property. These abutter calls in Pauli\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s direct chains of title depict a situation where either Pauli or Kelly could own the disputed parcel. Courses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>distances are unhelpful in determining the boundary because deeds in Pauli\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s chains of title do not use that descriptive method.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Besides taking note of the rule that area seldom controls deed interpretation, we observe that the estimations of area in the pertinent documents do not prove or disprove Pauli\u2019s claim of ownership. As previously noted, Huldah Hall\u2019s 1834 will left Edmund Hall\u2019s original farm, \u201ccontaining by estimation Sixty Acres,\u201d to Asa Hall; and in 1835, Asa Hall conveyed \u201cthe same farm\u201d to Nathan Williams by deed but, without explanation, described the estimated area as fifty acres, an acreage repeated in subsequent deeds. Pauli\u2019s contention that the farm contained 58.6 acres resembles the acreage in the 1834 will. Kelly\u2019s view that the farm contained 50.4 acres resembles the subsequent estimations. In both the registration and this action, the judges considered reliance on area, but determined that several possible but unproven hypotheses made it an inapposite basis for judgment. We agree, particularly because the \u201cmore or less\u201d language suggests that the area call is not exact and that the grantor did not intend the acreage call to be a rehable measure of what was conveyed. See <em>Overly </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Recr. Gen., </em>344 Mass. 188, 192 (1962) (in the usual case, \u201c[u]se of the words \u2018about,\u2019 \u2018more or less,\u2019 and the like, to qualify a statement of quantity indicates that the quantity of land is not the essence of the contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Where the deed descriptions in both Pauli\u2019s and Kelly\u2019s chains of title are ambiguous regarding the location of their common boundary (and hence ownership of the disputed parcel), the Land Court judge properly considered the abutter calls in the Perez Hall deed as extrinsic evidence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>213 Mass. 128, 132-134 (1912); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>284 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>at 220; <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Wingate, </em>338 Mass. 481, 485 (1959); <em>Ryan </em>v. <em>Stavros, </em>348 Mass. at 259-260 (resort to extrinsic evidence is appropriate to assist interpretation of ambiguous deed descriptions). The abutter calls in the Perez Hall deed resolve any ambiguity as to the location of the disputed boundary in favor of Pauli. More precisely, these abutter calls establish that northern boundary because they (1) describe the undisputed northern boundary of the Perez Hall property as running eastward along Kelly\u2019s southern property line \u201cto the land of Nathan Williams\u201d; (2) identify Nathan Williams as the <em>sole </em>eastern abutter of the Perez Hall property<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>; and, most importantly, (3) accurately measure the course of the shared eastern boundary that originates at the northwest comer of the disputed parcel and then mns southerly a defined distance (156 rods) to the road.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, entry of a declaratory judgment in favor of Pauli was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The instant problem might have been avoided had Edmund and David made a clear record of how they divided their interest in their father\u2019s property. However, the manner of their division has been lost in the \u201cdust bin of history.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 453, 457 (1984). Lacking that logical starting point, the parties resorted, of necessity, to deeds and probate records from later points in their respective chains of title to support their positions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Abutter calls are statements in a deed that describe the landowner\u2019s parcel by reference to the owners of adjoining properties. See 1 Patton and Palomar, Land Titles \u00a7 128, at 331-332 (3d ed. 2003); 14 Powell, Real Property \u00a7 81A.05[2], at 85 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\">Kelly has argued at various times that the boundary actually exists some 393 feet to the south of where Pauli locates it (shown on the diagram as the southern boundary of the disputed parcel). However, Kelly now concedes that she cannot establish the boundary in that location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b705-12\">The discrepancy in acreage remains unexplained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In the interim, Pauli brought an action to try title that was dismissed by the Land Court. That action is irrelevant for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b706-9\"><em>As </em>recognized by the Land Court judge, a decree of land registration is fundamentally different from a declaratory judgment implicating land ownership. If Pauli had successfully registered title to the disputed parcel, the law would treat her claim of ownership as superior to a claim made by <em>any </em>other person. See G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 45 (establishing that a registration decree \u201cshall be conclusive upon and against all persons\u201d); <em>Deacy </em>v. <em>Berberian, </em>344 Mass. 321, 328 (1962), quoting from <em>Malaguti </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>262 Mass. 555, 567-568 (1928) (observing that registration is generally \u201cconclusive upon every one\u201d). Conversely, Pauli\u2019s success in this declaratory judgment action means only that the law treats her claim of ownership as superior to Kelly\u2019s. See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8, inserted by St. 1945, c. 582, \u00a7 1 (\u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought ... no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Although a \u201cdeed research plan,\u201d which included an abstract of the Perez Hall deed, was before the Land Court in the registration proceeding, there is no indication that the Perez Hall deed and the abutter calls therein were part of the evidence considered by the judge, who concluded that there was insufficient evidence for registration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\">This included testimony from experts in geology, archeological geology, and geoarcheology as to the use of paths, ways, roads, stone walls, fences, and stone markers to mark property boundaries. Although many of these were present along and in the area of the disputed boundary, the testimony was inconclusive as to the boundary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Indeed, the judge\u2019s later determination that the registration proceeding had no preclusive effect on this declaratory judgment action, serves, at least, as indication that the judge had not intended to dismiss the registration complaint with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The judge made precisely this point in his order denying summary judgment when he held that the registration did not have preclusive effect because \u201c[q]uite clearly such finding did not determine the boundary at all, certainly not in favor of any party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"><em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Wellock, </em>348 Mass. 778 (1964), the only case relied on by Kelly involving G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 44, is inapposite. In considering the effect of a prior dismissed petition for registration that was based on a claim of adverse possession, the court observed that the prior registration proceeding established that \u201cas between the parties to that petition and their privies,\u201d the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>litigant\u2019s \u201cattempted acts of dominion gave him no title to the locus.\u201d <em>Dungan </em>v. <em>Wellock, supra. </em>A conclusion that specific acts of dominion do not establish adverse possession is fundamentally different from the situation here, where the prior registration did not conclusively locate the disputed boundary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Nor was consideration of the Perez Hall deed improper for any other reason suggested by Kelly. Regardless of whether that deed was proffered in some form in the prior registration, it was properly considered here as relevant evidence on the unresolved factual question of where the disputed boundary should be located. The rules of evidence also pose no obstacle to admissibility, because recitals in ancient deeds between strangers are competent evidence to prove the location of a disputed line. <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>113 Mass. 264, 267 (1873). See <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>213 Mass. 128, 133 (1912). Contrary to Kelly\u2019s assertions, the Perez Hall deed is not untrustworthy. Substantial property rights hinged on whether that deed correctly described the Nathan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Williams property as a monument with a northern boundary in the depicted position. If the true northern boundary of the Williams property were actually more to the south, as Kelly contends, the northern boundary described by the Perez Hall deed would have slanted southerly and resulted in the Perez Hall property containing significantly less land.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\">This description exactly matches the description in a contemporaneous deed from Pauli\u2019s chain of title that identified the owner of the Perez Hall property as the sole western abutter for Pauli\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Kelly now argues that this calculation is inaccurate. However, the Land Court judge found the length to be within allowable error based on the testimony of a land surveyor, E. Otis Dyer.
