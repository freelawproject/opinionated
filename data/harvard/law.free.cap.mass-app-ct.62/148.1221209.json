On appeal, the defendant\u2019s sole argument is that the judge\u2019s instruction lowered the standard of proof because it used the phrase \u201creasonable certainty\u201d to define reasonable doubt. The defendant did not raise this objection below, and we review to determine if there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>56 Mass. App. Ct. 337, 347 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-14\">The jury could have found that the defendant robbed the victim of money and a cellular telephone while armed with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-15\">The defendant argues that the following portion of the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury lowered the standard of proof required to convict him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>\u201c[T]he evidence must convince you of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt to a <em>reasonable certainty, </em>a certainty that convinces your understanding and satisfies your reason and judgment as jurors who have been sworn to act conscientiously upon the evidence\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The Federal and State Constitutions require the government to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). In advising a jury of this burden, no particular form of words is required. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 342 (1995). When an instruction is challenged, a reviewing court should \u201cread the charge as a whole,\u201d and not \u201cscrutiniz[e] bits and pieces [of the instruction] removed from their context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 619, 624-625 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 9 (2001). In reviewing an \u201cinstruction defining reasonable doubt, the constitutional question is \u2018whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction on proof insufficient to meet the <em>Winship </em>standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. at 342, quoting from <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1, 16 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The instruction given in this case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> repeated almost verbatim the reasonable doubt instruction that had been given to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>and approved by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>423 Mass. 129, 139 n.9 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only material difference between the two versions is that in this case the judge omitted the two references to \u201cmoral certainty\u201d that appeared in the <em>Latimore </em>instruction. <em>Ibid. </em>The use of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d has been repeatedly criticized on the ground that it dilutes the government\u2019s burden of proof. See, e.g., <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 41 (1990) (per curiam), revd. on other grounds, <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. at 343-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In the present case, the judge replaced the first reference to \u201cmoral certainty\u201d in the <em>Latimore </em>instruction with \u201cnear certitude,\u201d a phrase that is equivalent to \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>433 Mass. 266, 272 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The judge also removed \u201cmoral\u201d from the phrase \u201creasonable and moral certainty\u201d used in <em>Latimore, </em>leaving in place the phrase \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d and it is this truncated phrase to which the defendant objects on appeal. The defendant\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ment that the use of \u201creasonable certainty\u201d constitutes reversible error is without merit. Just as the use of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d is not error if it is linked with language that lends content to the phrase, the use of the phrase \u201creasonable certainty\u201d is also not error, provided that it is similarly linked to appropriate language. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. at 345. See generally <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 315 (1985) (any flaw in the jury instructions must be viewed in the context of the charge as a whole).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Here, several aspects of the entire reasonable doubt instruction alleviate any concern that the jury were misled by the use of the phrase \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d Most significantly, immediately after the judge used \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d she defined the concept as that which \u201cconvinces your understanding and satisfies your reason and judgment as jurors who have been sworn to act conscientiously upon the evidence.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>427 Mass. 245, 254 (1998) (instruction which, in part, equated reasonable doubt with satisfaction according to the jury\u2019s conscience, upheld). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Limone, </em>410 Mass. 364, 369-370 (1991) (same). In addition, before the judge used the phrase \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d she defined proof beyond a reasonable doubt as that state when, after having \u201ccompared and considered all the evidence, you [the jury] have in your minds an abiding conviction, a near certitude that the charge is true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The use of either phrase \u2014 \u201can abiding conviction\u201d or \u201cnear certitude\u201d \u2014 lends appropriate content to an instruction on reasonable doubt and eliminates concerns that a phrase such as \u201creasonable certainty\u201d \u201cmight be misunderstood in the abstract.\u201d <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. at 21. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>439 Mass. 362, 369 (2003). The use of both \u201cnear certitude\u201d and \u201cabiding conviction,\u201d in conjunction with reasonable doubt and \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d were sufficient to convey to \u201cthe jury ... the high degree of certainty they must possess to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 571 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1091 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">The judge emphasized that a strong probability that the defendant was guilty was \u201csimply not enough.\u201d The judge also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>made clear that the defendant was presumed to be innocent; that the law imposed on the Commonwealth \u201cthe burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each and every one of the essential necessary elements or parts of the crime charged\u201d; and that, \u201c[i]f you [the jury] evaluate all the evidence and you still have a reasonable doubt remaining, then [the defendant] is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and he must be acquitted.\u201d Viewed as a whole, \u201cwe conclude that the instruction correctly conveyed to the jury the level of proof required to convict the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The entire instruction on reasonable doubt was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201cThe prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each and every one of the essential necessary elements or parts of the crime charged. And that burden of proof never shifts. It remains with the prosecution throughout the trial from start to finish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">\u201c[The defendant] had absolutely no burden to produce any evidence. He is entitled to a verdict of not guilty unless you are satisfied that the prosecution has produced evidence that convinces you beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">\u201cNow, what do we mean by proof beyond a reasonable doubt? The term is often used and probably fairly well understood, but it is not easily defined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt. For everything in the lives of human beings is open to some possible or imaginary doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201cA charge is proved beyond a reasonable doubt if after, you, the jury, have compared and considered all the evidence, you have in your minds an abiding conviction, a near certitude that the charge is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXI\">\u201cI have told you that every person is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty and that the burden of proving guilt is always on the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">\u201cIf you evaluate all the evidence and you still have a reasonable doubt remaining, then [the defendant] is entitled to the benefit of that doubt and he must be acquitted. He must be found not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">\u201cIt\u2019s not enough if the prosecution has established a probability, even a strong probability, that [the defendant] is more likely to be guilty than not guilty. That is simply not enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANK\">\u201cInstead the evidence must convince you of [the defendant\u2019s] guilt to a <em>reasonable certainty, </em>a certainty that convinces your understanding and satisfies your reason and judgment as jurors who have been sworn to act conscientiously upon the evidence. This is what we mean by proof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-11\">The charge is substantially based on the language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850).
