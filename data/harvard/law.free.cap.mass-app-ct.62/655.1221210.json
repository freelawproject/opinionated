Claiming that their charges were completely fabricated, Metzler brought suit against both Lanoue and Giurleo for slander, libel, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Lanoue and Giurleo filed counterclaims of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, sexual harassment, and abuse of process against Metzler; they also moved to dismiss his complaint under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge allowed defendants\u2019 special motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but did not rule on the defendants\u2019 counterclaims and did not enter a final judgment under Mass.R. Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). The plaintiff appeals from the allowance of the special motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Generally, \u201can appellate court will reject attempts to obtain piecemeal review of trial rulings that do not represent final dispositions on the merits.\u201d <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. 517, 520-521 (2002), quoting from <em>Ashford </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authy., </em>421 Mass. 563, 565 (1995). The Supreme Judicial Court has, however, identified narrow exceptions to this rule. <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 521. Under the doctrine of present execution, for example, an \u201cimmediate appeal of an interlocutory order is allowed if the order will interfere with rights in a way that cannot be remedied on appeal from the final judgment.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Cmmrs. of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 26, 30 (1987), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Forastiera </em>v. <em>Breault, </em>485 U.S. 906 (1988) (\u201ceven where part of an action remains undetermined, we treat an order as final if it is to be executed presently with the result that any later appeal would be futile\u201d). The court has also found that disqualification of counsel orders are immediately appealable as they are \u201csimilar in effect to the orders and decrees listed under the doctrine of present execution,\u201d because they too are \u201ceffectively unreviewable on appeal from judgment.\u201d <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 780 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">In <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 521-522, the court expressly held that the <em>denial </em>of a special motion to dismiss pursuant to the anti-SLAPP statute was likewise a \u201climited\u201d exception to the finality rule. The court concluded that the Legislature designed the anti-SLAPP statute to immunize petitioners from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\u201charassing litigation and the costs and burdens of defending against retaliatory lawsuits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520. When a special motion to dismiss is denied, the moving party presently loses that protection because she will then have to defend against \u201charassing litigation\u201d \u2014 the very problem the anti-SLAPP statute seeks to avoid. If the moving party is not allowed to appeal immediately, her ultimate appeal will therefore be futile because even if she wins, she will have had to defend herself at trial. <em>Ibid. </em>The court likened the anti-SLAPP situation to governmental immunity cases in which \u201c[t]he right to immunity from suit would be \u2018lost forever\u2019 if an order denying it were not appeal-able until the close of litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, quoting from <em>Brum </em>v. <em>Dartmouth, </em>428 Mass. 684, 688 (1999). See <em>Breault </em>v. <em>Chairman of the Bd. of Fire Commrs. of Springfield, </em>401 Mass. at 31; <em>Kent </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 312, 316 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Conversely, when a special motion to dismiss \u2014 which is not dispositive of the entire case \u2014 is allowed, the nonmoving party\u2019s appeal after a final judgment is not futile. See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. at 782. If the judge were incorrect in allowing the special motion, the claim improperly dismissed can be resurrected. We are unpersuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s unsupported argument that dismissing the interlocutory appeal would increase the over-all burden on litigants and might lead to uncertain results at the trial level. Regardless, interlocutory review runs counter to our \u201cbedrock policy against premature and piecemeal appeals.\u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 388 (2000) (denying rule 54[b] certification for partial summary judgment that eliminated theory of relief, but did not finally adjudicate a separate claim). Compare <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 547-548 (2001) (plaintiff\u2019s appeal from allowance of defendants\u2019 G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H, motion to dismiss complaint not interlocutory where defendants thereafter voluntarily dismissed counterclaims and final judgment entered).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">In conclusion, the <em>allowance </em>of the special motion to dismiss \u2014 which is not dispositive of all claims and is not the subject of a rule 54(b) certification \u2014 is not immediately appealable because it does not render futile plaintiff\u2019s rights of appeal from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>final judgment. See <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. at 779-782; <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>436 Mass. at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The acronym \u201cSLAPP\u201d stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. 543, 544 n.2 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\">To prevail on a special motion, the moving party must first make a threshold showing that the claims are \u201c \u2018based on\u2019 the petitioning activities alone.\u201d <em>Duracraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Holmes Prods. Corp., 427 </em>Mass. 156, 167 (1998). The burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to prove that \u201c(1) the moving party\u2019s exercise of its right to petition was devoid of any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis in law and (2) the moving party\u2019s acts caused actual injury to the responding party.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>434 Mass. at 551-552, quoting from G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 59H.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
