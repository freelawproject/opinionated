Because the no-fault act does not create different standards depending on who provides the services, this requirement applies equally to services that a family member provides and services that an unrelated caregiver provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">If the fact-finder concludes that a plaintiff incurred allowable expenses in receiving care from a family member, the fact-finder must also determine to what extent any claimed expense is a \u201creasonable charge[].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While it is appropriate for the fact-finder to consider hourly rates charged by individual caregivers when selling their services (whether to their employers that commercially provide those services or directly to injured persons), comparison of hourly rates charged by commercial caregiving agencies is far too attenuated from an individual\u2019s charge for the fact-finder simply to adopt that agency charge as an individual\u2019s reasonable charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In applying these principles of law to the facts of this case, we hold that the Court of Appeals correctly determined that plaintiff may recover \u201callowable expenses\u201d to the extent that they encompass services that are reasonably necessary for plaintiff\u2019s care when the care is \u201crelated to [plaintiff\u2019s] injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, because the circuit court erred by awarding damages for allowable expenses without requiring proof that the underlying charges were actually incurred, we agree with the decision of the Court of Appeals to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>remand this case to the circuit court for a determination whether charges for allowable expenses were actually incurred. Nevertheless, we also conclude that the Court of Appeals erred to the extent that its decision limited the scope of the determination on remand to the period after November 7, 2006. Instead, the circuit court must reexamine on remand the evidentiary proofs supporting the entire award. While we reject defendant\u2019s request for a verdict of no cause of action because there remain unresolved questions of fact, we caution the circuit court that a fact-finder can only award benefits that are proved to have been incurred. Finally, in determining the hourly rate for attendant care services, the circuit court clearly erred by ruling that plaintiff is entitled to an hourly rate of $40 for attendant care services because that rate is entirely inconsistent with the evidence of an individual\u2019s rate of compensation, including the compensation that Katherine Douglas, plaintiffs wife, actually received as an employee hired to care for plaintiff. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this issue. Therefore, we affirm in part, reverse in part, vacate the award of attendant care benefits, and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In 1996, plaintiff, James Douglas, sustained a severe closed-head brain injury when a hit-and-run motorist struck the bicycle he was riding. Plaintiff was hospitalized for approximately one month after the accident and received therapy and rehabilitation after his discharge. Because the driver of the motor vehicle that struck plaintiff could not be identified, plaintiff sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>assignment of a first-party insurance provider through the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The facility assigned defendant, Allstate Insurance Company, to plaintiffs claim. In the three years after the accident, defendant paid plaintiff PIP benefits for his hospitalization, medical expenses, wage loss, and attendant care, as well as for replacement services, in accordance with the no-fault act. Defendant claims that plaintiff did not seek additional PIP benefits after 1999 until he filed the instant lawsuit in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In 1999, plaintiff began the first of a series of full-time jobs. However, he was unable to hold a job for very long, and he eventually stopped working. During this time, he twice attempted suicide. After the second suicide attempt, a 2005 letter written by plaintiffs psychiatrist indicated that plaintiff \u201crequires further treatment\u201d because he \u201ccontinues to suffer from ill-effects as a result of his closed-head injury. . . .\u201d In particular, the psychiatrist emphasized that plaintiff suffered from short-term memory problems and impulsivity as a result of the accident and explained that plaintiff \u201cshould have the opportunity to obtain the care that will most likely restore him to a good level of functioning.\u201d Defendant claims that it did not receive this letter before plaintiff initiated this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Plaintiff filed the instant lawsuit on May 31, 2005, in the Washtenaw Circuit Court seeking compensation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>unspecified PIP benefits that defendant \u201chas refused or is expected to refuse to pay____\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defendant filed three successive dispositive motions, only the first of which was granted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Relevant here, the second motion for summary disposition claimed that attendant care was not reasonably necessary because none of plaintiffs medical providers had prescribed attendant care for plaintiff. The circuit court denied the motion without prejudice in advance of further discovery. The third motion for partial summary disposition claimed that plaintiff could not recover for attendant care services provided before November 7, 2006, because plaintiffs treating psychologist, Dr. Thomas Rosenbaum, neither authorized nor prescribed attendant care services before that date. In opposing the motion, plaintiff offered an affidavit from Dr. Rosenbaum, which stated that plaintiff \u201cis in need of aide care during all waking hours\u201d and that Katherine Douglas \u201chas been providing her husband with aide care, while the two of them are together, since the motor vehicle accident.\u201d After hearing oral argument, the circuit court denied defendant\u2019s third motion, ruling that Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s affidavit created a question of fact that precluded partial summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The parties proceeded to a bench trial on the claim for attendant care services that Mrs. Douglas allegedly provided. Defendant\u2019s claims adjuster testified during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>plaintiffs case-in-chief as an adverse witness. This witness agreed with plaintiffs counsel that plaintiff \u201cwould have needed [attendant care] back when the lawsuit first began\u201d in 2005 and that \u201cit would be appropriate to pay Mrs. Douglas for some of [the] care that she provides ... at home[.]\u201d However, on direct examination by defendant\u2019s counsel, the claims adjuster testified that there was no evidence that any compensable care had actually been provided to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Katherine Douglas testified that when she was at home, her entire time was spent \u201cbabysitting\u201d and \u201cwatching James,\u201d even while she was performing other household chores. She believed that her presence in the house kept plaintiff from being hospitalized or incarcerated. She also testified about a series of forms, each labeled \u201cAFFIDAVIT OF ATTENDANT CARE SERVICES,\u201d all dated June 25, 2007, covering each month between November 2004 and June 2007. These forms totaled up the number of hours during which she claimed to have provided services and outlined the various tasks that she performed, including organizing her family\u2019s day-to-day life, cooking meals, undertaking daily chores, maintaining the family\u2019s house and yard, ordering and monitoring plaintiffs medications, communicating with health care providers and Social Security Administration officials, calling plaintiff from work to ensure plaintiffs safety, monitoring plaintiffs safety, and cueing or prompting various tasks for plaintiff to undertake. However, she admitted that the forms were all completed in June 2007, that she did not contemporaneously itemize the amount of time she spent on any particular item, and that in completing the forms, she went through household bills to reconstruct what had occurred in her life during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Dr. Rosenbaum testified that he began treating plaintiff on November 7, 2006, and recommended that Mrs. Douglas provide attendant care for all of plaintiffs waking hours,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> although in November 2007 he revised his recommendation to 40 hours of attendant care a week. Dr. Rosenbaum also testified that <em>his </em>company, TheraSupport, L.L.C., served as plaintiffs attendant care provider and that TheraSupport had employed Mrs. Douglas to provide her husband\u2019s attendant care. Although TheraSupport paid Mrs. Douglas $10 an hour for providing services to plaintiff, it billed plaintiff $40 an hour for those very services. Dr. Rosenbaum averred that defendant eventually paid all of TheraSupport\u2019s bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Defendant\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Charles Seigerman, testified that he conducted a battery of cognitive tests on plaintiff and concluded that two hours of attendant care services a day are needed to help plaintiff organize the logistics of his treatment and ensure that he takes his medicine. Dr. Seigerman also testified that an appropriate hourly rate for these services was \u201caround $10.00 an hour,\u201d or \u201c[p]erhaps a little higher,\u201d although he acknowledged on cross-examination that he was not an expert on the appropriate rate of compensation for this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The circuit court awarded PIP benefits to plaintiff, explaining that he \u201cneeds aide care for all of his waking hours.\u201d The circuit court calculated that plaintiff was entitled to a total of 67 hours a week of attendant care for the period between May 31, 2004, and November 1, 2007, and 40 hours a week after November 1, 2007.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The court established a $40 hourly rate for those services. The judgment entered on November 18, 2009, and totaled $1,163,395.40, which included attorney fees, no-fault interest, costs, and judgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. First, the panel rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the circuit court had erred by denying its final two motions for summary disposition. In particular, the panel concluded that Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s affidavit created a question of fact regarding whether attendant care services were \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for the period before Dr. Rosenbaum began treating plaintiff on November 7, 2006.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The panel also rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the circuit court had erred by awarding plaintiff benefits for replacement services because the award \u201cwas not intended to compensate Katherine for her mere presence in the home,\u201d but instead was intended to compensate for \u201cplaintiffi\u2019s] required supervision,\u201d and \u201cKatherine was the appropriate person to provide it.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s award, however, because \u201cthe trial evidence in this case did not reflect that Katherine maintained records of her claimed attendant care.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although Mrs. Douglas had submitted several forms, each labeled \u201cAFFIDAVIT OF ATTENDANT CARE SERVICES,\u201d the panel concluded that when the descriptions on the forms had not been \u201cleft blank,\u201d they were \u201cvague\u201d and only constituted \u201can effort to reconstruct her time.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the panel remanded for further proceedings \u201cregarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>amount of incurred expenses for attendant care from November 7, 2006, to November 18, 2009,\u201d and to determine \u201cwhether Katherine reasonably expected compensation at the time of performance.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Finally, the panel upheld the circuit court\u2019s $40 hourly rate because that rate \u201cis supported by Rosenbaum\u2019s testimony regarding the rate charged by his TheraSupport program for attendant care and also the testimony of defendant\u2019s adjuster regarding rates charged by commercial agencies for home attendant care.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered the parties to brief the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(1) whether the Court of Appeals erred in remanding this case to the trial court for further proceedings regarding the amount of incurred expenses for attendant care from November 7, 2006, to November 18, 2009, after finding that the trial court clearly erred in awarding attendant care benefits to the plaintiff without requiring sufficient documentation to support the daily and weekly hours underlying the award; (2) whether the plaintiff presented sufficient proofs at trial to support the trial court\u2019s award of attendant care benefits for the period before November 7, 2006; (3) whether activities performed by Katherine Douglas constituted attendant care under MCL 500.3107(l)(a) or replacement services under MCL 500.3107(l)(c); and (4) whether the trial court clearly erred in awarding attendant care benefits at the rate of $40 per hour.[<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">This case involves the interpretation of the no-fault act. \u201cIssues of statutory interpretation are questions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>law that this Court reviews de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> When interpreting a statute, we must \u201cascertain the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This requires courts to consider \u201cthe plain meaning of the critical word or phrase as well as \u2018its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If the statutory language is unambiguous, \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s intent is clear and judicial construction is neither necessary nor permitted.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We review de novo the denial of a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> A motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10) requires the reviewing court to consider \u201cthe pleadings, admissions, and other evidence submitted by the parties in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Summary disposition is appropriate if there is no genuine issue regarding any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In civil actions tried without a jury, MCR 2.517(A)(1) requires the court to \u201cfind the facts specially, state separately its conclusions of law, and direct entry of the appropriate judgment.\u201d We review these findings of fact for clear error,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> which occurs when \u201c \u2018the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">A. LEGAL BACKGROUND OF THE NO-FAULT ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">MCL 500.3105(1) establishes that a personal protection insurance provider is liable under the no-fault act \u201cto pay benefits for accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, subject to the provisions of this chapter.\u201d Accordingly, MCL 500.3105(1) imposes two threshold causation requirements for PIP benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">First, an insurer is liable only if benefits are <em>\u201cfor </em>accidental bodily injury.. ..\u201d \u201c[F]or\u201d implies a causal connection. \u201c[Alccidental bodily injury\u201d therefore triggers an insurer\u2019s liability and defines the scope of that liability. Accordingly, a no-fault insurer is liable to pay benefits only to the extent that the claimed benefits are causally connected to the accidental bodily injury arising out of an automobile accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">Second, an insurer is liable to pay benefits for accidental bodily injury only if those injuries \u201caris[e] out of\u201d or are caused by \u201cthe ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle ....\u201d It is not <em>any </em>bodily injury that triggers an insurer\u2019s liability under the no-fault act. Rather, it is only those injuries that are caused by the insured\u2019s use of a motor vehicle.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">MCL 500.3107(1) further limits what benefits are compensable as PIP benefits, allowing unlimited lifetime benefits for \u201callowable expenses\u201d but limiting \u201cordinary and necessary services\u201d to a three-year period after the accident and to a $20 daily limit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Except as provided in subsection (2), personal protection insurance benefits are payable for the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">(a) Allowable expenses consisting of all reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">(c) Expenses not exceeding $20.00 per day, reasonably incurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those that, if he or she had not been injured, an injured person would have performed during the first 3 years after the date of the accident, not for income but for the benefit of himself or herself or of his or her dependent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v Recca </em>clarified that the \u201cordinary and necessary services\u201d contemplated in subsection (1)(c) \u2014 commonly referred to as \u201creplacement services\u201d \u2014 constitute a category of expenses distinct from the \u201callowable expenses\u201d contemplated in subsection (1)(a).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">This case requires this Court to consider whether the specific services at issue here were \u201callowable expenses\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> or whether they were replacement services.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The distinction between allowable expenses and replacement services is important in this case because the operation of the one-year-back rule, MCL 500.3145(1), prevents plaintiff from recovering benefits for otherwise allowable expenses incurred more than one year before the filing of the lawsuit. Thus, plaintiff cannot recover benefits for otherwise allowable expenses incurred before May 31, 2004, which was nearly eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>years after plaintiffs July 1996 accident. Because recovery for replacement services is limited to those services provided in the first three years after the accident, plaintiff cannot recover any benefits for replacement services. Accordingly, in this case, plaintiff can only recover benefits for services to the extent that the services were allowable expenses within the meaning of MCL 500.3107(l)(a) and incurred after May 31, 2004. It is to the definition of \u201callowable expenses\u201d that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">B. allowable expenses</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">MCL 500.3107(1)(a) defines \u201callowable expenses\u201d as \u201call reasonable charges incurred for reasonably necessary products, services and accommodations for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d We have recognized that the plain language of this provision imposes four requirements that a PIP claimant must prove before recovering benefits for allowable expenses: (1) the expense must be for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation, (2) the expense must be reasonably necessary, (3) the expense must be incurred, and (4) the charge must be reasonable.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We will address these requirements seriatim as we apply them to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">1. SERVICES \u201cFOR\u201d AN INSURED\u2019S CARE, RECOVERY, OR REHABILITATION</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">MCL 500.3107(1)(a) requires that allowable expenses must be \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d As we explained in <em>Griffith v State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co, </em>\u201cexpenses for \u2018recovery\u2019 or \u2018rehabilitation\u2019 are costs expended in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>to bring an insured to a condition of health or ability sufficient to resume his preinjury life,\u201d while expenses for \u201ccare\u201d \u201cmay not restore a person to his preinjury state.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> While the dictionary definition of \u201ccare\u201d \u201ccan be broadly construed to encompass <em>anything </em>that is reasonably necessary to the provision of a person\u2019s protection or charge,\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> because MCL 500.3107(1)(a) \u201cspecifically limits compensation to charges for products or services that are reasonably necessary for an <em>injured person\u2019s </em>care, recovery, or rehabilitation^] . . . [t]his context suggests that \u2018care\u2019 must be related to the insured\u2019s injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In comparing the definition of \u201ccare\u201d to the definitions of \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation,\u201d we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201c[c]are\u201d must have a meaning that is broader than \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d but is not so broad as to render those terms nugatory.... \u201c[RJecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d refer to an underlying injury; likewise, the statute as a whole applies only to \u201can injured person.\u201d It follows that the Legislature intended to limit the scope of the term \u201ccare\u201d to expenses for those products, services, or accommodations whose provision is necessitated by the injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident. \u201cCare\u201d is broader than \u201crecovery\u201d and \u201crehabilitation\u201d because it may encompass expenses for products, services, and accommodations that are necessary because of the accident but that may not restore a person to his preinjury state.[<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">We reaffirm here <em>Griffith\u2019s </em>definition of \u201ccare\u201d as it relates to the scope of allowable expenses: although services for an insured\u2019s care need not restore a person to his preinjury state, the services must be related to the insured\u2019s injuries to be considered allowable expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>In analyzing this requirement as applied to the particular services claimed in this case, we note that prior panels of the Court of Appeals examined the extent to which a family member\u2019s services can be considered allowable expenses under the no-fault act. In <em>Visconti v Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, </em>the panel analogized no-fault benefits to worker\u2019s compensation benefits and ruled that \u201c \u2018[o]rdinary household tasks\u2019 \u201d that a family member performs are not allowable expenses, but \u201c \u2018[s]erving meals in bed and bathing, dressing, and escorting a disabled person are not ordinary household tasks\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and can therefore be considered allowable expenses pursuant to MCL 500.3107.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">A subsequent Court of Appeals panel applied <em>Visconti </em>and allowed the plaintiff to recover no-fault benefits when a family member was \u201crequired to serve his meals in bed, bathe him, escort him to the doctor\u2019s office, exercise him in conformity with his doctor\u2019s instructions, assist in formulating his diet, administer medication, and assist him with speech and associational therapy.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Court also held that, even though the family member who provided these services was not a licensed medical care provider, \u201c[t]he statute does not require that these services be supplied by \u2018trained medical personnel\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In other words, while the no-fault act specifies and limits what types of expenses are compensable, it places no limitation on <em>who </em>may perform what is otherwise an allowable expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The statutory language of MCL 500.3107 confirms the distinction between a family member providing attendant care to an injured person \u2014 which is \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> \u2014 and a family member providing replacement services to benefit the entire household\u2014 which are \u201cordinary and necessary services\u201d that replace services that the injured person would have performed \u201cfor the benefit of himself or herself or of his or her dependent.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reiterate this Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Johnson </em>that replacement services as described in MCL 500.3107(1)(c) are distinct from allowable expenses under MCL 500.3107(1)(a).<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Allowable expenses cannot be for \u201cordinary and necessary services\u201d because ordinary and necessary services are not \u201cfor an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In this case, defendant claims that a judgment of no cause of action should be entered because Mrs. Douglas did not perform any compensable allowable expenses, only replacement services, which are not compensable in this case because of the three-year time limit of MCL 500.3107(1)(c). We disagree with defendant\u2019s claim and conclude that defendant is not entitled to relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Defendant is correct that Mrs. Douglas\u2019s testimony and attendant care forms indicate that she provided many services that are properly considered replacement services, including daily organization of family life; preparation of family meals; yard, house, and car maintenance; and daily chores. These services are prototypical \u201cordinary and necessary\u201d services that every Michi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>gan household must undertake.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> While replacement services for the household might be necessitated by the injury if the injured person otherwise would have performed them himself, they are not <em>for </em>his care and therefore do not fall within the definition of allowable expenses. Nevertheless, the fact that Mrs. Douglas performed <em>some </em>replacement services does not preclude recovery for the allowable expenses that <em>actually were incurred, </em>including attendant care services. The fact that her attendant care forms list certain replacement services is not dispositive on this issue, especially given that other services listed on those forms can reasonably be considered attendant care services, including traveling to and communicating with plaintiffs medical providers and managing plaintiffs medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The circuit court ruled that Mrs. Douglas \u201cis Plaintiffs caretaker and basically spends her free time making sure that Plaintiff is cared for, and does not harm himself as he tried to do in a suicide attempt.\u201d This factual finding is not clearly erroneous because it is consistent with Mrs. Douglas\u2019s testimony that she was \u201cwatching James\u201d even while she was performing household chores by herself. Furthermore, it suggests that the circuit court adopted plaintiffs argument that Mrs. Douglas\u2019s supervision constituted attendant care services.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s claim that Mrs. Douglas only provided replacement services and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>compared the claimed supervision with this state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation caselaw that allows \u201con-call\u201d supervision,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> even when the care provider is pursuing other tasks while on call.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> We affirm the result of the Court of Appeals on this issue and hold that defendant is not entitled to a verdict of no cause of action on the basis of its claim that Mrs. Douglas <em>only </em>provided replacement services because there was testimony given at trial that at least some of the services she said she had provided were consistent with the requirement of MCL 500.3107(1)(a) that allowable expenses be for an injured person\u2019s care as necessitated by the injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> For instance, even if Mrs. Douglas\u2019s claimed supervision of plaintiff does not restore plaintiff to his preinjury state, testimony given at trial indicates that arguably at least some of this claimed supervision was for plaintiff\u2019s care as necessitated by the injury sustained in the motor vehicle accident and not for ordinary and necessary services that every Michigan household must undertake. Accordingly, defendant is not entitled to relief on the claim that <em>none </em>of Mrs. Douglas\u2019s claimed services could be considered attendant care services within the meaning of MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">2. REASONABLY NECESSARY EXPENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">MCL 500.3107(1)(a) also requires allowable expenses to be \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d In <em>Krohn v Home-Owners </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Insurance Co, </em>this Court clarified that this requirement \u201cmust be assessed by using an objective standard.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Defendant questions the reasonable necessity of attendant care services for the period before November 7, 2006, because there was no medical prescription for attendant care services before that date.'</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Before the circuit court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s third motion for summary disposition, plaintiff offered the affidavit of Dr. Rosenbaum, who explained that plaintiff \u201cis in need of [attendant] care during all waking hours\u201d and that Mrs. Douglas had provided that care \u201csince [the time of] the motor vehicle accident.\u201d The circuit court based its denial of defendant\u2019s motion in part on Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s affidavit. In reviewing that decision, the Court of Appeals determined that \u201cthe affiant relied on the statements of the parties to determine what activity plaintiff\u2019s wife engaged in during the subject period and subsequently evaluated those activities and found them to meet the definition of attendant care.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Thus, the panel held that the circuit court did not err by concluding that there were questions of fact sufficient to defeat defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary disposition. We agree with the Court of Appeals that questions of fact precluded summary disposition on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Moreover, we conclude that it was not clear error for the circuit court as fact-finder to conclude that attendant care services were, in fact, reasonably necessary for the period before November 7, 2006. There is a factual basis in the record to support the circuit court\u2019s conclusion: Dr. Rosenbaum testified at trial that, as early as 1997, plaintiffs doctors had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>recommended that plaintiff receive 24-hour supervision.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Furthermore, defendant\u2019s claims adjuster agreed with the statement of plaintiffs counsel that, if plaintiff needed attendant care services at the time of trial, \u201che would have needed [those services] back when the lawsuit first began[.]\u201d This evidence was sufficient for the circuit court to conclude that because attendant care services were reasonably necessary after November 7, 2006 (a point that defendant does not dispute), they were also reasonably necessary before that date. As a result, defendant has not established that the circuit court clearly erred by concluding that plaintiff proved this element of the allowable expenses analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">3. INCURRED EXPENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">MCL 500.3107(1)(a) also limits allowable expenses to \u201ccharges incurred.\u201d That is, even if a claimant can show that services were for his care and were reasonably necessary, an insurer \u201cis not obliged to pay any amount except upon submission of evidence that services were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number><em>actually rendered </em>and of the <em>actual cost </em>expended.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Because an insurer\u2019s liability</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">cannot be detached from the specific payments involved, or expenses incurred,... [w]here a plaintiff is unable to show that a particular, reasonable expense has been incurred for a reasonably necessary product and service, there can be no finding of a breach of the insurer\u2019s duty to pay that expense, and thus no finding of liability with regard to that expense.[<footnotemark>53</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">This Court has defined \u201cincur\u201d as it appears in MCL 500.3107(1)(a) as \u201c \u2018[t]o become liable or subject to, [especially] because of one\u2019s own actions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Similarly, a \u201ccharge\u201d is a \u201c[pecuniary burden, cost\u201d or \u201c[a] price required or demanded for service rendered or goods supplied.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, the statutory requirement that \u201ccharges\u201d be \u201cincurred\u201d requires some degree of liability that exists as a result of the insured\u2019s actually having received the underlying goods or services. Put differently, because a charge is something \u201crequired or demanded,\u201d the caregiver must have an expectation that she be compensated because there is no \u201cchargeG incurred\u201d when a good or service is provided with <em>no </em>expectation of compensation from the insurer.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ingly, this Court noted in <em>Burris v Allstate Insurance Co </em>that caregivers must have \u201cexpected compensation for their services.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Without the expectation of compensation, \u201cthe evidence fail[s] to establish that the plaintiff \u2018incurred\u2019 attendant-care expenses.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The fact that charges have been incurred can be shown \u201cby various means,\u201d including \u201ca contract for products and services\u201d or \u201ca paid bill.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The requirement of proof is not extinguished simply because a family member, rather than a commercial health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>provider, acts as a claimant\u2019s caregiver. Indeed, MCL 500.3107(1)(a) does not distinguish a \u201cchargeD incurred\u201d when a family member provides care from one incurred when an unrelated medical professional provides care.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> As a result, there is only one evidentiary standard to determine whether expenses were incurred regardless of who provided the underlying services. <em>Any </em>insured who incurs charges for services must present proof of those charges in order to establish, by a preponderance of evidence, that he is entitled to PIP benefits.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">This evidentiary requirement is most easily satisfied when an insured or a caregiver submits itemized statements, bills, contracts, or logs listing the nature of services provided with sufficient detail for the insurer to determine whether they are compensable.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Indeed, the best way of proving that a caregiver actually \u201cexpected compensation for [her] services\u201d at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>services were rendered<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> is for the caregiver to document the incurred charges contemporaneously with providing them \u2014 whether in a formal bill or in another memorialized statement that logs with specificity the nature and amount of services rendered \u2014 and submit that documentation to the insurer within a reasonable amount of time after the services were rendered. While no statutory provision <em>requires </em>that this method be used to establish entitlement to allowable expenses \u2014 a caregiver\u2019s testimony can allow a fact-finder to conclude that expenses have been incurred \u2014 a claimant\u2019s failure to request reimbursement for allowable expenses in a timely fashion runs the risk that the one-year-back rule will limit the claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits, as occurred here when plaintiff commenced a lawsuit to recover allowable expenses that were alleged to have been incurred more than one year earlier.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Moreover, once a claimant seeks payment from the insurer for providing ongoing services, the insurer can request regular statements logging the nature and amount of those services to ensure that the claimed services are compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The problem of a caregiver\u2019s failure to provide contemporaneous documentary evidence of allowable expenses is aptly illustrated in this case, in which Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Douglas submitted documents constructed in one day as proof of services rendered over the course of approximately three years. The lack of contemporaneous documentation implicates her credibility regarding whether the services were actually rendered in the manner documented.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Moreover, this failure to provide contemporaneous documentation may also be relevant to the fact-finder\u2019s determination whether Mrs. Douglas actually expected payment for providing those services. In this case, the circuit court failed to make a finding regarding whether the charges were actually incurred, including whether Mrs. Douglas expected compensation or reimbursement at the time she provided the services. Nevertheless, the circuit court awarded plaintiff attendant care benefits for 67 hours a week for the period between May 31, 2004, and November 1, 2007, and 40 hours a week for the period between November 1, 2007, and November 18, 2009. The Court of Appeals remanded this case to the circuit court and allowed the circuit court to \u201ctake additional testimony, if necessary, and amend its findings or render new findings, and amend the judgment accordingly.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The panel identified three problems with the circuit court\u2019s award of attendant care benefits: the circuit court \u201cclearly erred in awarding attendant care benefits to plaintiff without requiring sufficient documentation to support the daily or weekly hours underlying the award\u201d;<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> it erred by failing to consider \u201cwhether [Mrs. Douglas] reasonably expected compensation at the time of performance\u201d;<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>and it erred by failing to account for payments made to Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s agency, TheraSupport, which employed Mrs. Douglas as plaintiffs attendant care provider.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">We underscore the importance of the proofs necessary to establish entitlement to benefits. The circuit court issued a judgment in favor of plaintiff without finding that the expenses were <em>actually incurred </em>given that its determination of the number of hours to award plaintiff had no discernible basis in the evidence presented at trial and did not examine whether Mrs. Douglas had the expectation of payment for her services. While it awarded plaintiff benefits for 40 hours a week of attendant care services for the period beginning November 1, 2007, in accord with Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s prescription, there is no basis for its findings that Mrs. Douglas <em>actually </em>provided 40 hours of care each week during that period. Indeed, because she was unavailable to provide services during her working hours, there is no basis for compensating her for any hours that she spent working outside the home.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Similarly, the award for the period before November 1, 2007, was made with no discernible basis in the record. Therefore, the Court of Appeals properly recognized that that award could not be sustained and appropriately remanded this case for findings of fact based on the evidence.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Although the Court of Appeals established the scope of the determination of remand to the period after November 7, 2006, we direct the circuit court to make findings of fact as they pertain to the entire period of the lawsuit. The Court of Appeals did not explain how it decided that only the period after November 7, 2006, should be considered on remand, and more important, there is nothing in the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion or in the circuit court record that indicates that the circuit court\u2019s award for the period between May 31, 2004, and November 7, 2006, falls outside the ruling of the Court of Appeals that the circuit court \u201caward[ed] attendant care benefits to plaintiff without requiring sufficient documentation to support the daily or weekly hours underlying the award.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>entire award of attendant care benefits and clarify that on remand the circuit court must examine the entire period to determine whether plaintiff submitted sufficient proofs that allowable expenses were incurred but not reimbursed.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">4. REASONABLE CHARGE FOR EXPENSES</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Once a fact-finder has concluded that a plaintiff incurred allowable expenses in receiving care from a family member, the fact-finder must determine whether the charge is \u201creasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In this case, the circuit court awarded attendant care benefits to plaintiff at a $40 hourly rate. Although the circuit court did not explicitly state the basis of its hourly rate, the Court of Appeals identified two pieces of evidence adduced at trial as justification for the circuit court\u2019s ruling: Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s testimony that his company charges $40 an hour for attendant care and the testimony of defendant\u2019s adjuster regarding the rates that commercial agencies charge for attendant care services. We conclude that this testimony regarding the rates that commercial agencies charge is based on factors too attenuated from those underlying the rate charged for an individual\u2019s provision of attendant care services to be adopted as an individual\u2019s reasonable charge for attendant care services. This is a particularly erroneous circuit court finding given that Mrs. Douglas was actually paid $10 an hour by Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s company for providing attendant care services to her husband. Why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>the circuit court believed that the commercial rate Dr. Rosenbaum charged was more relevant than what he paid Mrs. Douglas is unstated and unjustified on this record. Accordingly, the circuit court\u2019s $40 hourly rate is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Although this Court has not ruled on the issue, the Court of Appeals in <em>Bonkowski v Allstate Insurance Co </em>stated that a commercial agency\u2019s rate for attendant care services is irrelevant to the fact-finder\u2019s determination of what constitutes a reasonable rate for a family member\u2019s provision of those services. Then Judge ZAHRA, writing for the court, noted that \u201c[i]n determining reasonable compensation for an unlicensed person who provides health care services, a fact-finder may consider the compensation paid to licensed health care professionals who provide similar services.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The opinion went on to state that the fact-finder\u2019s \u201cfocus should be on the compensation provided to the person providing the services, not the charge associated by an agency that hires health care professionals to provide such services.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The compensation actually paid to caregivers who provide similar services is necessarily relevant to the fact-finder\u2019s determination of a reasonable charge for a family member\u2019s provision of these services because it helps the fact-finder to determine what the caregivers could receive on the open market. While a commercial agency\u2019s fee incorporates this relevant piece of data\u2014 the compensation it pays to its caregivers \u2014 it also incorporates additional costs into its charge that family members who provide services do not incur, particularly the overhead costs inherent in the agency\u2019s provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>services. Thus, the total agency rate is too attenuated from the particular component of the agency rate that the fact-finder must determine in the instant case\u2014 \u201cthe compensation provided to the person providing the services . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">While we do not adopt the reasoning in <em>Bonkowski </em>in its entirety, we agree with <em>Bonkowski </em>that the fact-finder\u2019s focus must be on an <em>individual\u2019s </em>compensation. Accordingly, we hold that a fact-finder may base the hourly rate for a family member\u2019s provision of attendant care services on what health care agencies compensate their employees, but what health care agencies charge their patients is too attenuated from the appropriate hourly rate for a family member\u2019s services to be controlling.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Rather, the fact-finder must determine what is a reasonable charge for an <em>individual\u2019s </em>provision of services, not an agency\u2019s. While an agency rate might bear some relation to an individual\u2019s rate, it cannot be uncritically adopted as an individual\u2019s rate in the absence of specific circumstances that warrant such a rate \u2014 for instance, when the individual caregiver has overhead and administrative costs similar to those of a commercial agency.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>This case does not reflect such circumstances. Rather, there is undisputed testimony that Mrs. Douglas actually received $10 an hour in providing attendant care services to plaintiff during the time she served as Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s employee. Because this figure is the rate she <em>actually </em>received for providing attendant care services, it is highly probative of what constitutes a reasonable charge for her services. Therefore, we agree with defendant that the circuit court clearly erred by ruling that plaintiff is entitled to a $40 hourly rate for Mrs. Douglas\u2019s attendant care services. The only evidentiary basis for that figure is the rate that commercial agencies charge for attendant care services, and that rate is far too attenuated from an individual caregiver\u2019s actual rate of compensation to serve as the sole basis for the award of benefits in these circumstances.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Therefore, if the circuit court concludes on remand that plaintiff has proved his entitlement to benefits for Mrs. Douglas\u2019s services, the circuit court, as fact-finder, must establish a new hourly rate based on an individual caregiver\u2019s hourly rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Today we reaffirm that MCL 500.3107(1)(a) imposes four requirements that an insured must prove before recovering PIP benefits for allowable expenses: (1) the expense must be for an injured person\u2019s care, recovery, or rehabilitation, (2) the expense must be reasonably necessary, (3) the expense must be incurred, and (4) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>charge must be reasonable.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Allowable expenses are distinguished from replacement services in that allowable expenses are <em>for </em>the insured\u2019s care as it \u201crelate[s] to the insured\u2019s injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Defendant is not entitled to relief on its claim that Mrs. Douglas provided only replacement services, not allowable expenses, because the circuit court did not clearly err by ruling that Mrs. Douglas is plaintiffs caretaker. Defendant is also not entitled to relief on its claim that plaintiffs attendant care was not reasonably necessary in the absence of a specific prescription for attendant care services because the testimony of Dr. Rosenbaum and defendant\u2019s claims adjuster provided a factual basis for the reasonable necessity of those services at all times relevant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision to remand this case for further proceedings, but we hold that the consideration on remand must encompass the entire period for which charges are claimed. We also emphasize the necessity that the circuit court, as the fact-finder, must base its ruling on proofs that show the extent to which Mrs. Douglas <em>actually provided </em>compensable attendant care services. Therefore, on remand, the circuit court must apply the standard of proof outlined in this opinion to determine whether plaintiff has proved that \u201ccharges\u201d were \u201cincurred\u201d for his care.

Specifically, the majority determines that, in order to show that charges were incurred, an insured must establish (1) that the caregiver expected compensation for the services rendered, see <em>ante </em>at 267, and (2) that the caregiver\u2019s expectation of payment arose \u201cat the time [the caregiver] provided the services,\u201d see <em>ante </em>at 271.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither of the majority\u2019s newly created requirements are supported by the statutory language at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">A. CAREGIVER\u2019S EXPECTATION OF COMPENSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that MCL 500.3107(l)(a) requires a showing that the caregiver expected compensation. Rather, I continue to believe that the caregiver\u2019s expectation of payment is irrelevant because the obligation to pay \u201ccharges incurred\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>under MCL 500.3107(1)(a) lies with the <em>insurer </em>rather than the insured. <em>Burris v Allstate Ins Co, </em>480 Mich 1081, 1088-1089 (2008) (WEAVER, J., dissenting). I also disagree with the majority\u2019s reliance on the definition of \u201cincur\u201d that was adopted in <em>Proudfoot v State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>469 Mich 476; 673 NW2d 739 (2003), because, as Justice WEAVER explained in her <em>Burris </em>dissent, <em>Proudfoot</em>'s definition of \u201cincur\u201d was limited to the facts of that case, in which the plaintiff sought advance payment for <em>future </em>expenses. <em>Burris, </em>480 Mich at 1088 (WEAVER, J., dissenting). Accordingly, in <em>Proudfoot, </em>no one had incurred an expense because no service had been provided, and an insurer \u201cis not obligated to pay any amount except upon submission of evidence that services were actually rendered. . . .\u201d <em>Manley v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, </em>425 Mich 140, 159; 388 NW2d 216 (1986). In this case, however, plaintiff seeks benefits for <em>past </em>expenses resulting from services that <em>have already been provided. </em>Accordingly, as long as the services were actually rendered and reasonably necessary and the amount of the charges was reasonable, defendant, as the insurer, has incurred the charges because of its statutory obligation to provide PIP benefits under MCL 500.3107(1). Unlike the majority\u2019s interpretation, Justice Weaver\u2019s approach in <em>Burris </em>is consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent that the no-fault act be construed liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Turner v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>448 Mich 22, 28; 528 NW2d 681 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">In addition, I disagree with the majority\u2019s effort to further hamstring insureds\u2019 ability to recover PIP benefits to which they are entitled by imposing burdensome and statutorily unsupported preferences for specific documentary evidence. See <em>ante </em>at 269-270 (stating that the \u201cbest way of proving\u201d that a caregiver expected payment is a \u201cformal bill\u201d or \u201cmemorialized state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ment\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To begin with, the majority\u2019s determination that certain forms of evidence are always more persuasive than others is faulty because it is premised on the majority\u2019s conclusion that the caregiver must expect compensation. However, even accepting arguendo that compensation must be expected in order for a charge to be incurred for purposes of MCL 500.3107(1)(a), nothing in the statutory language supports the majority\u2019s gradation of the persuasiveness of various forms of evidence or the majority\u2019s resulting preference for a formal bill or memorialized statement. Particularly telling is the majority\u2019s failure to cite any authority in support of this preference for certain types of evidence. Indeed, the majority flatly admits that \u201cno statutory provision <em>requires\u201d </em>what the majority considers to be the \u201cbest\u201d evidence. <em>Ante </em>at 270. Accordingly, although I agree that \u201citemized statements, bills, contracts, or logs listing the nature of services provided,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 269, would be more than enough to establish entitlement to PIP benefits, simple testimony or any other form of admissible evidence should also be sufficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, generally, MRE 402 (providing that \u201c [a]ll relevant evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>dence is admissible . . .\u201d) and MRE 401 (defining \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Although the majority may be correct that certain types of evidence may be more persuasive under the specific circumstances of a particular case, by discussing the persuasiveness of various forms of evidence in absolutes, the majority invades the province of the fact-finder. See <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508, 514; 489 NW2d 748 (1992) (\u201c[A]ppellate courts are not juries, and . . . they must not interfere with the jury\u2019s role[.]\u201d). Indeed, this error in the majority\u2019s approach is exposed in its discussion of the specific facts of this case, particularly the majority\u2019s statement that failure to provide certain documents \u201cimplicates [the caregiver\u2019s] credibility .. . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 271. However, contrary to the majority\u2019s willingness to weigh in on witness credibility, this Court has frequently stated that appellate courts</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">must remember that the jury is the sole judge of the facts. It is the function of the jury alone to listen to testimony, weigh the evidence and decide the questions of fact.... Juries, not appellate courts, see and hear witnesses and are in a much better position to decide the weight and credibility to be given to their testimony. <em>[Wolfe, </em>440 Mich at 514-515 (quotation marks and citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In summary, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that an insured must prove that a family caregiver expected compensation in order to prove that charges were incurred for purposes of MCL 500.3107(1)(a). In my view, the insurer incurs the charge by way of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>statutory obligation to provide PIP benefits under MCL 500.3107(1)(a) when the insured proves that the services were reasonably necessary and actually rendered and that the amount of the charge is reasonable. Furthermore, accepting arguendo the majority\u2019s declaration that an insured must prove that his or her caregiver expected compensation, I disagree with the majority\u2019s implication that certain forms of evidence will always be the \u201cbest way\u201d to establish entitlement to PIP benefits. Not only does the majority admit that there is no statutory support for its conclusion, see <em>ante </em>at 269-270, the idea that an appellate court can determine the best evidence in a case has been consistently rejected as an improper invasion of the fact-finder\u2019s role as \u201cthe <em>sole </em>judge of the facts.\u201d <em>Wolfe, </em>440 Mich at 514 (quotation marks and citation omitted; emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">B. TIMING OF EXPECTATION AND REQUEST FOR PAYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The majority creates another unsupported and previously nonexistent requirement when it states that a caregiver must expect compensation \u201cat the time the services were rendered.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 269-270; see, also, <em>ante </em>at 271 (stating that the \u201ccircuit court failed to make a finding regarding.. . whether Mrs. Douglas expected compensation or reimbursement <em>at the time she provided the services\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Again, the majority fails to identify any support for this new timing requirement in either the caselaw or the statutory language of MCL 500.3107(1)(a). The reason for the majority\u2019s failure to do so is obvious: there simply is no support for the majority\u2019s judicially created requirement. This is particularly notable given that members of the majority have often railed against extratextual requirements. See, e.g., <em>People v Schaefer, </em>473 Mich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>418, 432; 703 NW2d 774 (2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, in <em>People v Wager, </em>460 Mich 118, 123-124; 594 NW2d 487 (1999), the majority opinion expressly overruled a previous Court of Appeals opinion that had inserted a \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement into the statute at issue in that case, stating \u201c[N]o sound reason exists to engraft the \u2018reasonable time\u2019 element onto the clear language of the statute.\u201d Accordingly, I am at a loss about why the majority believes it is appropriate to engraft a time requirement onto MCL 500.3107(1)(a) despite the lack of any such requirement in the actual language of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">Although the lack of support in the statutory language is reason enough to reject the majority\u2019s analysis, the practical implications of the majority\u2019s burdensome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>new requirement is also worth consideration. Specifically, by requiring that a family caregiver expect compensation, not only does the majority punish a family member who nobly acts to provide care to a loved one in a time of need, the majority also rewards <em>the insurer, </em>rather than the caregiver, for this act of kindness by allowing the insurer to avoid providing PIP benefits that it would otherwise be required to provide. This result is not only ethically troubling, but it also turns on its head the Legislature\u2019s intent that the no-fault act be construed liberally in favor of the <em>insured. Turner, </em>448 Mich at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Additionally, by requiring that the caregiver expect compensation at the time the services are provided, the majority fails to recognize the reality of situations in which attendant-care services are needed. Specifically, claims for PIP benefits arise out of automobile-related accidents, which were typically sudden, unexpected events. Accordingly, family members may unexpectedly be called upon to immediately provide care to a loved one. Given the nature of most families, I believe that in the vast majority of situations, the family member would be willing to provide the care, at least initially, without any contemporaneous expectation of compensation from anyone. Thus, I believe that it may be fairly common that the caregiver is initially not even aware of the possibility of compensation and the process that must be completed in order to recover that compensation. Indeed, not every citizen is an attorney well versed in the intricacies of the no-fault act. As a result, <em>at the time the services were provided, </em>the caregiver would have no expectation that <em>anyone </em>will provide compensation. Yet under the majority\u2019s analysis, if a family member did not expect compensation <em>at the time the services were provided, </em>despite the sudden and chaotic circumstances of the situation, he or she is not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to retroactively expect compensation for services provided in the past after discovering that compensation is a realistic possibility. This approach rewards the insurer by allowing it to avoid providing PIP benefits that it would otherwise be obligated to provide under MCL 500.3107(1)(a) merely because the caregiver does not immediately demand compensation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">II. DETERMINING WHAT IS A \u201cREASONABLE CHARGE\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Under MCL 500.3107(1)(a), PIP benefits are payable for \u201callowable expenses\u201d as long as the charge is \u201creasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court, acting as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>fact-finder in a bench trial, heard testimony from two sources regarding the rate typically charged by an agency to provide the care that Katherine Douglas provided. Additionally, the trial court heard testimony that while Dr. Thomas Rosenbaum\u2019s company employed Mrs. Douglas, she was paid at a rate of $10 an hour. Furthermore, the trial court heard testimony that Mrs. Douglas was unable to provide the hours of attendant care that plaintiffs doctor prescribed because she worked outside the home. After considering that testimony, the trial court awarded plaintiff PIP benefits at the rate of $40 an hour. In my view, agency rates are relevant to determining the proper rate of compensation for PIP benefits, and the trial court in this case properly considered the agency rates along with the other evidence submitted by the parties. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority that the trial court clearly erred in this case, and I would affirm the Court of Appeals on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Although the majority concludes that agency rates are both relevant and admissible in determining a \u201creasonable charge\u201d under MCL 500.3107(1)(a), see <em>ante </em>at 276 n 79 (stating that \u201cthis case is not about the <em>admissibility </em>of the agency rates\u201d because agency rates \u201cmay in fact be helpful to the fact-finder as a point of comparison in determining a reasonable charge for an individual\u2019s provision of attendant care services\u201d); and <em>ante </em>at 276 (stating that \u201can agency rate might bear some relation to an individual\u2019s rate\u201d), the majority nevertheless relies exclusively on the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion in <em>Bonkowski v Allstate Ins Co, </em>281 Mich App 154, 165; 761 NW2d 784 (2008), which expressly stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that agency rates are \u201cnot relevant.\u201d I disagree with the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Bonkowski </em>for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">To begin with, <em>Bonkowski </em>readily admitted that its entire discussion of the rate of compensation was dictum, stating that issue was not \u201csquarely before\u201d the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 164. Moreover, without justification, <em>Bonkowski </em>admittedly ignored caselaw that found agency rates relevant to determining the proper rate of compensation for a family member\u2019s provision of care. <em>Id. </em>(acknowledging that the Court of Appeals had \u201cpreviously embraced the notion that \u2018comparison to rates charged by institutions provides a valid method for determining whether the amount of an expense was reasonable and for placing a value on comparable services performed [by family members]\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Manley v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch, </em>127 Mich App 444, 455; 339 NW2d 205 (1983) (alteration in original). Further, <em>Bonkowski </em>cited no authority in support of its preferred approach to determining the proper rate of compensation for attendant care provided by unlicensed family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Most importantly, however, <em>Bonkowski </em>is poorly reasoned and, as a result, unpersuasive. Particularly unpersuasive is the notion that only the hourly rate paid to an attendant-care-services provider by an agency is relevant. Indeed, even the majority rejects this perspective. See <em>ante </em>at 276 n 79 (acknowledging that agency rates \u201cmay in fact be helpful to the fact-finder\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, the majority is unwise to rely on Bonkowski\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>analysis of this issue. Rather, I would adopt the reasoning from Judge GLEICHER\u2019s majority opinion in <em>Hardrick v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>294 Mich App 651; 819 NW2d 28 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><em>Hardrick, </em>294 Mich App at 678-679, first noted that the question whether expenses are reasonable is generally a question for the fact-finder, as this Court stated in <em>Nasser, </em>435 Mich at 55. Second, <em>Hardrick </em>agreed with <em>Bonkowski </em>that \u201cthe rates charged by an agency to provide attendant-care services are not dispositive of the reasonable rate chargeable by a relative caregiver,\u201d but the opinion also concluded that \u201cthis does not detract from the relevance of such evidence.\u201d <em>Hardrick, </em>294 Mich App at 666. Accordingly, I find persuasive Hardrick\u2019s decision to review the issue through the lens of the admissibility of evidence. <em>Hardrick </em>explained that evidence is \u201crelevant\u201d and thus \u201cmaterial\u201d when it helps prove a proposition that is a \u201cmaterial fact at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667-668. Because the \u201cmaterial fact at issue\u201d is the reasonable rate for attendant-care services for an insured, and insurers routinely pay agency rates for attendant-care services, <em>Hardrick </em>concluded that agency rates are relevant to determining the proper compensation for relative caregivers. <em>Hardrick </em>emphasized that the issue \u201cis not whether an agency rate is reasonable per se under the circumstances, but whether evidence of an agency rate may assist a jury in determining a reasonable charge for family-provided attendant-care services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669. Accordingly, because an agency rate commonly paid by insurers \u201c \u2018throws some light, however faint,\u2019 on the reasonableness of a charge for attendant-care services,\u201d it is admissible. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Beaubien v Cicotte, </em>12 Mich 459, 484 (1864).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Moreover, <em>Hardrick </em>explained that the fact-finder \u201cmay ultimately decide that an agency rate carries less weight than the rate charged by an independent contractor, or no weight at all. But the fact that different charges for the same service exist in the marketplace hardly renders one charge irrelevant as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Hardrick, </em>294 Mich App at 669. Indeed, the insurer would be free to introduce evidence showing the actual pay received by professional attendant-care-services providers and the overhead costs incurred by agencies that provide the care along with any other relevant evidence. In fact, in this case, defendant was permitted to counter plaintiffs evidence of the agency rate paid by Dr. Rosenbaum\u2019s company by showing that Mrs. Douglas was paid $10 an hour and with testimony from both defendant\u2019s medical expert and its claims adjuster. This is the critical error in the majority\u2019s reasoning: it fails to recognize that evidence of agency rates is only one of the various types of evidence that the fact-finder may consider in determining what constitutes a \u201creasonable charge,\u201d and the decision of which evidence is most relevant should be left to the fact-finder. Accordingly, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to opine regarding the weight that the fact-finder should give agency rates relative to other types of evidence when determining what constitutes a \u201creasonable charge.\u201d By doing so, the majority again forgets that \u201cappellate courts are not juries, and ... they must not interfere with the jury\u2019s role[.]\u201d See <em>Wolfe, </em>440 Mich at 514 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">Indeed, by adopting Bonkowski's emphasis on an individual caregiver\u2019s hourly rate, the majority\u2019s approach ignores other relevant considerations. For example, the family member might be forced to abandon a more lucrative career or move a great distance in order to be able to provide long hours of care to a loved one over an extended period. Additionally, the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>approach marginalizes the fact that a family member who provides attendant-care services may be left without an array of benefits that a professional attendant-care-services provider would ordinarily receive. For example, a professional attendant-care-services provider who is employed by an agency might receive health insurance benefits, vacation and sick leave, and retirement benefits, among other things. None of these benefits are represented in the professional attendant-care-services provider\u2019s hourly wage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, by singularly focusing on the rate paid to an attendant-care-services professional in order to determine what is a \u201creasonable charge\u201d for family-provided care under MCL 500.3107(1)(a), the majority fails to recognize the complexity of the inquiry at hand and reduces the determination to a purely economic decision when that is simply not the reality of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Furthermore, by implying that certain evidence is deserving of greater consideration when determining a \u201creasonable charge,\u201d the majority risks making the possibility of family-provided attendant care unattainable for a large number of no-fault insureds because their family members simply cannot afford to suffer the financial ramifications of that decision. This result not only potentially places families in the unenviable position of being forced to institutionalize a family member in order to make a fair living, but it also runs counter to one of the goals of the no-fault act: to keep no-fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>insurance affordable. See <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 627-628; 267 NW2d 72 (1978). Specifically, if a family member cannot afford to provide attendant care at the lower rate that the majority opinion essentially mandates, the insured may be forced into an institution, which will potentially increase the cost of attendant care and, therefore, the amount of PIP benefits that insurers must pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">Finally, although the majority is correct that this Court has not previously considered this exact issue, the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach in <em>Hardrick </em>is more consistent with this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Manley, </em>425 Mich at 154, which considered the \u201creasonable charge\u201d aspect of MCL 500.3107(1)(a) and held that evidence of a daily charge <em>by facilities </em>for \u201croom and board\u201d is admissible to determine a parent\u2019s costs for room and board of a disabled child <em>in the parent-caregiver\u2019s home. </em>See, also, <em>Manley, </em>425 Mich at 169 (BOYLE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (stating that \u201ccomparison to rates charged by institutions provides a valid method for determining whether the amount of an expense was reasonable and for placing a value on comparable services performed by [a family member]\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, given this Court\u2019s guidance on the issue in <em>Manley, </em>and because I believe that Hardrick\u2019s analysis is more thorough and well reasoned than Bonkowski\u2019s, I would adopt Hardrick\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Applying Hardrick\u2019s approach to this case, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that $40 an hour is a \u201creasonable charge.\u201d The majority claims that the trial court\u2019s finding is \u201cunjustified on this record\u201d; however, the majority fails to consider a variety of factors that were before the fact-finder in this case. Specifically, the trial court heard testimony from which it could conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Mrs. Douglas would need to quit her job outside the home in order to provide plaintiff with the attendant care his doctor prescribed. Moreover, the trial court heard testimony regarding both the agency rate and individual rate of pay for the type of care that Mrs. Douglas was providing. Notably, defendant could have submitted additional evidence in support of its claim for a lower hourly rate, but it chose not to do so. Thus, while the majority is correct that it is \u201cundisputed\u201d that \u201cMrs. Douglas actually received $10 an hour in providing attendant care services to plaintiff,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 277, it is also undisputed that agencies receive a higher rate of compensation for the same services, and it is also undisputed that Mrs. Douglas could not provide the attendant care that plaintiff needed while maintaining her employment outside the home. Thus, the rate paid to an individual caregiver fails to encompass all the ramifications of Mrs. Douglas\u2019s provision of attendant care to plaintiff. Accordingly, because \u201c[t]he trier of facts is permitted to draw natural inferences from all the evidence and testimony,\u201d <em>Kostamo v Marquette Iron Mining Co, </em>405 Mich 105, 120-121; 274 NW2d 411 (1979), I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court in this case \u201cuncritically adopted\u201d the agency rates or that agency rates were \u201cthe sole basis for the award of benefits in these circumstances.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 276-277. As a result, I am not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made,\u201d <em>Detroit v Ambassador Bridge Co, </em>481 Mich 29, 35; 748 NW2d 221 (2008) (quotation marks and citation omitted), and, thus, in my view, the trial court did not clearly err on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In summary, I dissent from the majority\u2019s effort to extend the erroneous interpretation of MCL 500.3107 from <em>Griffith. </em>Specifically, I disagree with the majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>judicially created requirements regarding what is necessary to show that a charge was incurred because those requirements are unsupported by the statutory language at issue and, thus, contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent with regard to MCL 500.3107(1)(a). Moreover, the majority\u2019s decision to rely, at least in part, on the reasoning from <em>Bonkowski, </em>281 Mich App 154, is ill conceived because <em>Bonkowski </em>is poorly reasoned, particularly in comparison to the persuasive analysis in <em>Hardrick, </em>294 Mich App 651.

Accordingly, despite the majority\u2019s unsupported conclusion that documentary evidence is \u201cbest,\u201d <em>any form of admissible evidence </em>could be equally sufficient to meet an insured\u2019s burden to prove that services were actually rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> The majority apparently interprets my dissent as asserting that when a family member provides care, the insured need not provide any evidence that attendant care was actually provided. See <em>ante </em>at 269 n 60. This is not an accurate characterization of my dissent, however, because I agree that an insurer \u201cis not obligated to pay any amount except upon submission of evidence that services were actually rendered . ...\u201d <em>Manley, </em>425 Mich at 159. Rather, as I previously stated, I disagree with the majority\u2019s unsupported preference for <em>specific documentary evidence </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>because, in my view, <em>any form of admissible evidence </em>could be equally sufficient to meet an insured\u2019s burden to prove that services were actually rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b349-5\"> See, also, <em>Johnson v Recca, </em>492 Mich 169, 196-197; 821 NW2d 520 (2012), stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">it must be assumed that the language and organization of the statute better embody the \u201cobvious intent\u201d of the Legislature than does some broad characterization surmised or divined by judges....

See, also, <em>ante </em>at 270 (discussing the \u201crisk\u201d of \u201cfail[ing] to request reimbursement for allowable expenses <em>in a timely fashion </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added). However, the majority admits that \u201cMCL 500.3107(1)(a) does not require a claim for allowable expenses to occur within any particular time.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 270 n 64. Thus, it is unclear to me why the majority chooses to create potential confusion by injecting the statutorily unsupported phrases \u201cwithin a reasonable amount of time\u201d and \u201cin a timely fashion\u201d into its application of MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> The majority dismisses as unfounded my concerns regarding the practicalities of the majority\u2019s new requirements, stating that \u201c[cjontrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, a family member\u2019s determination to provide care even in the absence of an insurer\u2019s payment is not inconsistent with expecting compensation from the insurer, but the expectation must nevertheless be present for a charge to be incurred within the meaning of MCL 500.3107(1)(a).\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 268 n 56. However, this statement only addresses the <em>source </em>of the compensation, not the <em>timing </em>of when the caregiver developed the expectation of payment, regardless of the source. Under the circumstances that I discuss, the family caregiver does not expect compensation \u201cat the time the services were rendered,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 269-270, which is an express requirement of the majority\u2019s erroneous interpretation of MCL 500.3107(1)(a). The majority claims that its requirement that compensation be expected at the time the services were provided \u201csimply applies the dictionary definitions of the statutory phrase \u2018charges incurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 268 n 56. However, even accepting the dictionary definitions that the majority selects, there is clearly no time component to those definitions. See <em>ante </em>at 267 (defining \u201cincur\u201d as \u201c[t]o become liable or subject to, [especially] because of one\u2019s own actions,\u201d and' \u201ccharge\u201d as a \u201c[pecuniary burden, cost\u201d or \u201c[a] price required or demanded for service rendered or goods supplied\u201d) (quotation marks and citations omitted). Indeed, applying these definitions, it is clear that a person could \u201cbecome liable\u201d for \u201ca price demanded for services\u201d <em>after </em>the services are rendered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> The majority incorrectly states that \u201cthe fact-finder must determine what is a reasonable charge for an <em>individual\u2019s </em>provision of services ....\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 276. Rather, the plain language of MCL 500.3107(1)(a) simply requires that the charge be \u201creasonable.\u201d Accordingly, although what an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>individual on the open market may be able to obtain as compensation is relevant, it is but one factor in a multifactor analysis to determine what is a \u201creasonable charge\u201d under the circumstances of a particular case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> The majority, however, also risks creating confusion when it states that the amount Mrs. Douglas was paid while employed by Dr. Rosenbaum \u201cis highly probative of what constitutes a reasonable charge for her services\u201d because \u201cthis figure is the rate she <em>actually </em>received for providing attendant care services .. ..\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 277. This statement could be misinterpreted and lead lower courts to conclude that a professional caregiver\u2019s hourly rate is the <em>only </em>relevant evidence. Thus, to clarify, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>agree with the majority that agency rates may be considered by the fact-finder in determining what constitutes a \u201creasonable charge\u201d under MCL 500.3107(1)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b356-5\"> I recognize that the majority briefly considers the issue of fringe benefits, see <em>ante </em>at 272 n 69, but the majority relegates the issue to a mere secondary consideration by repeatedly emphasizing that \u201cMrs. Douglas actually received $10 an hour in providing attendant care services to plaintiff,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 277. See, also, <em>ante </em>at 277 (stating that the $10 an hour rate is \u201chighly probative\u201d of what is a reasonable charge under MCL 500.3107(l)(a) because it was \u201cthe rate [Mrs. Douglas] <em>actually </em>received for providing attendant care services\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
