In <em>Spectrum Health Hospitals v Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co of Michigan </em>(Docket No. 142874), we examine the \u201cchain of permissive use\u201d theory, which the Court of Appeals initially adopted in <em>Bronson Methodist Hospital v </em>Forshee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This theory arises when a vehicle owner authorizes the vehicle\u2019s use by another person (the intermediate user), who in turn authorizes a third person (the end user) to use the vehicle. Applying <em>Bronson </em>in <em>Spectrum Health, </em>the Court of Appeals held that, for the purposes of MCL 500.3113(a), a vehicle owner is presumed to have allowed the end user to take the vehicle, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>whether the owner had expressly forbidden the end user from taking the car.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that <em>Bronson </em>erred by applying a theory developed in owner-liability caselaw to the context of MCL 500.3113(a) because this caselaw did not address whether the end user of a vehicle violated the Michigan Penal Code, including MCL 750.413 or MCL 750.414, by unlawfully <em>taking </em>a vehicle. Therefore, we overrule <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>application of the \u201cchain of permissive use\u201d theory as inconsistent with MCL 500.3113(a). To determine whether the end user in <em>Spectrum Health </em>unlawfully took the vehicle, we consider the undisputed facts of this case: the vehicle\u2019s owner expressly told the end user that he was not allowed to drive the vehicle. Therefore, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary disposition to Spectrum Health because MCL 500.3113(a) precludes the claimant from receiving PIP benefits in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">In <em>Progressive Marathon Insurance Co v DeYoung </em>(Docket No. 143330), we examine the \u201cfamily joyriding exception\u201d to MCL 500.3113(a). This theory, first articulated in Justice Levin\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Priesman v Meridian Mutual Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>involves the unauthorized taking of a person\u2019s motor vehicle by a family member who did not intend to steal it. Justice LEVIN opined that the Legislature did not intend that a relative\u2019s \u201cjoyride\u201d be considered an unlawful taking under MCL 500.3113(a) because, given that most legislators ar\u00e9 parents and grandparents, they may have experienced children who used a family vehicle without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>permission and may have done so themselves.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, he concluded that the Legislature did not truly intend to exclude teenagers who joyride in their relatives\u2019 automobiles. Because the family-joyriding exception has no basis in the language of MCL 500.3113(a), we disavow Justice Levin\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Priesman </em>and overrule the Court of Appeals decisions applying it: <em>Butterworth Hospital v Farm Bureau Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> Mester v State Farm Mutual Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> Allen v State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Roberts v Titan Insurance Co (On Reconsideration).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cross-defendants, Progressive Marathon Insurance Company and Citizens Insurance Company of America, are entitled to summary disposition because MCL 500.3113(a) excludes the injured claimant from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Therefore, in both <em>Spectrum Health </em>(Docket No. 142874) and <em>Progressive </em>(Docket No. 143330), we reverse the judgments of the Court of Appeals and remand these cases to their respective circuit courts for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">i. basic facts and proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"A_N\">a. <em>spectrum health</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">PIP claimant Craig Smith, Jr. (Craig Jr.), was injured in a single-car accident that occurred while he was driving a vehicle owned by his father, Craig Smith, Sr. (Craig Sr.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>and insured by Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company of Michigan and Farm Bureau General Insurance Company of Michigan (collectively \u201cFarm Bureau\u201d). Craig Sr. had forbidden Craig Jr. to operate the vehicle because he had no valid driver\u2019s license. Craig Jr. acknowledged that he knew he was forbidden to operate the vehicle. Craig Sr. entrusted the vehicle to Craig Jr.\u2019s girlfriend, Kathleen Chirco, to enable Craig Jr. and Kathleen to perform landscaping services. Nevertheless, Craig Sr. instructed Kathleen, in Craig Jr.\u2019s presence, that she was not to allow Craig Jr. to drive it. That night, Craig Jr. began drinking and asked Kathleen for the keys to Craig Sr.\u2019s vehicle. Although she initially resisted, Kathleen eventually gave him the keys, and he later crashed the vehicle into a tree. Craig Jr. pleaded no contest to operating while intoxicated causing serious injury, MCL 257.625, and was sentenced to a minimum of 2V2 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Spectrum Health Hospitals, which rendered care to Craig Jr., brought suit against Farm Bureau to recover payment for those services and subsequently moved for summary disposition. Farm Bureau opposed Spectrum Health\u2019s motion and took the position that Craig Jr. was not entitled to PIP benefits because the vehicle he was using had been taken unlawfully. The circuit court granted summary disposition in favor of Spectrum Health, ruling that Kathleen had been empowered to permit Craig Jr. to operate the vehicle. The Court of Appeals affirmed, applying the chain-of-permissive-use theory from <em>Bronson </em>to conclude that Craig Jr. had not taken the vehicle unlawfully.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">This Court granted Farm Bureau\u2019s application for leave to appeal, requesting the parties to address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">whether an immediate family member who knows that he or she has been forbidden to drive a vehicle may neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>less be a permissive user of the vehicle eligible for [PIP] benefits under MCL 500.3113(a) when, contrary to the owner\u2019s prohibition, an intermediate permissive user grants the [PIP] claimant permission to operate the accident vehicle.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">B. <em>PROGRESSIVE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">By age 26, Ryan DeYoung had accumulated three drunk-driving convictions, which resulted in the repeated loss of his valid driver\u2019s license beginning at age 17. Ryan\u2019s wife, Nicole DeYoung, owned and insured the family\u2019s four vehicles with Progressive Marathon Insurance Company. Ryan was a named excluded driver on the Progressive policy. As a result, Nicole expressly prohibited Ryan from driving the vehicles, including the 2001 Oldsmobile Bravada that she used as her principal vehicle. On the night of September 17, 2008, Ryan came home intoxicated and without his house key. He banged on the window of their home. Nicole rose from her bed, admitted him, and, perceiving his intoxicated state, went back to bed. Ryan took the key to the Bravada out of Nicole\u2019s purse and then took the vehicle, contrary to Nicole\u2019s standing instructions and without her permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Within 20 minutes of taking Nicole\u2019s vehicle, Ryan was badly injured in a single-car accident. He incurred bills of more than $53,000 at Spectrum Health Hospitals and another $232,000 at Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital. Progressive denied PIP benefits, arguing that Ryan had been injured while using a vehicle that he had unlawfully taken. It commenced a declaratory action against Ryan and Nicole on this basis. Spectrum Health and Mary Free Bed intervened as cross-plaintiffs to recover payment from Progressive for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the outstanding bills. Spectrum Health and Mary Free Bed also filed a claim with the Michigan Assigned Claims Facility, which designated Citizens Insurance Company of America to respond to Ryan\u2019s claim. Citizens also denied coverage, and Progressive named Citizens as a cross-defendant in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Progressive moved for summary disposition, contending that at the time of the accident Ryan was using a motor vehicle that he had taken unlawfully and without a reasonable belief that he was entitled to do so, which precluded him from receiving PIP benefits under MCL 500.3113(a). The circuit court granted summary disposition to both Progressive and Citizens, ruling that although the Court of Appeals decisions recognizing and applying the family-joyriding exception were binding precedent, none had extended the exception to a case in which the family member was a named excluded driver on the underlying no-fault policy. The circuit court concluded that \u201c[t]o further extend the \u2018joyriding\u2019 exception so as to overturn excluded driver provisions is to increase the risk in all such policies, and may result in good drivers with uninsurable family members (due to excessive risk associated with poor driving records) becoming uninsurable themselves.\u201d The circuit court concluded that it would \u201cnot engage in such rewriting of private contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that it had no alternative but to follow the binding precedent of prior Court of Appeals decisions recognizing and applying the family-joyriding exception to the disqualification from coverage of MCL 500.3113(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>We granted Progressive\u2019s application for leave to appeal, requesting that the parties address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">(1) whether an immediate family member who knows that he or she has been forbidden to drive a vehicle, and has been named in the no-fault insurance policy applicable to the vehicle as an excluded driver, but who nevertheless operates the vehicle and sustains personal injury in an accident while doing so, comes within the so-called \u201cfamily joyriding exception\u201d to MCL 500.3113(a); and (2) if so, whether the \u201cfamily joyriding exception\u201d should be limited or overruled.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">These cases involve the interpretation of MCL 500.3113(a). Issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In examining MCL 500.3113(a), we must apply our longstanding principles of statutory interpretation;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the statutory language. The first step in that determination is to review the language of the statute itself. Unless statutorily defined, every word or phrase of a statute should be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning, taking into account the context in which the words are used. We may consult dictionary definitions to give words their common and ordinary meaning. When given their common and ordinary meaning, \u201c[t]he words of a statute provide \u2018the most rehable evidence of its intent....\u2019 \u201d[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">A circuit court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary disposition is also reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">MCL 500.3113 excludes certain people from entitlement to PIP benefits. It states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">A person is not entitled to be paid [PIP] benefits for accidental bodily injury if at the time of the accident any of the following circumstances existed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">(a) The person was using a motor vehicle or motorcycle which he or she had taken unlawfully, unless the person reasonably believed that he or she was entitled to take and use the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Each of these cases involves a Court of Appeals decision not to apply the PIP benefits exclusion in MCL 500.3113(a) to the underlying claimant. In <em>Spectrum Health, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the chain-of-permissive-use theory articulated in Bronson<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> to conclude that Craig Jr. was a permissive user of the vehicle notwithstanding the fact that his father had expressly forbidden him to drive the vehicle. In <em>Progressive, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the family-joyriding exception articulated in Justice Levin\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Priesman</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to conclude that MCL 500.3113(a) did not exclude the claimant after he took his wife\u2019s vehicle contrary to her standing prohibition. Both of these theories purport to limit application of the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d in MCL 500.3113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">In determining the Legislature\u2019s intended meaning of the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully,\u201d we must accord the phrase its plain and ordinary meaning, and we may consult dictionary definitions because the no-fault act does not define the phrase.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The word \u201cunlawful\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>commonly means \u201cnot lawful; contrary to law; illegal,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and the word \u201ctake\u201d is commonly understood as \u201cto get into one\u2019s hands or possession by voluntary action.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> When the words are considered together, the plain meaning of the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d readily embraces a situation in which an individual gains possession of a vehicle contrary to Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">The Michigan Penal Code contains several statutes that prohibit \u201ctakings,\u201d including two that prohibit \u201cjoyriding,\u201d MCL 750.413 and MCL 750.414. MCL 750.413 states that \u201c[a]ny person who shall, wilfully and without authority, take possession of and drive or take away . . . any motor vehicle, belonging to another, shall be guilty of a felony . . . .\u201d Similarly, MCL 750.414 provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny person who takes or uses without authority any motor vehicle without intent to steal the same, or who is a party to such unauthorized taking or using, is guilty of a misdemeanor . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, both joyriding statutes make it unlawful to take any motor vehicle without authority, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>effectively defining an unlawful taking of a vehicle as that which is unauthorized.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Because a taking does not have to be larcenous to be unlawful, the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d in MCL 500.3113(a) applies to <em>anyone </em>who takes a vehicle without the authority of the owner, regardless of whether that person intended to steal it.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> With this statutory interpretation in mind, we consider seriatim the theories that the two Court of Appeals panels applied in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">A. <em>SPECTRUM HEALTH </em>AND THE \u201cCHAIN OF PERMISSIVE USE\u201d THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In <em>Spectrum Health, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the \u201cchain of permissive use\u201d theory from <em>Bronson </em>to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>the injured claimant to recover PIP benefits. In <em>Bronson, </em>the injured claimant, Mark Forshee, was drinking beer and taking controlled substances with three friends, Thomas Pefley, William Morrow, and Brian Antles.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The group was traveling in a car driven by Pefley and owned by his father, who had expressly indicated that only his son could drive the vehicle and who had expressly forbidden Forshee from doing so.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The police stopped the car and arrested Pefley for violating his probation by carrying a concealed weapon. Pefley yelled from the police car for Morrow to \u201ctake the car home.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> When the police left with Pefley, Morrow began driving the car. After taking Antles home, Morrow and Forshee purchased a case of beer and continued to use the car.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Morrow later allowed Forshee to drive.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Later that night, another police officer saw the car speeding and signaled the driver to stop.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Forshee instead accelerated and a high-speed chase ensued, ending when the car struck an embankment, ricocheted off a metal post, and landed some 50 feet away.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Following a bench trial, the circuit court held in part that Forshee was not eligible for no-fault benefits because he had unlawfully taken the motor vehicle within the meaning of MCL 500.3113(a).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The <em>Bronson </em>Court reversed and concluded that Forshee was entitled to recover PIP benefits. After observing the lack of caselaw interpreting the \u201cunlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ful taking\u201d language in MCL 500.3113(a), the <em>Bronson </em>Court turned for \u201cguidance [to] the decisions that have construed whether a vehicle was taken with consent for purposes of the owner\u2019s liability statute, MCL 257.401.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Specifically, the Court considered this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cowan v </em>Strecker<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and determined that we have \u201cinterpreted \u2018consent\u2019 broadly\u201d in the context of an owner\u2019s vicarious liability.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>Bronson </em>then held that an owner \u201c \u2018 \u201cconsents\u201d to assumption of the risks attendant upon his surrender of control regardless of admonitions which would purport to delimit his consent.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">While <em>Bronson </em>recognized that MCL 500.3113(a) \u201cis not concerned with placing the liability of [sic] the proper party, but, rather, with precluding the receipt of [PIP] benefits by someone who has unlawfully taken an automobile,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> it nevertheless adopted <em>Cowan\u2019s </em>\u201cbroad definition of \u2018consent\u2019 \u201d as \u201cof equal applicability\u201d in the no-fault context.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In applying this broad definition of consent, the <em>Bronson </em>Court observed that \u201cwhen an owner loans his vehicle to another, it is foreseeable that the borrower may thereafter lend the vehicle to a third party\u201d and concluded that \u201csuch further borrowing of the vehicle by the third party is, by implication, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the consent of the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> This \u201cunbroken chain of permissive use\u201d renders inapplicable the \u201cunlawful taking\u201d exclusion of MCL 500.3113(a).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-3\">We hold that the <em>Bronson </em>Court\u2019s \u201cchain of permissive use\u201d theory is inconsistent with the statutory language of the no-fault act. In articulating its theory, <em>Bronson </em>first looked to <em>another </em>statutory scheme, the owner\u2019s liability statute, to interpret the meaning of MCL 500.3113(a). However, the first step of statutory interpretation is to review the language of the statute at issue, not that of another statute. Indeed, the relevant phrase in MCL 500.3113(a) that we must interpret, \u201ctaken unlawfully,\u201d does not appear in the owner\u2019s liability statute that <em>Bronson </em>considered analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The owner\u2019s liability statute, MCL 257.401, differs from the no-fault act in several important respects.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In particular, it explains that the owner \u201cis not liable unless the motor vehicle is being driven with his or her express or implied consent or knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The owner\u2019s liability statute, therefore, considers not just an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>owner\u2019s consent but also the owner\u2019s knowledge, which is much broader than the focus in MCL 500.3113(a) on whether the taking was unlawful. Indeed, the owner\u2019s liability statute does not speak in terms of lawfulness or unlawfulness. Moreover, MCL 500.3113(a) does not contain language regarding <em>an owner\u2019s </em>\u201cexpress or implied consent or knowledge\u201d because it examines the legality of the taking from the <em>driver\u2019s </em>perspective \u2014 a perspective that the owner\u2019s liability statute lacks. Therefore, MCL 500.3113(a) does not incorporate from the owner\u2019s liability statute the presumption regarding an owner\u2019s consent or knowledge that determines a driver\u2019s statutory vicarious liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Not only did the <em>Bronson </em>Court err by analogizing the owner\u2019s liability statute to the no-fault act, it erroneously applied this Court\u2019s caselaw interpreting the owner\u2019s liability statute. <em>Cowan </em>indeed articulated a broad conception of consent in attempting to interpret the broad language in the owner\u2019s liability statute.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> However, <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>complete reliance on <em>Cowan </em>is in conflict with other Michigan Supreme Court precedent discussing a vehicle owner\u2019s vicarious liability. In <em>Fout v Dietz, </em>this Court emphasized that the holding in <em>Cowan </em>provided for an owner\u2019s liability when \u201cthe owner had initially given consent to the operation of his motor vehicle by others and then had <em>subsequently </em>sought, unsuccessfully, to place restrictions on that operation.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> However, <em>Fout </em>also emphasized that a party may present evidence to \u201crebut[] the common-law presumption that the vehicle in question was being operated with the express or implied consent of the owner\u201d at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Furthermore, in <em>Bieszck v Avis Rent-a-Car System, Inc, </em>this Court held that a rental contract forbidding anyone under age 25 from operating the rented vehicle conclusively rebutted the presumption that the 21-year-old driver was operating the vehicle with the owner\u2019s express or implied consent.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The Court reiterated that the common law and the owner\u2019s liability statute merely <em>presumed </em>that an owner has consented to the operation of a vehicle that was voluntarily given to someone else, a presumption that can be rebutted with \u201c \u2018positive, unequivocal, strong and credible evidence\u2019 \u201d that a particular use was outside the scope of the consent.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">For all these reasons, we believe that the \u201cchain of permissive use\u201d theory set forth in <em>Bronson </em>does not faithfully apply the standard articulated in MCL 500.3113(a) to determine whether the claimant \u201chad taken [the vehicle] unlawfully.\u201d Therefore, we overrule <em>Bronson </em>to the extent it is inconsistent with the plain meaning of MCL 500.3113(a). In examining whether a taking is unlawful within the meaning of MCL 500.3113(a), it is irrelevant whether the taking would have subjected the vehicle\u2019s owner to vicarious liability under MCL 257.401. What is relevant to this determination is whether the taking was \u201cwithout authority\u201d within the meaning of MCL 750.413 or MCL 750.414. If so, then the taking was \u201cunlawful\u201d within the meaning of MCL 500.3113(a).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In applying this principle of law to the facts of this case, we conclude that there is no factual dispute that Craig Sr. gave his consent only to allow Kathleen to use the vehicle and, at the same time, expressly instructed both Kathleen and Craig Jr. that Craig Jr. was not allowed to take and use the vehicle. Thus, Craig Jr. admitted that he had express knowledge that Craig Sr. did not give him consent to take and use the vehicle. As a result, Craig Jr. took his father\u2019s vehicle without authority contrary to MCL 750.414 and, therefore, took it unlawfully within the meaning of MCL 500.3113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Spectrum Health argues that Craig Jr. did not unlawfully take the vehicle because Kathleen had given him permission to take it. We disagree because a taking does not have to be forcible to be unlawful. Given the undisputed fact that Craig Jr. took the vehicle <em>contrary to the express prohibition of the vehicle\u2019s owner </em>(his father), Spectrum Health provides no legal support for its conclusion that Craig Jr.\u2019s actions did not violate MCL 750.414. Accordingly, the circuit court and Court of Appeals erred by granting Spectrum Health\u2019s motion for summary disposition because MCL 500.3113(a) precludes PIP benefits in this case.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> We reverse the lower court judgments and remand this case to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>B. <em>PROGRESSIVE </em>AND THE \u201cFAMILY JOYRIDING\u201d EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In <em>Progressive, </em>the Court of Appeals applied the \u201cfamily joyriding\u201d exception, first articulated in Justice Levin\u2019s plurality opinion in Priesman,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> to conclude that MCL 500.3113(a) did not exclude the claimant from receiving PIP benefits for taking his wife\u2019s vehicle contrary to her standing instruction. <em>Priesman </em>involved the motor vehicle accident of the vehicle owner\u2019s 14-year-old son, Corey, who had taken the vehicle without her permission.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The mother\u2019s no-fault insurer refused payment pursuant to MCL 500.3113(a), claiming that Corey had unlawfully taken the vehicle.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The circuit court granted the insurer\u2019s motion for summary disposition, finding no dispute that Corey had violated MCL 750.414 by taking his mother\u2019s vehicle without permission.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court, concluding that Corey\u2019s use \u201cwas not unlawful under the no-fault act\u201d and stating, \u201cWe cannot say that the Legislature intended that [MCL 500.3113(a)] would apply under the circumstances of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">This Court granted leave to appeal,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> although no majority holding resulted regarding the interpretation of MCL 500.3113(a).

In <em>Butterworth, </em>the Court examined <em>Priesman </em>and MCL 500.3113(a) to determine whether that provision applied to an adult family member who did not live with his parents.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> While the Court recognized that \u201cthe precedential value of <em>Priesman </em>is . . . somewhat problematic,\u201d the Court felt \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pelled to follow it.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The panel thus concluded that the unlawful-taking exclusion in MCL 500.3113(a) \u201cdoes not apply to cases where the person taking the vehicle unlawfully is a family member doing so without the intent to steal but, instead, doing so for joyriding purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The panel rejected the insurer\u2019s claim that the joyriding exception should not extend to a joyrider who had been expressly prohibited by the owner from driving the vehicle, reasoning that the joyrider\u2019s intent remained only to borrow the vehicle, not to steal it.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The panel also rejected the insurer\u2019s claim that the joyriding exception should not extend to users who take a vehicle knowing that they are \u201cphysically incapable of operating the vehicle safely and . . . not entitled to be a licensed driver.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Last, the panel rejected the insurer\u2019s claim that the joyriding exception should not extend to adult joyriders who lived apart from their parents at the time of the accident. The panel concluded that the age of the joyrider had no legal significance given <em>Priesman\u2019s </em>focus on \u201cthe fact that the driver was a family member who merely intended to joyride.\u201d<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Later, the Court of Appeals in <em>Mester declined \u201cto </em>extend the <em>Priesman </em>holding to apply to <em>anyone </em>who is merely joyriding.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> The panel considered, but ultimately rejected, Judge HOEKSTRA\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Butterworth, </em>which had interpreted <em>Priesman </em>for the broad proposition that \u201cthe legislators intended to except from [PIP] benefits only persons injured while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>driving a car they intended to <em>steal. . </em>. .\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The <em>Mester </em>panel explained that \u201cthe justices of the Supreme Court who recognized a joyriding exception in the <em>Priesman </em>case did so not because joyriding does not involve an unlawful taking, but only because of special considerations attendant to the joyriding use of a family vehicle by a family member.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In <em>Allen, </em>the Court of Appeals reaffirmed Mester's limitation of the family-joyriding exception to motor vehicle users who were related to the owners.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Finally, in <em>Roberts, </em>an inebriated 12-year-old, Kyle Roberts, was injured while driving his landlord\u2019s vehicle, which Kyle\u2019s mother had been allowed to use on a regular basis.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Relying on the no-fault act\u2019s definition of \u201cowner\u201d in MCL 500.3101 and the Court of Appeals\u2019 previous recognition that \u201cthere may be more than one \u2018owner\u2019 of a vehicle,\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> the majority concluded that Kyle\u2019s mother was properly considered an owner of the vehicle. As a result, the family-joyriding exception allowed Kyle to claim PIP benefits.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">As stated, Justice Levin\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Priesman </em>is the only instance in which this Court addressed the \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d language in MCL 500.3113(a). It is axiomatic that the <em>first step of </em>statutory interpretation is to review the language of the statute itself. Yet <em>Priesman </em>relied more on the language of the UMVARA and its commentary to interpret MCL 500.3113(a) than on the actual text of MCL 500.3113(a) enacted by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>This Court has previously expressed disapproval of relying on model acts to interpret existing statutes rather than on the clear language of the actual statutes at issue. In <em>Jarrad v Integon National Insurance Co,</em><footnotemark><em>78</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we overruled the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Spencer v Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity </em>Co,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> which had interpreted the phrase \u201cother health and accident coverage\u201d in MCL 500.3109a by reference to the UMVARA. In <em>Spencer, </em>the plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident during work and sought no-fault benefits.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> The insurer argued that the wage-continuation benefits the plaintiff received pursuant to a union agreement were \u201cother health and accident coverage\u201d under MCL 500.3109a and were therefore subject to coordination with no-fault benefits.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> The court referred to the counterpart language in the UMVARA and compared it with the statutory text.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The model language provided that PIP benefits were to be coordinated with \u201c \u2018loss otherwise compensated by benefits or advantages a person receives or is unconditionally entitled to receive from any other specified source . .. .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also found it \u201cclear from the comments that, under the UMVARA, wage continuation benefits pursuant to a union agreement were intended to be coordinated with no-fault benefits otherwise payable.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5W\">The <em>Spencer </em>Court held in this regard that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>[i]nstead of adopting the broader language of the uniform act,. .. the Michigan act was drafted much more narrowly, and limited coordination to \u201cother health and accident coverage.\u201d It appears, therefore, that in enacting the Michigan act the Legislature did not intend for no-fault benefits to be coordinated with a broad array of other benefits which may perhaps be equally duplicative.[<footnotemark>85</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">In response to this holding, this Court emphasized in <em>Jarrad </em>\u201cthat a court\u2019s fundamental interpretive obligation is to discern the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the words expressed in the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> And we stated that the <em>Spencer </em>Court simply had not analyzed the language of the statute. Rather, <em>Spencer </em>had perfunctorily held that \u201c(1) the statute is narrower than the model provision, and (2) the statute must therefore produce a different outcome than the model provision would generate.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> We explained that \u201c[a] court may not simply announce that the text of a statute differs from the language in a model act... as an excuse to avoid the court\u2019s duty to interpret the statutory text adopted by the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The plurality opinion in <em>Priesman </em>appears to have embraced the erroneous method of statutory interpretation advanced by the Court of Appeals in <em>Spencer </em>and subsequently rejected by this Court in <em>Jarrada.</em><footnotemark><em>89</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>than taking the first step of statutory interpretation, i.e., examining the relevant statute, the <em>Priesman </em>plurality referred to the UMVARA. and compared the UMVARA \u2014 which used the term \u201cconverter\u201d \u2014 to the relevant phrase in MCL 500.3113(a), \u201ctaken unlawfully.\u201d From this difference, the plurality presumed that \u201c[t]he legislative purpose, in rejecting the UMVARA language, was thus to except from no-fault coverage thieves while driving stolen vehicles even if they or a spouse or relative had purchased no-fault insurance, and not necessarily to except joyriders from coverage.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> This presumption is entirely unfounded. The only legislative purpose that can be gleaned from the text of MCL 500.3113(a) is the intent to exclude persons who had unlawfully taken vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">We conclude that the family-joyriding exception is not supported by the text of MCL 500.3113(a). Unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>the plurality opinion in <em>Priesman, </em>our decision is not based on the presumed driving habits of legislators or their families, and we certainly will not speculate whether, \u201csitting at a drafting session,\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> a majority of legislators collectively decided that family joyriders are entitled to PIP benefits, regardless of any circumstances surrounding the taking of the vehicle. Rather, we simply refer to the statutory text, which provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">[a] <em>person </em>is not entitled to be paid [PIP] benefits for accidental bodily injury if at the time of the accident any of the following circumstances existed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">(a) The <em>person </em>was using a motor vehicle or motorcycle which he or she had taken unlawfully, unless the <em>person </em>reasonably believed that he or she was entitled to take and use the vehicle.[<footnotemark>92</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">\u201cIf the language of the statute is unambiguous, the Legislature must have intended the meaning clearly expressed, and the statute must be enforced as written.

They maintain that insurance companies set their premiums to reflect the family-joyriding exception and that it is the medical providers and insureds who will suffer the consequences of this opinion. Justice CAVANAGH similarly claims there is an expectation that family members who drive a family vehicle without express permission will be covered. However, it is undisputed that there is no contractual right to have insurance companies provide PIP benefits to operators in these cases.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Indeed, Ryan DeYoung is a named excluded driver on the policy purchased from Progressive. In other words, our deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>sion today does not at all affect the parties\u2019 contractual rights, and it is retrospective in its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Our decision today applies the plain language of MCL 500.3113(a), which excludes from receiving PIP benefits someone who \u201cwas using a motor vehicle or motorcycle which he or she had taken unlawfully, unless the person reasonably believed that he or she was entitled to take and use the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Therefore, any person who takes a vehicle contrary to a provision of the Michigan Penal Code \u2014 including MCL 750.413 and MCL 750.414, informally known as the \u201cjoyriding\u201d statutes \u2014 has taken the vehicle unlawfully within the meaning of MCL 500.3113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">We overrule <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>\u201cchain of permissive use\u201d theory, which incorporated concepts from the owner\u2019s liability statute, as inconsistent with MCL 500.3113(a). The owner\u2019s liability statute establishes an owner\u2019s civil liability for injury caused by the negligent operation of his or her vehicle <em>whenever </em>the vehicle was \u201cbeing driven\u201d with the owner\u2019s \u201cexpress or implied knowledge or consent.\u201d Because its focus on the unlawful nature of the taking involves the <em>driver\u2019s </em>authority to take the vehicle, MCL 500.3113(a) is not analogous to the owner\u2019s liability statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Because the legality of the taking does not turn on whether the driver intended to steal the car, MCL 500.3113(a) applies equally to joyriders. Moreover, because MCL 500.3113 refers to <em>\u201ca </em>person,\u201d the Legislature clearly and plainly intended to exclude from receiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ing PIP benefits even a relative who took a vehicle unlawfully.

However, in two of the cases cited, the language of the UMVARA was the same as the language of the Michigan provisions under consideration.

This Court recognized that Michigan common law prohibited an intentional tortfeasor from seeking contribution. <em>Id. </em>at 249. The Legislature enacted a contribution statute, MCL 600.2925a(1), which provided in part that \u201c \u2018when 2 or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to a person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among <em>them....'\" Id. </em>at 247. This Court properly concluded that the Legislature did not intend any limitation or prohibition concerning intentional tortfeasors. <em>Id. </em>at 250. Indeed, the statute refers to liability \u201cin tort\u201d including \u201cwrongful death,\u201d which obviously may include an intentional tort. This Court only noted that MCL 600.2925a(1) \u201cwas based upon the model contribution act that itself retained the prohibition recognized in our common law. ...\u201d Id. at 257 n 14. The Court simply pointed out that \u201c[t]he fact that our Legislature did not include this restriction in adopting its version of the model contribution act is significant to any good-faith effort to give meaning to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. Donajkowski </em>relied on the absence of language in MCL 600.2925a(1) because it differed from the Michigan common-law rule. That the model contribution act included this common-law distinction merely supported the Court\u2019s conclusion. <em>Donajkowski </em>is clearly distinguishable because the enacted statutory language at issue here is different from that of the UMVARA, not omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">More important is that in none of these cases did this Court find that the model act provides more guidance than the actual text of the enacted statute. In this case, the language of the relevant statute differs from the corresponding provision of the model act, yet Justice Cavanagh still holds the belief that \u201c \u2018the Legislature did not intend any substantial difference in scope or meaning from the prototypical UMVARA concept excepting thieves from no-fault coverage ....\u2019\u201d <em>Post </em>at 541, quoting <em>Priesman, </em>441 Mich at 67-68. There is a very substantial difference between language that excludes only car thieves from receiving PIP benefits and language that excludes all persons who have unlawfully taken vehicles from receiving PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Some 20 years after <em>Priesman, </em>Justice CAVANAGH still seeks to insert into Michigan Law the UMVARA provision that \u201cexcept[ed] from coverage a \u2018converter\u2019- \u2014 a person who steals \u2014 unless covered under a no-fault policy issued to the converter or a spouse or other relative in the same household.\u201d <em>Priesman, </em>441 Mich at 66 (opinion by Levin, J.) (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>omitted). He admits as much by <em>endorsing Priesman\u2019s </em>attempt to \u201cg[i]ve meaning\u201d to the statute\u2019s language by \u201cconsider[ing] the modifications that the Legislature made to the model act that was the starting point for the statute that was eventually enacted.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 539-540. Contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s assertion, our \u201ctrue disagreement with <em>Priesman </em>is [not] that <em>Priesman </em>simply defined the phrase \u2018taken unlawfully\u2019 more narrowly than .. . [we] would like.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 541-542. Our disagreement is that <em>Priesman </em>did not consider the statute as the <em>starting point-, </em>rather, it first considered the UMVARA, then concluded that the Legislature intended to exclude \u201conly car thieves\u201d from receiving PIP benefits. Of course, the Legislature clearly could have readily excluded \u201conly car thieves\u201d and indeed could have simply adopted the UMVARA language and excluded \u201cconverters.\u201d Instead, the Legislature decided to except from PIP benefits persons who have \u201cunlawfully taken\u201d the vehicle. Rather than accepting this Legislative decision, Justice \u00dcAVANAGH prefers an interpretation in which any person can take and use any other person\u2019s vehicle with or without the owner\u2019s permission at any time for whatever reason as long as the person merely intends to return the vehicle at some later point in time. This interpretation is not grounded in the text of MCL 500.3113(a) and would, in fact, serve to entice uninsured persons to unlawfully take vehicles for joyrides.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"90\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\"> <em>Priesman, </em>441 Mich at 67 (opinion by Levin, J.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"91\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"92\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\"> MCL 500.3113(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"93\">\n<p id=\"b598-11\"> <em>Sun Valley Foods Co v Ward, </em>460 Mich 230, 236; 596 NW2d 119 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"94\">\n<p id=\"b598-12\"> We disagree with the sweeping proposition in Justice Hathaway\u2019s dissenting opinion that \u201cthe purpose of the no-fault act [is] to provide a source and means of recovery to persons injured in auto accidents.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 552.

Because the Court of Appeals panels in these cases correctly applied these principles, I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Under MCL 500.3113(a), an injured person is barred from recovering PIP benefits if the injured person \u201cwas using a motor vehicle or motorcycle which he or she had <em>taken unlawfully </em>. . ..\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In Priesman, </em>the lead opinion held that the insured\u2019s teenage son, who drove his mother\u2019s vehicle without express permission, had not taken the vehicle unlawfully for purposes of MCL 500.3113(a). Priesman\u2019s analysis formally became part of Michigan\u2019s caselaw when it was adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Butterworth Hosp v Farm Bureau Ins Co, </em>225 Mich App 244; 570 NW2d 304 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>(1997). Thus, in accordance with MCR 7.215(J)(1),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals in <em>Progressive Marathon Ins Co v DeYoung, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 24, 2011 (Docket No. 296592), accurately applied Priesman\u2019s progeny as binding case-law to conclude that MCL 500.3113(a) does not prohibit Ryan DeYoung from recovering PIP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The majority now reverses the Court of Appeals in <em>Progressive </em>and discards <em>Priesman </em>and its progeny, claiming that <em>Priesman </em>erroneously interpreted MCL 500.3113(a). The majority\u2019s reading of <em>Priesman </em>is flawed, however. To begin with, the majority inaccurately claims that <em>Priesman </em>\u201cstray[ed] from\u201d and is thus entirely divorced from the statutory language in MCL 500.3113(a). <em>Ante </em>at 534. Rather, like the majority opinion in this case, <em>Priesman </em>focused on the requirement that the vehicle be \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d in order to trigger the exclusion under MCL 500.3113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Priesman </em>gave meaning to this phrase by reviewing the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act (UMVARA). Contrary to the majority\u2019s claims, consideration of the UMVARA was an entirely logical approach to determining the legislative intent behind MCL 500.3113(a) because, as the lead opinion in <em>Priesman </em>explained, MCL 500.3113(a) was modeled after a provision in the UMVARA. Accordingly, an obvious method for determining the legislative intent behind MCL 500.3113(a) and the plain meaning of the words used was to determine what the Legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>accomplish by modifying the language of the model provision from which MCL 500.3113(a) was ultimately crafted. Thus, the majority is incorrect when it implies that <em>Priesman </em>\u201creified] on [a] model act[]... rather than the clear language of [the] actual statute at issue.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 530. Rather, to define the critical phrase used in the statute[], <em>Priesman </em>merely considered the modifications that the Legislature made to the model act that was the starting point for the statute that was eventually enacted. Notably, <em>Priesman </em>did not break new ground in considering the UMVARA; indeed, this Court has previously considered the UMVARA as a source of guidance in construing provisions of the no-fault act. See, e.g., <em>MacDonald v State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>419 Mich 146; 350 NW2d 233 (1984), and <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643, 391 NW2d 320 (1986); see, also, <em>Donajkowski v Alpena Power Co, </em>460 Mich 243, 257 n 14; 596 NW2d 574 (1999) (finding the fact that the Legislature deviated from a model act \u201csignificant to any good-faith effort to give meaning to the Legislature\u2019s intent\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>A panel of the Court of Appeals must follow the rule of law established by a prior published decision of the Court of Appeals issued on or after November 1,1990, that has not been reversed or modified by the Supreme Court, or by a special panel of the Court of Appeals....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>Priesman </em>specifically focused on the fact that the UMVARA \u201cexcept[ed] from coverage a \u2018converter\u2019 \u2014 a person who <em>steals </em>\u2014 unless covered under a no-fault policy issued to the converter or a spouse or other relative in the same household.\u201d <em>Priesman, </em>441 Mich at 66. <em>Priesman </em>concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>[t]he legislative purpose, in rejecting the UMVARA language, was thus to except from no-fault coverage <em>thieves while driving stolen vehicles </em>even if they or a spouse or relative had purchased no-fault insurance, and not necessarily to except joyriders from coverage.

Moreover, <em>Priesman </em>considered a logical source for that definition, given the legislative process that created MCL 500.3113(a). Accordingly, it appears that the majority\u2019s true disagreement with <em>Priesman </em>is that <em>Priesman </em>simply defined the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d more narrowly than the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ity would like. This is not a sufficient justification for the majority\u2019s decision to supplant more than 15 years of this state\u2019s jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The majority also argues that it is proper to consider the Michigan Penal Code, MCL 750.1 <em>et seq., </em>to give meaning to the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully.\u201d Ironically, this approach runs afoul of the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Priesman </em>erred because it considered sources other than the statutory text at issue. Other than the majority\u2019s strained exaggeration of its carefully selected dictionary definitions, there is no indication that it is proper to resort to the Penal Code to give meaning to a specific phrase in the no-fault act. It is axiomatic, however, that \u201c[w]hen considering the correct interpretation, the statute must be read as a whole\u201d and that \u201c[individual words and phrases, while important, should be read in the context of the <em>entire legislative scheme.\u201d Mich Props, LLC v Meridian Twp, </em>491 Mich 518, 528; 817 NW2d 548 (2012) (emphasis added, citations omitted). Accordingly, while the majority is apparently compelled by a dictionary to look outside the no-fault act, I am compelled by the canons of statutory interpretation to conclude that <em>Priesman </em>wisely recognized that MCL 500.3113(a) must be considered within the full context of the no-fault act and that <em>Priesman, </em>therefore, correctly concluded that the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide broad accessibility to benefits informed the proper interpretation of MCL 500.3113(a). <em>Priesman, </em>441 Mich at 64-66.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>The majority ignores the legislative intent to provide broad accessibility to benefits by conflating the concept of providing PIP benefits to a person who made a poor decision with that of endorsing that person\u2019s conduct. See <em>ante </em>at 533 n 89 (implying that <em>Priesman </em>condones or encourages a person\u2019s decision to joyride). <em>Priesman </em>no more condoned or encouraged this conduct than the no-fault act condones or encourages any other irresponsible conduct that results in an automobile accident. Nevertheless, a person who causes an accident by texting, fiddling with the radio, or simply daydreaming while driving is generally entitled to PIP benefits. Accordingly, if the majority truly believes that <em>Priesman </em>would \u201cserve to entice\u201d joyriders, <em>ante </em>at 533 n 89, the majority must also believe that the no-fault act entices other types of irresponsible conduct that is likely to cause automobile accidents. Moreover, I seriously doubt that the average would-be joyrider pauses to consider the availability of PIP coverage when deciding to go for a spin in another person\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">The majority also relies heavily on the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinions in <em>Butterworth, 225 </em>Mich App 244, and <em>Mester v State Farm Mut Ins Co, </em>235 Mich App 84; 596 NW2d 205 (1999), to support its mischaracterization and dismissal of Priesman\u2019s analysis. Although those opinions reached the right result under <em>Priesman\u2019 </em>s analysis, they also improperly interpreted <em>Priesman. </em>Specifically, <em>Butterworth </em>stated that MCL 500.3113(a) \u201cdoes not apply to cases where the person <em>taking the vehicle unlawfully </em>is a family member doing so without the intent to steal but, instead, doing so for joyriding purposes.\u201d <em>Butterworth, 225 </em>Mich App at 249 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>(emphasis added). Similarly, <em>Mester </em>stated that \u201cthe justices of the Supreme Court who recognized a joyriding exception in the <em>Priesman </em>case did so <em>not because joyriding does not involve an unlawful taking, </em>but only because of special considerations attendant to the joyriding use of a family vehicle by a family member.\u201d <em>Mester, </em>235 Mich App at 88 (emphasis added). Indeed, nowhere in the <em>Priesman </em>plurality opinion did Justice LEVIN use the phrase \u201cfamily joyriding exception,\u201d and <em>Butterworth </em>coined the phrase \u201c \u2018family member\u2019 joyriding exception\u201d by citing Justice GRIFFIN\u2019s <em>Priesman </em>dissent rather than Justice Levin\u2019s lead opinion. <em>Butterworth, </em>225 Mich App at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">These statements in <em>Butterworth </em>and <em>Mester </em>are erroneous because <em>Priesman </em>accurately interpreted the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d as including <em>only car thieves. </em>Accordingly, <em>Butterworth </em>and <em>Mester </em>incorrectly concluded that <em>Priesman </em>\u201cexempts\u201d a person who \u201ctakes the vehicle unlawfully.\u201d Instead, <em>Priesman </em>held that a vehicle that was driven without express permission does not meet the definition of one that was \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d under MCL 500.3113(a). Moreover, the majority in <em>Butterworth </em>rejected Judge HOEKSTRA\u2019s concurring opinion, in which he argued that a person\u2019s familial relationship to the owner of a car is irrelevant when applying <em>Priesman. </em>Judge HOEKSTRA concluded that nothing in <em>Priesman </em>supported the <em>Butterworth </em>majority\u2019s conclusion; rather, Judge HOEKSTRA determined that <em>Priesman </em>stood for the proposition that \u201cthe legislators intended to except from [PIP] benefits only persons injured while driving a car they intended to steal____\u201d <em>Butterworth, </em>225 Mich App at 253 (HOEKSTRA, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Judge HOEKSTRA was correct in his interpretation of Priesman\u2019s holding. Specifically, <em>Priesman </em>expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>stated that \u201c[t]he legislative purpose . . . was thus to except from no-fault coverage <em>thieves while driving stolen vehicles </em>. . . <em>Priesman, </em>441 Mich at 67 (emphasis added). Accordingly, Judge HOEKSTRA accurately concluded that Priesman\u2019s discussion of the family relationship at issue in that case \u201cwas merely part of the factual basis of the case and did not establish a limiting parameter for interpreting the Court\u2019s remaining discussion.\u201d <em>Butterworth, </em>225 Mich App at 253 (HOEKSTRA, J., concurring). Thus, I would reject <em>Butterworth </em>and <em>Mester </em>to the extent that those opinions are inconsistent with the proper interpretation of <em>Priesman. </em>Additionally, I would clarify this area of law by eliminating the misleading label \u201cfamily joyriding <em>exception.\u201d </em>There is no \u201cexception\u201d; rather, <em>Priesman </em>simply applied the rules of statutory interpretation to give meaning to the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d as it is used in MCL 500.3113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Finally, although the principles of stare decisis do not apply to <em>Priesman </em>because it is a plurality opinion, it should not go unnoticed that the Court of Appeals adopted Priesman\u2019s holding and those Court of Appeals opinions have been binding law for the last 15 years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, as applied by the Court of Appeals, the rule has created an expectation that, at a minimum, a family member who drives a family vehicle without express permission would be covered for PIP benefits. Furthermore, insureds have paid their insurance premiums for the last 15 years with this expectation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>may not agree with <em>Priesman; </em>however, <em>Priesman </em>is nevertheless a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language, and the Court of Appeals caselaw adopting and applying the rule is <em>binding law. </em>MCR 7.215(J)(1). Accordingly, insurers and insureds alike have rightfully conformed their conduct in reliance on Priesman\u2019s progeny. Thus, I believe that although <em>Priesman </em>and its progeny are not entitled to stare decisis consideration, the reliance interests related to this area of the law are significant, worthy of some consideration, and strongly counsel against departing from the existing state of the law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Accordingly, I see no reason to reject <em>Priesman. </em>I would instead affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Progressive </em>and uphold Priesman\u2019s interpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>tation of MCL 500.3113(a). Additionally, I agree with Justice HATHAWAY\u2019S conclusion that the Court of Appeals in <em>Spectrum Health </em>did not clearly err by holding that Craig Smith, Jr., did not unlawfully take the vehicle. Thus, I would also affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Spectrum Health.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b611-4\">Marilyn Kelly, concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b611-5\">Hathaway, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J., with respect to <em>Progressive </em>only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> MCR 7.215(J)(1) states, in relevant part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> In citing these cases, I do not argue that Priesman\u2019s consideration of the UMVARA is identical to this Court\u2019s consideration of the UMVARA in <em>MacDonald, Thornton, </em>or any other case for that matter.

Only the caselaw interpreting the meaning of \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d in MCL 500.3113(a) governs whether Ryan is entitled to PIP benefits, which, under Priesman\u2019s progeny, the Court of Appeals in <em>Progressive </em>correctly concluded that he is.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b610-13\"> The correction of the Court of Appeals\u2019 misinterpretation <em>o\u00ed Priesman </em>that I propose would not have the same negative effect that the majority opinion will have on the reliance interests at issue because insureds would not be denied coverage that was previously provided.

The primary issue in the case was whether Forshee had unlawfully taken the car and was therefore excluded from recovering PIP benefits under MCL 500.3113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The unanimous panel in <em>Bronson </em>noted that there was no caselaw that specifically defined \u201ctaken unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>fully\u201d as that phrase is used in the no-fault act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>Bronson </em>panel turned to a similar area of law involving a vehicle owner\u2019s liability. Specifically, the panel considered this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cowan v </em>Strecker,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which involved the taking of a vehicle with the consent of an intermediate user but without the express consent of the owner. While <em>Cowan </em>did not involve the no-fault act, it involved a similar statute, MCL 257.401, commonly known as the owner\u2019s liability statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">In <em>Cowan, </em>the owner of the vehicle loaned it to an acquaintance with the express direction to not let anyone else use it. Nevertheless, the acquaintance let her son use the car, and he was involved in an accident. This Court determined that the owner of the vehicle was hable under the owner\u2019s liability statute, based on a broad understanding of consent. The Court reasoned that given the owner\u2019s willing surrender of the vehicle to the acquaintance, the owner had consented to the risks inherent in surrendering control of a vehicle to another, \u201cregardless of admonitions which would purport to delimit his consent.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, this Court held that an owner\u2019s consent to an intermediate user included the consent to any subsequent users of the vehicle, even when the owner set restrictions on the use by the intermediate user.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Bronson </em>found this Court\u2019s interpretation of the owner\u2019s liability statute persuasive and applied the same analysis and reasoning to the unlawful-taking provision contained within the no-fault act. As such, <em>Bronson </em>held that when an owner of a vehicle gives permission to an intermediate user to take the vehicle, the intermediate user then has the authority to give permission to a subsequent user to take that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>vehicle. Therefore, the subsequent user in <em>Bronson </em>had lawfully taken the vehicle with the consent of the owner under the no-fault act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In <em>Spectrum Health, </em>the Court of Appeals correctly applied the chain-of-permissive-use theory to the facts before it. Plaintiff, Spectrum Health Hospitals, seeks to recover the cost of care that it provided to Craig Smith Jr. from the insurer of a truck owned by Craig Smith Jr.\u2019s father, Craig Smith Sr. Craig Sr.\u2019s truck was insured by defendants Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company of Michigan and Farm Bureau General Insurance Company of Michigan (collectively \u201cFarm Bureau\u201d). Farm Bureau claims that Craig Jr. is excluded from coverage under MCL 500.3113(a) because he had taken his father\u2019s truck unlawfully. Craig Sr. had loaned the truck to Craig Jr.\u2019s girlfriend with instructions not to let Craig Jr. drive it. However, Craig Jr.\u2019s girlfriend did allow him to drive it, and he was involved in an accident. Spectrum Health treated Craig Jr. and brought the instant suit to recover PIP benefits associated with his care. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals held that Craig Jr. was not excluded from coverage under the chain-of-permissive-use theory because Craig Sr. had turned control of the truck over to Craig Jr.\u2019s girlfriend, and she in turn gave Craig Jr. permission to use the truck. The majority\u2019s decision overrules the Court of Appeals and discards the weEestabhshed chain-of-permissive-use theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I disagree with the majority because the Court of Appeals correctly applied <em>Bronson </em>and the chain-of-permissive-use theory based on <em>Cowan. </em>I find that the <em>Bronson </em>analysis was a well-reasoned interpretation of the phrase \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d in its context within MCL 500.3113(a). It is reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d to be applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>in terms of consent of the owner, and this Court in <em>Cowan </em>properly defined what the consent of an owner includes. The majority\u2019s opinion simply substitutes its own definition of \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d for the well-established definition set forth in <em>Bronson. </em>However, the definition in <em>Bronson </em>was consistent with the policy of this state under the no-fault act that \u201c \u2018persons who suffer loss due to the tragedy of automobile accidents in this state shall have a source and a means of recovery.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unfortunately, the majority\u2019s new definition strays from this policy when there is no compelling reason to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\">The majority criticizes <em>Bronson </em>for looking outside the text of the no-fault act in order to determine the meaning of \u201ctaken unlawfully.\u201d The majority expresses concern that <em>Bronson </em>relied on the meaning of an owner\u2019s \u201cconsent,\u201d a term found only in one unrelated provision of the no-fault act. See MCL 500.3116(3). However, the majority uses the same approach in reaching its definition of \u201ctaken unlawfully.\u201d Specifically, the majority looks outside the text of MCL 500.3113(a) and relies on the word \u201cauthority,\u201d which is also found only in one unrelated provision of the no-fault act. See MCL 500.3104(1). In its search for the meaning of \u201ctaken unlawfully,\u201d the majority looks to the dictionary for the definitions of \u201cunlawful\u201d and \u201ctake.\u201d From the dictionary definitions, the majority concludes that \u201ctaken unlawfully\u201d refers to a criminal act. Then, just as the panel did in <em>Bronson, </em>the majority seeks guidance from a statute governing another area of law, and it turns to MCL 750.414, a statute that places criminal liability on a person who \u201ctakes or uses without authority any motor vehicle without intent to steal the same. . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The majority focuses on the word \u201cauthority\u201d in the criminal statute despite the fact that \u201cauthority\u201d is not found in the relevant provision of the no-fault act. It then concludes that if a person takes a vehicle against the express wishes of the owner, he or she has taken the vehicle without the owner\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d and has done so unlawfully under the no-fault act. Thus, like <em>Bronson\u2019s </em>reliance on \u201cconsent\u201d from the owner\u2019s liability statute, the majority relies on an owner\u2019s \u201cauthority\u201d under another area of law. Given that the majority engages in the same \u201coutside the text of the statute\u201d analysis, its criticisms of <em>Bronson </em>fall flat.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u201ctaken unlawfully.\u201d Its interpretation precludes a class of injured parties from recovering PIP benefits even when a party was given permission to take a car by an intermediate user. The <em>Bronson </em>interpretation is the better interpretation because it was more consistent with the purpose of the no-fault act to provide a source and means of recovery to persons injured in auto accidents. The majority\u2019s interpretation conflicts with that purpose. Moreover, the idea that the consent of an owner can be passed down through a chain of permissive users is well established in the law, and I see no reason to depart from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>Spectrum Health </em>because it correctly applied the well-reasoned and well-established chain-of-permissive-use theory.</p>\n<judges id=\"b616-6\">Marilyn Kelly, J., concurred with Hathaway, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> <em>Spectrum Health Hosps v Farm Bureau Mut Ins Co of Mich, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 24, 2011 (Docket No. 296976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\"> <em>Bronson Methodist Hosp v Forshee, </em>198 Mich App 617; 499 NW2d 423 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\"> <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\"> <em>Cowan v Strecker, </em>394 Mich 110; 229 NW2d 302 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b613-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b614-6\"><em> Bronson, </em>198 Mich App at 625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b615-4\"> <em>Coburn v Fox, </em>425 Mich 300, 311 n 3; 389 NW2d 424 (1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
