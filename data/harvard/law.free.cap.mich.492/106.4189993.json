The circuit court excluded the testimony of two experts regarding the occurrence of false confessions and the police interrogation techniques likely to generate them as well as the psychological characteristics of defendant that allegedly made him more susceptible to these techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">We hold that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the expert testimony regarding the published literature on false confessions and police interrogations on the basis of its determination that the testimony was not reliable, even though the subject of the proposed testimony is beyond the common knowledge of the average juror. We also hold, however, that the circuit court abused its discretion by excluding the proffered testimony regarding defendant\u2019s psychological characteristics because it failed to consider this evidence separately from the properly excluded general expert testimony and therefore failed to properly apply both MRE 702 and MRE 403 to that evidence. Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court for it to determine whether evidence of defendant\u2019s psychological characteristics is sufficiently reliable for admissibility under MRE 702. We further hold that the circuit court\u2019s application of MRE 702 did not violate defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">I. PACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In May 2008, the brother and sister-in-law of defendant, Jerome Walter Kowalski, were found dead in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>home. Defendant was charged with both murders. Testimony elicited at defendant\u2019s preliminary examination and Walker<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing indicates that police questioned defendant about the killings four times over the course of several days: first at defendant\u2019s home, next at the Brighton Police Station, then at the Ann Arbor Police Department, and finally at a Michigan State Police post.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">During the third interview session, defendant acquiesced to the interviewer\u2019s statement that there was a \u201cfifty percent chance [he killed his brother], but a fifty percent chance [he] didn\u2019t.\u201d Defendant discussed having a \u201cblackout\u201d and \u201cblurred\u201d memory and stated, \u201cI thought I had a dream Thursday, but it was the actual shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Defendant confessed to the murders during the last interview session, which followed a night in jail. Defendant stated that he went to his brother\u2019s home, walked into the kitchen, and murdered his brother and sister-in-law after a brief verbal exchange. The record suggests that defendant initially described shooting his brother in the chest from a distance of several feet, although he eventually changed his account after a detective illustrated through role-playing that defendant\u2019s first version of events did not corroborate the evidence recovered from the victims\u2019 house. At this point in the pretrial proceedings, defendant\u2019s confession is the primary evidence implicating him in the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress his statements to the police, which the circuit court denied after conducting a <em>Walker </em>hearing. Defendant then filed a notice of intent to call two expert witnesses. Dr. Richard Leo, a social psychologist, would testify regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ing police interrogation techniques and the existence of false confessions. Dr. Jeffrey Wendt, a clinical and forensic psychologist, proposed to testify about the psychological testing he performed on defendant and offer his opinion about defendant\u2019s mental state during police questioning. Wendt would also offer testimony that the \u201ccircumstances of Mr. Kowalski\u2019s confession were consistent with the literature on false confessions\u201d and that the interaction between defendant and police \u201cwas consistent with a coerced internalized confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abj\">The prosecutor moved to exclude this proposed expert testimony, arguing that it was inadmissible under MRE 702. Both experts testified at a Daubert<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hearing. Leo explained that his research classified each confession he believed to be false as either a \u201cproven false\u201d confession, a \u201chighly probable false\u201d confession, or a \u201cprobable false\u201d confession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This categorization involved comparing the narrative of a defendant\u2019s confession with other evidence, checking whether the confession led to independent evidence, and looking for other indicia of reliability, with a researcher determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>whether the confession fell into one of the three categories of false confessions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While some of the facts involved in this analysis came \u201cdirectly from case files,\u201d many were gleaned from secondary sources, including popular media accounts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition to classifying confessions by his confidence in their falsity, Leo also classified confessions as \u201cvoluntary false confessions,\u201d \u201cstress-compliant false confessions,\u201d \u201ccoerced-compliant false confessions,\u201d \u201ccoerced-persuaded false confessions,\u201d or \u201cnon-coerced-persuaded false confessions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Leo categorized each confession in this manner by comparing the circumstances of each confession with those of other confessions he had already determined to be false.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>On the basis of this research, Leo proposed to testify that \u201cfalse confessions are associated with certain police interrogation techniques,\u201d that \u201csome of those interrogation techniques were used in this case,\u201d and that \u201crisk factors associated with false and unreliable confessions, especially persuaded false confessions, were [also] present in this case.\u201d In support of Leo\u2019s opinions, defendant offered research conducted by Leo and by others. Some of this research appeared in peer-reviewed scientific journals, while some appeared in law reviews, which are not peer-reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Next, Wendt testified that he had administered a battery of standard psychological tests on defendant, performed an extensive clinical interview of defendant, and reviewed both the police reports recounting the circumstances of defendant\u2019s police interrogation as well as the transcripts of those interrogations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Wendt testified that these types of data are routinely used at the Center for Forensic Psychiatry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Wendt then combined all these \u201cdata sources\u201d to form a psychological profile, which allowed him to discuss how defendant\u2019s traits affected his ability to interact with other people.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Lastly, Wendt proposed to testify that \u201c[t]he circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>stances of [defendant\u2019s] confession were consistent with the literature on false confessions\u201d and that the interaction between defendant and the police \u201cwas consistent with a coerced internalized confession.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court excluded both experts\u2019 proposed testimony. The circuit court ruled that Leo was qualified in terms of knowledge but that his testimony was unreliable and would not assist the trier of fact. The circuit court stated that \u201cthe lack of precise information\u201d precluded Leo from measuring the accuracy of his studies and also critiqued the sources underlying Leo\u2019s classifications of particular confessions as false:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">[Leo] doesn\u2019t. .. have the ability in his studies to review video tapes, which would be reliable. He relies on newspaper accounts, magazine articles. He relies on information provided from sources that are prejudice^], for example a defense attorney that represented a defendant, [and] advocates against the death penalty.... I don\u2019t understand why he couldn\u2019t have done a [Freedom of Information Act request], police agency files where confessions were given and the suspect was tried or not tried, pull court files, order transcripts, review police records.. .. [This] would be a ... more reliable methodology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The circuit court examined the manner in which Leo analyzed the confessions that he determined to be false:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">[Leo] starts with the conclusion that the confession is false and then he works backwards.... He doesn\u2019t take into consideration why someone might falsely confess, other than because of a police interrogation technique.... [A]nd there are reasons why people would falsely confess, they might be trying to protect someone .... He hasn\u2019t determined a reliable means to have a study group consist of innocent people who wrongfully confess that weren\u2019t mentally ill or youth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The circuit court criticized this methodology for failing to compare true and false confessions and identify factors that contribute to false confessions but not true confessions. As the circuit court stated, \u201c[I]f true and false confessions can be derived from the same police interrogation techniques, [how] is it possible to blame police interrogation techniques with any degree of reliability?\u201d Given what the circuit court considered to be inadequacies of Leo\u2019s data and methodology, the circuit court concluded that Leo\u2019s testimony was unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The circuit court further determined that Leo\u2019s testimony would not assist the trier of fact because the jury could evaluate the credibility and reliability of defendant\u2019s confession in other ways:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">The video tape will allow the jury to have a first hand view of exactly how the confession was elicited. The jurors will be able to view the police interrogation techniques used. The jury can determine credibility and determine whether the confession is reliable. They have a video. The jurors can figure out if it\u2019s a persuaded confession by reviewing the tape and considering if the defendant was able to give facts to the police officer regarding the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Accordingly, the circuit court ruled that Leo\u2019s testimony failed to comply with MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Finally, the circuit court concluded that Leo\u2019s testimony was also properly excluded under MRE 403. The circuit court ruled that the \u201chighly questionable\u201d probative value of Leo\u2019s testimony was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice because the jury would hear about confessions of defendants with characteristics not present in this case, such as mental illness and youth, and because Leo would describe some confessions as \u201cproven false\u201d when the data did not support that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>With regard to Wendt\u2019s testimony, the circuit court found that the exclusion of Leo\u2019s testimony regarding the phenomenon of false confessions also required the exclusion of Wendt\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">With no other evidence about false confessions, I don\u2019t see how this could be relevant, helpful or do anything other than be misleading. ... What does that do in this case, other than result in misleading evidence, irrelevant evidence, or at least, that probative value would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Defendant sought interlocutory leave to appeal the circuit court\u2019s decision excluding the expert testimony. The Court of Appeals stayed the circuit court proceedings, but ultimately affirmed the circuit court in a split decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals majority agreed with the circuit court that Leo\u2019s testimony would have been unhelpful because it \u201cwould not have involved a proposition that was outside the common knowledge of a layperson.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that the circuit court\u2019s reliability determination was not an abuse of discretion, reasoning that Leo had used subjective determinations of which confessions were false, that his methodology could not be subjected to testing, and that no rate of error could be quantified.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also concluded that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by determining that Wendt\u2019s testimony would not have assisted the trier of fact. The Court of Appeals explained that this testimony related to witness credibility, which is within the sole province of the jury, and that Wendt could not distinguish the characteristics of a person who makes a false confession from the characteristics of a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>makes a true confession.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals agreed with the circuit court that the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the testimony of both witnesses and that their testimony was inadmissible under MRE 403, reasoning that an opinion on the truthfulness of defendant\u2019s confession was implicit in the testimony.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, the Court of Appeals rejected defendant\u2019s claim that the circuit court had violated his constitutional right to present a defense, explaining that \u201cthis right is not absolute: the accused must still comply with established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The Court of Appeals partial dissent would have reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision with respect to Leo\u2019s testimony regarding \u201cthe general fact of false confessions\u201d and with respect to Wendt\u2019s testimony to the extent it could stand independently of Leo\u2019s.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The dissent discussed empirical evidence that jurors \u201cwere commonly skeptical of false confessions\u201d and claimed that the majority made \u201cassumptions ... as to what a layperson may or may not commonly know.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The dissent also concluded that Wendt\u2019s testimony \u201cthat defendant\u2019s personality makes him more susceptible to influence than normal is based on reliable methodologies and is highly relevant to explain his mental state as a circumstance attendant to his confession.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Defendant applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted leave and instructed the parties to address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(1) whether the defendant\u2019s proffered expert testimony regarding the existence of false confessions, and the interrogation techniques and psychological factors that tend to generate false confessions, is admissible under MRE 702; (2) whether the probative value of the proffered expert testimony is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice; and (3) whether the Livingston Circuit Court\u2019s order excluding the defendant\u2019s proffered expert testimony denies the defendant his constitutional right to present a defense.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">II. STANDARD OP REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">This Court reviews for an abuse of discretion a circuit court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion results when a circuit court selects an outcome falling outside the range of principled outcomes.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We review de novo constitutional questions and issues of law underlying evidentiary rulings.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Aih\">A. MRE 702</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">MRE 702 establishes prerequisites for the admission of expert witness testimony.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">If the court determines that scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>ence, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if (1) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">A court considering whether to admit expert testimony under MRE 702 acts as a gatekeeper and has a fundamental duty to ensure that the proffered expert testimony is both relevant and reliable.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The overarching goal is \u201cto make certain that an expert... employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because there are many different kinds of experts and expertise, this inquiry is, by necessity, a flexible one, and a court determining the admissibility of expert testimony may consider reliability factors pertinent to the particular type of expert testimony offered and its connection to the particular facts of the case.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Whatever the pertinent factors may be, however, a court evaluating proposed expert testimony must ensure that the testimony (1) will assist the trier of fact to understand a fact in issue, (2) is provided by an expert qualified in the relevant field of knowledge, and (3) is based on reliable data, principles, and methodologies that are applied reliably to the facts of the case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Although these considerations are separate and distinct and must each be satisfied independently, they are, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>fact, overlapping in nature. For example, \u201c[a]n expert who lacks \u2018knowledge\u2019 in the field at issue cannot \u2018assist the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Likewise, expert testimony without a credible foundation of scientific data, principles, and methodologies is unreliable and, thus, unhelpful to the trier of fact.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, proposed expert testimony must meet all the other requirements of MRE 702 in order to \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">However, the threshold inquiry \u2014 whether the proposed expert testimony will \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\u201d \u2014 is also not satisfied if the proffered testimony is not relevant or does not involve a matter that is beyond the common understanding of the average juror. Interpreting the nearly identical language in the federal counterpart to MRE 702,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court explained that helping the trier of fact to \u201cunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\u201d presents a question of relevance because \u201c \u2018[e]xpert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Similarly, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the average juror does not need the aid of expert interpretation to understand a fact at issue, then the proffered testimony is not admissible because \u201cit merely deals with a proposition that is not beyond the ken of common knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> These considerations of relevancy and the need for expertise are independent of the other requirements of MRE 702. Thus, even proposed expert testimony that is offered by a qualified expert and based on reliable scientific data and methods may be properly excluded if it is not relevant to the facts of the case or is offered for a proposition that does not require the aid of expert interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In this case, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s exclusion of the expert testimony primarily because, in its view, the expert testimony about false confessions \u201cwould not have involved a proposition that was outside the common knowledge of a layperson.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Thus, we first address whether testimony regarding the phenomenon of false confessions is beyond the factfinder\u2019s \u201cken of common knowledge\u201d before proceeding to the lower courts\u2019 application of the additional requirements of MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>B. FALSE-CONFESSION TESTIMONY AND THE \u201cBEYOND COMMON KNOWLEDGE\u201d REQUIREMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As we have explained, whether expert testimony is beyond the ken of common knowledge is a commonsense inquiry that focuses on whether the proposed expert testimony is on a matter that would be commonly understood by the average person.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> If \u201cthe untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute,\u201d then expert testimony is unnecessary.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Although we have not considered whether the aid of expertise may help a juror to understand the occurrence of false confessions, we have allowed experts to explain other human behavior that is contrary to the average person\u2019s commonsense assumptions. In <em>People v Peterson, </em>for example, we observed that victims of child sexual abuse sometimes exhibit behavior, such as delayed reporting of abuse or retraction of accusations, that psychologists understand to be common among abuse victims but that jurors might interpret as being inconsistent with abuse.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We held that if the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>credibility is attacked by highlighting this behavior, then a qualified expert may explain the consistencies between the behavior of that victim and that of other victims of child sexual abuse. We further explained that such testimony was helpful to address \u201cbehavioral traits that may, by their very nature, create confusion in the minds of the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Likewise, in <em>People v Christel, </em>we observed that expert testimony is needed when a \u201cwitnesses] actions or responses are incomprehensible to average people.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Thus, we permitted a prosecution expert to testify about battered woman syndrome and how a victim of domestic violence might \u201cdeny, repress, or minimize the abuse . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We held that this type of testimony was \u201crelevant and helpful when needed to explain a complainant\u2019s actions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The common theme in these cases is that certain groups of people are known to exhibit types of behavior that are contrary to common sense and are not within the average person\u2019s understanding of human behavior. In these instances, an expert\u2019s specialized testimony may enlighten the jury so that it can intelligently evaluate an experience that is otherwise foreign.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">Although we have not recognized that making a purported false confession constitutes behavior contrary .to common sense, the Court of Appeals did so in <em>People v </em>Hamilton.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In that case, the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>charged with felony-murder and other crimes based solely on a confession he had made to the police. The defense theory was that the defendant had not committed the crimes and had falsely confessed. In support, the defendant proffered testimony of a clinical psychologist who would have testified \u201chow defendant\u2019s psychological makeup might have affected his statements to the police.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, citing <em>Crane v Ken</em>tucky,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> recognized that a rational juror does not readily understand why a defendant who is innocent might confess to a crime and that expert testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s psychological makeup might be relevant to a confession\u2019s reliability and credibility. The Court of Appeals, therefore, reversed the lower court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">[E]vidence of the manner in which a confession was obtained may be highly relevant to the confession\u2019s reliability and credibility....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">[The proffered testimony] would help the jury understand the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s statements to the police and how those circumstances affected the reliability and credibility of defendant\u2019s statements. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Such an understanding is central to the jury\u2019s determination of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.[<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We agree with <em>Hamilton </em>that expert testimony bearing on the manner in which a confession is obtained and how a defendant\u2019s psychological makeup may have affected the defendant\u2019s statements is beyond the understanding of the average juror and may be relevant to the reliability and credibility of a confession.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In the instant case, however, the Court of Appeals, like the circuit court, held that the proffered testimony about false confessions \u201cwould not have involved a proposition that was outside the common knowledge of a layperson\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> because the jury could perform its own analysis of defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements. Certainly, we have no disagreement with the premise that issues involving credibility and the weight of the evidence are within the province of the jury. However, the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis wrongly focused on the jury\u2019s role, which is not part of the MRE 702 analysis, rather than on what knowledge the common person possesses and whether the aid of specialized knowledge can help a juror understand a fact at issue. Like the behavior of the child sexual abuse and domestic violence victims in <em>Peterson </em>and <em>Christel, </em>a purported false confession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the sort in <em>Hamilton </em>constitutes counterintuitive behavior that is not within the ordinary person\u2019s common understanding, and thus expert assistance can help jurors understand how and why a defendant might confess falsely.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The exclusion of such expert testimony when it meets all the requirements of our evidentiary rules could, in some instances, hinder the jury in its task because without the enlightenment of expert opinion the jury\u2019s ultimate determination may not be arrived at intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Our conclusion that a confession challenged as false constitutes behavior contrary to common sense finds additional support in a longstanding presumption deeply rooted in our country\u2019s legal system: A person does not ordinarily make untruthful incriminating statements. As the United States Supreme Court explained more than 100 years ago, confessions are given great weight on the basis of the presumption that \u201cone who is innocent will not imperil his safety or prejudice his interests by an untrue statement. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Our \u201cstate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ment against interest\u201d exception to the hearsay rule embodies this presumption and allows the admission of hearsay statements, which are typically considered untrustworthy, if the statement tended to subject the declarant to criminal liability, so \u201cthat a reasonable person .. . would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The premise underlying this hearsay exception is \u201cthe common-sense intuition that a reasonable person would be expected to lie, if at all, only in his own favor, and would not harm himself by his own words.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Despite this well-established, commonsense presumption, embodied in our evidentiary rules, that a person does not make false incriminating statements, both the Court of Appeals and the circuit court simply presumed that the average juror possessed the knowledge to evaluate factors that might lead to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>false confession. This conclusion is not grounded in the necessary commonsense inquiry and lacks any legal basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">Accordingly, we hold that because the claim of a false confession is beyond the common knowledge of the ordinary person, expert testimony about this phenomenon is admissible under MRE 702 when it meets the other requirements of MRE 702. We caution, however, that like other expert testimony explaining counterintuitive behavior, the admissibility of expert testimony pertaining to false confessions is not without limitations. An expert explaining the situational or psychological factors that might lead to a false confession may not \u201ccomment on the . . . truthfulness\u201d of a defendant\u2019s confession,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> \u201cvouch for the veracity\u201d of a defendant recanting a confession,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> or \u201cgive an opinion as to whether defendant was telling the truth when he made the statements to the police.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> These conventional limitations are necessary to guard against the potential for jurors to view the expert \u201cnot only as possessing specialized knowledge in terms of behavioral characteristics generally associated with the class of\u201d defendants subject to police interrogation, but also as \u201cpossessing] some specialized knowledge for discerning the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Given the availability of these conventional limitations, we \u2014 unlike the Court of Appeals, which viewed the expert testimony as tantamount to testimony that defendant\u2019s confession was false \u2014 are less pessimistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>about the circuit court\u2019s management of the proposed testimony and the jury\u2019s capability to properly evaluate and assess the testimony in light of all the evidence submitted at trial.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In this case, the proposed testimony of both experts regarding the phenomenon of false confessions and Wendt\u2019s testimony regarding defendant\u2019s psychological characteristics would explain a proposition that is beyond the ken of common knowledge. Thus, the lower courts erred to the extent that they excluded the evidence solely on the basis that it \u201cmerely deals with a proposition that is not beyond the ken of common knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>C. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OP MRE 702</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Our conclusion in this regard does not end our analysis. We must still consider the other requirements of MRE 702 before determining whether the circuit court\u2019s ultimate conclusion to exclude the proposed testimony amounted to an abuse of discretion. As we have explained, the testimony of Leo and Wendt is admissible under MRE 702 if it meets the other requirements of the evidentiary rule: the \u201cwitness [is] qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\u201d the \u201ctestimony is based on sufficient facts or data,\u201d the \u201ctestimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,\u201d and the \u201cwitness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> When evaluating the reliability of a scientific theory or technique, courts consider certain factors, including but not limited to whether the theory has been or can be tested, whether it has been published and peer-reviewed, its level of general acceptance, and its rate of error if known.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> This analysis requires courts to ensure that \u201ceach aspect of an expert witness\u2019s proffered testimony \u2014 including the data underlying the expert\u2019s theories and the methodology by which the expert draws conclusions from that data \u2014 is reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATF\">Here, the expert testimony consists of two distinct categories: testimony by Leo and Wendt regarding the general phenomenon of false confessions and testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>by Wendt regarding his clinical psychological examination of defendant. We address each category in turn as it relates to the remaining requirements of MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">1. GENERAL TESTIMONY ABOUT FALSE CONFESSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Both Leo and Wendt proposed to offer testimony based on research and literature about the phenomenon of false confessions. Leo proposed to testify that false confessions existed, that certain psychological interrogation techniques commonly employed by the police sometimes resulted in false confessions, and that some of those techniques were used in this case. Wendt proposed to build on this foundation and testify that \u201c[t]he circumstances of [defendant\u2019s] confession were consistent with the literature on false confessions\u201d and that the interaction between defendant and the police \u201cwas consistent with a coerced internalized confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">With regard to Leo, the circuit court followed the mandate of MRE 702 and carefully reviewed all the stages of Leo\u2019s research, starting with his data.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> The circuit court noted that Leo decided whether a confession was false on the basis of information he gathered from sources such as newspaper accounts and attorneys representing the confessors. The circuit court questioned the accuracy and potential bias of these sources and even offered an alternative method of obtaining more authoritative documentation through Freedom of Information Act requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Next, the circuit court identified multiple problems with the analysis Leo applied to his data. Among the circuit court\u2019s observations was that Leo \u201cstarts with the conclusion that the confession is false and then he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>works backwards\u201d to find commonalities. The circuit court concluded that, rather than yielding factors common to all false confessions, Leo\u2019s method seemed to yield only factors common to confessions Leo <em>believed </em>to be false. This also made it impossible to test Leo\u2019s research or compute its rate of error. The circuit court also noted that because Leo did not have a \u201creliable means to have a study group\u201d that excluded extraneous factors, he had \u201cno ability to estimate the frequency of false confessions.\u201d The circuit court found troubling the number of confessions in Leo\u2019s studies that involved factors not present in this case, such as a defendant\u2019s youth or mental incapacity. Finally, the circuit court was troubled by a lack of \u201ca random sample of confessions, true and false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Nothing in the circuit court\u2019s analysis placed the exclusion of Leo\u2019s testimony outside the range of principled outcomes.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The circuit court properly considered all stages of Leo\u2019s analysis and found it unreliable at every stage. With regard to the data underlying Leo\u2019s testimony, the circuit court reasonably determined that its sources were unreliable because they were prone to inaccuracy or bias and, in nearly all instances, had not been subjected to the rigorous standards of scientific peer-review. Additionally, the circuit court raised multiple legitimate concerns about the \u201cmanner in which [Leo] interpreted] and extrapolate[d] from those data.\u201d The unreliable methodology, as the circuit court described, resulted in conclusions consistent with Leo\u2019s own preconceived beliefs rather than testable results consistent with an objective, scientific process. Therefore, because the exclusion of Leo\u2019s testimony was a reasonable and principled outcome, the circuit court\u2019s decision did not amount to an abuse of discretion. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Court of Appeals came to the same conclusion after making similar observations about the data and methods underlying Leo\u2019s studies, and we thus affirm the lower courts\u2019 decisions to exclude Leo\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Further, because the circuit court and Court of Appeals properly excluded Leo\u2019s testimony pertaining to the literature of false confessions, they were also correct to exclude the portion of Wendt\u2019s testimony indicating that defendant\u2019s confession was consistent with this literature.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> This part of Wendt\u2019s testimony obviously relied on the same unreliable foundation that we have rejected with respect to Leo\u2019s testimony. Thus, we cannot conclude that the lower courts committed an abuse of discretion by excluding this portion of Wendt\u2019s testimony and we affirm their decisions to exclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Our decision to uphold the exclusion of the testimony based on false-confession literature is supported by <em>Vent v </em>State,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> in which the Alaska Court of Appeals also upheld the exclusion of testimony by Leo that was very similar to the testimony he offered in the instant case. Like the circuit court here, the <em>Vent </em>court was \u201ctroubled by the fact that there was no way to quantify or test Dr. Leo\u2019s conclusions that certain techniques might lead to false confessions.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The <em>Vent </em>court explained that while some courts allow testimony of this sort, many have held that it is not an abuse of discretion to exclude it.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Ultimately, the <em>Vent </em>court concluded that there was \u201cmerit to [the Alaska superior court\u2019s] questions concerning Dr. Leo\u2019s methodology. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We have reached the same conclusion with regard to both experts\u2019 testimony relating to the literature of false confessions.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> However, this conclusion does not end our inquiry because Wendt\u2019s testimony also encompassed a second category: evidence of his psychological testing of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">2. PSYCHOLOGICAL-TESTING EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Wendt also proposed to testify regarding defendant\u2019s psychological profile, which he constructed from psychological tests and clinical interviews of defendant. The circuit court excluded the entirety of Wendt\u2019s testimony, reasoning that, without the evidence about false confession literature, his testimony on this subject would not assist the trier of fact. This conclusion was based on the erroneous premise that this portion of Wendt\u2019s testimony was somehow dependent on false-confession research for its reliability. The record establishes, however, that this portion of Wendt\u2019s testimony is, in fact, independent of the false-confession literature and was offered to illustrate a separate, but related, point regarding Wendt\u2019s specific study of defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>himself.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Wendt testified at length about the data he had gathered from an array of psychological tests he performed on defendant, his clinical interviews of defendant, and his review of the transcripts of defendant\u2019s interrogation. Wendt also explained the methods he applied to this data, how he compiled a psychological profile, and what opinions he formed from this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">This is exactly the type of expert testimony regarding defendant\u2019s psychological profile that may \u201cassist the trier of fact\u201d within the meaning of MRE 702. Consequently, the circuit court abused its discretion by excluding this testimony on the basis of the absence of testimony about the false-confession literature. Because the circuit court did not apply the remaining MRE 702 factors to this second aspect of Wendt\u2019s testimony, we do not hold that the circuit court is required to admit Wendt\u2019s testimony, only that its basis for excluding Wendt\u2019s testimony amounted to an abuse of discretion. On remand, it remains the circuit court\u2019s duty to fulfill its gatekeeper role under MRE 702 with respect to any proposed expert testimony.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Further, although the circuit court did not complete its analysis under MRE 702, it also opined that Wendt\u2019s testimony was properly excluded under MRE 403. We conclude that the circuit court\u2019s analysis of MRE 403 was similarly faulty. MRE 403 excludes relevant evidence only if \u201cits probative value is substantially out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>weighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> Evidence is unfairly prejudicial when \u201cthere exists a danger that <em>marginally </em>probative evidence will be given undue or preemptive weight by the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> In this case, the circuit court reasoned, \u201cWith no other evidence about false confessions, I don\u2019t see how this could be relevant, helpful or do anything other than be misleading,\u201d and concluded that its \u201cprobative value would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Thus, the circuit court ruled that Wendt\u2019s testimony had no probative value in the absence of the testimony about false-confession literature.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> We have explained that testimony like that Wendt proposed to offer can provide guidance to a fact-finder regarding behavior that would seem counterintuitive to a juror. Accordingly, and if the proposed testimony otherwise meets the requirements of MRE 702, the circuit court must consider this benefit in assessing the probative value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the testimony. Because it failed to weigh Wendt\u2019s testimony on the probative side of the analysis, the circuit court abused its discretion by excluding the evidence under MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Again, we do not hold that the circuit court is required to admit this portion of Wendt\u2019s testimony, just that it misapplied MRE 403 in excluding the testimony. However, in applying MRE 403 on remand, the circuit court must also consider whether the limits that this Court imposes on expert testimony of this nature and the possibility of a limiting jury instruction reduce the danger of any unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the portions of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and the circuit court order excluding the expert testimony regarding Wendt\u2019s psychological testing of defendant. On remand, the circuit court must consider whether this testimony meets the requirements of MRE 702 and MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">D. RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Finally, defendant claims that, to the extent <em>any </em>of the proposed expert testimony is excluded, the exclusion violates his right to present a defense. Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>defendants have a constitutional right to \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that a criminal defendant has the right \u201cto have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\u201d This right has been incorporated to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of the United States has held: \u201cThe right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The right to present a defense limits the otherwise broad latitude of states to establish rules that exclude evidence from criminal trials.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> When rules \u201cinfring[e] upon a weighty interest of the accused\u201d and are \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cdisproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve,\u201d they must yield to the constitutional right.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> However, while the right to present a defense is a fundamental part of due process, \u201cit is not an absolute right,\u201d and \u201c[t]he accused must still comply with \u2018established rules of procedure and evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability in the ascertainment of guilt and innocence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We must therefore determine whether the exclusion of the expert testimony at issue denies defendant his constitutional right to present a defense. To do so, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>consider the purpose MRE 702 is designed to serve. The purpose of nearly identical FRE 702 is to \u201censure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> In discussing FRE 702, the United States Supreme Court has explained that the inquiry is a \u201cflexible one\u201d and that \u201c [i]ts overarching subject is the scientific validity\u201d of the proposed testimony.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> The same can be said of MRE 702.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Ultimately, courts are vested with the gatekeeping authority to apply MRE 702 on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The <em>lack </em>of such discretion is what has most often prompted the United States Supreme Court to strike down evidentiary rules as violative of the Sixth Amendment. In <em>Rock v Arkansas, </em>for example, the Court considered a categorical rule prohibiting the consideration of a hypnotically refreshed memory.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The Court struck down the rule because it \u201cleaves a trial judge no discretion to admit this testimony, even if the judge is persuaded of its reliability by testimony at a pretrial hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> In contrast, every proper application of MRE 702 requires a careful consideration of the reliability of the proffered evidence. The very act of conducting a <em>Daubert </em>hearing establishes that a circuit court\u2019s gatekeeping role under MRE 702 is neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201cdisproportionate to the ends [it is] asserted to promote\u201d because \u201cthe Constitution permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>judges to exclude evidence that is .. . only marginally relevant or poses an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the issues\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> and evidence that fails to meet the requirements of MRE 702 will <em>always </em>be only marginally relevant or risk confusing the trier of fact.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold the proper application of MRE 702 in this case to exclude Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony and the portion of Dr. Wendt\u2019s testimony that would rely on false confession research does not deny defendant his constitutional right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">IV RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The dissenting justice\u2019s principal disagreement with our decision stems from our view that the phenomenon of false confessions is beyond the average person\u2019s common knowledge. The dissent, however, does not dispute that the \u201cstatement against interest\u201d exception to the hearsay rule embodies the presumption that a person does not ordinarily make untruthful incriminating statements, which is a strong indicator that the circumstances of a false confession are beyond the average person\u2019s understanding. Still, the dissent dismisses the significance of the fact that this presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>is embodied in our rules of evidence as well as the significance of our caselaw recognizing that the aid of expertise can help jurors understand similarly counter-intuitive behavior.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The dissent also does not dispute that our caselaw indeed permits expert testimony to explain counterintuitive behavior. Instead, the dissent insists that the average person is capable of understanding why a person might falsely confess to a crime and under what circumstances. This argument is unconvincing in part because it relies not on any established legal principles of our jurisprudence but, for the most part, on a law review article authored by a law student and on the concededly unreliable testimony of Leo.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Having posited that jurors can, in fact, understand without the aid of expertise why a person might falsely confess, the dissent supports this view with a list of our holding\u2019s supposed ill effects. But the dissent\u2019s fears that our decision will cause jurors to subordinate their judgment to the \u201cfalse appearance of expertise,\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> \u201copen up the floodgates for expert testimony,\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> and turn criminal trials into \u201cbattles of psychological experts\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> are simply unfounded. Our holding is limited to the principle that a claim of a false confession is beyond the common knowledge of the ordinary person and that expert testimony regarding this phenomenon is admissible under MRE 702 only if it meets the other requirements of MRE 702. Thus, far from the dissent\u2019s interpretation of our decision, we have not created a rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>allowing the admission of faux expert testimony regarding false confessions. Rather, a defendant proffering expert testimony on the phenomenon of false confessions must meet all the requirements not only of MRE 702, but also of MRE 403 before the testimony could be admitted. Thus, the ramifications the dissent fears \u2014 the \u201croutine\u201d use of experts by both the defense and the prosecution, and prolonged and more costly proceedings \u2014 are exaggerated. And while there may be some lengthening of the trial process in those few cases in which expert testimony regarding false confessions is admitted, the result is not \u201cgamesmanship\u201d \u201cfor no good reason,\u201d but an aid in the furtherance of a criminal trial\u2019s \u201cprincipal mission, the search for the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>94</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Further, the dissent lists several types of behavior that it believes could be subject to expert testimony as a result of our decision. However, that concern is not supported by today\u2019s holding. We agree with the dissent that questions of eyewitness identification, fading memories, witnesses\u2019 body language, and the like involve obvious human behavior from which jurors can make \u201ccommonsense credibility determinations.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> None of this behavior is recognized in our law as having special indicia of reliability. A statement against penal interest, on the other hand, is presupposed to be trustworthy and credible, which is precisely why an alleged false confession is a counterintuitive behavior that may, like other counterintuitive behavior recognized by our caselaw, require the aid of expertise to explain. The legal principles that <em>are </em>the foundation of our holding do not also support the need for expert testimony to explain the common human behavior described by the dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>v CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We affirm the exclusion of Leo\u2019s testimony and the portion of Wendt\u2019s testimony based on false-confession research because the circuit court\u2019s determination that it was not reliable under MRE 702 was not an abuse of discretion and its exclusion does not violate defendant\u2019s right to present a defense.

Thus, I agree that the lower courts erred in excluding the expert testimony to the extent that they concluded otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">I believe that appellate review of whether a trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence resulted in an abuse of discretion requires an examination of the importance of the testimony to a defendant\u2019s theory of defense. See <em>People v Barrera, </em>451 Mich 261, 269; 547 NW2d 280 (1996). At this juncture and under this Court\u2019s current evidentiary rule, however, I find that the issue presented in this case raises a close evidentiary question regarding Dr. Richard Leo\u2019s proposed testimony. Thus, I agree with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding as unreliable Leo\u2019s testimony as it pertains to police-interrogation techniques. <em>People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298, 322; 319 NW2d 518 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">And although I find persuasive the principles espoused by the Court of Appeals partial dissent as it relates to Dr. Jeffrey Wendt, <em>People v Kowalski, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued August 26, 2010 (Docket No. 294054) (DAVIS J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I agree with this Court\u2019s conclusion that it is prudent to remand this case to the trial court to consider the admissibility of Wendt\u2019s testimony in the first instance, in light of the trial court\u2019s failure to consider Wendt\u2019s testimony independently of Leo\u2019s testimony.

When the accuracy of a potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>conviction rests in large part on the accuracy of a confession, I believe that a trial court should give due consideration to the importance of a defense theory that seeks to undermine the accuracy of the confession.</p>\n<judges id=\"b210-4\">Marilyn Kelly and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b210-5\">MARKMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbD\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I agree with the lead opinion that (a) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that Dr. Richard Leo\u2019s proffered expert testimony regarding the existence of false confessions and the interrogation techniques claimed to generate them is unreliable and thus inadmissible under MRE 702, (b) for the same reason, to the extent that Dr. Jeffrey Wendt\u2019s proffered testimony relied on Leo\u2019s false confession testimony, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this testimony, and (c) the exclusion of this testimony did not violate defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense. However, I respectfully disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusions that (a) expert testimony regarding the existence of false confessions, even if reliable, is admissible under MRE 702 because it is beyond the common knowledge of the average juror and (b) Wendt\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s psychological characteristics, even if reliable, is relevant and thus admissible under MRE 702. Instead, I conclude that (a) expert testimony regarding the existence of false confessions is not beyond the common knowledge of the average juror and thus is inadmissible under MRE 702 and (b) Wendt\u2019s testimony concerning defendant\u2019s psychological characteristics is irrelevant because, as Wendt himself admits, none of these characteristics make it \u201cmore probable or less probable,\u201d MRE 401, that defendant\u2019s confession was either true or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>false, and thus his testimony is also inadmissible under MRE 702. In other words, I conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Leo\u2019s and Wendt\u2019s proffered testimony. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I. SUMMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The issue in this case is not whether defendants may sometimes falsely confess. Indeed, it is precisely because this possibility is so obvious that it can hardly be said to be \u201cbeyond the common knowledge of the average juror\u201d and thus an appropriate subject of \u201cexpert\u201d testimony under the law. Moreover, there is nothing offered in this case by the asserted \u201cexperts\u201d on false confessions that would afford jurors any actual assistance in determining whether <em>defendant\u2019s </em>confession was, in fact, false. The police interrogation techniques Leo identified as being associated with <em>false confessions </em>were acknowledged by Leo as also being associated with <em>true confessions, </em>and the psychological traits Wendt identified as evidence of a possible <em>false confessor </em>were acknowledged by Wendt as also being traits that might be possessed by <em>nonfalse </em>confessors. Thus, neither expert\u2019s proposed testimony is relevant in any way to the jury in deciding whether <em>defendant </em>was a false confessor or a nonfalse confessor. It is hard to think of a function more central to the traditional jury role than to ascertain the credibility of ordinary witnesses and other persons. To introduce into the jury process \u201cexpert\u201d witnesses who will testify that persons will sometimes falsely confess is to belabor the obvious and create the illusion that there is some \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d that will assist the jury in carrying out its core responsibility of determining credibility. Thus, the introduction of \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>perts\u201d into the realm of the mundane does not merely risk <em>distracting </em>the jury, but risks the prospect of jurors increasingly <em>subordinating </em>their own commonsense judgments \u2014 precisely the kind of judgments that form the rationale for the jury system in the first place \u2014 to the false <em>appearance </em>of expertise suggested by the presence of expert psychological testimony. The criminal trial of the near future in Michigan, one being nudged forward by today\u2019s decision, is one in which: (a) increasing numbers of criminal defendants will as a matter of routine employ \u201cexpert\u201d witnesses to attempt to dispel the trustworthiness of their confessions, (b) increasing numbers of criminal defendants will be encouraged not to testify on their own behalf that they falsely confessed, preferring to let the jury infer this same conclusion from the testimony of \u201cexperts,\u201d (c) prosecutors will be increasingly incentivized to respond to testimony by defendants\u2019 \u201cexperts\u201d that <em>false </em>confessions sometimes occur with testimony by their own \u201cexperts\u201d that <em>truthful </em>confessions sometimes also occur and that, in fact, truthful confessions tend to occur more often than false confessions, with defendants\u2019 \u201cexperts\u201d then responding that, while that may all be true, false confessions nonetheless occur more often than acknowledged by the prosecutors\u2019 \u201cexperts,\u201d (d) ordinary issues of credibility traditionally resolved by juries through the exercise of their own common sense, judgment, and experience will increasingly become the subject of battling contingents of \u201cexperts,\u201d and (e) increasingly frequent and distracting courtroom debates will take place concerning other unremarkable propositions of human behavior such as that memories fade over time, police officers sometimes testify falsely, and persons who do not look others in the eye may sometimes be testifying dishonestly. As a result, and for no good reason, the criminal trial of the near future will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>be slightly more prolonged, slightly more costly for all parties, and ever slightly more open to the kind of gamesmanship that distracts the criminal trial from its principal mission, the search for the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. <em>Edry v Adelman, </em>486 Mich 634, 639; 786 NW2d 567 (2010).

TESTIMONY OF DR. LEO</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">I do not believe that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Leo\u2019s testimony pursuant to MRE 702. For the reasons explained by the lead opinion, I agree that Leo\u2019s proposed testimony was not the product of reliable principles and methods and thus is inadmissible on this basis alone. However, I disagree with the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that had Leo\u2019s testimony been the product of reliable principles and methods, it <em>would </em>have been admissible.

However, this is not a proposition that is outside the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the average juror. Jurors, as ordinary members of the community with ordinary measures of judgment, common sense, experience, and personal insight, understand that people sometimes falsely confess, although jurors also understand that false confessions are far from the norm. Defendant argues that jurors have a tendency to believe that people will not confess to a crime that they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>commit. Quite likely, defendant is correct. However, this asserted tendency is not inconsistent with Leo\u2019s <em>own </em>testimony at the <em>Daubert </em>hearing. Leo testified that most jurors assume that if the defendant confessed he is \u201cprobably guilty,\u201d but Leo also acknowledged that \u201cmost confessions are true\u201d and that \u201cfalse confessions are the exception.\u201d Therefore, as long as the prosecutor does not argue that people <em>never </em>falsely confess, which he has not argued here, Leo\u2019s proposed testimony that false confessions are possible offers absolutely nothing of relevance to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u201c[T]here is no need for expert testimony that tells the jury what it already knows.\u201d Comment, <em>The (in)admissibility of false confession expert </em>testimony, 26 Touro L R 23, 58 (2010). \u201cAs it stands, most jurors have a nuanced understanding that false confessions occur, but only rarely.

However, Dr. Leo\u2019s testimony would not have involved a proposition that was outside the common knowledge of a layperson. <em>Gilbert, </em>470 Mich at 790. Dr. Leo acknowledged that the same interrogation techniques that he determined led to false confessions could also lead to true confessions. He could not identify any unique correlation between certain police interrogation tactics and false confessions. Dr. Leo explained that the reliability of a confession is determined by considering whether aspects of the confession fit with the evidence in the case. Nothing in the record here indicates that a juror cannot perform this same analysis without the assistance of expert testimony. Further, the police interrogation of defendant was recorded and the jury will be able to review the recordings at trial. Additionally, the police officers will be subject to cross-examination with respect to their specialized training in the art of interrogation and techniques they may use to pressure a defendant into confessing to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>crime. The jury will be able to consider the manner in which defendant\u2019s confession was elicited, and the way in which his statements progressed during the course of the interrogation, and it will be able to weigh the interrogation and confession with the remainder of the evidence introduced at trial and make a determination as to the credibility of the confession. No expert testimony is needed to assist the jury in this process. See <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508, 514-515; 489 NW2d 748 (1992), amended 441 Mich 1201 (1992) (issues involving credibility are within the sole province of the jury). <em>[People v Kowalski, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued August 26, 2010 (Docket No. 294054), pp 3-4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">As even the concurring/dissenting Court of Appeals judge explained, Leo\u2019s \u201cconclusion that certain police interrogation techniques are associated with false confessions ... is useless\u201d because \u201c[t]he police interrogation techniques Dr. Leo associated with false confessions are also associated with true ones and partially true ones, and there is no known difference in rates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (DAVIS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \u201c[A]ll Dr. Leo can tell us is that police interrogation techniques are associated with <em>confessions,\u201d </em>and \u201c[t]his association will not assist the jury[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in the original).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Because Leo admitted that the same interrogation techniques that result in false confessions may also result in true confessions, his proposed testimony concerning interrogation techniques will not \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\u201d and thus it is inadmissible under MRE 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>B. TESTIMONY OF DR. WENDT</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Wendt proposed to testify that defendant possesses some psychological traits that can lead to false confessions. However, given that he admitted that these same psychological traits can also lead to true confessions, this testimony is equally irrelevant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Informing the jury, for example, that defendant is an \u201canxious\u201d person, and that anxious people sometimes falsely confess, and also sometimes truthfully confess, does little to advance the jury\u2019s thinking. The jury\u2019s responsibility is to determine whether a confession is true or false, and unless an expert has something to offer the jury in this regard that will make it more or less likely that the confession is either true or false, the expert\u2019s testimony is irrelevant. See MRE 401 (\u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">As the Court of Appeals correctly explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">Dr. Wendt admitted that the same personality traits that correlate with false confessions can also lead to true confessions. Dr. Wendt could not identify a specific psychological factor that distinguishes a person who makes a false confession from one who makes a true confession. Thus, his testimony would have been of no help to the jury because the jury would have still been required to weigh defendant\u2019s confession against the other evidence in the case to determine whether it was credible. <em>[Kowalski, </em>unpub op at 5.][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>C. MRE 403</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">Even assuming for the sake of argument that Leo\u2019s and Wendt\u2019s testimony is relevant and reliable, I believe that its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . MRE 403. \u201cEvidence is unfairly prejudicial when there exists a danger that marginally probative evidence will be given undue or preemptive weight by the jury.\u201d <em>People v Crawford, </em>458 Mich 376, 398; 582 NW2d 785 (1998). As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">\u201cExpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 of the present rules exercises more control over experts than over lay witnesses.\u201d <em>[Daubert, </em>509 US at 595, quoting Weinstein, <em>Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence is Sound; It Should Not Be Amended, </em>138 FRD 631, 632 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">For the reasons explained earlier, I do not believe that the testimony at issue here is even \u201cmarginally probative evidence,\u201d but even if it were, there would be a considerable risk that the jury would accord undue weight to the experts\u2019 testimony. \u201cSince experts base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>their testimony on science, jurors tend to find the testimony more convincing, and therefore the risk of misleading and confusing them increases.\u201d Comment, 26 Touro L R at 37. \u201c \u2018[Qjuestions of credibility, whether of a witness or of a confession, are for the jury,\u2019 \u201d <em>Crane v Kentucky, </em>476 US 683, 688; 106 S Ct 2142; 90 L Ed 2d 636 (1986) (citation omitted), but the admission of expert testimony on the subject of false confessions, or on other subjects that are within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of jurors and that pertain to credibility, have the potential to undermine the jury\u2019s role in this regard. \u201cIndeed, as we have cautioned before, the jury in these credibility contests is looking \u2018to hang its hat\u2019 on the testimony of witnesses it views as impartial,\u201d <em>People v Peterson, </em>450 Mich 349, 376; 537 NW2d 857 (1995), and it may easily come to perceive the testimony of the expert as supplying a shortcut for resolving credibility disputes between witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In the instant case, defendant will be arguing that the confession is false,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the prosecutor will be arguing that the confession is true, and the experts\u2019 testimony concerning false confessions, if admitted, would be viewed by the jury as testimony from people who study false confessions for a living, in support of defendant\u2019s position that the confession is false. Even though the experts will not be allowed to expressly testify that they believe that defendant falsely confessed, the jury will be led to believe that the experts know more than they are telling, because the jury will almost certainly infer that the experts must believe that defendant\u2019s confession is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>false or else they would not be testifying on his behalf. See <em>Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 391 (CAVANAGH, J., dissenting). The danger that the jury will be misled by the experts\u2019 testimony to believe that the interrogation techniques used by the police, in conjunction with defendant\u2019s personality traits, must have resulted in a false confession is substantial, and thus the risk that the jury\u2019s role in making credibility determinations will be undermined is also substantial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">As a plurality of the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>United States v Scheffer, </em>523 US 303, 313-314; 118 S Ct 1261; 140 L Ed 2d 413 (1998), regarding polygraph evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">A fundamental premise of our criminal trial system is that \u201cthe <em>jury </em>is the lie detector.\u201d Determining the weight and credibility of witness testimony, therefore, has long been held to be the \u201cpart of every case [that] belongs to the jury, who are presumed to be fitted for it by their natural intelligence and their practical knowledge of men and the ways of men.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">By its very nature, polygraph evidence may diminish the jury\u2019s role in making credibility determinations. The common form of polygraph test measures a variety of physiological responses to a set of questions asked by the examiner, who then interprets these physiological correlates of anxiety and offers an opinion to the jury about whether the witness \u2014 often, as in this case, the accused\u2014 was deceptive in answering questions about the very matters at issue in the trial. Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors\u2019 knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion, in addition to its own, about whether the witness was telling the truth. Jurisdictions, in promulgating rules of evidence, may legitimately be concerned about the risk that juries will give excessive weight to the opinions of a polygrapher, clothed as they are in scientific expertise and at times offering, as in respondent\u2019s case, a conclusion about the ultimate issue in the trial. Such jurisdictions may legitimately determine that the aura of infallibility attending polygraph evidence can lead jurors to abandon their duty to assess credibility and guilt. [Citations omitted; emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Similarly, expert testimony concerning false confessions may diminish the jury\u2019s role in making credibility determinations. Jurors may give excessive weight to this testimony and abandon or subordinate their own primary duties to assess credibility and guilt. \u201c[T]he testimony would .. . convert the expert witness into a human lie detector,\u201d and \u201c[cjourts should be as wary of admitting human lie detectors as they are of admitting the results of a polygraph test.\u201d Comment, 26 Touro L R at 57-58. \u201cOur criminal justice system is founded on the belief that juries can understand when statements might be unreliable, and admitting expert testimony on false confessions upends this fundamental pillar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74.

This would interfere with the jury\u2019s role in determining the credibility and weight of the confession. Thus, there was a significant danger of unfair prejudice with respect to the proposed testimony; and, as discussed above, neither of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony had high probative value. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that MRE 403 was an additional basis on which to exclude the proffered expert testimony. <em>[Kowalski, </em>unpub op at 5.][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>D. LEAD OPINION CASELAW</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The lead opinion relies on <em>Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 352-353, which held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">(1) an expert may testify in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief regarding typical and relevant symptoms of child sexual abuse for the sole purpose of explaining a victim\u2019s specific behavior that might be incorrectly construed by the jury as inconsistent with that of an actual abuse victim, and (2) an expert may testify with regard to the consistencies between the behavior of the particular victim and other victims of child sexual abuse to rebut an attack on the victim\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Justice CAVANAGH, joined by Justice LEVIN, dissented and explained that he would have \u201ccontinue[d] to limit the use of behavioral reaction testimony to rebuttal purposes\u201d and \u201cpreclude[d] an expert. .. from making any reference to the particular complainant or defendant\u201d because \u201c[t]he marginal probative value of allowing the expert to further testify with respect to the particular complainant is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice that the jury will misuse the testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381-382, 391.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The lead opinion also relies on <em>People v Christel, </em>449 Mich 578, 580, 592; 537 NW2d 194 (1995), which held that \u201cbattered woman syndrome testimony is relevant and helpful [and thus admissible] when needed to explain a complainant\u2019s actions, such as prolonged endurance of physical abuse accompanied by attempts at hiding or minimizing the abuse, delays in reporting the abuse, or recanting allegations of abuse\u201d because \u201cexpert testimony is needed when a witness\u2019 actions or responses are incomprehensible to average people.\u201d Justice CAVANAGH, again joined by Justice LEVIN, concurred in part and dissented in part. He would have \u201climit[ed] the use of the battered woman syndrome evidence to the narrow purpose of rebutting an inference that the complainant\u2019s postincident behavior is inconsistent with that expected of rape victims\u201d and would not have \u201callow[ed] an expert witness to testify with respect to the complainant\u2019s behavior in the particular case\u201d because \u201cthe marginal probative value of allowing testimony with respect to the specific complainant\u2019s behavior is substantially outweighed by the unfairly prejudicial danger that the jury may conclude that the expert, in fact, knows that the complainant has been a battered individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601-602.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">I agree with the lower courts that <em>Peterson </em>and <em>Christel </em>are fully distinguishable. First, they were decided before this Court amended MRE 702 to conform to <em>Daubert, </em>so the trial court\u2019s gatekeeper role was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>different than it is now. Under the <em>pre-Daubert </em>version of MRE 702, the trial court\u2019s sole function was to determine whether the expert\u2019s testimony was \u201cgenerally accepted within the scientific community.\u201d <em>Craig v Oakwood Hosp, </em>471 Mich 67, 80; 684 NW2d 296 (2004). The trial court\u2019s gatekeeping function is much broader under the current version of MRE 702. \u201cRule 702 . . . assign[s] to the trial judge the task of ensuring that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 US at 597; see also <em>Kumho, </em>526 US at 152 (\u201cThe objective of [Daubert\u2019s gatekeeping requirement] is to ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony.\u201d); <em>Allison v McGhan Med Corp, </em>184 F3d 1300, 1310 (CA 11, 1999) (\u201c[W]hile Rules 401 and 402 reflect the general policy of the Federal Rules for liberal admission of evidence, Rule 403, working in conjunction with Rules 702 and 703, militates against this general policy by giving courts discretion to preclude expert testimony unless it passes more stringent standards of reliability and relevance. These stricter standards are necessary because of the potential impact on the jury of expert testimony.\u201d). Furthermore, although it is common knowledge that sometimes people falsely confess, knowledge of how a sexually abused child or a battered woman may react to the abuse may not be so common. While it is one thing for this Court to hold that psychological expert testimony may be necessary in extraordinary and narrow circumstances involving a sexually abused child or a battered woman \u2014 in which it is the remarkable sense of dependency of the victims on those who have abused them that may explain their conduct \u2014 it is quite another to extend this proposition, as the lead opinion does, to commonplace circumstances in which a competent person has confessed to committing a crime. An ordinary juror may well lack the life\u2019s experience to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>comprehend what is entailed in the extraordinary relationships of the sexually abused child and the battered woman, but deciding ordinary questions of witness credibility lies at the heart of the juror\u2019s responsibility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The lead opinion also relies heavily on <em>People v Hamilton, </em>163 Mich App 661; 415 NW2d 653 (1987), which held that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding expert testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s psychological makeup because the jury should have been able to use this evidence to assess the defendant\u2019s credibility. First, this case too was decided before MRE 702 was amended to adopt <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>standards. Second, <em>Hamilton </em>did not address at all whether the probative value of the proposed testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under MRE 403. Furthermore, the defendant in <em>Hamilton </em>was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>16-year-old child when he committed the offenses and, although he was 22 years old when he confessed, he was operating psychologically at the level of a 15-year-old. <em>Hamilton </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because <em>Hamilton </em>involved a child with a disability, while the instant case involves an adult with no disability. Therefore, it is not necessary for this Court in this case to determine whether <em>Hamilton </em>was correctly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">E. PRINCIPAL CONCERN</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">My principal concern with the lead opinion pertains to its holding that expert testimony concerning false confessions, if reliable, is admissible because it is beyond the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the average juror. I disagree with this assertion and am concerned that such a holding has the potential to open up the floodgates for expert testimony on a host of reasonably obvious matters of human behavior that have never been generally thought to require expert testimony. As a result, criminal trials will be increasingly converted into battles of psychological experts. See <em>State v Sabetta, </em>680 A2d 927, 933 (RI, 1996) (\u201c[T]o introduce the expert testimony of a psychologist concerning the unreliability of eyewitness memory. . . would effectively invade the province of the jury and . . . open a floodgate whereby experts would testify on every conceivable aspect of a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">What other reasonably obvious matters of human behavior are beyond the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the average juror, and may therefore necessitate expert testimony? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that it is possible for a witness to inadvertently testify inaccurately or for a witness to deliberately testify falsely? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that some parts of a witness\u2019s testimony may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>be true, while others may be false? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that eyewitness recollections may differ, although each eyewitness is testifying honestly? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that sometimes police officers testify falsely and sometimes convicted felons testify truthfully? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that it is possible for an eyewitness to misidentify a person? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that memories fade over time? Is it within the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d of the juror that particular forms of body language may sometimes evidence honesty or dishonesty? Should we or should we not require expert testimony regarding each of these matters? If not, why not and, if so, what exactly should be left for the jury to decide on its own?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Until today, \u201csuch normal human processes were held to be within the knowledge and experience of the jury, the triers of fact, thus requiring no expert opinion to clarify or inform their rational decision-making roles.\u201d Clifford, <em>Expert Testimony, </em>in Towl &amp; Crighton, eds, <em>Forensic Psychology </em>(Chichester: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2010), ch 4, p 47. After today, however, will criminal trials increasingly become a battle of psychologists? Although a battle of psychologists may well be useful in contexts beyond the ken of the ordinary juror, it seems considerably less useful in the context of making commonsense credibility determinations\u2014 exactly the type of determinations that we have always before entrusted to the jury. See <em>United States v Alexander, </em>816 F2d 164, 169 (CA 5, 1987) (\u201cRequiring the admission of the expert testimony proffered . . . would have established a rule that experts testifying generally as to the value of eyewitness testimony would have to be allowed to testify in every case in which eyewitness testimony is relevant. This would constitute a gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>overburdening of the trial process by testimony about matters which juries have always been deemed competent to evaluate.\u201d). Indeed, making such commonsense credibility determinations has always been at the heart of the jury\u2019s role within our criminal justice system, and this core responsibility should not, in my judgment, be supplanted by a growing role for psychological expert testimony.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Because I agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the expert witness testimony, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The lead opinion contends that its conclusion that the fact that someone might falsely confess is \u201ccontrary to common sense\u201d is supported by \u201c[o]ur \u2018statement against interest\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule [which] embodies [the] presumption. . . \u2018that a reasonable person ... would not have made [such a] statement unless believing it to be true.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 127-128, quoting MRE 804(b)(3). However, what the lead opinion wholly fails to recognize is that Leo does not dispute that people generally do not falsely confess. Leo knows this, and jurors know this. Leo and jurors also know that there are exceptions to this general presumption and that people sometimes do falsely confess. There is absolutely nothing inconsistent between the notions that people generally do not falsely confess and that people sometimes do falsely confess and I do not believe that either of these notions lies outside the common knowledge of jurors. See <em>State v Free, </em>351 NJ Super 203, 220; 798 A2d 83 (2002) (citation omitted) (\u201cAlthough our rules of evidence recognize that people do not usually make statements against their penal interest unless they are true, it does not follow that ordinary jurors believe that all confessions made by defendants subjected to police interrogation are true.\u201d); see also Comment, 26 Touro L R at 53 (\u201cThat false confessions occur is a matter of fact; however, it is also true that false confessions are rare.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> For example, Leo testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">[P]olice using coercive techniques sometimes results in true confessions, sometimes results in false confessions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The coercive, problematic techniques that might, when applied to an innocent person, lead to a false confession, but when applied to a guilty person, lead to a true or a partially true confession.

If that were the case, a limiting instruction would be able to cure all concerns relating to the probative value of evidence being \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\u201d and MRE 403 would be rendered meaningless. That is, if it were sufficient to simply instruct the jury not to allow evidence\u2019s \u201cprobative value [to he] substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>outweighed hy the danger of unfair prejudice,\u201d there would be no point in having a court rule that specifically provides that \u201cevidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice .. ..\u201d MRE 403. The lead opinion\u2019s other \u201csafeguard\u201d of not allowing the expert to expressly state that the defendant falsely confessed also does little to alleviate concerns about misleading the jury. When a jury is confronted with expert testimony that certain interrogation techniques may result in false confessions paired with testimony that the defendant himself was subject to these interrogation techniques, the invited inference will be just as misleading as expert testimony stating outright the conclusion that the defendant falsely confessed.

It invites the jury to give undue weight'to testimony that is foundationally and fundamentally unreliable merely because it is cloaked with the expertise of an expert. It also invites the jury to believe that the expert knows more than he is telling, by letting the jurors infer that the expert, who works with sexually abused children every day, must believe this child\u2019s story or else the expert would not be testifying. <em>[Peterson, </em>450 Mich at 391 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b229-7\"> The lead opinion contends that I \u201cunreasonably assume[] that the ordinary juror has the \u2018life\u2019s experience to comprehend\u2019 the circumstances of police interrogation . . . and the effect of a defendant\u2019s particular psychological traits on the outcome of the interrogation.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 127 n 48 (citation omitted). However, the lead opinion fails to explain how Leo\u2019s proposed testimony that the same police interrogation techniques that cause false confessions also cause true confessions or Wendt\u2019s proposed testimony that the same psychological traits that cause false confessions also cause true confessions will in any way help the jury decide whether the \u201ccircumstances of police interrogation\u201d or defendant\u2019s \u201cparticular psychological traits\u201d caused him to truthfully or falsely confess. Furthermore, as the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[T]he police interrogation of defendant was recorded and the jury will be able to review the recordings at trial. Additionally, the police officers will be subject to cross-examination with respect to their specialized training in the art of interrogation and techniques they may use to pressure a defendant into confessing to a crime. The jury will be able to consider the manner in which defendant\u2019s confession was elicited, and the way in which his statements progressed during the course of the interrogation, and it will be able to weigh the interrogation and confession with the remainder of the evidence introduced at trial and make a determination as to the credibility of the confession. <em>[Kowalski, </em>unpub op at 4.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\"> The lead opinion contends that I have \u201cexaggerated\u201d its ramifications because its \u201cholding is limited to the principle that a claim of a false confession is beyond the common knowledge of the ordinary person ... .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 142-143.
