The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the ordinance is unconstitutional under <em>City of Houston, Texas v Hill, </em>482 US 451; 107 S Ct 2502; 96 L Ed 2d 398 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we agree with the circuit court\u2019s analysis and conclude that the language in the ordinance making it an offense to \u201cdisrupt the normal activity\u201d of a protected person is facially overbroad, as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hill, </em>we reverse the portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment pertaining to the constitutionality of MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05, and we reinstate the circuit court\u2019s decision with regard to this issue to the extent that the circuit court held that the quoted language is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Also at issue is whether MCR 7.101(0) provides for taxation of costs in criminal cases. The Court of Appeals held that costs may not be assessed under MCR 7.101(0) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in criminal matters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the Court of Appeals and, therefore, affirm that portion of its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">This case arises from a parking citation that defendant received when his car was parked in an MSU parking structure. On the day the citation was issued, MSU parking enforcement employee Ricardo Rego was working on campus. Defendant confronted Rego and asked if Rego was the one who had issued the citation. Defendant was shouting, which led Rego to believe that defendant was acting aggressively. Rego got into his service vehicle and called the campus police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Approximately 10 to 15 minutes passed before the police arrived. During that time, Rego sat in his service vehicle and completed the process for having an adjacent vehicle towed, while defendant stood outside the service vehicle and took pictures of Rego with a camera phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Defendant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of violating MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A district court jury convicted defendant of violating the ordinance. On appeal, the circuit court reversed the conviction on the basis that the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The circuit court also granted defendant\u2019s motion brought pursuant to MCR 7.101(0) to tax costs against the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision and held that the ordinance is not facially overbroad, and defendant is not entitled to costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal and asked the parties to address \u201c(1) whether Michigan State University Ordinance 15.05 is facially unconstitutional under <em>City of Houston v Hill, </em>482 US 451 (1987), and (2) whether MCR 7.101(0) allows taxation of costs in criminal cases appealed in the circuit court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">This Court reviews de novo questions of constitutional law.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court presumes that ordinances are constitutional, and the party challenging the validity of the ordinance has the burden of proving a constitutional violation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We first address whether MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 is facially unconstitutional.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When considering a \u201cfacial\u201d challenge to the breadth of a law on First Amendment grounds,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> this Court considers \u201cnot merely the spo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>radie abuse of power by the censor but the pervasive threat inherent in its very existence that constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Before ruling that a law is unconstitutionally over-broad, this Court must determine whether the law \u201creaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has held that criminal statutes must be scrutinized with particular care,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and those that prohibit a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may be facially overbroad even if they have a legitimate application.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, \u201cinvalidating a law that in some of its applications is perfectly constitutional \u2014 particularly a law directed at conduct so antisocial that it has been made criminal \u2014 has obvious harmful effects.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, a statute\u2019s overbreadth must \u201cbe <em>substantial, </em>not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">In <em>Hill, </em>the United State Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of an ordinance that made it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>unlawful to \u201cin any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt\u201d a police officer.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court concluded at the outset that this language prohibited verbal interruptions and, therefore, implicated constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court first noted that the ordinance was not limited in any way to fighting words or obscene language.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, the ordinance imposed a blanket prohibition on speech that interrupts an officer in any manner.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Expressly clarifying that the Constitution prohibits making such speech a crime, the Court explained that \u201c[t]he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While the Court acknowledged the difficulty of drafting precise laws, it reiterated that it would invalidate those laws \u201cthat provide the police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for <em>words or conduct </em>that annoy or offend them.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><em>Hill </em>also stated that as the Court had \u201cobserved over a century ago, \u2018[i]t would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court noted that the ordinance\u2019s plain language prohibiting opposing, molesting, abusing, or interrupting a police officer in any manner could be violated on numerous occasions every day.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nevertheless, only those individuals that the police chose to arrest would be charged with violating the ordinance.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Hill </em>concluded that because the \u201cordinance criminalizes a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech, and accords the police unconstitutional discretion in enforcement,\u201d it was substantially overbroad and facially invalid.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In this case, we address the constitutionality of MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">No person shall disrupt the normal activity or molest the property of any person, firm, or agency while that person, firm, or agency is carrying out service, activity or agreement for or with the University.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u201cThe first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute\u201d because \u201cit is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This ordinance makes it a crime to \u201cdisrupt the normal activity ... of any person, firm, or agency.. . carrying out service, activity or agreement for or with the University.\u201d Defendant argues that this language is facially overbroad because it substantially infringes on First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>rights. We agree with defendant and hold that the phrase \u201cdisrupt the normal activity\u201d in the ordinance is facially overbroad.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The MSU ordinance prohibits disruptions but does not specify the types of disruptions that are prohibited. Thus, the plain language of the ordinance allows its enforcement for even <em>verbal </em>disruptions. Moreover, like the ordinance that the United States Supreme Court invalidated in <em>Hill, </em>the verbal disruptions that the MSU ordinance criminalizes are not limited to those containing fighting words or obscene language. Instead, the MSU ordinance explicitly criminalizes any disruption of the normal activity of persons or entities carrying out activities for or with MSU. Not only does the ordinance fail to limit the types of disruptions that are prohibited, it also protects a much broader class of individuals than the ordinance at issue in <em>Hill. </em>The plain language of this ordinance allows it to be enforced against <em>anyone </em>who disrupts in <em>any </em>way <em>anyone </em>carrying out <em>any </em>activity for or with MSU. Like the ordinance in <em>Hill, </em>which was \u201cadmittedly violated scores of times daily,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the MSU ordinance could be violated numerous times throughout any given day given that there are seem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ingly infinite ways in which someone might \u201cdisrupt\u201d another who is engaged in an \u201cactivity\u201d for or with MSU. Thus, we believe that this ordinance, just like the ordinance in Hill, \u201ccriminalizes a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">The Court of Appeals found <em>Hill </em>distinguishable from this case because the <em>Hill </em>ordinance specifically protected police officers who have the power to arrest violators at the officers\u2019 discretion, while the MSU ordinance only prohibits the disruption of MSU employees who do not necessarily have the power to arrest violators.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We disagree with this distinction. The MSU ordinance prohibits the disruption of MSU police officers while they are carrying out their duties for the university, and those police officers have the explicit power to enforce the ordinance and arrest violators.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, the concerns that <em>Hill </em>had regarding \u201c[t]he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>police action without thereby risking arrest\u201d apply equally to the MSU ordinance.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Moreover, the distinction regarding whether an individual protected by the ordinance has the power to arrest is an irrelevant one. An MSU student, for example, enrolled in classes on campus is undoubtedly carrying out an activity with MSU and, therefore, is protected by the ordinance. Nothing in the plain language of the ordinance prevents a student who simply feels that he or she has been disrupted by the actions or words of another person from seeking enforcement of this ordinance. Nor does the ordinance language prevent a police officer from choosing to enforce the ordinance when there is a complaint or simply when the officer witnesses somebody disrupting another person\u2019s activity.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> While not all protected individuals have the same power as a police officer to arrest, the ordinance is nonetheless a criminal statute that subjects the violator to a misdemeanor conviction and provides someone who <em>does </em>have the power to arrest with the opportunity to do so whenever a protected individual is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>disrupted.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Accordingly, this ordinance can be said to \u201cprovide the police with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for <em>words or conduct </em>that annoy or offend them,\u201d just as the ordinance in <em>Hill </em>did.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, like the unconstitutional ordinance in <em>Hill, </em>the MSU ordinance is \u201csusceptible of regular application to protected expression,\u201d regardless of whether the protected individual has the power to arrest.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Court of Appeals further attempted to distinguish <em>Hill </em>because the ordinance in that case used the word \u201cinterrupt,\u201d while the MSU ordinance uses the word \u201cdisrupt.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>(2006), quoted by the Court of Appeals, defines \u201cdisrupt\u201d as \u201c[t]o throw into confusion or disorder\u201d or \u201c[t]o <em>interrupt </em>or impede the progress, movement, or procedure of[.]\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reasoned that a person can \u201cinterrupt an action without causing disorder or confusion, such as by merely asking a question,\u201d but \u201cthe same conduct does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>disrupt.. . ,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals then explained that its reasoning compelled the conclusion that while the term \u201cinterrupt\u201d used in the <em>Hill </em>ordinance may encompass a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, \u201cthe same can not necessarily be said\u201d of the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d used in the MSU ordinance.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We disagree with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Under the definition chosen by the Court of Appeals, \u201cdisrupt\u201d explicitly includes \u201cinterrupt.\u201d Other dictionaries similarly include \u201cinterrupt\u201d in the definition of \u201cdisrupt.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Moreover, the terms \u201cinterrupt\u201d and \u201cdisrupt\u201d are commonly used as synonyms.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning implies that the term \u201cinterrupt\u201d is capable of encompassing verbal interruptions, thereby implicating constitutionally protected conduct, while the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d is somehow limited to nonverbal acts and thereby incapable of reaching protected conduct. However, nothing in the ordinary meanings of \u201cinterrupt\u201d and \u201cdisrupt\u201d supports this reasoning. More importantly, nothing in the ordinances at issue in <em>Hill </em>or this case creates that distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The dictionary definition used by the Court of Appeals essentially provides that a person can \u201cdisrupt\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>another person by either (1) interrupting that person or (2) causing disorder or confusion.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Given this definition, one way to violate the MSU ordinance is to disrupt a person by interrupting that person. There is no question that the United States Supreme Court concluded in <em>Hill </em>that an ordinance broadly prohibiting interruptions reaches \u201ca substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> A person may also violate the MSU ordinance, under this definition of \u201cdisrupt,\u201d by causing disorder or confusion. This means that if a person asks another person several questions, which causes that other person\u2019s activity to be \u201cthrown into confusion or disorder,\u201d a prohibited disruption has occurred. Both ways in which a person may disrupt another person can be accomplished by purely <em>expressive </em>conduct.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> And regardless of which definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\u201cdisrupt\u201d is applied, the MSU ordinance can be used to reach and criminalize \u201ca substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Finally, we note that our analysis is not affected by <em>Hill\u2019s </em>observation of an anomaly in Texas law whereby the ordinance in that case was preempted to the extent that the Texas Penal Code already covered the proscribed conduct. Because Texas law preempted enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>ment of that portion of the <em>Hill </em>ordinance that criminalized someone who \u201cassault[s]\u201d or \u201cstrike[s]\u201d a police officer, \u201cthe enforceable portion of the ordinance\u201d made it \u201c \u2018unlawful for any person to .. . in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty,\u2019 and thereby prohibits verbal interruptions of police officers.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">While defendant does not offer any Michigan law similar to the Texas preemption statute, we note that separate statutes and MSU ordinances already criminalize physical assaults. For instance, MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 22.01 provides that \u201c[n]o person shall accost, molest, or harass any person upon the lands governed by the Board [of Trustees].\u201d And, of course, MCL 750.81 criminalizes all assaults that occur within the state, regardless of whether they occur on MSU grounds. Thus, for all practical purposes, the only disruptions that the MSU ordinance <em>newly </em>criminalizes are the same nonphysical ones that the enforceable portion of the <em>Hill </em>ordinance proscribed. In other words, just as Texas law criminalized physical assaults on police offic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ers in the absence of the <em>Hill </em>ordinance, state statutes and MSU ordinances already criminalize any physical assault that disrupts someone on the MSU campus even in the absence of MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As a result, the partial preemption of the <em>Hill </em>ordinance does not compel a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Accordingly, we hold that under <em>Hill, </em>the language in MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 making it an offense to \u201cdisrupt the normal activity\u201d of a protected person is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Next, we address whether MCR 7.101(0) allows taxation of costs in criminal appeals in the circuit court. MCR 7.101(0) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-8\">Costs in an appeal to the circuit court may be taxed as provided in MCR 2.625. A prevailing party may tax only the reasonable costs incurred in the appeal, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">(1) the cost of an appeal or stay bond;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">(2) the transcript;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">(3) documents required for the record on appeal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">(4) fees paid to the clerk or to the trial court clerk incident to the appeal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>(5) taxable costs allowed by law in appeals to the Supreme Court (MCL 600.2441); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">(6) other expenses taxable under applicable court rules or statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Defendant argues that he is entitled to reimbursement for the costs he incurred because the prosecution pursued its case against him on the basis of an unconstitutional statute. While the circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion for taxation of costs, the Court of Appeals reversed that decision on the basis that there is no statutory authority allowing the assessment of costs in this matter. We agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">MCR 7.101(0) explicitly states that \u201ccosts . . . maybe taxed as provided in MCR 2.625.\u201d MCR 2.625 is a rule of civil procedure, which does not apply to a criminal matter.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> MCR 7.101(O)(5) refers to MCL 600.2441, a statute that applies only to the taxation of costs in civil matters.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Because this case is a criminal matter, MCR 7.101(0) does not provide grounds for awarding costs.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Accordingly, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that there is no basis to \u201cundermine the broad statutory discretion granted the prosecution in its charging decisions,\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and the assessment of costs against the prosecution in this case was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We conclude that the language in MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 making it an offense to \u201cdisrupt the normal activity\u201d of a protected person is facially overbroad, as articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hill. </em>Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in part and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s decision to the extent that the circuit court held that the quoted language is facially unconstitutional. On the issue of costs, we agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the circuit court erroneously assessed costs against the prosecution and, therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-6\">Young, C.

However, <em>Hill </em>did not cite any Texas law that preempted <em>all </em>nonverbal interruptions of police officers, as the dissent suggests.

Furthermore, \u00a7 15 of the MSU Ordinance Code specifically states that the operation of a sound amplifying device \u201cin such a manner as to create a noise disturbance\u201d is a violation of the section.

The decision to strike down the instant ordinance, and thereby nullify a decision of the university\u2019s legislative body, is a matter of considerable consequence. This Court is responsible for upholding both the Michigan and federal constitutions, but its authority to invalidate laws is limited and must be predicated on a clear and apparent demonstration of unconstitutionality. Absent that demonstration, the majority\u2019s decision, in my judgment, is an expansion of judicial power and an unwarranted encroachment on the legislative branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In my view, <em>Hill </em>does not provide sufficient grounds to conclude that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected expression relative to its plainly legitimate sweep. I am also not convinced that the ordinance presents a realistic danger of significantly compromising First Amendment freedoms. Finally, the majority fails to consider the context of the academic environment in reaching its decision.

THE OVERBREADTH DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Laws are presumed constitutional, and this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>must construe a law as constitutional unless its unconstitutionality is clearly apparent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The burden of proving that a law is unconstitutional falls on the party bringing the challenge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Facial overbreadth, as alleged here, is a unique breed of constitutional challenge because of the competing social costs at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first concern is that the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law may have a chilling effect on protected expression, which is harmful because it deprives society of an uninhibited marketplace of ideas.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fear is that the law\u2019s \u201cvery existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To address this concern, the overbreadth doctrine allows parties to challenge laws without establishing the traditional standing requirements.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That is, it \u201callows a party to challenge a law written so broadly that it may inhibit the constitutionally protected speech of third parties, even though the party\u2019s own conduct may be unprotected.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201c[t]he overbreadth doctrine is an exception to the traditional rule of practice that <em>\u2018a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>person to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not before the court.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u201cThe consequence of our departure from traditional rules of standing in the First Amendment area is that any enforcement of a statute thus placed at issue is totally forbidden until and unless a limiting construction or partial invalidation so narrows it as to remove the seeming threat or deterrence to constitutionally protected expression.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The competing social cost of the overbreadth doctrine, therefore, is that it prevents a law from applying to constitutionally unprotected speech and even constitutionally unprotected conduct, which can result in obvious harm to society.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201c[i]n order to maintain an appropriate balance, we have vigorously enforced the requirement that a statute\u2019s overbreadth be <em>substantial, </em>not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Further, to invalidate a law, \u201cthere must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Invalidation for overbreadth is \u201cstrong medicine\u201d that should be used \u201csparingly and only as a last resort\u201d and not \u201cwhen a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the challenged statute.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>II. DEFENDANT FAILS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ORDINANCE REACHES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PROTECTED EXPRESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In <em>Hill, </em>the Court struck down as facially overbroad a Houston ordinance making it \u201c \u2018unlawful for any person to assault, strike or in any manner oppose, molest, abuse or <em>interrupt </em>any policeman in the execution of his duty, or any person summoned to aid in making an arrest.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In contrast, MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 states, \u201cNo person shall <em>disrupt </em>the normal activity or molest the property of any person, firm, or agency while that person, firm, or agency is carrying out service, activity or agreement for or with the University.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In my view, the text of the Houston ordinance and the Supreme Court\u2019s stated reasons for striking it down are sufficiently distinguishable from this case that <em>Hill, </em>the sole basis for defendant\u2019s challenge, does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 reaches a substantial amount of protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The majority\u2019s use of <em>Hill </em>to guide its analysis is problematic in the first instance because it effectively turns the presumption of constitutionality on its head. Although the majority states that it \u201cpresumes that ordinances are constitutional,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> its analysis uses a case in which an ordinance was declared unconstitutional as a point of reference and from there reasons that no basis exists for not treating that case as controlling. The majority\u2019s analysis suggests a presumption of <em>unconstitutionality. </em>The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Hill </em>is also problematic because it allows the majority to evade a traditional overbreadth analysis in what amounts to an attempt to fit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>a square peg into a round hole. Careful review reveals that the majority\u2019s analysis presents an oversimplified version of <em>Hill </em>that downplays its distinguishing aspects, creating only the appearance of a good fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Beginning with the most obvious distinction, the Houston ordinance made it unlawful to \u201cinterrupt\u201d a police officer in the execution of his or her duties, whereas MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 makes it unlawful to \u201cdisrupt\u201d the normal activity of a protected person carrying out an activity for or with MSU. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, these terms are not used in a largely synonymous fashion by those who use the English language carefully, as judges must, and the majority\u2019s use of thesaurus references is misleading.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The term \u201cinterrupt\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]o break the continuity or uniformity of,\u201d whereas \u201cdisrupt\u201d means \u201c[t]o throw into confusion or disorder\u201d or \u201c[t]o interrupt or impede the progress, movement, or procedure of[.]\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Significantly, the term \u201cinterrupt\u201d typically carries a verbal connotation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d carries a comparatively strong connotation that suggests not merely a verbal interjection or expression of a viewpoint, but an actual and severe impediment to the carrying out of one\u2019s activities.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> For example, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>context of a meeting, whereas a meeting may proceed once an interruption is over, a disruption will likely end the meeting. In my view, as this example illustrates, disruptions most often result from a nonexpressive, physical disturbance rather than the verbal interjection of a viewpoint.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This is not to say that it is impossible for a person to disrupt the normal activity of a protected person through words or expressive conduct. Nevertheless, \u201cthe mere fact that one can conceive of some impermissible applications of a statute is not sufficient to render it susceptible to an overbreadth challenge.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARn\">The majority, however, construes the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d as synonymous with \u201cinterrupt,\u201d relying primarily on its second dictionary definition, which is \u201c[t]o <em>interrupt </em>or impede the progress, movement, or procedure of[.]\u201d Using this definition, the majority concludes that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 is comparable to the Houston ordinance because \u201ca person can \u2018disrupt\u2019 another person by . . . interrupting that person . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">The majority\u2019s synthesis is not faithful to the language in the dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt\u201d or to MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05. The second dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt\u201d is to interrupt <em>the progress, </em>interrupt <em>the movement, </em>or interrupt <em>the procedure </em>of. And MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 provides that \u201c[n]o person shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>disrupt <em>the normal activity </em>... of [a protected person].\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, the ordinance language is focused not on disrupting the <em>person, </em>but on disrupting the <em>normal activity </em>in which the person is engaged. The following statement is a more accurate synthesis of the second dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt\u201d and MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05: No person shall interrupt the progress, the movement, or the procedure of the normal activity of a protected person.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Interrupting the progress, the movement, or the procedure of a normal activity is a far cry from interrupting a person, and this difference indicates that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 is less concerned with silencing speech and more concerned with allowing legitimate activities on campus to go unimpeded. The scope of the ordinance is further limited because a protected person\u2019s \u201cnormal activity\u201d may include being verbally interrupted by other people. It is part of a professor\u2019s normal activity, for example, to be interrupted by students asking questions. It is likewise part of a police officer\u2019s or a parking enforcement officer\u2019s normal activity to be interrupted by having to respond to legitimate questions from the public. MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 does not prohibit these interruptions. The majority, having relied primarily on the second dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt,\u201d fails to discuss any of these subtleties or engage in any balancing analysis that takes into consideration the legitimate sweep of MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Applying the first dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt,\u201d another way to violate the ordinance is to throw into confusion or disorder the normal activity of a protected person. Certainly, a person can interrupt without throwing into confusion or disorder the normal activity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>of a protected person \u2014 for instance, by asking a question.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Accordingly, while all disruptions may be considered interruptions (as suggested by the inclusion of \u201cinterrupt\u201d in the second dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt\u201d), not all interruptions rise to the level of disruptions.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is also no mistake that the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d is not included in the dictionary definition of \u201cinterrupt,\u201d as one would expect if the terms were truly synonymous. Accordingly, the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d carries a different meaning than \u201cinterrupt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Nonetheless, according to the majority, disruptions that throw into confusion or disorder the normal activity of a protected person also implicate purely expressive conduct and, therefore, MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 reaches a substantial amount of protected expression under either dictionary definition of \u201cdisrupt.\u201d As an example, the majority asserts that \u201cif a person asks another person several questions, which causes that other person\u2019s activity to be \u2018thrown into confusion or disorder,\u2019 a prohibited disruption has occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Court in <em>Hill, </em>however, addressed the majority\u2019s hypothetical example and concluded that a municipality may constitutionally punish such conduct. Specifically, the Court agreed with Justice Powell that \u201c \u2018a municipality constitutionally may punish an individual who chooses to stand near a police officer and persistently attempt to engage the officer in conversation while the officer is directing traffic at a busy intersection.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Stated dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ferently, the interruption, expressive or otherwise, is not protected if it prevents the officer from directing traffic at a busy intersection. The Court explained, however, that a municipality may not do what Houston did, which was \u201cto attempt to punish such conduct. .. by authorizing the police to arrest a person who <em>in any manner </em>verbally interrupts an officer.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05, however, does not make it unlawful to <em>in any manner </em>disrupt a protected person. Rather, a disruption is prohibited only if it prevents a protected person from carrying out an activity for or with MSU, making it narrower than the Houston ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">The linguistic differences between the ordinances reveal the logical fallacy employed by the majority. In essence, the majority reasons that, because the Supreme Court held that the term \u201cinterrupt\u201d in the Houston ordinance reached a substantial amount of protected expression, and because <em>some </em>interruptions rise to the level of disruptions, then the term \u201cdisrupt\u201d in the MSU ordinance also reaches a substantial amount of protected expression. This is a non sequitur \u2014 the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Rather, all that can he drawn from <em>Hill </em>is that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 reaches less protected expression than the Houston ordinance.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This, of course, falls short of defendant\u2019s burden to establish <em>substantial </em>overbreadth, and it leaves this Court with insufficient grounds to invalidate the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Furthermore, the majority effectively ignores a major facet of the Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Hill </em>for striking down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the Houston ordinance. The Court interpreted the Houston ordinance as targeting speech and not core criminal conduct in large part because the Texas Penal Code preempted governmental subdivisions or agencies from enacting or enforcing laws that purported to criminalize any form of physical assault against a police officer, and the city conceded the issue of preemption in the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Court stated that, as preempted, \u201cthe enforceable portion of the ordinance deals not with core criminal conduct, <em>but with </em>speech.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The Court also stated that \u201c[t]he enforceable portion of this ordinance is a general prohibition of speech that \u2018simply has no core\u2019 of constitutionally unprotected expression to which it might be limited.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Indeed, given the extent of preemption, the Court went as far as to say that \u201climiting the ordinance to \u2018physical acts\u2019 would be equivalent to invalidating it on its face.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Thus, the Court construed the enforceable portion of the ordinance as prohibiting only <em>\u201cverbal </em>interruptions of police officers.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> To the extent that the ordinance prohibited nonverbal interruptions or other physical affronts directed toward police officers, the ordinance was preempted.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Given this limited construction, the Court sensibly concluded that the Houston ordinance criminalized a substantial amount of protected expression relative to its plainly legitimate sweep. In this case, however, neither defendant nor the majority identifies a Michigan law that preempts MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05. Accordingly, it is enforceable against physical disruptions. Because the enforceability of the ordinance is not limited to mere verbal disruptions, it has a far broader legitimate sweep than the Houston ordinance.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The majority asserts that because existing laws \u201calready criminalize any physical assault that disrupts someone on the MSU campus . .. , the partial preemption of the <em>Hill </em>ordinance does not compel a different result in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s statement misses the point. It did not matter in <em>Hill </em>that Texas law already criminalized physical assaults on police officers; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>it mattered that the Texas Legislature had preempted the city from doing the same. Absent a similar preemption statute, the mere existence of MSU ordinances and statutes criminalizing certain campus disruptions does not align this case with <em>Hill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">For all these reasons, <em>Hill, </em>the sole basis for defendant\u2019s facial challenge, does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">III. DEFENDANT FAILS TO DEMONSTRATE A REALISTIC DANGER THAT THE ORDINANCE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISE FIRST AMENDMENT FREEDOMS</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">In addition to examining the language of an ordinance, it is appropriate to examine the likelihood of the ordinance\u2019s unconstitutional application. Even in a facial overbreadth challenge, the party bringing the challenge must demonstrate \u201ca realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court... .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In <em>Hill, </em>the appellee introduced city records indicating the frequency with which arrests had been made under the Houston ordinance and the types of exchanges that had led to those arrests.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reasoned that the evidence provided by the appellee showed a realistic danger that the city\u2019s application of the ordinance significantly compromised protected expression, and the Supreme Court did not disturb that conclusion.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The Supreme Court further observed that the ordinance was <em>\u201cadmittedly </em>violated scores of times daily . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>In this case, however, defendant provides no examples of protected expression that the ordinance has or could prohibit, and his characterization of the behavior for which he was cited as merely asking a parking official for his name is inconsistent with a fair reading of the record.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In particular, there is evidence that defendant drove toward the parking official in his vehicle at an aggressive speed, leapt out of his vehicle, approached the official in an aggressive manner, took pictures of the official with his cell phone, yelled at the official regarding the ticket, and demanded to know the official\u2019s name. In response, and out of concern for what defendant might do next, the official returned to the inside of his truck and summoned the university police for assistance. Although I do not opine on defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge, the record viewed as a whole belies defendant\u2019s claim that he received a citation merely for interrupting a parking official to ask for his name. Defendant has also otherwise failed to show a history of enforcement of the ordinance against protected expression. Finally, unlike in <em>Hill, </em>no one has <em>admitted </em>that the ordinance at issue in this case is violated scores of times daily by persons engaging in protected expression.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Thus, I do not believe that defendant has dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>onstrated a realistic danger that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 will significantly compromise First Amendment freedoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">An ordinance\u2019s enforcement mechanism may also be relevant to whether the ordinance presents a realistic danger of significantly compromising protected expression, as the Court suggested in <em>Hill. </em>The Houston ordinance prohibited interrupting police officers, the same class of individuals with the discretionary power to arrest individuals under the ordinance. As the Court explained, \u201c[t]he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge <em>police </em>action without hereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The Court also stated that it has \u201crepeatedly invalidated laws that provide the <em>police </em>with unfettered discretion to arrest individuals for words or conduct that annoy or offend <em>them.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the Court considered it especially concerning that enforcement of the Houston ordinance was entrusted to the sole objects of its prohibition. This feature of the ordinance presented an \u201c \u2018opportunity for abuse\u2019 \u201d that the Court had previously admonished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>legislators to avoid<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> and made the ordinance \u201csusceptible of regular application to protected expression.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AW4\">In this case, because the persons protected against disruptions are not limited to the police, there are many circumstances, including this case, under which enforcement of the ordinance is carried out by a neutral third party rather than left to the unfettered discretion of the object of the prohibition. Therefore, even if I were to assume that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 reaches a substantial amount of protected expression, which I do not, it presents a reduced opportunity for abuse and is less susceptible of regular application to protected expression than the Houston ordinance.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">IV CONSIDERATIONS OF THE ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">It is apparently of little consequence to the majority that this case concerns an ordinance adopted by an institution of higher education. To the extent that an academic environment is at issue in this ordinance, it is far more likely that speech-related activities (both inside and outside the classroom) will be the <em>object </em>of disruptions than that such activities will be undermined by the <em>prohibition </em>against disruptions. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>way, the ordinance as written may actually serve to promote the dissemination of ideas rather than threaten them.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Further, just as picketing outside courthouses<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> disruptive rallies within libraries,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and speech that disrupts the workplace<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> can be constitutionally prohibited, a university can implement measures to prevent disruptions of the academic environment.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Even campus newspapers are not entitled to the same degree of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>free speech as the <em>Lansing State Journal </em>because of the particular mission of the university.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> By striking down MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05, the majority is not only compromising the ability of parking officials to safely respond to irate behavior, but it is also preventing MSU from regulating numerous other disruptive activities that interfere with its core academic mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Finally, it is useful to consider the campus disruptions that MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 will no longer cover because it has been partially struck down by the majority: (1) a person running onto the field of a stadium during a sporting event, (2) a person blaring music during a lecture, (3) a person interfering with the progress or movement of an individual cleaning or maintaining a university building, (4) a person prevent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>ing the entrance of students into a classroom by physically blocking the classroom door, (5) a person shining a laser pointer during a performance or lecture, (6) a person turning the lights on and off in a classroom during an exam, (7) a person continually making noise in the library, (8) a person calling in a false bomb threat, and (9) a person pulling a fire alarm in the absence of a fire emergency. These are just a few of the countless nonexpressive campus occurrences that might throw into confusion or disorder the normal activity of a protected person. These illustrations highlight the tangible consequences of the majority\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that <em>Hill </em>provides insufficient grounds for this Court to invalidate MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05. At best, <em>Hill </em>supports the conclusion that the ordinance reaches less protected expression and presents less danger of compromising First Amendment freedoms than the Houston ordinance. I also consider it significant that this ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>was adopted by an academic institution. Because <em>Hill </em>provides the sole basis for defendant\u2019s overbreadth challenge, I do not believe that defendant has met his burden in this case. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority opinion and would instead affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which upheld MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 as constitutional on its face and remanded the case to the circuit court for consideration of defendant\u2019s as-applied challenge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-5\">MARKMAN, J., concurred with ZAHRA, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-10\"> <em>City of Houston, Texas v Hill, </em>482 US 451; 107 S Ct 2502; 96 L Ed 2d 398 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b151-8\"> Although my conclusion that defendant does not prevail in his constitutional challenge makes it unnecessary for me to reach the second question presented in this appeal, I nonetheless agree with the majority and the Court of Appeals that MCR 7.101(0) does not permit the assessment of costs in criminal matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"><em> In re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding Constitutionality of 2011 PA 38, </em>490 Mich 295, 307; 806 NW2d 683 (2011); <em>People v Barton, </em>253 Mich App 601, 603-604; 659 NW2d 654 (2002) (applying a presumption of constitutionality to an ordinance challenged on overbreadth grounds).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> <em>In re Request for Advisory Opinion Regarding Constitutionality of 2005 PA 71, </em>479 Mich 1, 11; 740 NW2d 444 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> <em>United States v Williams, </em>553 US 285, 292-293; 128 S Ct 1830; 170 L Ed 2d 650 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\"> <em>Virginia v Hicks, </em>539 US 113, 119; 123 S Ct 2191; 156 L Ed 2d 148 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b152-11\"> <em>Broadrick v Oklahoma, </em>413 US 601, 612; 93 S Ct 2908; 37 L Ed 2d 830 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\"> <em>Id. </em>at 613.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\"> <em>In re Chmura, </em>461 Mich 517, 530; 608 NW2d 31 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b153-5\"> <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Broadrick, </em>413 US at 610.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> <em>Broadrick, </em>413 US at 613.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b153-7\"> <em>Hicks, </em>539 US at 119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> <em>Williams, </em>553 US at 292.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> <em>Los Angeles City Council v Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 US 789, 801; 104 S Ct 2118; 80 L Ed 2d 772 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b153-10\"> <em>Broadrick, </em>413 US at 613.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b154-6\"> <em>Hill, </em>482 US at 455, quoting Houston Ordinance, \u00a7 34-11(a) (1984) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\"> Emphasis added.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b155-7\"> A thesaurus groups related concepts and provides a list of terms having similar meanings.

The Court noted that the Texas Penal Code broadly defined \u201cassault\u201d as including \u201cany provocative contact with... any person,\u201d making it much broader than the traditional concept of assault. <em>Hill, </em>482 US at 460 n 8; Tex Penal Code Ann 22.01(a). Given that the Houston ordinance was preempted to the extent that it prohibited any provocative contact whatsoever, my reading of the enforceable portion of the ordinance as limited to verbal interruptions is not overly narrow Is not a physical interruption a form of provocative contact? Further, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Court acknowledged that the Texas Penal Code did far more than preempt the enactment of laws criminalizing physical assaults. As one example, the Court noted that the Houston ordinance was preempted to the extent that it criminalized disorderly conduct. <em>Hill, </em>482 US at 465 n 13; Tex Penal Code Ann 42.01. In any case, the majority concedes that the Court construed the Houston ordinance as unenforceable against many types of physical interruptions. By contrast, the Michigan Legislature has not barred local units of government from enforcing ordinances that bar provocative or assaultive contact. Thus, no part of the MSU ordinance is preempted. Therefore, the ordinance has a broader legitimate sweep than the Houston ordinance. The lack of preemption in this case is a significant distinction that the majority all but ignores.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> That MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05 is not limited to verbal disruptions does not imply that the ordinance is somehow limited to nonverbal disruptions, and I disagree with the majority that the Court of Appeals implied that it is. <em>Ante </em>at 80 (asserting that \u201cthe Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning implies that... the term \u2018disrupt\u2019 is somehow limited to nonverbal acts\u201d). I agree fully with the Court of Appeals\u2019 statement that \u201cwhile to \u2018interrupt\u2019 could be deemed, as it was in <em>Hill, </em>to reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct, the same can not necessarily be said of \u2018disrupt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rapp, </em>293 Mich App at 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 84.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\"> <em>Los Angeles City Council, </em>466 US at 801.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b162-10\"> <em>Hill, </em>482 US at 455.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\"> <em>Id. </em>at 457.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b162-12\"> <em>Id. </em>at 466 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b163-4\"> Because this is a facial challenge, defendant is not required to show that the ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to him.

That \u201cthere are seemingly infinite ways\u201d to disrupt, however, provides all the more reason to be concerned about the damaging effects that the majority\u2019s decision will have on legitimate law enforcement interests at MSU. By what alternative legal approach does the majority believe that MSU can address these \u201cinfinite\u201d forms of disruptions other than by prohibiting \u201cdisruptions?\u201d Moreover, the claim that the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>nance <em>could </em>be enforced frequently is beside the point if defendant has not demonstrated a likelihood that the ordinance will <em>actually </em>be enforced against protected expression and, as I believe, the prohibition against disruptions primarily regulates unprotected activity. There are several laws that are violated numerous times daily on MSU\u2019s campus (e.g., laws prohibiting speeding and the possession of alcohol by a minor). The mere prevalence of violations does not make a law constitutionally suspect if the law does not reach a substantial amount of protected expression. Given the majority\u2019s focus on the sheer number of violations as a barometer of unconstitutionality, does the majority understand the First Amendment as applying differently at a large campus such as MSU\u2019s than at a smaller campus such as Northern Michigan University\u2019s?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> <em>Hill, </em>482 US at 462-463 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 465 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 466, quoting <em>Lewis v New Orleans, </em>415 US 130, 136; 94 S Ct 970; 39 L Ed 2d 214 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring in the result).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> <em>Hill, </em>482 US at 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\"> The majority\u2019s claim that the concerns regarding the enforcement mechanism of the Houston ordinance \u201capply equally\u201d here, <em>ante </em>at 78, is flawed. The majority fails to consider the broader legitimate sweep of MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.05, which protects more than the police. Further, the majority\u2019s observation that the ordinance is \u201ca criminal statute that subjects the violator to a misdemeanor conviction and provides someone who <em>does </em>have the power to arrest with the opportunity to do so,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 78, only serves to state the obvious \u2014 the police are responsible for enforcing our criminal laws and, of course, even police officers are sometimes the victims of crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\"> See <em>Cameron v Johnson, </em>390 US 611, 617; 88 S Ct 1335; 20 L Ed 2d 182 (1968) (upholding a statute that prohibited picketing that \u201cobstructs or unreasonably interferes with ingress or egress to or from the courthouse\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\"> See <em>Brown v Louisiana, </em>383 US 131, 142-143; 86 S Ct 719; 15 L Ed 2d 637 (1966) (suggesting that a state or its instrumentality may prohibit \u201cdisruption^] of library activities\u201d in a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> See <em>Waters v Churchill, </em>511 US 661, 680-681; 114 S Ct 1878; 128 L Ed 2d 686 (1994) (explaining that speech by public employees that <em>disrupts </em>the workplace is unprotected, regardless of whether the speech is on a matter of public concern).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> See <em>Tinker, </em>393 US at 513 (declaring that \u201cconduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason . .. materially <em>disrupts </em>classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech\u201d) (emphasis added). Although <em>Tinker </em>involved high school students, courts have applied <em>Tinker </em>in the university setting. For example, in <em>Salehpour v Univ of Tennessee, </em>159 F3d 199, 208 (CA 6, 1998), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, citing <em>Tinker, </em>held that the plaintiffs disruption of the classroom environment at the university was unprotected. The court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">where the expression appears to have no intellectual content or even discernable purpose, and amounts to nothing more than expression of a personal proclivity designed to <em>disrupt </em>the educational process, such expression is not protected and does violence to the spirit and purpose of the First Amendment. <em>Tinker, </em>393 U.S. at 511. The rights afforded to students to freely express their ideas and views without fear of administrative reprisal, must be balanced against the compelling interest of the academicians to educate in an environment that is free of purposeless distractions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and is conducive to teaching. Under the facts of this case, the balance clearly weighs in favor of the University. <em>[Id. </em>(emphasis added; citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court, in recognition of its decision in <em>Tinker, </em>stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">[a] university differs in significant respects from public forums such as streets or parks or even municipal theaters. A university\u2019s mission is education, and decisions of this Court have never denied a university\u2019s authority to impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the use of its campus and facilities. <em>[Widmar v Vincent, </em>454 US 263, 268 n 5; 102 S Ct 269; 70 L Ed 2d 440 (1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">In this case, MSU has implemented a reasonable, content-neutral regulation that is consistent with its mission as an educational institution.

MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.01 prohibits \u201cany excessive noise or disturbance, riot, raid, or <em>disruption </em>... which obstructs the free movement of persons about the campus or the free and normal use of University buildings and facilities, or prevents or obstructs the normal operations of the University\u201d (emphasis added); MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.02 provides that \u201c[n]o person shall <em>disrupt </em>the normal operation of any properly authorized class, laboratory, seminar, examination, field trip, or other education activity of the University\u201d (emphasis added); and MSU Ordinance, \u00a7 15.03 provides that \u201c[n]o person shall <em>disrupt </em>the normal use of any campus building or area which has been assigned or scheduled by appropriate means for educational or extracurricular activities\u201d (emphasis added). These ordinances not only illustrate the range of laws that might be placed at risk by the majority in the very limited context of this one university, but also, each of these ordinances is relatively clear in communicating a sense that a \u201cdisruption\u201d is distinct from a mere \u201cinterruption.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
