Defendant seeks a retrial on the basis of the newly discovered impeachment evidence. The trial court and the Court of Appeals concluded that this evidence cannot be used as a basis for granting a new trial because, in part, it is impeachment evidence. The Court of Appeals also concluded that the evidence did not warrant a new trial because if it were admitted on retrial, there was no reasonable chance of a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">We hold that impeachment evidence may be grounds for a new trial if it satisfies the four-part test set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>in <em>People v Cress.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We further hold that a material, exculpatory connection must exist between the newly discovered evidence and significantly important evidence presented at trial. It may be of a general character and need not contradict specific testimony at trial. Also, the evidence must make a different result probable on retrial. Accordingly, we vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and remand this case to the trial court for determination of whether the newly discovered evidence satisfies <em>Cress.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AT1\">A. THE COMPLAINANT\u2019S STORY AND DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">This case involves an alleged rape that occurred in 2001. The complainant testified that on May 12, 2001, she drove her van into the parking lot of the Fort Gratiot Meijer store between noon and 12:30 p.m. She claimed that she stepped out and turned to retrieve her purse from between the front seats. While she did so, a man with long dirty hair, a scraggly beard, and a hat appeared in front of the open door. He grabbed her arm and ordered her into the van. She testified that she resisted him, but the man struck her, causing her to fall inside. She continued to resist, but after being struck again, briefly lost consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">When she regained her senses, her head was between the front seats, one of her legs was pinned by the man, and the other was pinned by the steering wheel. The man unbuttoned her pants and pulled them and her underwear down around her knees. He then unzipped his own pants and she saw his erect penis. The man again struck her several times with his hand and stated, \u201cThis will shut you up.\u201d He slid a ring with several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>stones on it down one of his fingers to the knuckle and, she testified, forced that finger into her vagina.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The complainant claimed that she attempted to scream but could not because, after the man struck her, she was having difficulty breathing. However, she was able to call the man a \u201cbastard\u201d and he responded by backhanding her. The complainant indicated that she could taste blood from a cut on her face. She claimed that the man then inserted his penis into her vagina while gripping and striking her thighs as she continued to resist. The complainant testified that she again lost consciousness, but when she revived, her attacker was gone. She claimed that she found her way home, but was unable to recall the details of how she got there. When she arrived home, she immediately went into her bedroom because she did not want her children to know what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The complainant\u2019s husband testified that he knew that something was wrong when she returned home. He claimed that the complainant looked panicked and had a cut on her mouth. He questioned her about what had happened, and the complainant indicated in an incoherent and rambling manner that she had been physically attacked. However, she did not mention having been sexually assaulted. She testified that she did not tell her husband about the sexual assault because she \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to face [her]self\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to break [her husband\u2019s] heart.\u201d The complainant\u2019s husband testified that he noticed large bruises developing on her legs and arms over the days following the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">On May 14, 2001, two days following the attack, the complainant reported the assault to the police. Again, she did not report its sexual nature and the police treated the incident as an attempted carjacking. However, the police did note a large scratch on the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ant\u2019s face and that she told them she had extensive bruising. The complainant testified that she did not report the extent of the attack to the police because she had not yet fully disclosed the details of the assault to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Also on May 14, 2001, the complainant received medical treatment from Dr. Paul Jerry for some of her injuries. Jerry testified that he observed that the complainant\u2019s arm was swollen and bruised and that she reported tenderness in her neck. She testified that she did not report the sexual assault to Jerry because she was uncomfortable talking to him near other beds. She said she did not think reporting it would be helpful given that she had since showered.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">On May 15, 2001, the complainant told someone for the first time that she had been sexually assaulted. The friend she spoke to described her as traumatized and advised her to disclose the sexual nature of the assault to her husband. The complainant thereafter told her husband that she had been digitally penetrated. However, she claimed that she did not disclose further details because of his reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">On May 16, 2001, the complainant was seen by Dr. Deborah Russell, her gynecologist. She reported the full account of the attack, including the penile penetration. She explained that because her attacker had not worn a condom, she was concerned about possible health-related issues. Russell directed the complainant to return to the hospital emergency room because doctors there would be better able to treat her for a sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">On Russell\u2019s advice, the complainant returned to the hospital along with her husband. She was treated by Dr. Thabit Bahhur. Because her husband was present and she had not yet told him the nature of the assault, she told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Bahhur only that she had been digitally penetrated. Bahhur observed abrasions on the outside and inside of the complainant\u2019s vagina, as well as on her cervix. He testified that the abrasions were consistent with forceful digital or penile penetration but he could not rule out other causes of the injuries. He did not collect evidence for a \u201crape kit\u201d because of how much time had elapsed since the alleged attack. Also, the complainant had changed clothes and reported only a digital penetration. Additionally, the complainant had thrown away all the clothing she had worn during the alleged assault before it could be tested. She admitted that she knew at the time that it could have been tested for DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">One week later, on May 23, 2001, the complainant returned to Russell for a follow-up examination that revealed bruising on her legs and arm, as well as abrasions along her inner labia. Russell opined that the complainant\u2019s vaginal area was normal at the time, but noted that the \u201cvaginal area heals very quickly,\u201d so any abrasions more than a few days old would have healed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Several months elapsed before the complainant told her husband the full account of her alleged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Thirteen months after the alleged rape, in June 2002, the complainant reported to the police that she was driving near the Fort Gratiot Meijer when she saw a black Jeep leave a driveway. While it was behind her stopped at a traffic light, she said that she recognized the person she believed to be her assailant in her rearview mirror. She indicated that the driver had scraggly hair, a beard, and a ring on his hand. It was then that she notified the police for the first time that she had been sexually assaulted. She did this, she claimed, because she did not want to live in fear and believed that she might be able to \u201cget the person off the street who hurt [her] . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Over a five-day period in October 2002, the complainant reviewed more than 7,500 photographs at the police station. She identified her attacker in one picture. That person was defendant. Sometime afterward, police officers interviewed defendant. He initially denied owning a ring like the one described by the complainant, although he later admitted that he had owned such a ring but had pawned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">On November 7, 2002, the police arranged a corporeal lineup at which the complainant was given an opportunity to identify her assailant. Police officers advised defendant at his home that he should be at the station at a certain time. When they did so, defendant looked unkempt, with long hair and a scraggly beard. But when he arrived for the lineup, he had shaved his head and face. The complainant did not identify defendant as her attacker, instead selecting a different person from the lineup. Nonetheless, defendant was charged with two counts of criminal sexual conduct involving the use of force or coercion and resulting in personal injury to the victim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Several months before trial, the complainant claimed to have remembered that her attacker had a skull tattoo on his upper arm, although she did not recall any other details about it. Nor had she recalled the tattoo when the lineup was held or on any other occasion. Trial testimony established that defendant had a skull tattoo on his upper arm. There was also testimony that defendant had worked at the Fort Gratiot Meijer store on the day of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">A St. Clair County deputy sheriff testified that the police never made a connection between defendant and a Jeep-type vehicle that the complainant asserted she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>had seen him driving. Furthermore, testimony established that defendant had pawned a ring in May 2001. That was more than a year before the victim reported seeing a man in a black Jeep wearing a ring that she claimed she could positively identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Defendant did not testify at trial. A jury convicted him as charged of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. He was sentenced to 15 to 35 years in prison. On direct appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We denied his application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">B. THE NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Two years after defendant\u2019s convictions, the complainant called one of the detectives who had investigated the case against defendant. She informed him that she had been sexually assaulted by her brother and her father when she was a child. Another officer spoke with the complainant, who then reported having been raped in California. The prosecutor then obtained police reports from Bakersfield and Fresno, California, and provided them to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">1. THE BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA POLICE REPORTS</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The first report, dated September 28, 2001, included a missing-persons form that the complainant\u2019s mother had filed with the Bakersfield police. The form indicated that the complainant had been having lunch at a restaurant with her mother and a friend when her cellular telephone rang. She left the restaurant with her phone but never returned. According to the officer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>completed the form, L. Lerman, the complainant\u2019s mother said that it was \u201c \u2018out of character\u2019 \u201d for the complainant to \u201cjust take off.\u201d She also told the police that the complainant had been raped several months earlier and since then had \u201cnot been herself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The report also included a claim that the Bakersfield police received from the complainant\u2019s father the following day. Her father indicated that the complainant had recently called him and \u201ctold him she had been kidnaped and he needed to call the police.\u201d The police went to the father\u2019s house and asked him if he believed his daughter. He replied: \u201c \u2018No. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just a smoke screen. My daughter likes to have a lot of attention.\u2019 \u201d The father also told the police that the complainant had been sexually assaulted between the ages of 10 and 12 by a female member of their church congregation. He further stated that \u201cthe police were never contacted, a report was never made, and [the complainant] never received any type of counseling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Bakersfield police determined that the complainant had not been kidnapped, but instead had been staying with friends in Fresno, California. Officers contacted one of her friends, who indicated that the complainant \u201chad been raped several times and \u2018her husband was in on it.\u2019 \u201d The friend also explained that the complainant had been \u201chiding out in Colorado earlier this week, where she was assaulted by her brother.\u201d Finally, the friend noted that the complainant had alleged that her brother raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The Bakersfield police reports also reflect that the complainant admitted that she had called her father to report that she had been kidnapped. She told Lerman that she had been kidnapped by a \u201cwhite male adult, late 20\u2019s, 5\u20199\u201d, 200 pounds, with black, curly, medium length hair, light complexion, mustache, wearing black pants and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>white and blue striped shirt.\u201d Lerman indicated that the complainant claimed that the man had taken her to \u201ca concrete block room where there were no lights or windows\u201d and forced her to swallow six large white pills at knifepoint. Lerman also noted that the complainant \u201clater recanted this version of the incident, stating it never occurred,\u201d and that her friends from Fresno had picked her up at the restaurant where she had been lunching with her mother and a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Another Bakersfield police investigation \u201crevealed a possible assault had taken place against [the complainant], as she had some injuries consistent with a sexual assault.\u201d Lerman again interviewed the complainant, who claimed that she had been accosted by \u201ca white male adult, with short, black hair, wearing a green and gray mask, which covered his mouth, chin and nose; dirty jeans; and a short-sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up.\u201d The complainant further claimed that the man had raped her \u201cbetween two cars parked in the parking lot\u201d of the restaurant and that she had been sexually assaulted at a Colorado motel while traveling to California. However, Lerman noted that the complainant provided no details regarding the assault and was \u201cvery uncooperative.\u201d She also refused to submit to a sexual-assault examination at a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The complainant also told Lerman that the 15-minute attack had occurred while she was outside the restaurant before entering and eating with her family. Lerman asked the complainant\u2019s mother if her daughter had appeared to be upset while they were having lunch, and her mother said that her daughter seemed fine. Lerman asked a colleague if he believed the complainant needed \u201cpsychiatric evaluation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Lerman later contacted one of the complainant\u2019s friends in Fresno. The friend explained that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>picked up the complainant at the restaurant on the day of the complainant\u2019s disappearance. The friend also indicated that the complainant \u201cmade no mention of a sexual assault at that time.\u201d When Lerman told the friend that the complainant had alleged that she had been kidnapped, taken to an unknown location, and given pills, the friend said: \u201cThat is not true. That is so untrue. That never happened.\u201d When Lerman asked her why she believed the complainant would tell Lerman such a thing, the friend stated, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The second Bakersfield police report, dated October 1, 2001, indicated that on the previous day, the complainant appeared at an emergency room in a California hospital and announced that she had been raped. Bakersfield Police Officer A. Gavin talked with her at the hospital. She told him that she had been accosted by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">a Hispanic male, late 20\u2019s to early 30\u2019s, 5\u20196\u201d, 180 pounds, medium build, with black, curly hair, short in front and long in back, last seen wearing a green plastic, surgical type mask over his face, a light blue work shirt with no emblem on it, with the sleeves rolled up, dirty in appearance, dirty blue jeans and dirty tennis shoes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Gavin\u2019s report further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">[The complainant] said when they reached the south parking lot of the restaurant, she saw two vans parked next to each other. The suspect then pushed her in between these two vans. She said the suspect was wearing a small, hand-held, gray flashlight hooked on his belt with some type of leather strap. [The complainant] said he removed the flashlight from his belt with his right hand, reached down the front of her pants, and moved her underwear aside. He then inserted the flashlight into her vagina. I asked [the complainant] what she was wearing when this occurred and she told me it was the same clothing she was currently wearing. She told me she had not changed clothing since the incident occurred. I asked [the complainant] if she had showered or douched and she said she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>had taken one shower since the incident. I asked [the complainant] if the suspect said anything to her when he was putting the flashlight into her vagina and she said he never said anything. She said he did this for a few seconds and he then removed the flashlight and inserted one of his fingers inside her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">[The complainant] said she began screaming and the suspect yelled at her to stop screaming. She said he undid his pants and exposed his erect penis. He was able to move her pants and underwear aside and insert his penis into her vagina. [The complainant] said she began hitting him and he put his hands on her thighs and tried to keep her from squirming around. She said she screamed again and the suspect ran south through the parking lot toward the businesses located south of the restaurant. She never saw a vehicle. [The complainant] said the suspect did not ejaculate inside her vagina.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">[The complainant] said she does not believe she could identify the suspect again if she were to see him again because he was wearing some type of mask over his face. She described this mask as green and said it reminded her of a mask a gardener or doctor might wear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">I asked [the complainant] what happened after the suspect fled and she said she retrieved her purse from the sidewalk in front of the restaurant where she had dropped it. She then went back inside the business and sat with her mother and two aunts and acted like nothing happened. [The complainant] said she ordered a cup of tea and sat silently while the three others conversed. I asked her why she did not say anything to her family and she said she was in shock. I asked [the complainant] if her family members would find it odd that they had made lunch arrangements, but she had not ordered any lunch and sat silently while the other three women socialized. She said that was typical behavior for her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">I asked [the complainant] why she was afraid to tell her family, the police, or anyone else about the incident in the parking lot. She told me she was afraid no one would believe her because this had happened once before. She told me approximately six months ago, while in Michigan, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>had been raped in the parking lot of a grocery store while getting out of her vehicle. [The complainant] said she was in shock and could not believe it had happened again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The complainant also told Gavin that she had met her Fresno friend through an online rape support group. She explained that she had joined the group <em>before </em>being raped in Michigan because she had been \u201craped when she was six years old.\u201d She further explained that she had been \u201cin and out of support groups and therapy for years.\u201d However, Gavin\u2019s report noted that the complainant\u2019s husband expressed \u201ca difficult time believing [the complainant] was telling the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">2. THE FRESNO, CALIFORNIA POLICE REPORT</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The third and final report was made by the Fresno Police Department. That report stemmed from a friend expressing concern about the complainant\u2019s allegations. The friend stated that the complainant was \u201cpossibl[y] mentally unstable and may try to file false allegations . . . .\u201d The report also reflected that the complainant had met one of her Fresno friends \u201cabout 18 months ago online and has been talking to her online and on the phone since then.\u201d It further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">[The complainant], who is from an unknown city in Michigan, claims that approximately 18 months ago, her brother and his friends gang-raped her. She reported this crime and the suspects were arrested and convicted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">She states that her brother got out of jail a week ago and found her in Colorado, where she was staying with her husband to hide from her brother. [The complainant] told [a friend] that her brother raped her again on Monday and was not supposed to know where she and her husband were.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The Fresno police officer who completed this report believed that the complainant had lied to her Fresno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>friends, her family, and law enforcement. The report concluded that \u201c[the complainant] told her family and Bakersfield [Police Department] she was being held against her will in Fresno, which was not true. [The complainant] is possibly mentally unstable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">C. PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THIS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Armed with these newly discovered police reports, in March 2006 defendant filed a pro se motion for relief from the judgment and requesting a new trial. The trial court denied the motion. The court acknowledged that the newly discovered evidence would have been admissible at trial to test the complainant\u2019s credibility. But the court concluded that it was bound by several Court of Appeals decisions holding that newly discovered impeachment evidence cannot be the basis for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Court of Appeals denied defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted, directing it \u201cto consider whether defendant has a reasonably likely chance of acquittal in light of the newly discovered evidence and in light of the evidence presented against defendant that did not involve the complainant\u2019s credibility.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">On remand, the Court of Appeals majority held that newly discovered evidence cannot form the basis for granting a new trial if its sole purpose is to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It also held that, even if the newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>discovered evidence were admissible and could have provided a basis for granting a new trial, defendant had no reasonable chance of acquittal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It opined that there was other evidence supporting defendant\u2019s conviction that was not dependent on the complainant\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Judge GLEICHER dissented. She opined that defendant was reasonably likely to be acquitted on retrial in light of the newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We review for an abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">A. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Historically, Michigan courts have been reluctant to grant new trials on the basis of newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This policy is consistent with requiring parties to \u201c \u2018use care, diligence, and vigilance in securing and presenting evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We have identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>several evaluative criteria to apply when determining whether a new trial may be granted because of newly discovered evidence. We have explained that a defendant must show that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">(1) the evidence itself, not merely its materiality, was newly discovered; (2) the newly discovered evidence was not cumulative; (3) the party could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced the evidence at trial; and (4) the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">This test has been applied consistently for more than a century.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In <em>Spray v Ayotte, </em>the Court added a caveat to the four-part test in the context of newly discovered <em>impeachment </em>evidence, noting that \u201c[o]rdinarily a new trial will not be granted because of newly discovered evidence to impeach a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Like the traditional four-part test, Spray\u2019s caveat has also endured since its inception.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Recently, in <em>People v Armstrong, </em>we reconsidered the significance of impeachment evidence and its use as grounds for granting a new trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We concluded that a defense attorney\u2019s failure to introduce telephone records that contradicted the complainant\u2019s trial testimony amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel and was sufficient for a new trial. We specifically noted the importance of evidence attacking the complainant\u2019s credibility because \u201c[t]he defense\u2019s whole theory of the case was that the complainant had falsely accused defendant of rape. The attacks on the complainant\u2019s credibility at trial were inconclusive, providing mere \u2018he said, she said\u2019 testimony contradicting the complainant\u2019s version of the events.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the impeachment evidence was found to be sufficiently important to the determination of guilt or innocence that it could change the result on retrial. In these circumstances, we held that a defendant might be entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Federal courts have employed an approach similar to Michigan\u2019s with respect to newly discovered impeachment evidence. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has opined, \u201cOf course it will be the rare case in which impeaching evidence warrants a new trial, because ordinarily such evidence will cast doubt at most on the testimony of only one of the witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Yet the Seventh Circuit recognized that merely because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">[t]he practice has been to deny new trials where the only newly discovered evidence was impeaching[,] ... the practice should not be taken to imply <em>a rule </em>that even if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>defendant proves that his conviction almost certainly rests on a lie, the [trial] judge is helpless to grant a new trial.\u201d[<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The Court further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">[i]f the government\u2019s case rested entirely on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness who was discovered after trial to be utterly unworthy of being believed because he <em>had lied consistently in a string of previous cases, </em>the district judge would have the power to grant a new trial in order to prevent an innocent person from being convicted.[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Thus, newly discovered evidence that impeaches a witness\u2019s testimony with false statements made in other cases is expressly permitted under <em>Taglia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Likewise, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that \u201c[trial] courts do not and should not ignore a claim that there has been a miscarriage of justice just because the newly discovered evidence supporting the claim could be categorized as impeachment in character.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, \u201c[w]hen asked to grant a new trial solely on the basis of new impeachment evidence, a court carefully should examine whether the defendant has demonstrated the necessary exculpatory connection between the evidence and the offense or has demonstrated that the newly discovered evidence totally undermined critical inculpatory evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In evaluating this evidence, the Third Circuit noted that \u201c[t]here must be something more, i.e. a factual link between the heart of the witness\u2019s testimony at trial and the new evidence. This link must suggest directly that the defendant was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>wrongly.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Other circuits and authorities have reached similar conclusions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">And in <em>White v Coplan,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit explicitly rejected the notion that impeachment evidence lacks the power to alter a jury verdict. It held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">In this case, [the defendant\u2019s] evidence was not merely \u201cgeneral\u201d credibility evidence. That label applies to the traditional proofs \u2014 offered through character or reputation witnesses and sometimes through proof of specific instances of misbehavior, especially prior convictions \u2014 to support an inference that the witness has a tendency to lie. Once a staple of trials, modern evidence rules ... have significantly restricted such evidence without totally precluding it in all cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">The evidence in this case was considerably more powerful. The past accusations were about sexual assaults, not lies on other subjects; and while sexual assaults may have some generic similarity, here the past accusations by the [witnesses] bore a close resemblance to [their] present testimony \u2014 in one case markedly so. In this regard the evidence of prior allegations is unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-8\">If the prior accusations were false, it suggests a pattern and a pattern suggests an underlying motive (although without pinpointing its precise character). The strength of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>impeachment evidence falls along a continuum. That a defendant told lies to his teacher in grade school is at one end; that the witness was bribed for his court testimony is at another. Many jurors would regard a set of similar past charges by the [witnesses], if shown to be false, as very potent proof in [the defendant\u2019s] favor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">This \u201cif,\u201d of course, is the heart of the matter. If the witness were prepared to admit on the stand that a prior accusation of similar nature was false, it is hard to imagine good reason for excluding the evidence. Prior admitted lies of the same kind in similar circumstances could powerfully discredit the witness. No time-consuming excursion beyond the witness would be required. Further, the accusation being conceded to be untrue, inquiry would not require the witness to admit to prior sexual activity or assault.[<footnotemark>29</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"><em>White's </em>analysis stands as strong recognition of the utility of impeachment evidence in the context of prior false accusations. The newly discovered evidence in that case did not directly contradict the witnesses\u2019 testimony at trial. It was nonetheless held sufficient to warrant a new trial because it significantly undermined the victims\u2019 credibility on the question of whether the crime ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Finally, the United States Supreme Court has recognized the significance of newly discovered impeachment evidence. In <em>Napue v Illinois, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[t]he jury\u2019s estimate of the truthfulness and reliability of a given witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, and it is upon such subtle factors as the possible interest of the witness in testifying falsely that a defendant\u2019s life or liberty may depend.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">It bears emphasizing that, as this Court recognized more than a century ago, newly discovered impeach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>ment evidence ordinarily will not justify the grant of a new trial. Our decision today, therefore, does not disturb this unremarkable statement. It will be the rare case in which (1) the necessary exculpatory connection exists between the heart of the witness\u2019s testimony at trial and the new impeachment evidence and (2) a different result is probable on retrial.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> But when that rare case presents itself, a court should not refuse to grant a new trial solely on the ground that the newly discovered evidence is impeachment evidence. It should not refuse even if the new evidence is not directly contradictory to specific trial testimony.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>In sum, there is ample authority that undercuts the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that newly discovered impeachment evidence can never be grounds for a new trial. Rather, impeachment evidence may be grounds for a new trial if it satisfies the four-part test set forth in <em>Cress. </em>More specifically, newly discovered impeachment evidence satisfies <em>Cress </em>when (1) there is an exculpatory connection on a material matter between a witness\u2019s testimony at trial and the new evidence<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> and (2) a different result is probable on retrial.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The Court of Appeals majority in this case relied on <em>People v Duncan</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>People v Davis</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that newly discovered impeachment evidence is never grounds for a new trial. <em>Duncan </em>was a mere peremptory order of this Court. The Court of Appeals dissenting opinion whose reasoning this Court adopted in <em>Duncan </em>did not impose a blanket prohibition on granting a new trial because of newly discovered impeachment evidence.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Davis\u2019s alleged prohibition of new trials based on newly discovered impeachment evidence can be traced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to the 1967 Court of Appeals decision in <em>Graham v Inskeep.</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet <em>Graham </em>employed language consistent with our rule today, noting that \u201cit is <em>generally </em>held that a new trial will not be granted if the newly-discovered evidence is merely to impeach.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Graham </em>left open the possibility that there may be circumstances under which newly discovered impeachment evidence warrants a new trial. Thus, <em>Graham\u2019s </em>progeny transformed a <em>general </em>rule into a <em>per se </em>one. To the extent that any Michigan decisions impose a per se prohibition against granting a new trial in light of newly discovered impeachment evidence, they are hereby overruled.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">B. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As discussed earlier, granting a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence requires a defendant to show that (1) the evidence itself, not merely its materiality, is newly discovered, (2) the newly discovered evidence is not cumulative, (3) using reasonable diligence, the party could not have discovered and produced the evidence at trial, and (4) the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In this case, the prosecution did not contest the first three of these criteria in the lower courts. It conceded that the evidence was newly discovered, not cumulative, and that defendant could not have discovered and produced it at trial using reasonable diligence.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>However, the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment. It ruled that impeachment evidence \u201ccannot form the basis for .. . granting] ... a new trial.\u201d This ruling was legally incorrect. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s ruling was necessarily an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">On remand, defendant is entitled to have the trial court carefully consider the newly discovered evidence in light of the evidence presented at trial. The trial court must evaluate the new evidence and determine whether there exists an exculpatory connection between it and the heart of the complainant\u2019s testimony. The only facts that the trial court should consider in deciding whether to grant a new trial are those in the newly discovered evidence and those in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We hold that newly discovered impeachment evidence generally is insufficient to warrant a new trial. However, such evidence may be grounds for a new trial if it satisfies the four-part test set forth in <em>Cress. </em>Newly discovered impeachment evidence concerning immaterial or collateral matters cannot satisfy <em>Cress. </em>But if it has an exculpatory connection to testimony concerning a material matter and a different result is probable, a new trial is warranted. It is not necessary that the evidence contradict specific testimony at trial. Because the trial court did not have the benefit of this clarification of the role of newly discovered impeachment evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>dence, a remand for application of the standards clarified here is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">For these reasons, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment. We remand the case to the trial court for a determination of whether the newly discovered evidence satisfies <em>Cress. </em>The only facts that the trial court should consider in deciding whether to grant a new trial are those in the newly discovered evidence and those in the record. The trial court\u2019s determination is to be made and communicated to this Court within 60 days of the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b386-6\">CAVANAGH, MARKMAN, and HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with Marilyn Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> <em>People v Cress, </em>468 Mich 678; 664 NW2d 174 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\"> MCL 750.520b(1)(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b369-10\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 18, 2004 (Docket No. 251427) <em>(Grissom </em>I).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b369-11\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>472 Mich 919 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>unpublished order of the Court of Appeals, issued July 2, 2007 (Docket No. 274148).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>480 Mich 1140 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b375-10\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued October 29, 2009 (Docket No. 274148), p 10 <em>(Grissom II). </em>The Court of Appeals majority cited <em>People v Duncan, </em>414 Mich 877 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>(1982), and <em>People v Davis, </em>199 Mich App 502, 516; 503 NW2d 457 (1993), for the proposition that newly discovered impeachment evidence cannot be the basis for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b376-12\"> <em>Grissom II, </em>unpub op at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b376-13\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b376-14\"> <em>Id. </em>at 15 (Gleicher, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b376-15\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>488 Mich 1031 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b376-16\"> <em>People v Andrews, </em>360 Mich 572, 578; 104 NW2d 199 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b376-17\"> See, e.g., <em>People v Pizzino, </em>313 Mich 97, 109; 20 NW2d 824 (1945), citing <em>Canfield v City of Jackson, </em>112 Mich 120, 123; 70 NW 444 (1897).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b376-18\"> <em>Pizzino, </em>313 Mich at 109, quoting <em>Canfield, </em>112 Mich at 123 (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> <em>People v Cress, </em>468 Mich 678, 692; 664 NW2d 174 (2003) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> See, e.g., <em>People v Clark, </em>363 Mich 643, 647; 110 NW2d 638 (1961); <em>Canfield, </em>112 Mich at 123.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b377-9\"> <em>Spray v Ayotte, </em>161 Mich 593, 595; 126 NW 530 (1910).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b377-10\"> See, e.g., <em>Luckhurst v Schroeder, </em>183 Mich 487, 499-500; 149 NW 1009 (1914) (\u201cOrdinarily, the court will not grant a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence where that evidence is for the purpose of impeachment.\u201d), citing <em>Spray, </em>161 Mich at 593-595; <em>People v Serra, </em>301 Mich 124, 133; 3 NW2d 35 (1942) (\u201cA new trial will not ordinarily he granted because of newly-discovered evidence to impeach a witness.\u201d), citing <em>Spray, </em>161 Mich 593; see also <em>People v Barbara, </em>400 Mich 352, 363; 255 NW2d 171 (1977) (\u201cGenerally, too, where the new evidence is useful only to impeach a witness, it is deemed merely cumulative.\u201d).

Although I am willing to agree to remand this case to the trial court for application and resolution of the <em>Cress </em>test, I believe this Court should do that itself. Hence, I write separately to explain why.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">First, this appeal has lingered unresolved in the state appellate courts for the past six years. This Court already considered and remanded it once before during that period. The parties have now diligently, thoroughly, and thoughtfully briefed and argued the question whether defendant should be afforded a new trial. Not only is it appropriate for us to give them an answer, there is no impediment to our doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Second, the rationale for a remand to the trial court rests in large part on the theory that the judge there has the benefit of having tried the case. The trial judge would normally have superior knowledge of the facts that were presented at trial. He or she would apply that knowledge to the question of whether a different result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>is probable on retrial were the newly discovered evidence to be admitted. But in this case, the trial judge has retired from the bench, and this Court\u2019s remand will go to a judge who in all likelihood knows nothing of the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Third, in granting defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, we specifically ordered the parties to address whether the newly discovered evidence warrants a new trial. Hence, it follows that we should attempt to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Lastly, by resolving the issue, the Court can establish precedent on the question of when newly discovered impeachment evidence can satisfy the fourth <em>Cress </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Nonetheless, I fully join the majority opinion. I write separately to definitively answer the question on which we granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal: I would hold that the newly discovered evidence constitutes material exculpatory evidence and that it makes a different result probable on retrial, satisfying the fourth <em>Cress </em>factor. Accordingly, my preference would be to vacate defendant\u2019s convictions and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">As discussed in my majority opinion, granting a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence requires a defendant to show that (1) the evidence itself, not merely its materiality, is newly discovered, (2) the newly discovered evidence is not cumulative, (3) using reasonable diligence, the party could not have discovered and produced the evidence at trial, and (4) the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>prosecution correctly conceded that defendant has satisfied the first three factors, the only remaining question is whether the newly discovered evidence makes a different result probable on retrial. I would answer that question in the affirmative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">A. ADMISSIBILITY OF THE NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Merely presenting a court with newly discovered evidence does not automatically support the grant of a new trial. Rather, to potentially effect a different result on retrial and thereby satisfy the fourth <em>Cress </em>factor, the newly discovered evidence must be admissible. Thus, a question prefatory to the trial court\u2019s resolution of whether defendant\u2019s newly discovered evidence would make a different result probable on retrial is whether that evidence could be admissible. The Court of Appeals majority hinted that it could be admissible in limited circumstances, namely, to show that the complainant admitted she had lied about being kidnapped and about being raped in California. It also noted that the California police reports con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tain hearsay,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which is generally not admissible under MRE 802.1 conclude that, at the very least, the reports have evidentiary value and contain information that could be admitted if properly presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">First, on retrial, if the complainant were to deny having ever made a false police report of rape, the fact that she did so in California in 2001 could be admissible. Under MRE 613, this inconsistency would be relevant to her credibility. If she were to testify that she made the false report, it would also severely impeach her credibility. The veracity of her testimony was vital to defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Second, the newly discovered evidence is relevant. In this regard, MRE 401 defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">MRE 404(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system in doing an act, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident when the same is material, whether such other crimes, wrongs, or acts are contemporaneous with, or prior or subsequent to the conduct at issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">Accordingly, parts of the newly discovered evidence could be admissible to show that the complainant had a motive for falsely reporting a sexual assault. It could show that she engaged in a scheme consisting of falsely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>accusing various individuals of raping her. The police reports show that the complainant reported to the police, family, or friends that she had been raped by at least eight different people on at least nine separate occasions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, MRE 404(b) could be yet another basis for the introduction of information contained in the California police reports.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Third, the newly discovered evidence has evidentiary value because, on retrial, it may permit defendant access to the complainant\u2019s medical, counseling, and psychological records. This could include records from the online rape support group that the complainant participated in <em>before </em>the alleged rape by defendant in this case. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for discovery of these records at trial, and the Court of Appeals affirmed this decision,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> citing MCR 6.201(C)(2)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>and <em>People v </em>Stanaway.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><em>Stanaway </em>requires a defendant to establish \u201ca reasonable probability that the privileged records are likely to contain material information necessary to his defense\u201d before an in camera review is conducted pursuant to MCR. 6.201(C)(2) to ascertain whether those records contain evidence that is \u201creasonably necessary to the defense ... .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It appears that the newly discovered evidence could satisfy the court rule and <em>Stanaway.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The rape-shield statute<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> does not apply to this evidence because it does not preclude impeaching a complainant with the complainant\u2019s prior false accusation. The statute provides that evidence of specific instances of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct, opinion evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>complainant\u2019s sexual conduct, and reputation evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct are generally inadmissible. However, in <em>People v Jackson, </em>we held that testimony concerning prior false sexual-assault allegations does not implicate the rape-shield statute.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And as the Court explained in <em>People v Hackett,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[t]he fact that the Legislature has determined that evidence of sexual conduct is not admissible as character evidence to prove consensual conduct or for general impeachment purposes is not however a declaration that evidence of sexual conduct is never admissible. We recognize that in certain limited situations, such evidence may not only be relevant, but its admission may be required to preserve a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. For example, where the defendant proffers evidence of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct for the narrow purpose of showing the complaining witness\u2019 bias, this would almost always be material and should be admitted. Moreover in certain circumstances, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct may also be probative of a complainant\u2019s ulterior motive for making a false charge. Additionally, the <em>defendant should be permitted to show that the complainant has made false accusations of rape in the </em>past.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Thus, at a minimum, on retrial, the rape-shield statute would not preclude admission of the complainant\u2019s admittedly false accusation of rape made to the Bakersfield Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In addition, <em>Hackett </em>discussed another type of evidence of sexual conduct that, if otherwise admissible, does not run afoul of the rape-shield statute: evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct probative of a complainant\u2019s ulterior motive for making a false charge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This exception may also be germane because evidence of the complainant\u2019s past false accusation and purported childhood sexual abuse could arguably suggest an underlying motive for making a false charge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">In light of these evidentiary, statutory, and judicially crafted rules, if defendant properly offered the evidence, he could introduce the complainant\u2019s prior false rape claim. Potentially, he could also attempt to show that she made numerous reports of rape over the years involving many different individuals. Finally, under <em>Stanaway </em>and MCR 2.601(C)(2), the newly discovered evidence might permit defendant access to the complainant\u2019s medical, counseling, and psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>records on retrial, which were denied to him at trial. I note that this is not an exhaustive evaluation of the potential admissibility of the newly discovered evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">B. EXCULPATORY CONNECTION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">For newly discovered impeachment evidence to satisfy <em>Cress, </em>there must be an exculpatory connection between the evidence and the offense, even if the new evidence does not contradict a witness\u2019s specific testimony. Alternatively, the evidence must totally undermine critical inculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hence, in evaluating this issue, a court must identify a factual link <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>between the heart of a key witness\u2019s testimony at trial and the newly discovered evidence. I would hold that a clear exculpatory connection exists between the newly discovered evidence in this case and the heart of the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial. This is because the new evidence calls into question whether the alleged crime she testified about ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The new evidence impeaches complainant\u2019s most incriminating testimony. Defendant\u2019s convictions were predicated on complainant\u2019s allegation that defendant sexually assaulted her. Her credibility was central to the case. But the newly discovered evidence casts serious doubt on her credibility, not just in general, but with respect to the most crucial evidence at trial: her testimony that she was brutally assaulted in a commercial parking lot in the middle of the day and that defendant perpetrated the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The newly discovered police reports are highly significant because they render complainant\u2019s allegations in this case more difficult to believe. Relevant in this respect is the final version of complainant\u2019s story documented in the California police reports, the details of which bear a remarkable resemblance to this case. Both involved allegations of rape in a parking lot in the middle of the day. In both cases, no one reported seeing an assault. In both cases, no definitive physical evidence of a sexual assault was obtained because complainant did not seek immediate medical treatment. And in both cases, the complainant alleged that her attacker penetrated her with a foreign object, his finger, and then his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In sum, the newly discovered evidence creates a serious question about whether any sexual assault occurred at all in this case. It discloses a history of at least one, and as many as nine, prior false sexual-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>assault allegations. And it raises questions about the complainant\u2019s veracity as pertains to her testimony inculpating defendant. As we noted in <em>People v Barbara, </em>new impeachment evidence is \u201cparticularly significant when. . . the only evidence that an offense was ever committed was largely based on the testimony of [an] individual[] whose credibility might be put into question . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> For these reasons, I would hold that the newly discovered evidence contains an exculpatory connection, i.e. \u201ca factual link between the heart of the [complainant\u2019s] testimony at trial and the new evidence . . . suggesting] directly that the defendant was convicted wrongly.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">C. A DIFFERENT RESULT IS PROBABLE ON RETRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In light of these considerations, I believe that a different result is probable on retrial. First, the prosecution\u2019s case against defendant was not strong. Several months had elapsed from the date of the alleged rape by the time the complainant told her husband about it. Thirteen months elapsed before the complainant went to the police claiming that someone had raped her. Initially, she told both her husband and the police a different story \u2014 that she had been beaten. No direct physical evidence linked defendant to the crime. There was no DNA evidence and the complainant did not seek <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>medical care until any such evidence could no longer be identified. Indeed, although the complainant admitted that she knew the clothing she wore during the alleged attack could be tested for DNA evidence, she threw it away before it could be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The complainant identified someone other than defendant as her assailant at the police lineup. She did not tell two of the physicians who examined her after the alleged attack that she had been raped. There were no eyewitnesses to the alleged attack, which supposedly occurred in broad daylight in a crowded parking lot. Surveillance videotape of the Meijer parking lot did not reveal any evidence of criminal activity. Nor did it reveal that defendant or the complainant was even <em>present </em>in the parking lot on the day of the alleged assault.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Second, the only evidence offered to corroborate the complainant\u2019s allegation that she suffered physical injuries that could have been signs of a rape was testimony from Dr. Thabit Bahhur and Dr. Deborah Russell. These are two of the physicians who examined her. Bahhur indicated that he observed abrasions on the outside and inside of the complainant\u2019s vagina, as well as on her cervix. Although he testified that the abrasions were consistent with a sexual assault, he specifically indicated that he could not rule out other causes of the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Similarly, Russell observed abrasions on the complainant\u2019s labia. She also reported bruises on the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>plainant\u2019s arms and legs. But Russell testified that the complainant\u2019s vaginal area was \u201cnormal\u201d at the time of her exam. Thus, the testimony offered by Bahhur and Russell did not establish that the complainant had been sexually assaulted, much less that defendant was her attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Third, during closing argument, the prosecutor presented the complainant\u2019s allegations as setting forth a slam-dunk case, stating, \u201cThere\u2019s really, really no question as to whether or not this assault happened. There\u2019s really no question.\u201d In light of the newly discovered evidence, this is not an accurate characterization of the complainant\u2019s allegations. The newly discovered evidence creates a serious question about whether any assault occurred at all in this case. Moreover, it discloses a history of at least one, and possibly as many as nine, false sexual-assault allegations. It raises questions about the complainant\u2019s veracity. I believe that at a new trial, it is probable that a jury would find this evidence sufficiently compelling to acquit defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In reaching this conclusion, I do not overlook the evidence presented at trial corroborating defendant\u2019s convictions that was not entirely independent of the complainant\u2019s credibility. This evidence includes the fact that defendant worked at the Meijer store where the alleged assault occurred. It also includes the complainant\u2019s identification of defendant in a photo array. It includes defendant\u2019s lie to the police about not having owned or pawned a ring fitting the complainant\u2019s description of her attacker\u2019s ring.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> And it includes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>fact that defendant had a skull tattoo on his right arm. Furthermore, defendant altered his appearance before his corporeal lineup. However, given the circumstantial nature of this evidence, the likelihood that a jury would acquit defendant after being presented with the newly discovered evidence is great enough to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Given these considerations, I believe defendant has set forth a sufficient basis for a new trial. As we noted in <em>Barbara, </em>new impeachment evidence is \u201cparticularly significant when . . . the only evidence that an offense was ever committed was largely based on the testimony of [an] individ\u00faalo whose credibility might be put into question .. . ,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> That is, I believe there is a factual link between the heart of the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial and the newly discovered evidence that suggests that defendant might have been wrongly convicted.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> I cannot say that a different result will <em>certainly </em>occur on retrial. But the newly discovered evidence undermines my confidence in the complainant\u2019s testimony, and I believe a different result is probable on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">As Judge GLEICHER aptly concluded in her dissent in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">In summary, the prosecutor presented the [the complainant] as an ordinary wife and mother, engaged in a routine shopping trip, whom defendant senselessly and brutally attacked. The jury remained ignorant of other highly relevant facts, including the victim\u2019s prior participation in an online rape support group, which likely would have engendered reasonable doubt regarding her delayed and inconsistent description of the attack in the Meijer\u2019s parking lot. The impeachment evidence supplied by the California police reports, and the further information likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>to flow directly from additional investigation triggered by those reports, more probably than not renders the [complainant\u2019s] testimony incredible.[<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">I agree. Whether a jury would believe the complainant\u2019s version of events in light of the newly discovered evidence remains an open question. I simply note the gravity of the evidence and would hold that it makes a different result probable on retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">II. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RULING</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The majority opinion correctly holds that the trial court abused its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment because it ruled that impeachment evidence \u201ccannot form the basis for . . . granting] ... a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">I also believe that the trial court gave insufficient weight to the potential effect of the newly discovered evidence when considering defendant\u2019s motion for new trial. Instead, it commented on the testimony that went to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">Finally, this Court takes strong exception to defense counsel\u2019s version of the facts that came out at trial for the jury\u2019s consideration as contained in his Motion for New Trial. The statement of facts as contained in the Prosecutor\u2019s brief on this motion is much closer to my remembrance of the trial evidence. My point in commenting on this is that there was ample and strong competent evidence for the jury to convict Defendant independent of [the complainant\u2019s] testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">This analysis failed to recognize that the complainant\u2019s testimony was essential to defendant\u2019s convictions. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>it ignores the powerful effect of the newly discovered evidence on the complainant\u2019s credibility. Accordingly, I would further hold that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to properly weigh the newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">I would hold that the newly discovered evidence constitutes material exculpatory evidence and satisfies the fourth <em>Cress </em>factor, making a different result probable on retrial. Accordingly, my preference would be to vacate defendant\u2019s convictions and remand this case to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> <em>People v Cress, </em>468 Mich 678, 692; 664 NW2d 174 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\"> In <em>Graham v Inskeep, </em>5 Mich App 514, 524; 147 NW2d 436 (1967), the Court of Appeals opined that trial courts are generally in the best position to determine whether newly discovered evidence would tend to produce a different result on retrial. <em>Graham, </em>reasoned that trial courts are in closest contact with the parties. They have tried the case, have heard the relevant witnesses\u2019 testimony, and are therefore in the best position to evaluate the proper weight to be afforded newly discovered evidence. However, the judge who presided over defendant\u2019s triad and denied defendant\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment has retired. Thus, <em>Graham\u2019s </em>reasoning has no applicability here. There is no legitimate reason to remand this case to the trial court for assignment to a new judge unfamiliar with its lengthy history, factual background, and legal intricacies. Thus, the dissent\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]he trial court possesses a superior ability to assess in the first instance the strength and importance of the newly discovered evidence in relation to the evidence presented at trial,\u201d <em>post </em>at 363, is unfounded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> MRE 801(c) defines \u201chearsay\u201d as \u201ca statement, other than the one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b390-5\"> These instances include (1) an alleged rape in Michigan when the complainant was 6 years old, (2) an alleged sexual assault by a female member of the complainant\u2019s church congregation when the complainant was between 10 and 12 years old, (3) alleged sexual assaults by the complainant\u2019s brother when she was a child, (4) alleged sexual assaults by the complainant\u2019s father when she was a child, (5) the alleged rape by defendant in this case, (6) alleged rapes in California that her husband and brother were \u201cin on,\u201d (7) the alleged rape that occurred in a California parking lot, (8) the recanted allegation of rape at a Colorado hotel, and (9) an alleged gang rape committed by her brother and his friends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b390-6\"> The dissent argues, <em>post </em>at 352 n 34, that I have developed an exculpatory defense theory that the complainant engaged in a \u201cscheme\u201d to make false rape accusations. Not so.

My analysis in this regard tracks the language of MRE 404(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 18, 2004 (Docket No. 251427), p 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> MCR 6.201(C)(2) provides, \u201cIf a defendant demonstrates a good-faith belief, grounded in articulable fact, that there is a reasonable probability that records protected by privilege are likely to contain material information necessary to the defense, the trial court shall conduct an in camera inspection of the records.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\"> <em>People v Stanaway, </em>446 Mich 643, 677; 521 NW2d 557 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 649, 684.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\"> <em>Stanaway </em>considered a situation in which \u201c[t]he defense theory is that the claimant is a troubled, maladjusted [person] whose past trauma has caused her to make a false accusation . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682.

Rather, consistently with <em>Stanaway </em>and MCR 6.201(C)(2), it <em>may </em>conduct a review if there is a reasonable probability that the privileged records are likely to contain information necessary to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Similarly, I do not rely on the complainant\u2019s psychological records in assessing whether defendant has met his burden of showing that a different result is probable on retrial. I simply note how the newly discovered evidence might make possible the admission of those records on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> MCL 750.520j.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> <em>People v Jackson, </em>477 Mich 1019 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> <em>People v Hackett, </em>421 Mich 338, 348; 365 NW2d 120 (1984) (emphasis added; citations omitted). The dispositive question regarding the timing of a past false rape accusation and its admissibility is not when a false rape allegation occurred relative to the case at bar. Rather, given a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, it is sufficient that any prior false allegation occurred before a complainant testifies at trial. To hold otherwise would lead to unjust results.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Consider the following hypothetical situations. In the first situation, the complainant alleges that defendant A raped her. While the case against A is pending, the complainant makes other rape allegations against defendants B, C, and D. Then she recants her allegations against A, B, and C.

While the case against A is pending, the complainant makes other rape allegations against defendants B, C, and D that she later recants. Under the dissent\u2019s erroneous view, defendant A would not be permitted to cross-examine the complainant regarding the false rape allegations against defendants B, C, and D. This would be because he was unfortunate enough to have been accused first. Such a result is untenable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"> See <em>White v Coplan, </em>399 F3d 18, 24 (CA 1, 2005) (\u201cIf the prior accusations were false, it suggests a pattern and a pattern suggests an underlying motive . ...\u201d); see also <em>Stanaway, </em>446 Mich at 682 (recognizing that a complainant\u2019s unresolved prior sexual abuse could produce a false accusation).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\"> Without <em>any </em>supporting analysis, consideration of our rules of evidence, or application of governing caselaw, the dissent states as an ipse dixit that the newly discovered evidence might not be admissible on retrial. By contrast, I have carefully outlined how at least portions of the newly discovered evidence could be admissible notwithstanding the fact that hearsay is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Furthermore, the dissent claims that on remand, the trial court should consider only admissible evidence when determining whether the newly discovered evidence satisfies <em>Cress. </em>This is incorrect.

The expanded record may include letters, affidavits, documents, [and] exhibits . ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The dissent also indulges in considerable speculation about evidence the prosecution might seek to enter into the record on remand to defeat the grant of a new trial. I have avoided such speculation in part because it tends to lead the legal analysis far astray for no useful or appropriate purpose. And it is unavailing. For example, the dissent speculates that the prosecution may show that the complainant\u2019s false California assault claims were the product of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by defendant\u2019s alleged assault. But, of course, defendant might show that the complainant\u2019s claim against him in this case was the product of post-traumatic stress disorder caused by sexual assaults she suffered as a child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b394-9\"> <em>United States v Quiles, </em>618 F3d 383, 392 (CA 3, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\"> <em>People v Barbara, </em>400 Mich 352, 363-364; 255 NW2d 171 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> <em>Quiles, </em>618 F3d at 392.

This argument misses the point. The exculpatory connection between the new evidence in this case and the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial is that the new evidence tends to show defendant\u2019s innocence.

Thus, on retrial and in light of defendant\u2019s new evidence, a jury might find the complainant less credible if it believes that she was wrong about seeing defendant and the ring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> <em>Barbara, </em>400 Mich at 363-364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b399-8\"> See <em>Quiles, </em>618 F3d at 392.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b400-12\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued <em>October 29, 2009 </em>(Docket No. 274148), p 15 (Gleicher, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b401-6\">MARKMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJu\">(concurring). I concur with the majority that the test set forth in <em>People v Cress, </em>468 Mich 678, 692; 664 NW2d 174 (2003), for determining when a new trial is warranted on the grounds of newly-discovered evidence, can be satisfied by impeachment evidence. I further agree that such evidence may be of a general character and need not contradict specific testimony at trial. Rather, it is sufficient that such evidence have an exculpatory and material connection to testimony at trial, and otherwise satisfy the <em>Cress </em>test. Particularly in cases involving one-on-one credibility contests, I believe that the test adopted by the dissent may deprive a defendant of a new trial where newly-discovered evidence does not contradict specific testimony but nonetheless renders a new result probable upon retrial because no crime at all was committed. I also agree that newly-discovered impeachment evidence will only rarely justify the grant of a new trial, that this evidence cannot satisfy <em>Cress </em>if it concerns immaterial or collateral matters, and that it will be the exceptional case in which the necessary \u201cexculpatory connection\u201d to testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>mony concerning a material matter will exist and a different result will be probable on retrial. Finally, I agree that it is appropriate to remand this case to the trial court so that it can evaluate defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial in light of our clarified <em>Cress </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">I write separately, however, for two reasons. First, I wish to clarify that I do not join Justice MARILYN KELLY\u2019s concurrence with her own majority opinion for the same reason that I disagree with the dissenting opinion. Contrary to each of these opinions, I find this to be one of the most difficult and puzzling criminal cases that has come before this Court in recent years, and I am considerably less certain than my four colleagues as to how this matter should presently be resolved. I cannot join Justice KELLY\u2019s concurring opinion because, as the dissenting opinion compellingly observes, there is significant existing evidence of defendant\u2019s conduct that suggests guilt. I also cannot join the dissenting opinion because, as Justice KELLY compellingly observes, there is much about the accuser\u2019s conduct that suggests that guilt could never have been established almost exclusively on the basis of the accuser\u2019s testimony had the newly-discovered evidence been available to the jury. As a result, I am satisfied to remand to allow the trial court to assess the <em>entirety </em>of the available evidence in applying the <em>Cress </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Second, I write separately to summarize both the newly-discovered and the existing evidence that must be considered by the trial court upon remand. The trial court clearly believed that impeachment evidence could <em>never </em>establish the basis for a new trial, and therefore can be said to have abused its discretion as a matter of law. <em>Koon v United States, </em>518 US 81, 100; 116 S Ct 2035; 135 L Ed 2d 392 (1996). Now that this Court has clarified that such evidence <em>can </em>under the proper circumstances establish such a basis, a remand is appropriate for the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>consideration of <em>Cress. </em>A review of the newly-discovered evidence in this case indicates the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\u2014In California, approximately four months after the reported assault at issue in this case (but before the complainant reported that assault), the complainant called her father and told him she had been kidnapped and was being held in a room with no windows. Her father told the police he did not believe the complainant, explaining that he was \u201cafraid it\u2019s just a smoke screen\u201d because complainant \u201clikes to have a lot of attention.\u201d Finally, the complainant\u2019s husband told police that her clothing and toothbrush were missing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">\u2014Police discovered that the complainant was actually in California staying with friends, and that she had told those friends that she had been raped several times, including by her brother in Colorado, and that her husband had been \u201cin on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">\u2014When contacted by police, the complainant stated that a man and woman had kidnapped her at knife point, driven her to a concrete block room with no lights or windows, and given her six large, white pills. The complainant stated that the man robbed her of her jewelry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">\u2022 \u2014 The complainant then recanted her report of the robbery and kidnapping, stating that it \u201cnever occurred\u201d and that her friends, whom she had met in an online rape support group 18 months earlier, had picked her up from the restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u2014The complainant explained that she had joined the rape support group <em>before </em>being raped in Michigan because \u201cshe was raped when she was six years old\u201d and \u201cshe has been in and out of support groups and therapy for years.\u201d However, the complainant\u2019s husband expressed \u201ca difficult time believing [she] was telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">\u2014The complainant told the police that she had planned to spend the night with her friends without telling her husband or family and had fabricated the kidnapping story to \u201cbuy some time\u201d to be alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-11\">\u2014The complainant then gave a third version of what happened outside the restaurant, one that was strikingly similar to the assault at issue here. The complainant told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the police that she never went in the restaurant; instead, a man grabbed her, put a knife to her back, and assaulted and raped her in the restaurant parking lot between two parked cars. The complainant then stated that she went in to the restaurant and had lunch with her family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-4\">\u2014When asked about the complainant\u2019s reported rape in the parking lot of the restaurant, her mother reported that the complainant was never alone in the parking lot of the restaurant. Rather, the complainant had gone in the restaurant with the rest of the family and appeared fine at lunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">\u2014When the complainant went to the hospital after reporting the rape in the restaurant parking lot, she told the police that the man had inserted a small, hand-held, gray flashlight into her vagina, as well as penetrating her digitally and then with his penis. The complainant said that the man wore a green mask and fled when she began screaming and hitting him. The complainant \u201chad some injuries consistent with a sexual assault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">\u2014The complainant then told the police that in Colorado she had been raped by her brother\u2019s friend, who had \u201ctracked her down\u201d at her motel. She later recanted this story and denied that any assault had occurred in Colorado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">\u2014The complainant told the fianc\u00e9 of her friend from the online rape support group that her brother and his friends had gang-raped her 18 months earlier and that they had been convicted. The complainant said that her brother had found her in Colorado after he was released from jail and raped her again and that she thought her husband was also involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">\u2014The complainant\u2019s friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9, a police officer, reported that the complainant had lied to them, that she might be mentally unstable, and that he was worried she might raise false allegations about him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">\u2014As the majority opinion observes, the California police reports \u201cshow that complainant reported to police, family or friends that she had been raped by at least eight different people on at least nine separate occasions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">On remand, the trial court should consider this newly-discovered evidence in conjunction with the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>both inculpatory and exculpatory, that was previously offered at trial. This includes at least the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">\u2014Although the complainant claimed that defendant raped her in a Meijer parking lot during the middle of the day, no witnesses reported seeing or hearing anything at Meijer that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-6\">\u2014The complainant considerably delayed reporting the alleged sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">\u2014The complainant provided varying accounts of the alleged assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">\u2014The physician who examined the complainant after the alleged assault testified that there were other possible explanations than rape for the complainant\u2019s physical injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">\u2014The complainant picked a person other than defendant out of a corporeal lineup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">\u2014The complainant claimed that she believed she saw defendant wearing the gold ring he wore during the alleged assault more than a year after defendant had pawned the ring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">\u2014Although the complainant admitted that she knew that DNA evidence could be obtained from clothing, she threw away all the clothing she had worn during the alleged assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">\u2014Defendant was employed at the store at which the assault allegedly occurred and worked on that date, with his shift beginning shortly after the assault allegedly took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-13\">\u2014The complainant identified defendant after viewing more than 7,500 photographs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">\u2014The complainant described her attacker as having a skull tattoo on his upper right arm, and defendant had such a tattoo on his upper right arm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">\u2014Defendant lied about owning and pawning a ring that fit the complainant\u2019s description of her attacker\u2019s ring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">\u2014Defendant dramatically altered his appearance shortly before his corporeal lineup.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u2014Medical and lay testimony reflected that the complainant suffered injuries to her face, shoulder, neck, arms, thighs, and vagina that were consistent with her testimony that she had been sexually assaulted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">When applying the <em>Cress </em>factors to a motion for a new trial, the trial court may consider only two classes of evidence: the claimed newly-discovered evidence and the evidence presented at the previous trial. Any evidence that falls outside these classes is plainly beyond the scope of the <em>Cress </em>process.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Precisely because of the very considerable strengths and the very considerable weaknesses of the evidence arrayed against defendant, this is a case in which a remand is appropriate so that the trial court can properly evaluate <em>all </em>of the evidence before rendering a final judgment on whether a new trial is warranted. This is a truly difficult and perplexing case, which makes it even more important that the trial court itself <em>first </em>consider the evidence in light of our clarification of the <em>Cress </em>test.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b406-6\">ZAHRA, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjQ\"><em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part). </em>I concur with the majority that the four-part test set forth in <em>People v </em>Cress<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is used to determine whether a defendant has established entitlement to a new trial, and I further concur that newly discovered evidence that impeaches a witness may, in rare cases, be grounds for a new trial if it satisfies the <em>Cress </em>test. Specifically, I agree that a material, exculpatory connection must exist between the newly discovered evidence and significantly important evidence presented at trial, but I strongly disagree that \u201cit may be of a general character and need not contradict specific testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 300. Rather, I believe that new impeachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>evidence could make a different result probable on retrial only if it directly contradicts material trial testimony in a manner that tends to exculpate the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because I do not believe that defendant\u2019s new impeachment evidence satisfies the <em>Cress </em>test in this case, I dissent from the majority\u2019s application of the <em>Cress </em>test and its decision to remand this case to the trial court to again address this issue. The new evidence offered to impeach the complainant does not contradict <em>any </em>of her testimony at trial or address in any manner the events in this case. More importantly, this case did not hinge on the complainant\u2019s uncorroborated account of this assault. Substantial independent evidence at trial corroborated the complainant\u2019s testimony that defendant raped her:</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u2022 The complainant identified defendant after reviewing 7,800 photographs at a police station over the course of four to five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u2022 Defendant worked at the very Meijer store in whose parking lot the rape occurred, and his shift began shortly after the rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u2022 The complainant described a \u201cgold nugget\u201d ring that her attacker wore and used to rape her, and defendant pawned just such a ring <em>a mere four days after the rape, </em>but then denied to the police that he had ever owned such a ring until presented with evidence that he had pawned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\u2022 The complainant described a skull tattoo that defendant had on his upper right arm, a tattoo that was not visible when defendant was wearing his Meijer uniform.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">\u2022 Defendant radically altered his appearance shortly before a lineup, to such an extent that the police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>who had seen defendant <em>earlier that day </em>to tell him about the lineup could not recognize him.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u2022 Medical and lay testimony reflected that the complainant suffered injuries to her face, shoulder, neck, arms, thighs, and vagina that were consistent with her testimony that defendant had beaten and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In my view, the majority fails adequately to account for this independent evidence in concluding that a remand is required to determine whether a different result is probable on retrial. Consider what a jury would have to believe in order to find that the complainant fabricated her rape claim. The jury would have to be convinced that the complainant, in perpetrating her false claim, spent four to five days at the police station looking at nearly 8,000 photographs and then was somehow able to select a person who (1) worked at the Meijer store at which complainant claimed the rape occurred, (2) began his shift shortly after the time of the alleged rape, (3) happened to own a gold nugget ring just like the one the complainant described, (4) happened to pawn that ring a few days after the alleged rape, (5) subsequently denied pawning the ring until presented with evidence that he did so, and (6) happened to have a skull tattoo on his upper right arm as complainant described. Not only would the jury have to believe all of this, but it would also have to conclude that defendant, despite his innocence, chose for some reason to alter his appearance by shaving his head and beard before a lineup. And a jury would also have to discount lay and medical testimony regarding the complainant\u2019s multiple injuries that were consistent with the beating and rape that she described.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In light of the substantial evidence that did not depend on the complainant\u2019s credibility, I cannot conclude that a jury on retrial would probably acquit defendant on the basis of the new impeachment evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>dence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">A trial court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> An abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court\u2019s decision falls outside the range of reasonable and principled outcomes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cA mere difference in judicial opinion does not establish an abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The majority correctly articulates the four-factor test that must be met before a new trial may be granted on the basis of newly discovered evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">For a new trial to be granted on the basis of newly discovered evidence, a defendant must show that: (1) the evidence itself, not merely its materiality, was newly discovered; (2) the newly discovered evidence was not cumulative; (3) the party could not, using reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced the evidence at trial; and (4) the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">This test has existed in our caselaw for more than a century.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The only factor in dispute here is whether the new evidence makes a different result probable on retrial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>In <em>Spray v Ayotte, </em>this Court explained, \u201cOrdinarily a new trial will not be granted because of newly discovered evidence to impeach a witness.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subsequent cases have applied this principle in the criminal context.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I agree with the majority that our caselaw has not characterized this principle as a strict, per se rule prohibiting the grant of a new trial because of newly discovered impeachment evidence, even though some Court of Appeals panels have apparently treated it as such.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the principle enunciated in <em>Spray </em>simply recognizes that it is only in rare cases that newly discovered impeachment evidence will satisfy the traditional four-factor test for granting a new trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The question thus arises regarding what unusual circumstances could permit newly discovered impeachment evidence to satisfy the <em>Cress </em>test. This Court in <em>Spray </em>cited the Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure, which delineates the exceptions to the general rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">Ordinarily a new trial will not be granted for newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>discovered evidence to impeach a witness. Thus evidence to show that a witness had made statements inconsistent with his testimony or to contradict him on immaterial or collateral matters is seldom ground for a new trial. But evidence of contradictory statements made by a witness on whose testimony a doubtful verdict was founded has sometimes been held sufficient cause for setting aside the verdict. Newly discovered evidence to successfully contradict a witness upon a material matter may be cause for allowing a new trial, and it is no objection to such allowance that the evidence may incidentally impeach a witness.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Thus, newly discovered evidence that contradicts particular and material statements in a witness\u2019s testimony could potentially satisfy the four factors for granting a new trial, as opposed to newly discovered evidence that only serves to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Both federal and Michigan caselaw support this explanation for when a new trial is warranted. For example, in <em>United States v Saada, </em>a prosecution witness who testified pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government was later caught on tape urging another indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>vidual to falsely implicate an innocent person <em>in another case </em>in order to receive a reduced sentence on a pending charge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendants sought a new trial on the basis of this new evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that the new evidence did not satisfy the requirements for granting a new trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In particular, the court noted that the new evidence was \u201conly impeaching\u201d and that there was \u201cno exculpatory connection\u201d between the witness\u2019s act of urging someone to falsely implicate an Innocent person in another case and the defendants\u2019 crimes.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Moreover, the new evidence would probably not have produced an acquittal because there was sufficient evidence of guilt independent of the witness\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Relying in part on <em>Saada, </em>the Third Circuit in <em>United States v Quiles </em>summarized the general principle regarding newly discovered impeachment evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">[L]ong experience has shown that newly discovered evidence that is <em>merely </em>impeaching is unlikely to reveal that there has been a miscarriage of justice. There must be something more, i.e. a factual link between the heart of the witness\u2019s testimony at trial and the new evidence. This link must suggest directly that the defendant was convicted wrongly. ... When this connection is not present, then the new evidence is merely impeaching and its revelation does not warrant granting a new trial.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Therefore, \u201c[w]hen asked to grant a new trial solely on the basis of new impeachment evidence, a court care<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>fully should examine whether the defendant has demonstrated the necessary exculpatory connection between the evidence and the offense or has demonstrated that the newly discovered evidence totally undermined critical inculpatory evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The exculpatory connection must be \u201cstrong.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201c[d]etermining the strength and importance of the exculpatory connection or the significance of the newly discovered evidence with respect to the credibility of critical evidence given at the trial is a difficult task that is left in the first instance to the discretion of the [trial] court.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Recently, in <em>People v Armstrong, </em>we applied a similar analysis in the analogous context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>Armstrong, </em>the defendant\u2019s attorney failed to introduce cellular telephone records that revealed the complainant\u2019s frequent attempts to contact the defendant after his alleged rapes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In concluding that the defendant was prejudiced by this failure, we acknowledged that the complainant\u2019s credibility at trial had been challenged in various ways, including with evidence that she had falsely accused another person of rape on a prior occasion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cAlthough unquestionably significant, such attacks had less of a tendency to undermine the complainant\u2019s credibility than the cell phone records, which would have provided documentary proof strongly suggesting that the complainant lied to <em>this </em>jury regarding her actions in connection with the alleged rapes in <em>this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>case.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> That is, \u201c[t]he cell phone records revealing frequent communication with defendant following the alleged rapes would have cast serious doubt on the <em>substance </em>of her accusations.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In light of these authorities, I conclude that newly discovered evidence to impeach a witness could potentially make a different result probable on retrial if it directly contradicts material testimony by that witness at trial in a manner that tends to exculpate the defendant. By contrast, new evidence that merely impeaches a witness on a collateral or immaterial matter, unrelated to the substance of the charges in the case at hand, lacks the requisite exculpatory connection to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In this case, defendant has failed to establish an exculpatory connection between the newly discovered evidence and the offense at issue. The new evidence consists primarily of police reports concerning events that occurred in California more than four months <em>after </em>the rape in this case.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The police reports contain no information that contradicts or even addresses the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial regarding the rape that occurred in this case. Thus, because the reports do not contradict <em>any </em>evidence presented at trial, let alone <em>material </em>evidence, an exculpatory connection simply does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">What the California police reports do contain can only be described as a confusing series of hearsay statements attributed to the complainant regarding other purported sexual assaults that occurred at vari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>ous points in her life, including during her trip to California and during her childhood. Some of the hearsay statements are secondary or tertiary hearsay within hearsay. Although the reports suggest that the complainant retracted her accusation regarding an alleged assault in Colorado on her way to California and also retracted a claim that she was kidnapped in California, the record contains no direct evidence of falsity regarding the other alleged sexual assaults. It is thus not clear on what grounds the vast majority of the purported accusations would be admissible on retrial. Nor is it apparent on what theory the evidence of sexual-assault claims that occurred <em>after </em>the rape in this case would be admissible. Although a \u201cdefendant should be permitted to show that the complainant has made <em>false </em>accusations of rape <em>in the past,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>no established theory of relevance has been identified for the admission of <em>subsequent </em>allegations of rape or of allegations for which <em>no evidence of falsity has been presented.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Also, the reports contain no evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct that would be probative of bias or an ulterior motive to make a false charge.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In her concurrence, Justice MARILYN KELLY aggregates the newly discovered hearsay evidence to engage in a speculative enterprise that would grant a new trial on the basis of evidence that might never even be admitted \u2014 and indeed might not even be admissible \u2014 at trial. However, when considering whether newly discovered evidence satisfies the <em>Cress </em>standard, the reviewing court should only consider admissible evidence.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Even assuming, however, that the substance of the California police reports is somehow relevant and could be admitted, it is not clear whether a jury would find that this new evidence undermines the complainant\u2019s credibility to such an extent that the jury would disbelieve her testimony that defendant had raped her in Michigan four months earlier. Whatever exculpatory theory defendant might offer to explain the newly discovered evidence,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> he simply has not established that a jury would more likely accept that theory than the prosecution\u2019s explanation, which is that the rape <em>in this case </em>caused the complainant to suffer from an emotional trauma that led to her subsequent actions in California. The prosecution explained this theory at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for relief from judgment or a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>I would represent to the Court, I followed up on that when I received this material and I talked to an expert in the area of mental health and gave them the scenario and asked specifically: Is this unusual? Because that\u2019s what the defense has been representing to the Court here this morning, that this is outrageous, this is just unheard of that something like this would happen four to five months after a rape. But what this professional tells me is it\u2019s not unusual at all. You\u2019ve got a victim suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. She\u2019s not been able to deal with what happened to her in that parking lot at Meijer. It hasn\u2019t been resolved. It hasn\u2019t even been reported to critical key people and so she\u2019s decompensating and that\u2019s what he told me and I fully expect, your Honor, had we had to hash this out in front of a jury, that not only he but other experts would come in and support that suggestion that this is not unusual behavior but, in fact, it corroborates what happened to her. It reinforces the fact that she had been through a traumatic experience in May of that year, which ultimately led to this behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In short, it is far from obvious that any exculpatory defense theory would be more believable to a jury than the prosecution\u2019s theory that the rape caused an emotional trauma leading to the events in California. Remember, it is <em>the defendant\u2019s </em>obligation to satisfy the <em>Cress </em>factors,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> including the fourth factor requiring that \u201cthe new evidence makes a different result <em>probable </em>on retrial.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Given that defendant has failed to articulate why a jury on retrial would more likely believe an exculpatory defense theory over the prosecution\u2019s alternative theory that is consistent with defendant\u2019s guilt, the fourth <em>Cress </em>factor has simply not been satisfied, and defendant is not entitled to a new trial.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Further undermining any exculpatory defense theory is that substantial independent evidence of guilt corroborated the complainant\u2019s testimony that defendant raped her.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The trial in this case was not a simple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201che said/she said\u201d credibility contest. When testifying regarding the beating and the digital and penile penetrations by the use of force that defendant committed after he approached her minivan in a Meijer parking lot, the complainant described a \u201cgold nugget\u201d ring, containing several small stone chips and ridges, that defendant inserted into her vagina with the middle finger of his left hand during the assault. When questioned by the police, defendant initially denied that he had ever owned <em>any </em>jewelry, including a gold nugget ring. But when presented with evidence that he had pawned a gold nugget ring at a business called The Hock Shop a mere four days after the alleged rape, defendant admitted that he had indeed pawned the ring there. The owner of The Hock Shop identified defendant at trial as the person who pawned the ring four days after the rape, and the owner\u2019s records confirmed that defendant did so.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>In addition, defendant worked at the Meijer store in whose parking lot the rape occurred. His shift started shortly after the rape. Defendant also had a skull tattoo on his upper right arm that would not have been visible when he was wearing his Meijer uniform. The complainant identified such a tattoo when describing defendant, stating that she saw part of the tattoo during the assault. A Meijer employee testified that employees are not required to wear their uniforms on the way to work; they are permitted to wear street clothes and then change when they arrive.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The complainant identified defendant after looking at 7,800 photographs at the police station over a period of four to five days. The first 6,800 photographs that she reviewed were contained in eight loose-leaf books. The books did not contain any identifying information regarding the persons in the photographs. She then looked at approximately 1,000 photographs in digital format on a computer. The digital format also did not reveal any identifying information about the persons shown. An officer testified that after the complainant had reviewed approximately 1,000 digital photographs, she became \u201cquite emotionally upset, left the computer, went into a separate room crying and very visibly emotionally upset.\u201d She then informed the officer that she had found the picture of the man who attacked her. Defendant was the person depicted in the photograph. The picture was taken a little more than two months after the rape in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A lineup was then held. On the morning of the lineup, an officer went to defendant\u2019s house to tell him to appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>for the lineup. When the officer saw defendant at his house that morning, he had \u201clong hair, the long goatee-type, scraggly-looking beard. Unkept [sic]. He looked very unkept [sic].\u201d Later that day, the officer went to the police station lobby to get defendant for the lineup. The officer testified: \u201cThere was [sic] several people sitting around in the lobby and I went back in, he wasn\u2019t -1 said he wasn\u2019t there. I didn\u2019t recognize him in the lobby.\u201d The officer then learned that defendant actually had been sitting in the lobby when the officer went to look for him. The officer had not recognized defendant in the lobby because \u201c[h]e had shaved all of his hair off, all of his facial hair, completely, completely changed the way I\u2019d seen him hours earlier.\u201d A second officer who had seen a photograph of defendant also looked for him in the lobby, saw several people, and \u201cdidn\u2019t believe he was there.\u201d The second officer explained that she did not recognize defendant because \u201c[h]e appeared very different from the photograph that I had seen of him.\u201d In particular, when he arrived for the lineup defendant \u201cwas pretty well clean-shaven, his head, his face.\u201d He also appeared heavier than in the photograph.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In addition to this independent evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt, evidence of the complainant\u2019s behavior and physical condition following the attack corroborated her testimony. The complainant\u2019s husband testified that when she returned from Meijer that day, she looked panicked and terrified. She also had a cut near her mouth. The complainant immediately went to her bedroom.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> When her husband followed her into the bedroom and asked her what had happened, the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ant \u201cwas quite upset. She had a hard time finishing any sentences. Just kind of incoherent, rambling.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Within the next day or two, the complainant\u2019s husband saw large bruises on both of her arms and legs, including on her thighs. The complainant was still very upset when she went to the emergency room four days after the assault, and she had difficulty relating the event. Also, the police officer who took the initial report two days after the assault saw a large scratch on the complainant\u2019s face and bruises on her shoulder. He testified that she was complaining of soreness on her chest, arms, and \u201cpretty much all over.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> A friend whom the complainant had told about the rape three days after it occurred testified that the complainant was \u201cvery slow in speaking,\u201d distant, and fearful.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">The complainant first went to the emergency room two days after the assault. She did not disclose the sexual nature of the assault at that time but was treated for injuries to her left shoulder, neck, and arm.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Her left arm was bruised and swollen and was placed in a sling. Two days later, the complainant called her gynecologist and reported that she had been sexually as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>saulted and wanted a full exam because she was growing worried about possible repercussions given that her assailant had not used a condom. She told the gynecologist about the penile penetration. The gynecologist directed the complainant to go back to the emergency room. Later that day, the complainant returned to the emergency room and reported the digital penetration but not the penile penetration.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> A full rape kit was not prepared because only a digital penetration was reported and four days had passed since the assault. The complainant reported vaginal pain. An examination revealed internal abrasions on the right side of the vagina and the cervical area deep in the vagina. The attending physician testified that although other explanations were possible, his findings were consistent with a forceful digital penetration and a forceful penile penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Eleven days after the rape, the complainant saw her gynecologist, who testified that the complainant was anxious and depressed. An examination revealed abrasions and scratches along the inner labia. The vaginal area was normal, but \u201c[t]he vaginal area heals very quickly. So over a matter of a few days those would probably no longer be visible.\u201d Abrasions that had occurred 11 days earlier would have been \u201chealed by that point.\u201d The gynecologist also observed \u201cobvious\u201d bruises on the complainant\u2019s arms and inner legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">More than a year later, the complainant told the police about the sexual nature of the assault after she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>saw someone in a car behind her who matched the description of her assailant. The complainant explained that she went to the police because she felt \u201cstronger\u201d at that point and \u201cwasn\u2019t willing to live in fear anymore. I was ready to do what I needed to do. To get the person off the street who hurt me and changed my life.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> It was then that she reviewed the 7,800 photographs at the police station and identified defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It is noteworthy that, as the Court of Appeals majority observed, defendant had already impeached complainant\u2019s credibility at trial</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">by pointing out that she did not immediately report the nature of the attack and further, that her descriptions of the attack, while not wholly inconsistent, were incremental in the manner that she released the information to her husband and to the authorities. The [California] police reports of events that took place <em>after </em>the victim told several people that she had been raped and <em>after </em>objective evidence thereof had been obtained does not cast much doubt on events that took place several months earlier in Michigan.[<footnotemark>48</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In short, defendant has not established that a different result is probable on retrial because (1) the newly discovered evidence does not contradict any material (or, for that matter, immaterial) evidence presented at trial or pertain in any way to the offenses committed in this case, (2) the complainant had already been impeached in various ways at trial regarding her failure to immediately report the nature of the attack, and (3) significant objective evidence corroborates complainant\u2019s testimony that defendant raped her. As the Court of Appeals majority explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">[T]he significant objective evidence \u2014 defendant\u2019s presence in the vicinity of the crime, the victim\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s tattoo and ring, defendant\u2019s denial that he owned the ring, defendant\u2019s pawning of the ring only four days after the attack, the victim\u2019s identification of defendant\u2019s picture, defendant\u2019s radical change in appearance during the short time between being told to attend a lineup and his appearance therein, and medical evidence of injuries consistent with a sexual assault \u2014 did not involve the victim\u2019s credibility and were legally sufficient to support defendant\u2019s convictions. Moreover, none of it is affected in any way by the California police reports.[<footnotemark>49</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">To reach a different result on retrial, then, a jury would have to conclude not merely that the complainant fabricated her rape claim, but that after going through 7,800 photographs, she found the proverbial needle in the haystack, somehow choosing a photograph of an innocent man who coincidentally (1) worked at the location of the alleged rape, (2) was in the vicinity at the time, (3) had a ring like the one she described, (4) pawned the ring four days later, (5) subsequently denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ever owning such a ring or, for that matter, any jewelry, (6) had a skull tattoo on his right upper arm like the one she described, and then (7) inexplicably shaved his head and heard right before a lineup.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And this conclusion must be reached despite the complainant\u2019s medically documented injuries that were consistent with a rape and a beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We must not overlook that our review of this issue is deferential. It was the trial court, not the members of this Court, who tried the case and heard the evidence and thus was \u201cwithout question ... in the best position to determine if the new [evidence] would tend to produce a probable different result on a retrial.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The trial court possessed a superior ability to assess in the first instance the strength and importance of the newly discovered evidence in relation to the evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> The majority states that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>abused its discretion by denying a new trial because it erroneously believed that impeachment evidence could never be the basis for a new trial. However, the trial court also took note of the significant evidence of guilt that was independent of the complainant\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">Finally, this Court takes strong exception to defense counsel\u2019s version of the facts that came out at trial for the jury\u2019s consideration as contained in his Motion for a New Trial. The statement of facts as contained in the Prosecutor\u2019s brief on this motion is much closer to my remembrance of the trial evidence. My point in commenting on this is that there was ample and strong competent evidence for the jury to convict Defendant independent of [the complainant\u2019s] testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">This conclusion regarding the independent evidence of guilt fell within the range of reasonable and principled outcomes and fully supports the decision to deny a new trial. Therefore, to the extent that the trial court also based its decision in part on an erroneous line of Court of Appeals caselaw, reversal is not required. \u201cA correct result may be reached and affirmed, although based on a wrong reason.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Finally, the majority cites no authority for its assertion that \u201c[t]he only facts that the trial court should consider in deciding whether to grant a new trial are those in the newly discovered evidence and those in the record.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 321. Whatever the merits of this unsupported assertion,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> it is difficult to square with Justice MARILYN Kelly\u2019s concurrence, in which she opines that \u201cthe newly discovered evidence has evidentiary value because, on trial, it may permit defendant access to the complainant\u2019s medical, counseling, and psychological records,\u201d including the complainant\u2019s rape-support-group records. <em>Ante </em>at 326. <em>None </em>of those records are part of the newly discovered evidence, nor are they in the record. Thus, <em>under the majority\u2019s own opinion, </em>consideration of those records would appear to be entirely off limits in deciding the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In conclusion, I concur that the <em>Cress </em>test is used to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a new trial and that new impeachment evidence may, in rare cases, satisfy the <em>Cress </em>test. In particular, I <em>agree </em>with the majority that a material exculpatory connection must exist between the new impeachment evidence and significantly important evidence presented at trial, but I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>strongly disagree that such new evidence \u201cmay be of a general character and need not contradict specific testimony at trial.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 300. New impeachment evidence could make a different result probable on retrial only if it directly contradicts material trial testimony in a manner that tends to exculpate the defendant. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s application of the <em>Cress </em>test and its decision to remand this case to the trial court. The trial court reached a reasonable and principled outcome by denying a new trial because the new impeachment evidence here does not make a different result probable on retrial. I would therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b430-4\">Young, C.J., and Mary Beth Kelly, J., concurred with Zahra, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\"> <em>People v Cress, </em>468 Mich 678; 664 NW2d 174 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> See, e.g., <em>People v Armstrong, </em>490 Mich 281, 291-292; 806 NW2d 676 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\"> <em>Cress, </em>468 Mich at 691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-12\"> <em>People v Blackston, </em>481 Mich 451, 460; 751 NW2d 408 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b409-13\"> <em>Cress, </em>468 Mich at 691.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b409-14\"> <em>Id. </em>at 692 (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b409-15\"> See, e.g., <em>Canfield v City of Jackson, </em>112 Mich 120, 123; 70 NW 444 (1897); <em>People v Pizzino, </em>313 Mich 97, 110; 20 NW2d 824 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b409-16\"> The prosecution conceded in the trial court that defendant had satisfied the other three factors.

The Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network indicates: \u201cA flashback is when memories of past traumas feel as if they are taking place in the current moment. Many survivors of sexual violence experience these emotional returns to the trauma, believing themselves to be back at the scene of the attack or abuse.\u201d &lt;http://rainn.org/effects-of-sexual-assault/flashbacks&gt; (accessed July 30, 2012).

Moreover, it is widely recognized that the <em>Brady </em>standard is <em>more </em>\u201cdefendant-friendly\u201d than the standard for granting a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence. See, e.g., <em>United States v Agurs, </em>427 US 97, 111; 96 S Ct 2392; 49 L Ed 2d 342 (1976); <em>Connolly, </em>504 F3d at 212; <em>United States v Frost, </em>125 F3d 346, 382 (CA 6, 1997); <em>United States v Duke, </em>50 F3d 571, 576-577 (CA 8, 1995); <em>United States v Johnson, </em>380 F Supp 2d 660, 678 (ED Pa, 2005). Thus, even under a <em>more </em>defendant-friendly standard for granting a new trial than the one that applies here, it is recognized that the force of impeachment evidence is diminished when the witness\u2019s testimony is supported by strong corroborating evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\"> Defense counsel suggested at oral argument that defendant might have forgotten that he owned the ring. But given that defendant initially denied to the police not merely that he had owned such a ring hut that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>had ever owned <em>any jewelry whatsoever, </em>it seems unlikely that a jury would believe that defendant entirely forgot that he once owned a gold nugget ring and then pawned it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b420-7\"> Although portions of the Meijer parking lot were subject to surveillance video, the officer who reviewed the tapes testified that \u201c[tjhey\u2019re absolutely poor quality. You couldn\u2019t see - just barely make out the cars themselves. Poor quality, we could not see anything on the tapes.\u201d Also, a Meijer employee acknowledged that there were areas of the parking lot that the cameras did not cover and that it was difficult to identify people the further they were from the doors. The complainant testified that she parked between two vehicles, \u201cquite a ways from the doors.\u201d Further, the video of the parking lot is displayed inside the Meijer store. Thus, defendant, a Meijer employee, could have regularly watched the video to determine whether a particular area of the parking lot was covered by the cameras. As the prosecutor observed during closing argument, defendant \u201cknew that parking lot. He knew that store. He knew what the video showed and what it didn\u2019t show. And when he found his vulnerable victim, he took his chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">On a related note, although defendant notes that the attack occurred in a parking lot in daylight hours and that no one reported seeing the assault, the circumstances of the assault reflect that defendant took steps to minimize the chance of the complainant\u2019s being seen or heard by others. The complainant, who was getting out of her minivan when defendant attacked her, testified that she fell back into her vehicle after defendant punched her face with his fist. She then fell farther back into the vehicle when he hit her again, causing her to lose consciousness with her head between the two front bucket seats of the vehicle. After the complainant regained consciousness and tried to sit up, defendant pulled her pants and underwear down around her knees. When the complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>saw defendant\u2019s erect penis and realized what was going to happen, she tried to sit up partway, but defendant hit her several times in the chest and collarbone to knock her back down, calling her \u201ca stupid bitch.\u201d Defendant then stated, \u201c[T]his will shut you up\u201d and, after sliding his ridged gold nugget ring to the middle knuckle of his finger, inserted his finger and the ring into her vagina. Reacting to the pain, the complainant called defendant a \u201cbastard,\u201d and in response defendant cut her face by striking her with the back of his hand. The complainant tried to scream, but it was difficult for her to breathe because of having been struck several times in the chest, which knocked the wind out of her. After defendant inserted his penis into the complainant\u2019s vagina, she again lost consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Thus, given that (1) the attack occurred largely inside the complainant\u2019s vehicle, into which defendant had pushed her and which was parked between two other vehicles \u201cquite a ways from the doors,\u201d and (2) defendant\u2019s repeated battering of the complainant rendered her unconscious for part of the assault and made it difficult for her to breathe or scream, the evidence indicates that defendant\u2019s own actions decreased the likelihood that anyone would see or hear the complainant as he beat and raped her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b422-6\"> Just like the police officers who were unable to identify defendant before the lineup, the complainant was also unable to identify defendant after he changed his appearance for the lineup.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> The complainant testified that she went to the bedroom because her children were sitting in the kitchen and she did not want them to see her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b423-5\"> According to the complainant, she did not tell her husband about the sexual nature of the assault at that point because \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to face [it] myself.

Admitting it to [the officer] would he admitting it to myself.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b423-7\"> The complainant testified that she did not disclose the rape during this first visit to the emergency room because she was in a room with six other beds and because she had already taken a shower and did not think anything could be done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b424-7\"> The attending physician, a male, acknowledged that not all patients are comfortable with him and that female victims are sometimes uncomfortable telling male physicians about being raped.

As the prosecutor explained at oral argument, the point of this testimony was not to establish that defendant <em>actually </em>was the person driving behind her that day or that the person was wearing the same ring that defendant was wearing on the day of the assault, but that the complainant\u2019s observation of a person matching defendant\u2019s description was what led her to report the sexual nature of the assault to the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\"> <em>People v Grissom, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued October 29, 2009 (Docket No. 274148), p 10.

In her separate concurring opinion, Justice Marilyn Kelly says that the judge who tried this case has now retired, that a new judge will be assigned on remand, and that my discussion of the deference owed to the trial court is thereby unfounded. But as my analysis makes clear, I am deferring to the <em>original </em>trial judge who <em>already </em>denied defendant\u2019s motion for new trial; this is <em>the very same judge </em>who tried the case and heard the evidence. Thus, it is entirely appropriate to accord deference to the trial court.
