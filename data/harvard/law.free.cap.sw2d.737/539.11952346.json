He requested the Circuit Court for Robertson Counfy to delete the requirement that he return his son to his former wife on Sunday morning during his visitation to enable the boy to accompany his mother to church. The trial court denied the father\u2019s request on the ground that it was not in the child\u2019s best interests to modify the existing visitation arrangements. The father has perfected this appeal. He insists that the trial court erred by structuring his visitation with his son in a way that prevents his son from accompanying him to church. The evidence does not show that the parents\u2019 different religious beliefs are affecting the welfare of the child. Therefore, we vacate the trial court\u2019s order and remand the case with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">Milton Dewayne Neely and Sarah Beth Soapes Neely were divorced on April 9, 1985. Sarah Neely was given custody of the parties\u2019 minor son who was five years old at the time of the divorce. The trial court, specifically recognizing that \u201ca minor child\u2019s relationship with both parents should be as strong as possible\u201d, directed that Mr. Neely would have visitation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>his son \u201cevery other Friday from 6:00 p.m. until Sunday at 6:00 p.m.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Mrs. Neely was an active Baptist at the time the divorce was granted. She regularly took her son to church on Sunday for morning and evening services. Mr. Neely did not attend church regularly at that time. Therefore, the trial court included the following provision in the divorce decree that is at the heart of the present dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">The court recognizes that on Sunday mornings it is important that Jason be in church. On weekends that Jason is with his father, the Plaintiff, Milton Dewayne Neely, shall leave the minor child at the home of his mother ready and dressed thirty (30) minutes prior to the start of church services. The Plaintiff shall have the right to pick up the minor child after church services for visitation until 6:00 P.M.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Following the divorce, Mr. Neely moved from Robertson County to Davidson County. He remarried and began to attend a Pentecostal church regularly.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">In October, 1985, Mrs. Neely filed a petition in the trial court seeking to hold Mr. Neely in contempt because he was not returning their son on Sunday morning so she could take him to her church. Mr. Neely filed a counter-petition insisting that his relocation to Davidson County and his regular church attendance were changed circumstances warranting a modification of the visitation provisions of the original divorce decree. Specifically, he asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">That at the time of the hearing of the divorce, the Defendant/Counter-Plaintiff was not going to church and has now joined a church and is attending regularly. The Court should not specify as to which church the child goes to, but the father should be entitled to take the child to his church on alternating weekends when he exercises visitation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Mrs. Neely replied to this petition that Mr. Neely should not be permitted to take their son to the Pentecostal church. At the hearing on this petition, she explained that she wanted to raise her son as a Baptist and that she objected to the Pentecostal belief concerning \u201cspeaking in tongues.\u201d She insisted that her son would be \u201cconfused\u201d if Mr. Neely were permitted to take him to the Pentecostal church. Mrs. Neely did not question the sincerity of Mr. Neely\u2019s religious beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">The trial court heard proof on the parties\u2019 petitions on February 7, 1986 and issued two orders, one on February 28, 1986 and another on March 7, 1986.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court found that \u201cno purpose would be served\u201d by holding Mr. Neely in contempt. It also held that Mr. Neely\u2019s regular church attendance since the divorce was granted was a changed circumstance. However, the trial court declined to modify the existing visitation arrangements stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-14\">The Court finds that Jason needs stability and needs to know where his church is and where his home is and to be comfortable with that knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">Mr. Neely filed a Tenn.R.Civ.P. 59 motion requesting that the trial court amend its order on the ground that it deprived \u201cthe non-custodial parent the right to expose his children to his religious beliefs.\u201d The trial court entered an order on April 24, 1986 stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-16\">The Court finds that the proper standard in determining whether an order of visitation should be changed is the \u201cbest interests of the child.\u201d The Court finds that the child, JASON, is a young child of very impressionable age. It is important that the child has developed friendships with other children even if these relationships have developed through Jason attending church with his mother. At the time of the entry of the original order of visitation, the defendant, MILTON DEWAYNE NEELY, was not aat-tending church services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-17\">The Court finds that JASON needs the stability of knowing where his home is and where his church is and he needs to be comfortable with that knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The Court does not intend and does not indicate to anyone that it can or would try to make a choice between the religion of either parent. The court cannot make any statement (sic) regarding religious beliefs and finds that the issue before this Court is one of the stability and best interest of the child. The Court finds that amending the original order of visitation will not maintain the stability that JASON needs and is not in JASON\u2019s best interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\n<em>The Rights of Natural Parents</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">The relationship between parent and child occupies a unique place in our legal culture. Natural parents have fundamental interests in their children, <em>State ex rel. Bethel v. Kilvington, </em>100 Tenn. 227, 236, 45 S.W. 433, 435 (1898), which are more precious than property rights and more significant than the liberties derived from shifting economic arrangements. <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services of Durham County, </em>452 U.S. 18, 38, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 2165, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). This Court has found these interests to be the \u201cmost basic of civil rights.\u201d <em>In re Riggs, </em>612 S.W.2d 461, 469 (Tenn.Ct.App.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 921, 101 S.Ct. 1370, 67 L.Ed.2d 349 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Tennessee Supreme Court has recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">The right to the society of the child exists in its parents; the right to rear it, to its custody, to its tutorage, the shaping of its destiny, and all of the consequences that naturally follow from the relationship are inherently in the natural parents, and they cannot be deprived of these rights without notice, and upon some ground which affects materially the future of the child. <em>In re Knott, </em>138 Tenn. 349, 355, 197 S.W. 1097, 1098 (1917).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has held that parents have the right and the duty, free from governmental interference, to nurture their children, to direct their destiny and to inculcate moral standards, religious beliefs and elements of good citizenship in them. <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 233, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1542, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Name of Jesus and Mary, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-35, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">When divorce ends the marriage of a child\u2019s natural parents, the primary responsibility for the care of the child rests with the custodial parent. However, the noncustodial parent\u2019s interests in the child are not completely extinguished following a divorce. <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>271 Pa.Super. 19, 412 A.2d 139, 144 (1979). See also Note, <em>The Religious Upbringing of Children After Divorce, </em>56 Notre Dame Law 160, 169-70 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">The courts should not lightly and without good cause sever the non-custodial parent\u2019s right to the care and companionship of a child. See <em>Stubblefield v. State ex rel. Fjelstad, </em>171 Tenn. 580, 587, 106 S.W.2d 558, 560 (1937). This Court has recognized that it is important for a child to maintain a relationship with the non-custodial natural parent. <em>Dillow v. Dillow, </em>575 S.W.2d 289, 291 (Tenn.Ct.App.1978). Accordingly, we have held that visitation provisions in a divorce decree should be modified if they prevent the relationship between the child and the natural parent from growing and developing normally. <em>Bryan v. Bryan, </em>620 S.W.2d 85, 88 (Tenn.Ct.App.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">The rights, desires, and interests of the parents become secondary in child custody and visitation cases. <em>Riddick v. Riddick, </em>497 S.W.2d 740, 742 (Tenn.Ct.App.1973). The welfare and best interests of the child are the paramount considerations. <em>Luke v. Luke, </em>651 S.W.2d 219, 221 (Tenn.1983). However, the rights of the parents cannot be ignored and must be weighed in the balance when a court makes a decision that will affect the parent/child relationship. Courts should attempt, to the extent warranted by the facts, to devise a custody and visitation arrangement that interferes with the parent/child relationship as little as possible. <em>In re Marriage of Mentry, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 260, 267-68, 190 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>843, 848-49 (1983); <em>State ex rel. Juvenile Department of Polk County v. Tucker, </em>83 Or.App. 330, 731 P.2d 1051, 1053 (1987). However, when the parents remain at odds, the best interests of the child may require some limitations on the rights and interests of either or both of the parents. <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>118 Mich.App. 227, 324 N.W.2d 582, 584 (1982); <em>Felton v. Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 418 N.E.2d 606, 607 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\n<em>Disputes Concerning a Child\u2019s Religious Upbringing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The freedom of choice in matters of family life is also a fundamental liberty interest. <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 753, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1394, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). Thus, the vast majority of matters concerning the upbringing of children should be left to the conscience, patience, and self-restraint of their natural mother and father. No end of difficulties arise when the courts begin to tell parents how to bring up their children. <em>In re Marriage of Mentry, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 260, 267, 190 Cal.Rptr. 843, 848 (1983). However, the courts are invariably called upon to make these decisions after parents have been divorced. No other area of parental disagreement presents a court with a more intractable problem than disputes involving a child\u2019s religious upbringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Courts must maintain strict neutrality in cases involving religious disputes between divorced parents. <em>Compton v. Gilmore, </em>98 Idaho 190, 560 P.2d 861, 863 (1977); <em>Zucco v. Garrett, </em>150 Ill.App.3d 146, 103 Ill.Dec. 558, 563-64, 501 N.E.2d 875, 880-81 (1986); <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>118 Mich.App. 227, 324 N.W.2d 582, 585 (1982); <em>Burnham v. Burnham, </em>208 Neb. 498, 304 N.W.2d 58, 61 (1981); <em>Munoz v. Munoz, </em>79 Wash.2d 810, 489 P.2d 1133, 1135 (1971) (en banc). Thus, this Court and others have held that the parties\u2019 religious beliefs cannot be controlling in custody cases. <em>Mollish v. Mollish, </em>494 S.W.2d 145, 152 (Tenn.Ct.App.1972). <em>See also </em>H. Clark, <em>The Law of Domestic Relations in the United States, </em>\u00a7 17.4, at 588-90 (1968); Annot., 22 A.L.R.4th 971 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">The religious beliefs of both parents are important. <em>Cissell v. Cissell, </em>573 S.W.2d 722, 724 (Mo.Ct.App.1978). In fact, the law tolerates and even encourages, up to a point, the child\u2019s exposure to the religious influences of both parents even if they are divided in their faiths. <em>Felton v. Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 418 N.E.2d 606, 607 (1981). Thus, a court cannot prefer the religious views of one parent over another unless one parent\u2019s religious beliefs and practices threaten the health and well-being of the child. <em>In re Marriage of Short, </em>698 P.2d 1310, 1313 (Colo.1985) (en banc); <em>In re Marriage of Knighton, </em>723 S.W.2d 274, 278 (Tex.Ct.App.1987). In the absence of a showing of harm to the child, visitation provisions cannot have the effect of advancing one parent\u2019s religion while inhibiting that of the other parent. <em>Sanborn v. Sanborn, </em>123 N.H. 740, 465 A.2d 888, 894 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Most courts considering religious disputes between divorced parents have declined to interfere with a non-custodial parent\u2019s exposing a minor child to his or her religious beliefs in the absence of a clear and affirmative showing that these activities and expressions of belief are harmful to the child. <em>In re Marriage of Murga, </em>103 Cal.App.3d 498, 506, 163 Cal.Rptr. 79, 82 (1980); <em>In re Marriage of Hertford, </em>586 S.W.2d 769, 772 (Mo.Ct.App.1979); <em>In re Marriage of Knighton, </em>723 S.W.2d 274, 278 (Tex.Ct.App.1987); <em>Munoz v. Munoz, </em>79 Wash.2d 810, 489 P.2d 1133, 1135 (1971). <em>See also </em>3 <em>Child Custody and Visitation Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 16.02[3][h] (1986); 27C C.J.S. <em>Divorce, </em>\u00a7 634 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">The harm to a child from being exposed to its parents\u2019 conflicting religious beliefs cannot be simply assumed or surmised. It must be demonstrated in detail. <em>Felton v. Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 418 N.E.2d 606, 607 (1981).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, a custodial parent\u2019s asser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tions that the child will be harmed or might be confused do not provide a court with a sufficient basis to interfere with the noncustodial parent\u2019s interests in exposing a child to his or her religious beliefs. <em>In re Marriage of Mentry, </em>142 Cal.App.3d 260, 266, 190 Cal.Rptr. 843, 847 (1983); <em>Felton v. Felton, </em>383 Mass. 232, 418 N.E.2d 606, 610 (1981); <em>Robertson v. Robertson, </em>19 Wash.App. 425, 575 P.2d 1092, 1093 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AsB\">\n<em>The Trial Court\u2019s Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Anq\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s decision regarding visitation and custody is governed by Tenn.R.App.P. 13(d). Thus, we review the record de novo with the presumption that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are correct. <em>Hass v. Knighton, </em>676 S.W.2d 554, 555 (Tenn.1984). However, we review the details of the trial court\u2019s custody and visitation arrangements to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Edwards v. Edwards, </em>501 S.W.2d 283, 291 (Tenn.Ct.App.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"AnKF\">A trial court\u2019s decisions involving custody and visitation, once made, are final and will not be modified unless the trial court is satisfied that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the divorce decree was entered. <em>Young v. Smith, </em>193 Tenn. 480, 485, 246 S.W.2d 93, 95 (1952); <em>Long v. Long, </em>488 S.W.2d 729, 731-32 (Tenn.Ct.App.1972). There are no hard and fast rules concerning what constitutes a \u201cchanged circumstance.\u201d <em>Dantzler v. Dantzler, </em>665 S.W.2d 385, 387 (Tenn.Ct.App.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AgUx\">We concur in the findings of fact contained in the trial court\u2019s order that: (1) Jason is a young child of impressionable age; (2) Jason has developed relationships with other children by attending church with his mother; (3) Mr. Neely did not attend church when the original divorce decree was entered; and (4) Mr. Neely\u2019s regular church attendance following the divorce is a changed circumstance. However, we have concluded that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to delete the requirement that Mr. Neely must return his son to Mrs. Neely during his visitation period to enable her to take the hoy to her church.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">The trial court apparently believed that preserving this restriction on Mr. Neely\u2019s visitation rights would enable his son to maintain relations with the children he met at his mother\u2019s church and to know \u201cwhere his home is and where his church is.\u201d We have determined that the restriction of Mr. Neely\u2019s visitation rights goes too far. There is no proof in the record that the boy will not be able to maintain relations with his friends by attending church with his mother every other Sunday morning and every Sunday evening. There is likewise no proof that exposing the boy to his father\u2019s religion has or will affect his mental or physical well-being. Mrs. Neely\u2019s subjective and presently unsubstantiated belief that her son could become confused does not provide a sufficient basis for the courts to interfere with the natural development of the relationship between Mr. Neely and his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the trial court is vacated. This case is remanded to the trial court for the purpose of entering an amended custody and visitation order deleting the requirement that Mr. Neely return his son to Mrs. Neely on Sunday morning when he is exercising his visitation rights. The costs of this appeal are taxed to Sarah Beth Soapes Neely and to Milton Dewayne Neely and their respective sureties in equal proportions for which execution, if necessary, may issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b576-7\">TODD, P.J., and CANTRELL, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\">. These two orders embody the same subject matter and appear to be the parties\u2019 respective versions of the trial court\u2019s ruling on February 7, 1986. We have determined that these two orders should be read together as the ruling of the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\">.
