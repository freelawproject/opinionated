INTRODUCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">On March 13, 2009, a notice to appear was issued to appellant pursuant to the automated traffic enforcement statutes (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21455.5-21455.7), alleging she failed to stop at a red signal light located at the intersection of Centinela Avenue and Beach Avenue in the City of Inglewood. Following a court trial wherein photographic evidence obtained from an automated traffic enforcement system (ATES) was admitted, appellant was convicted of failing to stop at a red signal light (Veh. Code, \u00a7 21453, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-12\">Appellant presents the following contentions: (1) the photographs depicting the traffic violation were inadmissible because no foundation was established that the photographs were reasonable representations of what they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>alleged to portray, and they constituted hearsay; (2) the yellow light interval of the traffic light did not conform to the requirements of Vehicle Code section 21455.7; (3) the prosecution\u2019s use of photographic evidence violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses; and (4) the prosecution failed to prove appellant was the driver depicted in the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">In affirming the judgment, we acknowledge the Appellate Division of the Orange County Superior Court has held that claims similar to those addressed in part III.A. warrant reversal of the judgment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Khaled </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 796].) Specifically, <em>Khaled </em>held photographs from an ATES purporting to show the defendant driving through a red light were inadmissible because the testifying officer (1) was not a percipient witness and, therefore, could not establish that the photograph was a \u201c \u2018 \u201creasonable representation of that which it is alleged to portray . . .\u201d \u2019 [citation]\u201d; or (2) could not, like a person who set up a \u201c \u2018nanny cam,\u2019 \u201d establish the time the camera was set to record and the method used to retrieve the photographs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. Supp. 5.) In addition, <em>Khaled </em>held the photographs constituted inadmissible hearsay in that they were not admissible business records (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1271) or official records (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1280). <em>(Khaled, </em>at pp. Supp. 6-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">We respectfully disagree with <em>Khaled. </em>As explained below, it is our view that photographs taken by an ATES may be admissible even if the testifying officer was not a percipient witness to the violation and was not personally responsible for setting up the camera. We conclude the accuracy of the photographs is subject to a rebuttable presumption pursuant to Evidence Code sections 1552, subdivision (a), and 1553. Moreover, apart from such a presumption, the photographs may be authenticated by a law enforcement officer who has knowledge about the methods used by the ATES to transmit the photographs to the officer\u2019s law enforcement agency. Finally, the data and images on the photographs did not constitute hearsay because they did not amount to a \u201cstatement\u201d from a human declarant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">\n<em>II. FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\">Only one witness testified at trial\u2014Investigator Dean Young of the Inglewood Police Department. Investigator Young was assigned to the Traffic Division, Red Light Camera Photo Enforcement. Based on more than six years of experience in this division, as well as the knowledge he acquired from city engineers and the company that maintained the ATES, he explained the issuance of the traffic citation as set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 5\">*Supp. 5</page-number>The ATES located at the intersection of Centinela Avenue and Beach Avenue was implemented in September 2003. It is operated by the police department but maintained by Redflex Traffic Systems (Redflex).</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">On a monthly basis, Investigator Young visually inspects the traffic signal to ensure the duration of the yellow light interval complies with the minimum guidelines established by California\u2019s Department of Transportation. On February 16, 2009, and March 16, 2009, he conducted timing checks of the traffic signal\u2019s yellow light interval, which showed averages of 4.11 and 4.03 seconds respectively. These test results were \u201cwell above 3.9 as established by the Department of [Transportation] for [a 40-mile-per-hour] highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-6\">The ATES is programmed to obtain three digital photographs and a 12-second video when its sensors detect a vehicle in the intersection during a red light phase: a \u201cpre-violation photograph\u201d showing the vehicle behind the limit line; a \u201cpost-violation photograph\u201d showing the vehicle in the intersection; and a photograph of the vehicle\u2019s license plate. A \u201cdata bar\u201d containing the date, time, location, and red light interval is printed on each photograph. The ATES operates independently once triggered, and information from the system is stored on a computer at the scene and retrieved by Redflex technicians through an Internet connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">As indicated in the data bar printed on the photographs of appellant\u2019s violation, the signal light was in the red light phase for 0.27 seconds when the \u201cpre-violation photograph\u201d was taken. In the \u201cpost-violation photograph\u201d taken 0.66 seconds later, appellant was shown in the intersection while the signal light remained in the red light phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-8\">\n<em>III. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmCQ\">A. <em>Authentication and Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">\u201cWe review claims of evidentiary error [for] abuse of discretion .... [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Dixon </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 985, 997 [63 Cal.Rptr.3d 637].) \u201cUnder [that] standard, \u2018a trial court\u2019s ruling will not be disturbed, and reversal of the judgment is not required, unless the trial court exercised its \u2022 discretion in an arbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hovarter </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 983, 1004 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 299, 189 P.3d 300].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">1. <em>Authenticity of a Photograph</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-11\">The authenticity of a photograph is a preliminary fact that must be established by the photograph\u2019s proponent before it may be admitted into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 6\">*Supp. 6</page-number>evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1401, subd. (a) [requiring authentication of a \u201cwriting\u201d]; <em>People v. Beckley </em>(2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 509, 514 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 362] [noting that a photograph is a \u201cwriting\u201d under the Evid. Code].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">Evidence Code sections 1552<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 1553<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> establish a presumption that the data from the ATES and the digital images it captured were \u201can accurate representation\u201d of the information or images contained therein. Under these statutes, the burden of producing evidence casting doubt on the accuracy or reliability of the photographs fell on appellant. She provided no evidence on this point. Without any evidence of inaccuracy, the photographs were properly presumed to be accurate and authenticated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">In any event, notwithstanding the presumption of accuracy, there was sufficient evidence of authentication. \u201cA photograph or other writing may be authenticated by \u2018the introduction of evidence sufficient to sustain a finding that it is the writing that the proponent of the evidence claims it is\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1400) . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Beckley, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.4th at p. 514.) Authentication does not require the person who takes a photograph to testify in order to lay a proper foundation for admission of the photograph into evidence. <em>(Holland v. Kerr </em>(1953) 116 Cal.App.2d 31, 37 [253 P.2d 88].) Rather, authentication of a photograph \u201cmay be provided by the aid of expert testimony . . . although there is no one qualified to authenticate it from personal observation.\u201d <em>(People v. Bowley </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 855, 862 [31 Cal.Rptr. 471, 382 P.2d 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">The officer provided expert testimony regarding the operation of the ATES and the photographs it produces based on information he had from city traffic engineers and Redflex as well as his experience with images obtained from the cameras. He explained that, once the automated system\u2019s sensors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 7\">*Supp. 7</page-number>triggered by appellant\u2019s entry into the intersection during a red light phase, it independently recorded data (i.e., the timing of appellant\u2019s violation) and photographs of her violation, and such digital information was then collected by Redflex employees and sent to the police department. His testimony provided the foundation necessary to demonstrate the photographs were reliable portrayals of data and images contained therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">Thus, even apart from appellant\u2019s failure to rebut the presumption of accuracy, the evidence sufficiently supported the trial court\u2019s determination that the photographs were what the prosecution claimed they portrayed, namely, digital depictions of appellant entering the intersection against a red signal light.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">2. <em>The Photographs Were Not Rendered Inadmissible by the Hearsay Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">\u201c \u2018Hearsay evidence\u2019 is evidence of a statement that was made other than by a witness while testifying at the hearing and that is offered to prove the truth of the matter stated.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200, subd. (a).) A \u201cstatement\u201d in this context \u201c \u2018means (a) oral or written verbal expression or (b) nonverbal conduct of a person intended by him as a substitute for oral or written verbal expression.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cPerson\u201d includes a natural person, firm, association, organization, partnership, business trust, corporation, limited liability company, or public entity.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Hawkins </em>(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1449 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 627].) Because \u201c[t]he Evidence Code does not contemplate that a machine can make a statement,\u201d information generated from a machine does not fall within the bar created by the hearsay rule. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1329-8\">The data bars affixed to the bottom of the photographs were not hearsay, insofar as they were not \u201cinputted\u201d by a person but, rather, were generated by the ATES once the system\u2019s sensors were triggered by appellant. The purpose of the hearsay rule is to subject the declarant to cross-examination in order to bring to light any falsities, contradictions, or inaccuracies that may not be discernible in the declarant\u2019s out-of-court statement. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hawkins, supra, </em>98 Cal.App.4th at p. 1449.) Under no scenario could appellant have cross-examined the ATES to ask what time it recorded appellant\u2019s traffic violation. (See <em>ibid, </em>[noting that a machine cannot consciously misrepresent facts].) Simply put, the data bars were not a \u201cstatements\u201d from a person that were subject to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-9\">As for the images depicted in the photographs, they were demonstrative evidence of appellant\u2019s crime and, hence, did not render the photographs inadmissible under the hearsay rule. <em>People v. Cooper </em>(2007) 148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 8\">*Supp. 8</page-number>Cal.App.4th 731, 746 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 6] [holding that photographs and video \u201care demonstrative evidence, depicting what the camera sees,\u201d and \u201care not hearsay\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">\n<em>IV.
