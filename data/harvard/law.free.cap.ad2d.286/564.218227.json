Memorandum: Petitioner commenced this special proceeding seeking to invalidate the certificate of election of officers of the Chautauqua County Independence Party filed by Randall Brown (respondent). Supreme Court properly granted that part of respondent\u2019s motion seeking dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>missal of the proceeding as time-barred. Petitioner was required to file her verified petition and order to show cause in the county clerk\u2019s office within 10 days of the filing of the contested certificate of election <em>(see, </em>Election Law \u00a7 16-102 [2]; CPLR 304; <em>Matter of Essenberg v Reape, </em>272 AD2d 544; <em>Matter of Zicari v Stewart, </em>207 AD2d 951; <em>Matter of Ehle v Wallace, </em>195 AD2d 1086, <em>lv denied </em>82 NY2d 653), but failed to do so. Respondents filed the certificate of election on September 29, 2000, and thus the 10-day period began to run on September 30, 2000 <em>(see, </em>General Construction Law \u00a7 20). Because the 10-day period expired on October 9, 2000, which was Columbus Day, the last date on which petitioner could have timely filed her petition and order to show cause was October 10, 2000 <em>(see, </em>General Construction Law \u00a7 25-a [1]). Petitioner did not file her petition and order to show cause in the county clerk\u2019s office until October 20, 2000.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We further conclude that the court properly refused to recuse itself. Petitioner sought recusal at oral argument on the ground that Justice Gerace\u2019s son might, in a \"year or so,\u201d be involved in an election for County Sheriff; petitioner asserted that at such time he might seek the endorsement of the Independence Party because he had been endorsed by that party during the last election held for the office of County Sheriff. \u201cWhere, as here, there is no allegation that recusal is statutorily required <em>(see, </em>Judiciary Law \u00a7 14), the matter of recusal is addressed to the discretion and personal conscience of the Justice whose recusal is sought\u201d <em>(Matter of Card v Siragusa, </em>214 AD2d 1022, 1023; <em>see, Shuman v Bower, </em>278 AD2d 860). Petitioner\u2019s allegation of possible bias is too speculative to warrant the conclusion that the court abused its discretion in refusing to recuse itself here.
