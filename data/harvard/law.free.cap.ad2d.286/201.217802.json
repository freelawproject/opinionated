Mars, Appellant, v Andrea R.

The marriage produced two children: Jonah, born July 24, 1993, and Lily, born July 22, 1995. The parties separated in August 1997, and this action, in which each party sought a judgment of divorce, was commenced the same month.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Prior to the marriage, the parties entered into a September 1992 \u201cAgreement in Contemplation of Marriage,\u201d which provides, <em>inter alia, </em>as pertinent to this appeal that the \u201conly monies, assets or things of value\u201d defendant would receive from plaintiff would be a payment comprising $30,000 for the first year of marriage and an additional $10,000 for each subsequent year or part of a year thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The agreement also required plaintiff to deposit the monies to be paid to defendant (i.e., the $30,000 plus $10,000 for each additional year of marriage) into a savings bank account, payable on plaintiff\u2019s death to defendant and requiring both parties\u2019 signatures for withdrawals prior to his death, according to the following schedule: (1) $30,000 within one month after the first day of the marriage; and (2) $10,000 per year thereafter for the duration of the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\">The parties dispute whether plaintiff has made the payments (totaling $70,000, based on the duration of the marriage) required by the pre-nuptial agreement. However, since plaintiff failed to document his alleged payments and the issue was purely one of credibility, there is no occasion to second guess the trial court\u2019s finding that plaintiff \u201chas not proven that any of that amount has been satisfied\u201d or its award to defendant of \u201cthe full amount, pursuant to the formula.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Also, since defendant is, by her own account, a full-time mother who has no plans to return to the workforce, and Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 (1-b) (the Child Support Standards Act [CSSA]) authorizes an award for child care only where the custodial parent is working or receiving work-related education or training (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 [1-b] [c] [4]) or seeking work (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 [1-b] [c] [6]), the award for child care expenses, apparently for a full-time nanny, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The court also vested all decision-making authority in defendant based on its view that plaintiff \u201cis abusive, controlling and has no decent respect\u201d for defendant\u2019s opinions or judgment. While this statement appears to have support in the record, the same could be said of defendant\u2019s attitude toward plaintiff. As attested to by the court-appointed psychiatric expert and the children\u2019s guardian ad litem, both parties are \u201cimpulsive,\u201d \u201chave poor judgment,\u201d and \u201ceach is so centered on obtaining goals or advantages for himself or herself, that all their supposed concern for the best interests of their children may disappear when it conflicts with their own needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">It is undisputed that each parent takes an active interest in the children\u2019s lives and that it is in the children\u2019s best interest that both parents remain involved with them, notwithstanding the parents\u2019 present intolerance for each other. Under these circumstances, the trial court should not have vested all decision-making authority in one parent in a situation where it appears that neither parent can be trusted not to obstruct the other\u2019s relationship with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">While there is significant precedent for dividing decision-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>making between parents, we are aware of no precedent for completely depriving a non-custodial parent, who is otherwise to remain fully involved with the children\u2019s lives, of decision-making authority in all areas. Thus, although we do not think that such authority should necessarily be divided between the parties equally, we feel that the children\u2019s interests are best served by giving plaintiff decision-making authority over the children\u2019s religious upbringing \u2014 an area in which plaintiff apparently takes a greater interest than does defendant \u2014 and over their dental treatment, in recognition of his professional expertise. Like plaintiff, defendant is required to consult with the other parent concerning significant decisions in his areas of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Finally, despite plaintiff\u2019s post-submission withdrawal of that part of his appeal from the trial court\u2019s award of child support and its award to defendant of exclusive occupancy of the marital apartment, we note that the trial court incorrectly determined plaintiff\u2019s liability for child support without engaging in either a calculation using the statutory child support percentage or a detailed analysis of the factors enumerated under Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 (1-b) (f). The explanation the court gave in its decision for departing from the statutory method was simply that \u201c [reference to the guidelines to determine additional child support would serve little purpose in this case.\u201d However, even defendant\u2019s counsel concedes in her brief that \u201cwhen the Court below rejected the amount derived from the statutory formula, it should have set forth that amount in its written order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">While the trial court\u2019s approach may have been proper under the purely discretionary child-support system that preceded its adoption, the CSSA was intended to replace the prior discretionary system with one affording \u201cgreater uniformity, predictability and equity in fixing child support awards.\u201d <em>(Matter of Cassano v Cassano, </em>85 NY2d 649, 652 [citing Bill Jacket materials].) The Court of Appeals has held that CSSA requires the trial court to follow a three-step method for determining the basic child support obligation: (1) calculation of combined parental income; (2) multiplication of the combined parental income, up to $80,000, by the specified child support percentage, and allocation between the parents on a pro rata basis, unless application of the percentage is deemed \u201cunjust or inappropriate\u201d on consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (f), as articulated in a written order (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 [1-b] [g]); and (3) for the amount of combined parental income over $80,000, application either of the child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>percentage or of the \u201cparagraph (f)\u201d factors, and articulation of the reasons for the method used (whether the percentage or the factors) <em>(Bast v Rossoff, </em>91 NY2d 723, 726-727; <em>Matter of Cassano v Cassano, supra, </em>85 NY2d 649, 652-655).
