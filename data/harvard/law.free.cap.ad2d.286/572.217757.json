The record lacks any evidence that plaintiff performed any services that could give rise to any fiduciary duties owed to defendants <em>(see, Northeast Gen. Corp. v Wellington Adv., </em>82 NY2d 158, 162-163). It is clear that once plaintiff introduced the principals in the 310 Madison Avenue transaction, plaintiff was informed that its services were no longer needed. We further find evidence establishing that defendant Harry Macklowe agreed to compensate plaintiff for the finder services performed. Para<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>graph 15 (b) of the contract for the 310 Madison Avenue transaction expressly states that defendant Macklowe agreed to pay plaintiff pursuant to a separate agreement. The admission of plaintiffs performance of brokerage services in the contract entitles it to summary judgment as to defendants\u2019 liability for payment <em>(see, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. v New York Blood Ctr., </em>257 AD2d 64, 67). There remain triable issues of fact as to the actual amount of compensation to which the parties agreed. Therefore, the matter must be remanded to the IAS court for a determination on damages.
