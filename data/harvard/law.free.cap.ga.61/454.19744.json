The power of a court to go back on its own findings and judgments, and reverse them, is a strong one; and in this state, the granting of new trials has been made a subject of constitutional law. Without referring to the earlier constitutions, it is only necessary to cite that of 1868, which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>in treating of the superior courts, declares that <em>\u201c </em>There shall be no appeal from one jury in the superior courts to another; but the court may grant new trials on legal grounds.\u201d Code, \u00a75091. The same constitution (Code, \u00a75084) provides as follows: \u201c The judicial powers of this state shall be vested in a supreme court, superior courts, courts of ordinary, justices of the peace, notaries public, and such other courts as have been or may be established by law,\u201d Other provisions of the constitution treat of the jurisdiction and powers of the several courts and officers named, and on none of them, except the. superior courts? is the power to grant new trials conferred. The superior courts being the highest courts of original jurisdiction known to the constitution, a high power expressly granted to thenvand to none others, ought, we think, to be treated as an exclusive power. There can be no question that the power of entertaining motions for new trials is a very high power. The constitution of 1868 was of force when the attempt was made by the act of February 24th, 1873, to enable the county judges to grant new trials. It follows from what we have said, that, in our opinion, the act was and is, so far, unconstitutional and void. See 55 <em>Ga., </em>222.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
