Before Judge Lester. Lumpkin Superior Court. April Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-10\">Defendants in error brought ejectment-against plaintiff in error, demises being laid both from Patton, executor, and Puckett, who held by deed from him. Both sides claimed under Porter, deceased; Puckett had a deed from his executor, Patton, made after his death under order of the ordinary to perfect titles; Farrow held under a lease from the executor for thirteen years, dated October 8, 1871; the description in the lease was sufficiently general .to cover the land in dispute, and much more besides, but contained this provision: \u201c This lease is subject to all rights deeded to certain parties who purchased lots, from the said deceased, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>said executor, oil either of the first three above named lots, as deeded in these respective deeds, this lease to embrace all of lot No. 971 not previously sold as above stated, etc.\u201d The land in controversy was apart of lotNo. 971. Puckett\u2019s deed was dated August 21, 1875, but recited that it was to perfect title in pursuance of a sale by the deceased in 1869. Some point was made on the regularity of the order by the ordinary under which the deed was made. The jury found for the plaintiffs. Defendant moved for a new trial, which was refused, and he excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-5\"><em>W. </em>P. Price ; R. H. Baker ; H. P. Bell ; R.

The plaintiffs are entitled to recover upon the demise in the name of Porter\u2019s executor, Patton, for the reason that this piece of land sold to Puckett by Porter, was not leased to Farrow, the defendant, but expressly reserved. Farrow holds under a lease from Porter; that lease does not cover this land, because land bargained and sold before the lease was, by its true intent and meaning, reserved from the operation thereof, and this strip was sold before the lease; hence the title, if it did not vest in Puckett on account of any informality in the deed, or the fact that it was made by the executor after Porter\u2019s death, remains in the estate of Porter, and the land can be recovered by his executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">The fact is that Farrow had notice of the claim of Puckett to this land; that he had paid Porter for it in his lifetime, and that the executor had staked it off to Puckett since his decease. He built upon it with his eyes open, and must suffer the consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>There is evidence enough to support the verdict for mesne profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
