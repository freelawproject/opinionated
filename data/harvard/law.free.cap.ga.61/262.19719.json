The complainant also alleges that, on the 27th of December, 1876, her said husband departed this life, leaving no property, no will, and there has been no administration, for the reason that he had nothing to be administered. When the case was called for trial, the court, after hearing complainant\u2019s parol evidence, ruled it out, and the defendant then made a motion to dismiss the complainant\u2019s bill for want of equity. The court sustained the motion, and the complainant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Assuming that the proper parties were before the court, there was no error in dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill. Neither the deed nor a copy thereof was before the court, consequently it did not appear whether it was made upon a good or valuable consideration. According to the facts as disclosed in the record, it was an attempt to annex a condition to a deed for land by parol evidence, there being no allegation in complainant\u2019s bill to lay the foundation for the introduction of such evidence, which parol evidence, the record shows, was offered by the complainant and ruled out before the motion to dismiss the bill was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
