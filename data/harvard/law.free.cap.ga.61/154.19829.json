The court, therefore, erred in deciding that any ministerial officer in this state had jurisdiction or authority to enforce the execution in the record mentioned against the reversionary interest of the defendant in that execution, on the statement of facts contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Let the judgment of the court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
