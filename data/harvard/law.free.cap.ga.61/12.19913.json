Under \u00a7\u00a729o and 308 of the Code, read in connection with \u00a7\u00a74082 and 4083, the county judge has the same power to issue a distress warrant as the justice of the peace, and if the property be replevied and a case <em>made </em>for trial, and the amount sworn to be such a sum as to give the superior court jurisdiction to try and determine, the case may be returned by the levying officer to the superior court for hearing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b13-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>2.

The amount involved being $400.00, the case was returned to the superior court. On the trial, defendant moved to dismiss the warrant for want of jurisdiction in the county judge to issue it, it being for more than he had the power to dispose of; the motion was overruled. The jury found for plaintiff. Defendant moved for a new trial, which was refused, and he excepted. For the other facts, see the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-7\">J. T.

The meaning is clearly that the county judge shall proceed as a justice of the peace would, to issue the w'arrant in all distress cases; and perhaps to try the case throughout, with right of appeal to the siiperior court. But certainly the superior court has jurisdiction to try the case, if returned by the levying officer to that court originally, which was done here, and all we do here is to decide that the county judge may issue the distress warrant, and if over two hundred dollars, that then the superior court may try it when a case is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> In regard to the second point, we think that there is no error for three reasons: first, because the pleadings \u2014 the affidavit of the defendant \u2014 do not authorize the evidence, there being no allegation that anybody pulled down the defendant\u2019s fence and let cattle on 'his crop ; secondly, because there is no offer to prove that plaintiff' committed the tort, or ordered it done; and thirdly, because the damages sought to be recouped do not arise, according to the evidence rejected, out of the contract of rent. See \u00a72910 of Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
