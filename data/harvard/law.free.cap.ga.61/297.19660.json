October Term, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-8\">Mrs. Wilson sued Ashley for a trespass. The declaration alleged that she was the owner of certain land, and had rented it for the-year 1876 to various named tenants for certain specified rent, a part of which was payable in cotton (describing the amounts); that the tenants were good and responsible ; that defendant entered on the land, drove off plaintiff\u2019s tenants, sought to put in tenants of his own, tore down fences, etc., and damaged plaintiff in the sum of $2,500.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-9\">Defendant pleaded the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-10\">On the trial the evidence showed, in brief, the following facts : Defendant did cause his agents to enter on plaintiff\u2019s land and remove certain fencing, etc.; also sent a message to one of the tenants that the latter had better leave, as he could not remain during the year ; also burned rails from the fences. Defendant\u2019s actions caused other tenants to leave. Defendant had a mortgage on the place, which had been foreclosed, and a sale under it was afterwards made in March. He wished to protect the premises and prepare them for rent, feeling certain that he would buy the land, when sold, and for that purpose he acted as he did. He also rented a part of the place, in January, but on taking legal advice, rescinded the contract, and informed the other parties that he could not rent until he bought at the sale. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Before making this contract he had referred the other parties to the husband of plaintiff, and had been informed that the latter refused to rent or have anything to do with it. Defendant thought he had a right to protect the property. When it was sold, however, plaintiff\u2019s son bid it in. Whether the moving of the fences, etc., was an injury or benefit, the evidence was conflicting. The amount of rent contracted for by the plaintiff and her tenants was shown, and the value of five bales of <em>cotton </em>(which <em>formed </em>a part of the rent) in the fall when deliverable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">The jury found for plaintiff $1,000.00. Defendant moved for a new trial, on the following grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">(1.) Because the court allowed a witness, R. B. Wilson, to testify that five bales of cotton, of 500 pounds each, (the amount to be paid by one of plaintiff\u2019s tenants.) would have been worth \u00cdO-J to 13J cents per pound, in Augusta, in the fall, defendant\u2019s counsel objecting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-7\">(2.) Because the documentary evidence in the case was handed to the jury along with the record by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, without the knowledge or consent of defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-8\">(3.) Because the verdict was contrary to law and evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-9\">The motion was overruled provided plaintiff would write off $500.00 from the verdict; and defendant excepted. Plaintiff joined in the exceptions because of the order to write off $500.00.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-10\">J.

On the trial of the case, the juiy found a verdict for the plaintiff for $1,000.00. A motion was made for a new trial on the grounds therein stated, which was granted unless the plaintiff would write off from the vei\u2019dict the sum of $500.00, which the plaintiff did, and then the court overruled the motion for a new tidal, whereupon the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\"><bracketnum>1, 2.</bracketnum> There was no error in admitting the testimony of the witness that the five bales of cotton which Philpot was to give for the rent of the place would have been worth in the fall 10-J to 13^ cents per pound, in Augusta; nor in allowing the papers containing the documentary evidence, such as lettei\u2019s, written contracts, etc., to go out with the jury when they retired to make up their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><bracketnum>8.</bracketnum> It appeal's from the evidence in the record, that the defendant had a mortgage upon the lands on which the trespass is alleged to have been -committed, which had been foreclosed, and that he entered thereon under a mistake as to what were his legal rights, therefore, he was only liable for such damages as were <em>actually </em>sustained by the plaintiff in consequence thereof. It was nota case for exemplary or vindictive damages. There is no more evidence in the record to support the verdict for $500.00, or anything like that amount, than there was to support the verdict for $1,000.00, and the overruling the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, upon the terms prescribed by the coui\u2019t, was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Let the judgment of the court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
