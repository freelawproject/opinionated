The plaintiffs obtained judgment on this last named note on the 8th of September, 1875, execution issued thereon, and was levied on a certain described tract of land as the property of Merritt, who filed his affidavit of illegality alleging that the land levied on had been set apart as a homestead, and was not subject to the payment of the debt on which said judgment and <em>fi. fa. </em>were founded. Upon the hearing of the case, the court decided that the defendant\u2019s homestead was not subject to the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment debt, and dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019levy ; whereupon the plaintiffs excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The note on which the judgment was founded was <em>not </em>given in renewal of a note originally given for the purchase money of the homestead land levied on, as was the case in <em>Wofford vs. Gaines, </em>53 <em>Ga., 485, but was </em>a judgment founded on a contract made subsequent to the adoption of the constitution of 1868, and therefore the setting apart of the defendant\u2019s homestead on his land did not impair the obligation of that contract as prohibited by the constitution of the United States. There was no error in dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 levy on the defendant\u2019s homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
