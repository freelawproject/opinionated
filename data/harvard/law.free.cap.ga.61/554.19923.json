This being the case reported in 59 <em>Go,., </em>213, (the present writ of error arising out of a new trial of the same in the court below) and the presiding judge having, in his charge to the jury on the n&lt;rw_trial, adopted the favorable legal theory, that if the guardian debited himself with notes as cash, he might nevertheless account for the fund as notes only, unless he intended to make them his own and become personally responsible to his ward, and the jury having passed on the truth of his plea, and on his intention, his diligence and his good faith, with no material error of which he can complain in the charge of the court, and the verdict being for a less sum than might have been found under the evidence with strict law applied thereto, and the presiding judge being satisfied with the verdict, his discretion in overruling the motion of the guardian and his sureties for a new trial should not be disturbed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b554-8\">2. Where the case of a guardian, according to the facts in evidence, was not one requiring time in the beginning of the trust to collect assets and ascertain indebtedness, and where he took the office while the act of 1847 (Code, \u00a73608 ; Cobb\u2019s Dig., 336,) was in force with, out the modification wrought by the act of 1866 (Code, \u00a73602; pamph. acts of 1865 \u2014 \u201966, p. 84,) he was not entitled to exemption from interest during the first year after his qualification. A guardian who qualified in 1860, is not affected by the temporary legislation on the the subject of compound interest, which took place pending the war, inasmuch as the first six years of his term had not. expired when that legislation (granting it to have been effective) ceased to operate. See 84 <em>Ga\u201e </em>809.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b554-9\">Guardian and ward. New trial. Interest. Before Judge Underwood. Floyd Superior Court.
