November Term, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-12\">Rollins was placed on trial for the offense of assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>intent to murder, alleged to have been committed on the person of Moses Bacon. He pleaded not guilty. The evidence-made, in brief, this case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">Bacon, with his wife and three other women, was coming from Roswell to Marietta, in a double-seated buggy, on the afternoon of Sunday, September 16th, 1877. Defendant and another man, South by name, met them in the road. Defendant caught the mule by the bridle, saying, \u201chold on, I want to tell you something.\u201d Bacon told him several times to let the mule loose, which he failed to do, saying that he had something to tell him. Bacon got out of the buggy, drew the reins out of defendant\u2019s hands, and told his wife to drive on, which she did. He followed the buggy, and as he was about to get in, defendant shot him with a pistol in the back part of the hip. South urged defendant to let the mule loose, and endeavored to prevent the shooting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">South, introduced by defendant, varied in his testimony from the above statement only in this, that Bacon jumped out of the wagon, and pushed defendant loose, having, at the same time, his buggy whip in - his hand, butt end up ; that he \u201cjowered\u201d with defendant and pushed him one or two steps across the road, just far enough for the buggy to pass. He also stated that he heard no insulting language from Bacon or any of the women with him; that Bacon made no attempt to hit defendant, and that he did not stoop down to pick up a rock until after he was shot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">The defendant\u2019s statement was to the effect that he caught the mule and Bacon told him to turn it loose; that Bacon called him a \u201cdamned son of a bitch\u201d and drew his whip, to which he replied that he did not allow a white man to do that way ; that Bacon turned to pick up a rock and he shot him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">The jury found the defendant guilty. He moved for a new trial because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence, and because of the newly discovered testimony of John G. McGullion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The affidavit of this witness was to the effect, that at the time of the difficulty, deponent and his sister were getting muscadines in the vicinity; that he heard loud talking and Bacon say, \u201cyou son of a bitch ;\u201d that he saw him jump out of the wagon, catch defendant by the neck, push him back against the bank on the side of the road, and draw his whip over the defendant\u2019s head; that the latter said \u201cturn me loose,\u201d and threw up one of his arms when \u201cthe whip went down and defendant\u2019s hair flew up,\u201d and deponent thinks he was struck on the head ; that defendant cried out again \u201cturn me loose,\u201d when Bacon let him go and reached to the ground as if picking up something, when some one, deponent thinks South, said \u201cput down that rock,\u201d and then the pistol was fired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-5\">The motion was overruled and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-6\">J.

Giving it all the weight to which it is entitled, it ought not to vary the result. With, as without, this newly discovered evidence, the two gre'at facts remain, that the prosecutor was first obstructed by the prisoner on the highway, and then shot by him. Apparent is it, also, that whatever violence in language or conduct the prosecutor may have exhibited on the occasion, was wantonly provoked by the aggressive action of the prisoner. There is no dispute that the prosecutor, accompanied by several females, was peaceably traveling through the country on the Sabbath day; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that tlie prisoner, being at the time armed with a deadly weapon, endeavored to arrest his progress, and for that purpose caught his mule by the bridle and failed to let it go when ordered to do so; and that whatever the prosecutor may have said or done, was the consequence of this outrage on the part of the prisoner. Moreover, it is plain from the prisoner\u2019s statement, as well as from the testimony of South, his own witness, that the prosecutor did not strike him with the whip; and even if the attempt to take up a rock preceded the shooting, that was no justification, for had the prisoner behaved himself this would not have occurred. As the prisoner was prepared with a pistol, and was himself the aggressor, what right did he have to shoot the prosecutor to prevent him from taking up a rock ? There was no attempt to throw the rock, and as the shot took effect from behind, the prosecutor was not in a position to throw towards the prisoner at the moment. If death had ensued from the shooting, we can see no reason why such a homicide should not be graded as murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> According to the testimony of South, to say nothing of that of the prosecutor, the verdict was proper. It is amply supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
