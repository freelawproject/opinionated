Before Judge Crawford. Muscogee Superior Court. November Term, 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-5\">This was an action against the railroad company for refusing to allow Miss Hughes to pass over its road on a certain excursion ticket which she had purchased ; the refusal resulted from a mistake on the part of the company\u2019s agents; and in consequence of it, she was compelled to remain in Opelika from the morning of June 10, 1876, until about 11 or 12 o\u2019clock p. m., when the next train passed. The mistake had then been corrected by telegraph, and she was allowed to go to her destination at Columbus. The jury found $50.00 damages. The plaintiff moved for a new trial on various grounds, which are immaterial here. The motion was overruled and plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b132-6\">J. M.

This is the case of a young lady of the same party, in the same excursion, and treated in the same way. The jury found fifty dollars, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>much, more than the actual damage, and she moved for a new trial, it was refused and she excepted. \u00a5e think that the verdict was enough. The case does not demand extraordinary or exemplary damages, and no matter what the court had charged or left uncharged, when the verdict is what it ought to be under the law of the case and the facts thereof, it ought not to be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The ease arose on contract; the suit is really for breach thereof; the conductor acted under a mistake as to the contract, but with politeness and decorum, merely stating that under the telegrams received, he could not take the excursionists back to Columbus from Opelika, on that train ; the agent at Montgomery made an unintentional mistake as to the contract; the young lady was not ejected from the car, but merely left with the others; she shed some tears some witnesses said when she got off the train, but was invited to a relative\u2019s of another young lady, and was well cared for. The mistake did not cost her one cent so far as the record shows, and really the damages, $50.00, is for wounded feelings, all of it, and we think it enough, especially as the Code, \u00a72943 declares that \u201cexemplary damages can never be allowed in cases arising on contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\"We supposg that the verdict is good against the property of the present company, without making the lessees or present owners parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
