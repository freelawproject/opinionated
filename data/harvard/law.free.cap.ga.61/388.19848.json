The summons, in each case, required the appearance of the defendant at a proper time and place, \u201cto answer the plaintiff in an action of debt,\u201d but no description of the debt was therein embraced or thereto attached. Service was acknowledged. Judgments were rendered for the plaintiff, and the cases carried by appeal to the superior court. They were there, by agreement, consolidated and tried together.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Defendant moved to dismiss the suits because the summonses did not plainly and distinctly set forth the cause of action by giving the amount and description of the debts claimed. The motion was overruled and defendant excepted. Yerdicts were rendered for the plaintiff. A motion for new trial was made on the ground that the court erred in refusing to dismiss. _ A new trial was refused and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-5\">John A.

The Code, in section 4139, prescribes that all suits before justices of the peace shall be commenced by written summons, directed to any lawful constable of the county, \u201ccommanding the defendant to appear at the time and place of trial, which time and place shall be specified in said summons.\u201d What else the summons is to contain, if anything, is no where laid down. Nothing is said as to describing the cause of action, or setting out a copy of the note or account, or giving the date or amount thereof. The defendant is to be commanded to appear at the time and place of trial, and the time and place are to be specified ; this is all. Doubtless, in practically administering this scanty provision of the Oode, it is best to go further than the letter of it requires; it is best to describe the cause of action, or add a eppy of it. But there is a difficulty in holding.that it is legally requisite to do more than the Code lays down ; for as something is prescribed for the summons to contain, namely, the time and place of trial and the command to appear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>how can the courts say it shall contain something in addition ? It is enough to rule now that a summons like any of the four described in the record, is sufficient to bring the defendant into court, and that whatever more of detail may be necessary to carry on the suit may be supplied by amendment. Code, \u00a73479; 58 Ga., 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
