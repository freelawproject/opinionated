The force .involved in the offense of forcible entry is private force unlawfully exerted. The public force of the state, lawfully exercised, cannot be the means of a criminal entry. Whoever, in the prescribed.mode, calls the law to his assistance instead of taking the law into his own hands, commits no breach of the peace, though in making the call he may commit perjury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b496-8\">Criminal law.

Affidavit was made in terms of the law, a warrant was duly issued, and a lawful officer executed the same by expelling the tenant, and delivering possession to Sewell, the landlord. It seems that the ground of the conviction was, that the affidavit was corruptly false in alleging that the term had expired. Grant that it was, the indictment and conviction should have been for perjury, not for a forcible entry. The entry was not with \u201c menaces, force and arms, and without authority of law,\u201d but with lawful warrant, executed in a lawful way by a lawful officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
