The judge refused the <em>mandamus </em>nisi, and this is the error complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">While \u00a73650 of the Code does require the notice to be given, we think that the applicant\u2019s remedy is by an action for damages, if he can prove any, and if he has any right or remedy at all. Certainly we know of no law which will entitle him to make the \u25a0 sheriff by <em>mandamus </em>change the advertising back into his newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">The judgment must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
