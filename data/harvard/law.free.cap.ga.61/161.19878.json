The defendants demurred to the plaintiffs declaration, upon the ground that the Eureka Lodge having been incorporated under the laws of this state, was not sued in plaintiff\u2019s action, and that the persons named in the declaration were sued as agents, when the owners of the property should have been sued. The plaintiff then proposed to amend his declaration by inserting, after the word \u201cshoweth,\u201d the following, \u201cthe Eureka Lodge and Leesburg Academy, represented by J. P. Tison, R. B. Armstrong, J. Hill yer, T. H. West and H. L. Long, it appearing that the said persons are the officers of the said lodge, worshipful master and wardens,\u201d and also by striking out the word \u201ccommittee\u201d wherever it appears in the declaration, and insert in lieu thereof the word \u201cdefendants.\u201d The court refused to allow the proposed amendment, and sustained the demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration ; whereupon the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The suit should have been brought against the principals and not against the agents, Code, 3257, 39 <em>Ga., </em>35.
