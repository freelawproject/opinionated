In an action against a municipal corporation for injuries resulting from falling into a cellar door on one of its sidewalks, left open by the owner of the property on its street, there are two questions for the jury; first, is the system adopted by defendant in regard to allowing cellars on its sidewalks, reasonably calculated to insure the safety of those who travel thereon by night or day? Second, if so, is the defendant liable in the special case by reason of negligence in the owner, coupled with notice, actual or constructive, to the city?</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-10\">2. It was error to charge that the question was whether the city \u201c was guilty of negligence in the use of the cellar by the occupant or owner thereof.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b48-11\">S. The question being as to whether the system adopted by the city in regard to allowing cellars on its sidewalks, was reasonably calculated to insure the safety of those who travel thereon, evidence that children upon different occasions had previously fallen into such openings, was admissible.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Municipal corporations.

On the trial of the case, the jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $500.00. A motion for a new trial was made on the grounds therein stated, which was overruled, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\"><bracketnum>1, 2.</bracketnum> This is the second time this case has been before this court. According to the ruling of this court when it was here before, there were two questions to be submitted to the jury: First, was the system adopted by the defendant in regard to allowing cellars on its sidewalks, in front of the business houses thereon,' reasonably calculated to insure the safety of those who travel on them either by day or night <em>% </em>Second, was the defendant liable to the plaintiff for negligence in <em>allowing </em>the use of the cellar by the owner thereof, under the evidence in the case, according to the ruling of this court in <em>Chapman vs. The Mayor, etc., of </em>Macon, 55 <em>Ga. Rep., </em>566 ? See 59 <em>Ib., </em>154. In the case of <em>Chapman vs. The Mayor, etc., of Macon, </em>it was held that if the opening of the cellar door by the owner thereof, was a single act of negligence, the city would not be liable, because it would not be charged with knowledge, nor could notice in fifteen minutes be given to it. But if the owner had been for a long time careless and negligent, the city would be presumed to have notice. The court charged the jury amongst other things, \u201c If you find that the system of cellars with covered doors in the sidewalks, as adopted by defendant, to be reasonably safe and secure, it is then for you to ascertain whether the defendant was guilty of negligence in the use of the cellar by the occupant or owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>thereof; and if you find that the defendant has been guilty of negligence, you should give such damages as to fully compensate the plaintiff for all injuries sustained.\u201d This charge of the court, in view of the evidence in the record, was error. The question^ according 'to ' the ruling of this court, was not whether \u201c the' defendant was guilty of negligence in the use of the cellar by the occupant or owner thereof,\u201d but the question to have been submitted to the jury, was whether the defendant was liable to the plaintiff in damages for negligence in <em>cMowing. </em>the use of the cellar by the owner thereof, under the evidence in the case, when applied to the law as ruled by this court in <em>Chapman vs. The </em>Mayor, <em>etc. of </em>Macon, before cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\"><bracketnum>8.</bracketnum> The evidence of Barker that. \u201c he Jiad seen a child walk backwards and fall into Dr. Campbell\u2019s cellar, and also that he had seen another such instance five OR six years before,\u201d may be considered as bearing remotely upon the question as to the reasonable safety of the defendant\u2019s sidewalks according to the system adopted by it in regard to cellars thereon in front of business houses,'and was therefore admissible for what it was worth in that connection. The overruling of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Let the judgment of the court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
