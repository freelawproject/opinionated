Before Judge Bartlett. Houston Superior Court. May Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-8\">Rainey, as guardian for certain minors, cited Cook, a former guardian, to appear before the ordinary for a settlement. The case was carried by appeal to the superior court. The evidence showed that the defendant had accounted for every dollar received by him, and the sole material question made, was whether he was liable for the amount exceeding the income which he had expended, on account of his failure to obtain orders from the ordinary. It was insisted on his part that as his annual returns showed on their face that his expenditures exceeded the income, and these returns were approved and ordered to record, such facts constituted authority from the ordinary. The testimony disclosed that his expenditures were reasonable and necessary. The jury found for the plaintiff $167.75. The defendant moved for a new trial because the court erred in charging the following propositions, and in refusing to charge to the contrary:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-9\">\u201c He (the guardian) is not allowed to encroach upon the <em>corpus </em>of the estate in his hands for the support of the minors, without having previously acquired an order for that purpose, and the fact that he makes his regular annual returns showing that he is encroaching on the <em>corpus, </em>that these returns have been approved by the ordinary and admitted to record, is not such ratification or allowance by the ordinary as will protect him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-10\">\u201cThe law allows the <em>corpus </em>to be used in certain cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>but before the guardian can so appropriate the <em>corpus, </em>he must make out a petition and present it t\u00e9 the ordinary at a regular term of the court, and an order to so use it must be granted at a regular term, and not at chambers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">\u201c Before Cook could encroach upon the <em>Corpus, </em>he must previously get an order from the ordinary allowing the same. He must make application under the law in writing, set forth the reason why the encroachment is necessary, and this he must do each year. An order granted for more than one year would be invalid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-6\">The motion was overruled, and defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-7\">Eli Warren ; W. S. Wallace, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b453-8\">C. C. Duncan, for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXD\">cited Code \u00a7\u00a71806, 1824; 25 <em>Ga., </em>696; 55 <em>Ib., </em>90; 29 <em>Ib., </em>82.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-9\">Bleckley, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Prior to the adoption of the Code, the question made in this case was settled by several adjudications. 15 <em>Ga., </em>451; 20 <em>Ib., </em>325; 29 <em>Ib., </em>582. It may have been the purpose of section 1824 of the Code to alter the law, but of this we are not certain, and the better ruling always is to hold the old law as still of force where repeal is doubtful. The language which raises the doubt is as follows: \u201c But the expenses of maintenance and education must not exceed the annual profits of the estate except by the approval of the ordinary previously granted.\u201d It is certain that no tribunal but the ordinary can entitle the guardian to take credit for any part of the <em>corpus </em>expended in education or maintenance. In order for the guardian to have his disbursements allowed he must show the approval of the ordinary, in so far as they encroach upon the <em>corpus. </em>That approval must precede the allowance on final settlement, but must it precede the act of disbursing? We think not. Beading sections 1824 and 1825 of the Code together, and comparing them with the prior statutes on the same subject, we rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>that they introduce no exclusive mode by which the ordinary\u2019s consent is to be expressed, and that one of the legal modes still is by approving the regular annual returns of the guardian when the returns show on their face that the expenses have exceeded the income.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
