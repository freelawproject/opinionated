These mortgages contested for the proceeds of the property mortgaged, in the hands of the sheriff; the court below gave it to the senior mortgage, and the question is, is that judgment right ?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The Code, \u00a71357, declares \u201c mortgages not recorded within the time required remain valid as against the mortgagor, but are postponed to all other liens created or obtained, or purchases made, prior to the actual record of the mortgage.\u201d The statute here certified is found in Cobb\u2019s Digest, p. 172, and shows to what sort of lien, if created by mortgage, the older, unrecorded in time mortgage is postponed. That statute reads: \u201c Upon failure to record any mortgage as hereinbefore required, within the time or times hereinbefore specified for recording the same, that then, and in such case, all judgments obtained before the foreclosure of said mortgage, and also any mortgage executed after the same, <em>and d/aly </em>recorded, shall take lien on the said mortgaged property in preference to the said mortgage.\u201d So that construing the statute and the Code together, as in <em>pari </em>materia, it' is clear that the younger mortgage must be duly recorded within the time the law requires before it can postpone the elder. Should they be so construed together ? Unquestionably, unless the statute is superseded by the Code; for the constitution of 1868 (Code, \u00a75145) continues the statutes \u201cnot superseded by said Code, though not embodied therein\u201d as law. This act of 1827 is not superseded by the Code \u2014 this section of it, we mean section 33, because it can stand in entire harmony with the Code. For the Code postpones the older mortgage when not recorded, to liens created after its execution, and the statute enacts that if that lien be a mortgage, it must be recorded in time. Both can stand together, and be construed together, and the- Code will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>held by mere implication \u2014 and that not a strong much less a necessary implication \u2014 to repeal or supersede the statute. <em>We </em>think, therefore, that the older mortgage had the better lien, and that the case was ruled right by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
