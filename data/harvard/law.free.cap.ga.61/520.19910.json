M., of Wayne county, levied two j#. <em>fas., </em>issued from the justice court of said district, in favor of Clary &amp; Whaley against D. T. Dunn, W. S. Blain, G. W. Haines and D. M. Mitchell, upon fourteen acres of land in Jessup, Ga., known as the Black survey, one of said <em>fi. fas. </em>for $83.33 principal debt and costs, the other for $95.17 principal debt and costs, each dated the 28th day of May, 1875, and reciting that they were issued upon judgments rendered in the justice court of said district on December 1st, 1871. The Black survey levied on was complainants\u2019 property, and said <em>fi. fas., </em>with levies thereon, had been returned to the sheriff, who was then proceeding to advertise said property for sale on the first Tuesday in August, 1878. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-12\">On the 27tlf day of July, 1878, complainants tendered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the sheriff an affidavit of illegally to each of said <em>fi. fas. </em>The points made were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-4\">1. That no one of the parties defendants named in said <em>fi. fas. </em>ever had notice served on them of the pendency of any common law suit of any character whatever, or had waived service thereof, or acknowledged service, or ever appeared or pleaded to the merits of the suits in the said justice court in which said judgments purport to have been rendered, or had any notice whatever of the pendency of any common law suit against them in said court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">2. That the <em>fi. fas. </em>were actually proceeding by virtue of two attachments sued out by Clary &amp; Whaley against D. T. Dunn and W. S. Blain as copartners, which were placed in the hands of one George, as constable, who notified defendant, Blain, that h\u00e9 was instructed to levy the same, when said Blain agreed to give bond to the constable for the forthcoming of the property sought to be seized, which he gave, complainants going on the same as security. That the attachments were returnable to the December term, 1874, of the justice court of the 1255th district, G. M. That at said term of said couit judgments were rendered generally against all of said defendants, W. S. Blain, D. T. Dunn, G. W. Iiaines and D. M. Mitchell, and not against Blain <em>&amp; </em>Dunn as principals, and D. M. Mitchell and G. W. Haines as securities, or against the property attached. That there was in truth and fact no levy made upon the property of defendants in attachment, and said <em>fi. fas. </em>have been levied on the property of Haines <em>&amp; </em>Mitchell and not the property sought to be seized by virtue of said attachments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-6\">3. 4 &amp; 5. * * * * *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-7\">6. That the bond signed in said matter was not a bond payable to the plaintiffs in attachment, obligatory to pay them the amount of the judgment they might recover in said case, but was payable to the said George, constable, conditioned for the forthcoming of the property sought to be levied on under said attachments, and not the bond required by the attachment laws, and was therefore void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Complainants aver that the said two affidavits of illegality tendered were true, and that they had never filed any prior affidavits of illegality in said eases, which fact was known to the sheriff. The original attachment papers and judgments thereon had been lost or destroyed, as complainants have been informed and believe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">When said affidavits were tendered to the sheriff by complainants\u2019 attorney, July 27th, 1878, he agreed to receive them and stop the sale, but on July 31st, notified him that he would not receive them and said that the property must sell. Willis Clary and W. H. Whaley were both upon the bond of said sheriff, and his regular advising attorney, John D. Rumph, attorney for said parties, and the said parties had, as complainants believe, advised the sheriff to disregard said affidavits of illegality. The property levied on was worth $1,000.00, but if sold at public sale at present prices would not bring a tittle of its value. Said <em>fi. fas. </em>were void because they could not issue upon an attachment proceeding. Complainants never entered into any obligation connected with any proceeding in favor of said plaintiffs in said <em>fi. fa. </em>other than the forthcoming bond aforesaid, and no valid judgment could be entered thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">Complainants\u2019 remedy is not as complete and adequate by a suit against the sheriff as it is in equity, for the reason that the measure of damages against him would be only the value of the property as ascertained by the bid at said sale, etc., therefore complainants prayed the writ of injunction addressed to said sheriff, plaintiffs in <em>fi. fa. </em>and constable, commanding and requiring them to desist from further attempting to sell said property, and also the writ of subpoena, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">As cause why an injunction should not issue, the defendants Clary <em>&amp; </em>Whaley demurred to the bill because it contained no equity, the remedy at law was complete, and be. cause it was multifarious.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>They also set up, by answer, the following facts : In 1871, Dunn <em>&amp; </em>Blain, being indebted to them for rent $83.33, they sued out before Eloyd, J. P., a distress warrant for that amount, which was levied upon certain personalty as the property of the defendants. A counter-affidavit was filed, and a bond, given in terms of the law, with the complainants as securities. Afterwards, Dunn &amp; Blain becoming indebted to them an additional amount for rent, a second distress warrant was issued and the same proceedings again had. These cases came on for trial before said justice on December Is', when a judgment was rendered in each case against Dunn, Blain, Harris and Mitchell for the amount claimed. On May 28th, 1875, Parker, J. P., Eloyd\u2019s successor, issued executions upon the judgments aforesaid, which were, on June 19th following, levied upon the land described in the bill as the property of Haines and Mitchell. To these levies Blain, in behalf of all of the defendants, interposed an affidavit of illegality, which, upon being returned to the justice court, was overruled, and an appeal entered to the superior court. At the March term, 1878, of the superior court, when said appeal case came on to be heard, a judgment was rendered directing the executions to proceed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">The affidavit of illegality filed by Blain in June, 1875, after uniting the two cases as to amount and stating them as one, proceeds thus : <em>\u201c </em>Before the undersigned, came William S. Blain, one of the defendants in the above stated <em>fi. fct,., </em>who, being sworn according to law, saith that the above stated <em>fi. fa. </em>is proceeding against him and his sureties illegally, for the following grounds, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">Affidavits were read in support of the bill and answer respectively, which leave it in doubt whether the original proceedings, in which the bond was given with complainants as securities, were by attachment or distress warrant. The papers having all been lost or destroyed, there was no way of establishing which theory was correct. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>evidence did disclose, that the bond signed by the complainants was given to the constable for the forthcoming of the property levied on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-5\">The chancellor granted the injunction and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-6\">John D.

Code, \u00a7\u00a73319, 4083. A bond for the production of the property may be binding as a common law bond, but certainly no judgment upon it can be entered up in the main case, or without an action upon the bond. Here, this summary mode of taking judgment was pursued, and for that reason the judgments were void.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The sheriff having refused to receive a good ,and sufficient affidavit of illegality, was subject to be enjoined from making the sale. 47 <em>Ga., </em>400.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> The prior affidavit of illegality, by Blain, was no impediment to an affidavit by Haines and Mitchell, the complainants in the bill.

Both executions were between the same parties, levied by the same officer, on the same property, and were subject to the same objections. The relief prayed against one, and the grounds thereof, were identical with the relief prayed against the other, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>grounds thereof. The bill sought to ward off, by the same means, two blows, with two like instruments, aimed by the same parties 'at the same object. To exact a unity in the bill more strict than this, would be to go beyond the sticklers for the dramatic unities \u2014 the classical purists in dramatic composition, who are to be satisfied with nothing less \u2022.than complete unity of time, of place, and of action.
