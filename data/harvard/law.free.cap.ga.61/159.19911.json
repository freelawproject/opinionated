Insolvency, etc., was alleged. The evidence before the chancellor was conflicting. He granted the injunction, provided that it should be dissolved and the <em>fi. fa. </em>proceed, upon the giving by the principal defendant of a good bond to pay such decree as complainant might recover.

Judgment had been obtained upon a mortgage of realty; it was regularly foreclosed; and the <em>fi.fa. </em>was levied some time after the foreclosure. Possibly there was equity in the bill, but it was sworn off by the answer. Equity will hesitate before enjoining a judgment at all, and the cases in which it is ever done are well defined. Kerr on Injunctions, chap. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The terms are always in the discretion of the chancellor. Kerr, pp. 18-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">Sometimes the chancellor, in a case like this, will require the money to be actually paid in court by the complainant before an injunction shall be directed in his favor. Kerr, p. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">The evidence before the chancellor in this case was conflicting, and he required <em>the defendant </em>in equity to secure the complainant, before he would permit the mortgage <em>fi.fa. </em>to proceed ; and to that end to give bond with good secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>rity to indemnify complainant, if complainant recovered on the hearing; if defendant did this, then he could go on with the collection of the judgment of foreclosure and prosecute his levy, otherwise he was enjoined. Surely the defendant in <em>fi.fa., </em>who is the complainant in equity, and who sought the injunction, could ask no more, and if the chancellor erred at all, it was in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The chancellor in our judgment, as he granted the injunction, was right to modify his order by allowing <em>th&amp;fi.f co-to </em>proceed whenever Davis, the mortgage creditor, gave the bond and security.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
