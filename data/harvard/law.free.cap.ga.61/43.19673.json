A motion was made for a new trial on the several grounds therein stated, which was overruled by the court, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-18\">The evidence is that the defendant cut Freeman on th\u00e9 right side of his neck, and left breast, -with a pocket knife; that defendant was mad with him. The court charged the jury, amongst other things, \u201c that the stabbing being admitted, the law presumes malice, and the presumption becomes conclusive unless it is rebutted by proof. I do not mean to say the defendant must bring witnesses, he may rebut it by the state\u2019s own witnesses.\u201d In view of the evidence in the record, we find no error in the charge of the court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>jury were the proper judges, from the evidence before them, with what intent the stabbing was done by the defendant. There was no error in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
