Equity. New trial. Before Judge Underwood. Floyd Superior Court. January Adjourned Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-10\">Hargrove was appointed commissioner by the superior court of Floyd county to sell the property of the Ridge Yalley Iron Company, which was in litigation. He offered the land at cash sales in parcels. \u2022 The first was bid off by one Elliott, and the second was put up and bid off by Walters. Elliott, however, failed to pay the cash, and the eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>missioner thought it best to re-sell the whole land, which he did. Walters objected and tendered the amount of his bid, but the commissioner nevertheless re-sold. On the second sale the lot brought more than on the first. Walters filed objections to the commissioner\u2019s report of sale. The court sustained the sale, but offered to order a re-sale, if he would petition therefor. Fie declined to do so, and excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\">Daniel S.

The first bidder who was ready to pay for his purchase complained, but the chancellor confirmed the last sale. We think he was authorized to do so. A large discretion is vested in him in passing on these equity sales. The- sale is never consummated until he does confirm it, and in the order here this reservation is expressly made. Rorer on Judicial Sales, \u00a7\u00a7104, 124, 129 ; High on Rec., 137; Dan\u2019ls Chan. Prac., \u00a7\u00a71274, 1285-6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">But the record shows that the chancellor gave the first bidder, Walters, the option to try again, which he refused or declined. He was hard to please. We think that the court did exactly right, and must affirm the judgment. The property, as a whole, brought several hundred dollars more by the re-sale, and nobody was illegally hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
