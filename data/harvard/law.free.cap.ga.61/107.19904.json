An administrator who lias sold the reversionary or remainder interest in the land of the intestate to his widow, who was tenant in dower thereof, and who said in effect to the purchasers of the entire fee from the widow, that if they bought they would get good title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>to the fee, as he had sold and she had bought the remainder, and he had plenty of what was coming to her from the estate to pay for it, and thus induced them to buy and pay for the land, and to suffer injury if he sell the fee in the land, so once administered by him, as he threatened to do, is estopped, and will he perpetually enjoined from the re-sale thereof.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-4\">2.

The jury so found, and a decree was entered upon their verdict granting a perpetual injunction, and error is assigned upon the charge and the consequent verdict and decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><bracketnum>1.</bracketnum> <em>We </em>think that the charge and verdict and decree are right. The remainder and the dower were fully administered ; the last was set apart and the first was sold by the administrator; these purchasers from the tenant in dower who bought the remainder at his sale, were misled by the administrator; they paid out their money on the faith of his statement, and he ought in equity to be estopped from selling the remainder again. The Code, section 3753, declares that \u201c admissions upon which other parties have acted, either to their own injury or for the benefit of those making the admissions, and similar cases where it would be more unjust and productive of more evil to hear the truth than to forbear investigation,\u201d will estop the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">These parties acted upon this admission, paid money and gave notes, and would be injured if the administrator were allowed to sell this laud, which they bought and paid for in consequence of this admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">It has been argued that it will not do to conclude creditors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>and heirs of an estate by the admissions of the administrator ; but the creditors and heirs do not appear to be interested. The administrator is personally bound to them ; the securities on his bond are bound to make good to them his failure to collect from the widow this purchase money, which he failed to collect out of the widow when he had plenty of funds coming to her. In any view, we think the administrator estopped.-</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> But it is said that Hawkins was not a competent witness, and that the court erred in allowing him to testify. Col. Hawkins was the advising counsel of the widow, it appears from the evidence, and probably he was consulted by the Messrs. Morgan; but he was not their agent to make the trade with Boone. If he had been, he could not probably have been sworn under the principle announced in <em>Odum vs. </em>Gill, 59 <em>Ga., </em>180; but, under the facts here, he was competent, though Boone was dead, especially as Boone had been sworn on a former trial, and his evidence was in court, and was afterwards used in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">That testimony of Boone is full on the point; but it is overwhelmingly overthrown by that of several other witnesses, and it stands by itself; all the others who swear on the point representing the transaction as alleged in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">The decree is right under the evidence, and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
