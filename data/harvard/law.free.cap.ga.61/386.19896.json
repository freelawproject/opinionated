This ordinance was passed after licenses were issued to complainants, and materially restricted their business. It required that the doors of all retail houses be closed during the continuance of divine service by any denomination of Christian people within the corporate limits of Stone Mountain, and imposed a penalty of $50.00 upon any person who should sell liquor during such service. It further provided that the prohibition covered not only the time during which such services were being performed, but on protracted occasions it extended to all intermissions by day or night. The bill alleged that two of the complainants had already been fined for a violation of this ordinance, and had carried their cases by <em>certiorari </em>to the superior court. It was charged and admitted that it was the intention of the municipal authorities to strictly enforce its provisions. The injunction was denied and complainants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-5\">L. J.

Eden on Inj., 66 ; 2Yesey Sr., 396 ; Hilliard on Inj., 2, 269; Kerr on Inj., 2 ; 30 Ala., 135 ; 53 (9\u00ae., 675. For this reason, whatever may be the infirmities of the penal ordinances of Stone Mountain, an injunction in the present case was properly denied. If unlawful convictions take place before a municipal court, reversal can be had in the superior court, as a court of law, by <em>certiorari. </em>This is a plain and adequate remedy, and a court of equity need not and cannot interfere. Chancery takes no part in the administration of criminal law. It neither aids the criminal courts in the exercise of jurisdiction nor restrains or obstructs them.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
