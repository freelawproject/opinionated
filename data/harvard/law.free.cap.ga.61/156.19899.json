A neighborhood road used by a settlement of people, great or small, is not a public road in the sense of the Georgia Code and in the common parlance of our people, and the case of <em>Salter vs. Taylor, </em>55 <em>Ga., </em>310, therefore covers and controls this case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b156-8\">2. The question being whether the justices had jurisdiction to abate the nuisance complained of, the superior court should not interfere by prohibition. Should the justices err, the remedy is by <em>eerUorari </em>\u2014(B.)</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b156-9\">Roads and bridges. Nuisance. Jurisdiction.

He applied to the superior court for a writ of prohibition, on the ground that the justices had no jurisdiction. It was granted and they excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-11\">A. P. &amp; S. B.

See Code, \u00a7597 <em>et seq.; </em>also \u00a7721 to \u00a7741 inclusive. It is so used, too, in common parlance.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">So that this case is covered by the case in 55 <em>Ga., </em>above cited, and the principle there ruled rules the case here. That case was deliberately considered and determined by this court, and we are content that it stand as law until \u2022 the legislature see fit to change it. No harm that we can see can result from it. If the justices erred, the remedy is by <em>certiorari </em>to the superior court, and thence to this court by bill of exception. So that all the courts are open to the contestants, and the nuisance had as well be tried and determined in that as in any other manner. '</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Whether the petition be demurrable or not, and whether the petitioners be entitled to their easement which they claim, or not, we do not now determine. The justices will do right with their j ury upon these questions, and if they do not, parties have their remedy. All that we rule now is, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the writ of prohibition, which ought never to be granted except upon a strong case clearly made out, of want of jurisdiction in the court sought to be prohibited, should not have been granted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
