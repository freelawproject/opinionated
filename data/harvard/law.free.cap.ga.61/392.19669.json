February Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">Langston <em>&amp; </em>Crane brought suit in the justice court of the 243d district G. M., against Jackson, on a note for $53.00, given for commercial manure, known as Bradley\u2019s Palmetto Acid. The note contained this stipulation : \u201c It is expressly agreed and understood that I buy said commercial manure for my own use, to be used on lands cultivated by or for me, and it is guaranteed to me as to its effect on crojis only as to the analysis of the state inspector, as evidenced by his brand on each and every package, and I hereby accept the said analysis as evidenced by said brand as a co. rect estimate of the commercial value of said fertilizer.\u201d The justice rendered judgment for the plaintiff, and the case was carried by appeal to the superior court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\">The defendant pleaded the general issue, that there was no brand of the state inspector on the sacks containing the fertilizer sold to him, and that it was valueless as a manure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-13\">The evidence as to whether the sacks were branded or not was distressingly conflicting. There was sufficient to sustain a verdict either way. The jury found for the plaintiffs. The defendant moved for a new trial upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-14\">1. Because the court erred in charging the jury as follows : \u201cThe question for you to determine is, has the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>fen dan t proved to your satisfaction that the sacks of fertilizers for which the note was given, were not stamped with the brand of the inspector of fertilizers as the defendant insists. If you believe, from the evidence, that the sacks were not so stamped, then you should find for the defendant ; but if you believe, from the evidence, that the sacks were so stamped, then the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-5\">2. Because the court erred in charging as follows: \u201c The defendant having bought the fertilizer without any guaranty as to its effect on crops, only as made by the inspector\u2019s brand, and having accepted the analysis of the fertilizer as evidenced by the inspector\u2019s brand as a correct estimate of the commercial value of said fertilizer, the defendant is bound by his contract, and according to his contract he cannot defend this action by showing that the fertilizer was of no value, and that he was not benefited-by it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-6\">3. Because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-7\">Other grounds were relied on, but they are not material here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b393-8\">The motion was overruled and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-9\">Jackson &amp; Thomas ; Erwin &amp; Cobb, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoY\">cited 54 <em>Ga., </em>527 <em>; 56 Ib., </em>557; 60 <em>Ib., </em>520; 49 <em>Ib., </em>620; 25 <em>Ib., </em>504.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-10\">P.

Here the parties shaped for themselves the warranty which suited their wishes. What can be more express than this language: \u201cIt is guaranteed to me as to its effect on crops only as to the analysis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>state inspector, as evidenced by his brand on each and every package; and I hereby accept the said analysis as indicated by said brand as a correct estimate of the commercial value of said fertilizer.\u201d The inspector\u2019s analysis was made the measure both of fertilizing power and commercial value, and the inspector\u2019s brand was made the evidence of the analysis. If, therefore, the genuine brand of the inspector was on each and every package, and if the fertilizer had not been tampered with or adulterated after it passed through the inspector\u2019s hands, the buyer received precisely what he purchased, and no breach of the seller\u2019s warranty has occurred. In the absence of all fraud on the part of the seller, (and there is no evidence of any fraud in this case), the effect of such a warranty is to throw upon the buyer the risk of everything but the genuineness of the inspector\u2019s brand. Whether the packages in fact had upon them the inspector\u2019s brand, was a question for the jury. There ought to be no difficulty in drawing the distinction between this case and that in 60 <em>Ga., </em>520. The mere affirmation that \u201c This fertilizer is sold under the inspection and analysis of Dr. A. Means, inspector at Savannah, and the Department of Agriculture at Atlanta,\u201d is no exclusion of the implied warranty of the Code; but so to hold is not inconsistent with the proposition that the parties may exclude the implied warranty if they will. Hero they have done so,, as to the quality and commercial value of the fertilizer, though not, of course, as to title, and nothing we have said is to be understood as intimating that express warranty confined to quality, etc., would supersede the implied warranty in respect to title. We have no such thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> There was enough evidence to justify the verdict. That part of it which was of doubtful admissibility was entirely immaterial to the real merits of the controversy. It could do no harm, and may now be ignored. The charge of the court was correct. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
