Eloyd Superior Court. January Term, 1878.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">Meyerhardt and wife\u2019 filed their bill against the Eome Gas-Light Company. They alleged that they were the owners of two lots in the city of Eome; that defendant, had unlawfully, and without their knowledge or consent, run its pipes across these lots; that they had erected valuable improvements, and in excavating a cellar had found one of defendant\u2019s pipes, which was put together in sections, so that it was liable to break and do irreparable damage if the dirt was dug from under it. They claimed the right to complete their cellar, and prayed an injunction to restrain defendant from using the pipe or pipes. By amendment Meyerhardt was stricken, and the suit proceeded in the name of his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-9\">The answer set up the defense that defendant had laid its pipes before the complainant bought; that there was then an alley between the lots, and along this they laid their pipes with the consent of the owners of the two lots; that Meyerhardt was the real owner of the land, and he bought with notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-10\">On the trial, the evidence in regard to notice was conflicting. The jury found for complainant. Defendant moved for a new trial on the following among other grounds :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-11\">1. Because the court erred in charging as follows : \u201c If defendant had a verbal license from any former owner of the lots in question to locate and use its gas pipe on or through said lots, or either of them, and if defendant, in pursuance of such license, expended money or incurred ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>pense in preparing for the use and enjoyment of such easement, then such license would be irrevocable. But if complainant, D. J. Meyerhardt, -afterwards became the owner of said lots by conveyance from or under such former owner, and if said Meyerhardt was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of said lots for value, and without notice of defendant\u2019s said easement, or of the fact that the gas pipes were located on, or through, said lots, then complainant would be protected against defendant\u2019s claim of easement. Meyerhardt\u2019s rights in this respect would depend upon the question whether or not he had notice at the time he purchased and took a conveyance to the lots. Notice to him after that time would not affect his rights under a purchase that was complete before notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">\u201cIf a person has notice of any fact which would put a prudent man on inquiry, then the notice of the existence of such fact would charge such person with notice of whatever he would have discovered, if he had prosecuted such inquiry with reasonable diligence. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">2. Because the decree does not follow the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">3.

On the trial of the cause, the jury, under the charge of the court, found the following verdict: \u201cWe, the jury, find for the complainant, in that the defendant remove the pipe at its own expense within ninety days, making the walls good, finding no damage.\u201d A motion was made for a new trial on the grounds therein stated, which was overruled, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The court entered a decree upon the verdict of the jury, to the effect that the defendant be allowed ninety days within which it may remove from the complainant\u2019s promi \u2022 ses, if it should desire to do so, its main gas pipe, provided it can remove the same without permanent injury to the buildings thereon, and shall, at its own expense, fully restore and repair all damage and injury that may be done to the walls of the buildings, if any, by such removal, and that after ninety days from this date, that the defendant be forever enjoined from using said gas pipe for conveying g\u00e1s, or for any other purpose, on or through' the defendant\u2019s premises. This decree is also excepted to as erroneous by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">\u201cIf defendant had a verbal license from any former owner of the lots in question, to locate and use its gas pipe, on, or through said lots, or either of them, and if defendant, in pursuance of such license, expended money or incurred expense in preparing for the use and enjoyment of such easement, then such license would be irrevocable. But if complainant, D. J. Meyerhardt, afterwards became the owner of said lots by conveyance from or under such former owner, and if said Meyerhardt was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of said lots for value, and without notice of defendant\u2019s said easement, or of the fact that the gas pipes were located on or through said lots, then complainant would be protected against defendant\u2019s claim of easement. Meyer-hard t\u2019s rights in this respect would depend upon the question whether or not he had notice at the time he purchased and took a conveyance to the lots. Notice to him after that time would not affect his rights under a purchase that was complete before notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">\u201c If a person has notice of any fact which would put a prudent man on inquiry, then the notice of the existence of such fact would charge such person with notice of whatever he would have discovered if he had prosecuted such inquiry with reasonable diligence. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In view of the evidence contained in the record, we find no error in the charge of the court to the jury, nor in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The theory and legal effect of the verdict, as understood by the court below, appears to have been, that the jury in finding for the complainant intended to find that the defendant should be enjoined from using its gas pipes on the complainant\u2019s premises, but should have the privilege of removing the same therefrom within ninety days, at its own expense, without injury to the walls. The privilege of removing the gas pipe from the complainant\u2019s premises within ninety days, was intended for the defendant\u2019s benefit, but if it should not think proper to avail itself of that privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>within ninety days, then after the expiration of that time, inasmuch as the jury found in favor of the complainant, the legal intendment of that finding was in favor of the complainant\u2019s prayer for an injunction. In our judgment, the decree substantially carries into effect the intention of the jury as expressed in their verdict, though somewhat vaguely expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
