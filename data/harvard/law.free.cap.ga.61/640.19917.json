On the trial of Johnson, the jury found him guilty of murder, and on the trial of Small, the jury found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Afterwards, a motion was made to arrest the judgment by each defendant separately. The court rendered two separate judgments. In the case of Johnson, it was ordered and adjudged that the verdict be set aside. In the case of Small, it was ordered that the judgment be arrested. Whereupon the solicitor-general, in behalf of the state, excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">When the case was called upon the .docket here (it having been agreed that both cases should be argued together) a motion was made to dismiss it, on the ground that a writ of error in behalf of the state against'ja' defendant in a criminal case, cannot be brought to tfcs court.
