On appeal, Defendant argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b874-24\">Beginning in May 2014, a criminal informant completed seven controlled purchases of crack cocaine from Defendant. Law enforcement officials subsequently executed a search warrant at Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>residence in October 2014. The search revealed, among other things, varying amounts of marijuana, crack cocaine, cocaine, a sawed-off shotgun, and a semiautomatic rifle. The substance that tested positive for cocaine contained less than <em>2% </em>purity of that drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Defendant later pled guilty to: (1) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (\u201cCount 1\u201d); (2) possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1),(b)(1)(D) (\u201cCount 2\u201d); and (3) possession of an unregistered short-barreled shotgun, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5841, 5861(d), and 5871 (\u201cCount 3\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">In anticipation of sentencing, the probation officer prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Based on Defendant\u2019s possession of a short-barreled shotgun, the PSR assigned him a base offense level of 18, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(5). He received a 4-level enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6)(B), because he possessed the sawed-off shotgun in connection with another felony offense (the possession of cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute). Defendant\u2019s total adjusted offense level was 22.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Defendant\u2019s total offense level was 19. Based on a total offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of I, Defendant\u2019s guideline range was 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Defendant requested a downward departure or variance from the guideline range based on the 2% purity level of the cocaine found in his possession. The district court acknowledged that the purity levei of the cocaine was low, but did not believe that warranted a departure or variance from the guideline range due to Defendant\u2019s possession of a sawed-off shotgun. After considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the individual facts of this case, the district court sentenced Defendant to a total of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">n. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">Using a two-step process, we review the reasonableness of a district court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cubero, </em>754 F.3d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 2014). We first look to whether the district court committed any procedural error, and then we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cA district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to afford consideration to rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>vant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (quotations omitted). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Defendant has not shown that his 30-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. First, we expect Defendant\u2019s sentence to be reasonable, as it is at the low end of the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir. 2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Moreover, his 30-month sentence was well below the statutory maximum sentences for his offenses (20 years under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C), 5 years under \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(D), and 10 years under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d) and 5871). <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (suggesting that a sentence well below the statutory maximum is an indicator of reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">Further, the record does not support Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court failed to adequately consider the purity level of the cocaine mixture. Although the district court determined that the low purity level did not warrant a sentence below the advisory guideline range due to Defendant\u2019s possession of the short-barreled shogun, the district court explicitly stated that it was imposing a sentence at the low end of the guideline range based on the small percentage of cocaine contained in the mixture. That the district court chose to weigh Defendant\u2019s possession of the firearm more heavily than the purity level of the cocaine was entirely within its discretion. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 2007) (\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">As to Defendant\u2019s contention that the district court failed to consider his mitigating evidence, Defendant set forth his mitigating arguments in his sentencing memorandum and elaborated on his upbringing and substance abuse at the sentencing hearing. While the district court did not explicitly mention Defendant\u2019s mitigating circumstances, it stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3563 factors and the individual facts of this case prior to imposing sentence. As such, Defendant has failed to convince us that the district court ignored his mitigating circumstances. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir. 2007) (stating that, although the district court did not specifically mention mitigating evidence, \u201cwe cannot say that the court\u2019s failure to discuss this \u2018mitigating<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> evidence means that the court erroneously \u2018ignored\u2019 or failed to consider this evidence in determining [the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">In short, we are not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendant\u2019s 30-month sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-7\">. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, the PSR grouped Counts 1 and 2 separately \u2022. from Count 3. As to Counts 1 and 2, the PSR assigned Defendant a base offense level of 14 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, because his possession-with-intent-to-distribute offenses involved the equivalent of at least 10 but less than 20 kilograms of marijuana. The PSR applied a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), because Defendant possessed a dangerous weapon, which resulted in an adjusted offense level of 16. Because the offense level for Count 3 was greater than 16, the PSR used the offense level from Count 3 to calculate the guideline range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b875-12\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed education or vocational training or medical care; (6) the ldnds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
