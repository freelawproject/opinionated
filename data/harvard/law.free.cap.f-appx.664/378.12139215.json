Magistrate Judge John R. Froeschner, proceeding with the consent of the parties, granted summary judgment for Defendants. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">On February 18, 2012, Plaintiff Joseph Abston was working as a longshoreman aboard Defendants\u2019 ship, the Pavo J. It was a stormy day; operations were suspended between 3:10 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. due to heavy rainfall that obscured the longshoremen\u2019s vision. At approximately 4:00 p.m., Abston and other crew members were loading flat racks onto the top deck of bay nine,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> placing one near the edge of the deck fifteen feet above deck thirteen. While deck thirteen is usually surrounded by a \u201csafety expansion,\u201d a series of two- and-a-half-foot-tall pipes linked together by rope, the expansion is routinely removed during cargo operations and was not then in place. The longshoremen did not object to the safety expansion\u2019s absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">Abston worked as a lasher that day, requiring him to- climb to the top of the cargo containers and unhook them from the crane that loaded them onto the deck. Rather than use a ladder, Abston \u201cshimmied up the side of [the flat rack]\u201d by receiving a \u201cboost\u201d from another longshoreman and climbing up the flat rack\u2019s hinges. Abston did not request or wear fall-safety equipment. While holding on to a hinge on the flat rack, Abston\u2019s foot and hand slipped, and he fell approximately ten feet to the top deck before falling a further fifteen feet to the bottom of deck thirteen, suffering significant physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">Following discovery, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. At the hearing, Abston informed the court that he would not call live witnesses at trial but would instead rely solely on depositions. The court granted summary judgment for Defendants, and Abston timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">Summary judgment is proper where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ordinarily, on summary judgment, a court is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant and make all reasonable inferences in the non-movant\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, this Court has articulated a different standard where, as here, the trial court sits as the trier of fact and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>parties will be relying on deposition testimony rather than live witness testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVK\">If decision is to be reached by the court, and there are no issues of witness credibility, the court may conclude on the basis of the affidavits, depositions, and stipulations before it, that there-are no genuine issues of material fact, even though decision may depend on inferences to be drawn from what has been incontrovertibly proved. Under those circumstances, which may be rare, the judge who is also the trier of fact may be warranted in concluding that there was or was not negligence, or that someone acted reasonably or unreasonably, or, as is the case here, that delay under the circumstances proved is justified or unjustified, even if that conclusion is deemed \u201cfactual\u201d or involves a \u201cmixed question of fact and law.\u201d A trial on the merits would reveal no additional data. Hearing and viewing the witnesses subject to cross-examination would not aid the determination if there are neither issues of credibility nor controversies with respect to the substance of the proposed testimony. The judge, as trier of fact, is in a position to and ought to draw his inferences without resort to the expense of trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u201cWe review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the' same standard as did the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Abston alleges breach of two of the three duties owed by vessel owners to longshoremen under \u00a7 905(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, that Defendants, while maintaining \u201cactive control\u201d over the relevant area, failed to replace the safety expansion after cargo unloading operations ceased. Second, that Defendants failed to intervene and replace the safety expansion, leaving a hazardous work condition that the longshoremen and the stevedore-employer continued to work around.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The active control duty is the broader of the two duties here at issue; \u201ca shipowner must exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries to longshoremen in areas that remain under the \u2018active control of the vessel.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cIf, however, a vessel has relinquished control over an area to the stevedore, then it is the primary responsibility of the stevedore to remedy a hazard in that area.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cTo determine whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>vessel owner retains active control over an area, this court generally considers whether the area in question is within the contractor\u2019s work area, whether the work area has been turned over to the contractor, and whether the vessel owner controls the methods and operative details of the stevedore\u2019s work.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Abston argues that \u201cthe evidence unequivocally establishes that Defendants exercised active control over the safety expansion,\u201d citing Jeffrey Williams\u2019s deposition testimony that longshoremen were not allowed to replace the safety expansion. Well and good, but, at the time of the accident, the vessel\u2019s crew had turned that area of the ship over to Ports America for cargo operations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nothing in the record indicates that the ship\u2019s crew controlled \u201cthe methods and operative details of the stevedore\u2019s work.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are pointed to no competent summary judgment evidence that the top deck of bay nine was an area under the active control of the vessel or her crew; disallowing replacement of the safety expansion by the longshoremen is not enough to meet the plaintiffs burden. We turn to the duty to intervene claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\u201c[A] vessel has a duty to intervene when it has actual knowledge of a dangerous condition and actual knowledge that the stevedore, in the exercise of obviously improvident judgment, has failed to remedy it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To establish a breach of the duty to intervene, the plaintiff must show: (1) the vessel owner had actual knowledge of the defect; (2) the vessel owner had actual knowledge that the defect posed an unreasonable risk of harm; and (8) the vessel owner had \u201cactual knowledge that it could not rely on the stevedore to protect its employees and that if unremedied the condition posed a substantial risk of injury.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">That Abston exercised \u201cobviously improvident judgment\u201d by climbing onto the flat rack without the use of either a safety harness or ladder is not challenged. The record indicates that Defendants removed the safety expansion as a matter of course during cargo operations and also suggests that the longshoremen did not raise concerns about the missing expansion. And there is no evidence in the record that Defendants could have reasonably anticipated that Abston, after a driving rainstorm, would climb the side of a flat rack near the missing safety expansion without the use of either a safety harness or a ladder.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Even where a risk exists, \u201c[t]his Court has noted that in some situations the vessel owner is entitled to rely on the stevedore\u2019s judgment that the condition, though dangerous, was safe enough. It is only where the stevedore\u2019s judgment in continuing-to work in the face of danger is \u2018obviously improvident\u2019 that the vessel acquires a duty to intervene.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Abston has not produced competent summary judgment evidence that the Defendants had actual knowledge that the missing safety expansion created an unreasonable risk of harm or that the Defendants were aware that Plaintiff would attempt his climb without a safety harness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Without such evidence, Abston has failed to raise a question for trial regarding.the duty to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We AFFIRM summary judgment for Defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\"> Pursuant to 5th C\u00ede.

Nor can Plaintiff articulate a causal link between the missing safety expansion and the \u2022 concededly improvident conduct in which he engaged. Plaintiff would have fallen either way, and while he speculates that he might have been able to grab the safety expansion on the way down, the'safety expansion was not designed nor intended for such purpose. Put slightly differently, an experienced longshoreman climbing the side of a flat rack in rainy conditions and without any fall protection equipment was not a harm within the risk of failing to replace the safety expansion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
