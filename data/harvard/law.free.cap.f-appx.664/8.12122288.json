Craig Lawrence, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office (USA), Civil Division, DOJ Appellate Counsel, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Civil Division, Appellate Staff, Anr drew Donald Fiorillo, Esquire, Attorney Advisor, Christina Doran Troiani, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of Information Policy, Washington, DC, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b29-5\">BEFORE: Tatel, Kavanaugh, and Millett, Circuit Judges</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b29-6\">ORDER</p>\n<author id=\"b29-7\">Per Curiam</author>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Upon consideration of the motion for summary affirmance, the court\u2019s order to show cause filed September 19, 2016, the response to the order, and the response to the motion; the motion for summary reversal and the response thereto; and Appellant\u2019s brief, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">ORDERED that the order to show cause be discharged. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">FURTHER ORDERED that the,motion for summary affirmance be granted and the motion for summary reversal be denied. The merits of the parties\u2019 positions are so clear as to warrant summaiy action. See Taxpayers Watchdog, Inc. v. Stanley, 819 F.2d 294, 297 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (per curiam). The district court correctly determined that the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) search for records responsive to Appellant\u2019s request for information fulfilled its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a; see also Weisberg v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 705 F.2d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Additionally, the FBI properly withheld identifying information contained in the documents under FOIA Exemption 7(C), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C), as.the individuals appearing in the records have a significant privacy interest that Appellant has not shown is defeated by the public\u2019s interest in disclosure, Schrecker v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Further, Appellant does not contest the FBI\u2019s decision to withhold certain information pursuant to Exemption 7(E), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-12\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R. App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
