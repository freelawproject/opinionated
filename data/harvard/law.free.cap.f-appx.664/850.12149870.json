No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ8\">This case involves a series of contracts entered into between MSE and Courtroom Connect pursuant to which MSE was to provide consulting services to Courtroom Connect in exchange for compensation. First, on 28 February 2012, MSE and Courtroom Connect entered into a \u201cSales Commissions Agreement.\u201d In pertinent part, the Sales Commissions Agreement provided that Courtroom Connect was to pay MSE (1) $5,000 per month plus (2) a monthly bonus equal to 10% of gross sales in excess of $50,000 on certain products. The agreement purported to be \u201cnon-can-celable for any reason whatsoever (including death).\u201d The agreement contained no description of MSE\u2019s obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">On 5 April 2012, MSE entered into an \u201cEquity Share Agreement\u201d with David Feinberg, Courtroom Connect\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. Under the terms of this agreement, Feinberg agreed to transfer to MSE 30% of Feinberg\u2019s equity interest in Courtroom Connect in the event Courtroom Connect was either sold or obtained a round of financing. Like the Sales Commissions Agreement, the Equity Share Agreement contained no description of MSE\u2019s obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">On 7 December 2012, MSE and Courtroom Connect entered into an \u201cEquity Transaction Agreement,\u201d which incorporated and superseded expressly the Equity Share Agreement between MSE and Fein-berg. Under the terms of the Equity Transaction Agreement, MSE agreed to perform certain enumerated \u201cmanagement, development, marketing, and organizational services\u201d for Courtroom Connect. As compensation for those services, Courtroom Connect agreed to transfer to MSE 10% of the gross proceeds of any sale of the business or of additional rounds of financing. The agreement specified a 10-year term and was \u201cnon-cancellable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Four months later, on 16 April 2013, MSE and Courtroom Connect entered into another contract: the \u201cStrategic Marketing Agreement,\u201d This agreement purported to incorporate and supersede the Sales Commissions Agreement. Under the terms of the Strategic Marketing Agreement, MSE agreed to provide to Courtroom Connect the same \u201cmanagement, development, marketing, and organizational services\u201d already set forth in the Equity Transaction Agreement. In exchange for those services, Courtroom Connect agreed to pay MSE (1) $7,700 per week plus (2) a monthly bonus equal to 12.5% of every dollar of revenue collected above $400,000. The Strategic Marketing Agreement was to \u201crun concurrently\u201d with the remainder of the Equity Transaction Agreement\u2019s 10-year term. The agreement was \u201cnon-can-cellable,\u201d except under specific \u201cnarrow\u201d circumstances in which Courtroom Connect could terminate the agreement with 30 days\u2019 written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Courtroom Connect ultimately stopped making payments to MSE in November 2013. MSE then filed this civil action, alleging claims for breach of contract and for promissory estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">The district court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Courtroom Connect on MSE\u2019s claims based on the Strategic Marketing Agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, the district court concluded that the Strategic Marketing Agreement was void for lack of consideration. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., 443 F.3d 832, 836-37 (11th Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The Strategic Marketing Agreement is governed by Delaware law. Delaware courts have said \u201c[i]t is the blackest of black-letter law that an enforceable contract requires an offer, acceptance, and consideration.\u201d E.g., Cigna Health <em>&amp; </em>Life Ins. Co. v. Audax Health Sols., Inc., 107 A.3d 1082, 1088 (Del. Ch. 2014). \u201cConsideration\u201d is defined as \u201ca b\u00e9nefit to a promi-sor or a detriment to a promisee pursuant to the promisor\u2019s request.\u201d Cont\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Rutledge &amp; Co., 750 A.2d 1219, 1232 (Del. Ch. 2000). \u201cA party cannot rely on a pre-existing duty as his legal detriment in an attempt to formulate a contract.\u201d Id. Instead, a promisee incurs a \u201csufficient legal detriment\u201d \u201cif it promises or performs any act ,.. which it is not obligated to promise or perform so long as it does so at the request of the promisor and in exchange for the promise.\u201d 3 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 7.4 (4th ed. 2016) (emphasis added) (cited with approval by Delaware courts); see also Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., 750 A.2d at 1233 (contract modification was unenforceable for lack of consideration because, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>although defendants incurred greater expenses under the modified terms, nothing evidenced that those expenses were incurred \u201cin exchange for a modification\u201d of the contract or \u201cas an inducement for [plaintiffs] promise to amend the agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The district court committed no error in concluding that the Strategic Marketing Agreement was void for lack of consideration. Between 7 December 2012 and 15 April 2013, the relationship between Courtroom Connect and MSE was governed by two contracts: the Sales Commissions Agreement and the Equity Transaction Agreement. Under the Sales Commissions Agreement, MSE was entitled to receive ongoing monthly fees in exchange for unspecified consulting services. Meanwhile, under the Equity Transaction Agreement, MSE was entitled to a contingent equity interest in Courtroom Connect in exchange for specific enumerated consulting services.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The parties then entered into the Strategic Marketing Agreement, which superseded the Sales Commissions Agreement, but left intact the Equity Transaction Agreement. For the Strategic Marketing Agreement to be enforceable under Delaware law, MSE must show, in pertinent part, the existence of consideration. See Cigna Health &amp; Life Ins. Co., 107 A.3d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Because the consulting services MSE was obligated to perform under the Strategic Marketing Agreement were identical to those services MSE was already obligated to perform under the Equity Transaction Agreement, MSE cannot rely on those pre-existing duties as consideration. See Conti Ins. Co., 750 A.2d at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">About the existence of consideration, MSE relies instead on the termination clause in the Strategic Marketing Agreement which allowed Courtroom Connect to terminate the contract under certain conditions: a right that Courtroom Connect lacked under the Sales Commissions Agreement. Nothing evidences, however\u2014 nor does MSE contend\u2014either that Courtroom Connect requested the inclusion of the termination clause or that the termination clause otherwise induced Courtroom Connect\u2019s promise to pay MSE substantially increased consulting fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the absence of evidence that the termination clause was a bargained-for term, it constitutes no consideration under Delaware law. See Conti Ins. Co., 750 A.2d at 1233. We affirm the district court\u2019s grants of partial summary judgment in favor of Courtroom Connect.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-6\">, The district court later dismissed without prejudice MSE\u2019s remaining claims against Courtroom Connect based on the Equity Transaction Agreement. The district court entered final judgment in favor of Courtroom Connect on MSE's claims based on the Strategic Marketing Agreement,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\">, On appeal, MSE raises no challenge to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on MSE's claim for promissory estoppel under the Strategic Marketing Agreement: that claim is, thus, not before us on appeal. MSE\u2019s promissory estoppel claim was based on MSE\u2019s reliance on Feinberg\u2019s assurance that Feinberg was authorized to execute the Strategic Marketing Agreement on behalf of Courtroom Connect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b873-8\">. In addition to providing a more lucrative bonus structure, the Strategic Marketing Agreement entitled MSE to receive-$7,700 per week instead of $5,000 per month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b873-9\">. On appeal, MSE also contends that the Strategic Marketing Agreement and the Equity Transaction Agreement should be read together as reflecting the parties\u2019 intent for MSE to receive two forms of compensation\u2014 ongoing consulting fees and a contingent equity interest\u2014in exchange for MSE\u2019s consulting services. Because MSE failed to raise this argument in the district court, the argument is not properly before us. See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir. 2004). Moreover, MSE\u2019s argument about the parties\u2019 intent is immaterial to whether\u2014as a matter of Delaware contract law\u2014the Strategic Marketing Agreement was void for lack of consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
