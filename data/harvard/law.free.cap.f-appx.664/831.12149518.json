Ordonez-Rojop contends that he established that he suffered past persecution due to his service in the Guatemalan National Army. He also argues that he has established a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">Ordonez-Rojop served in the Guatemalan National Army for nearly three years beginning in 1983. After his discharge, he and several other men were selected by the government in 1993 to recruit young men from his community and train them to defend the community against guerilla forces. At his hearing before the IJ, Ordo-nez-Rojop testified that the Guatemalan government provided weapons for him and his young recruits, but did not pay the recruits. Ordonez-Rojop continued to recruit and train young men in his community until 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">In 1996 the Guatemalan government signed peace accords with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity. Ordonez-Rojop testified that, after the peace accords were signed, his former recruits tried to kill him. He testified that they beat him several times with metal and wooden objects, leaving him with scars on his chest, face, and left arm. Ordonez-Rojop also testified that he reported the assaults to the authorities in Guatemala, but they refused to do anything because they were afraid of the guerillas, with whom his former recruits were somehow affiliated.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">The IJ found that Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s testimony about why his former recruits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>turned on him was unclear. At one point, he testified that the recruits were angry because they had not been paid for their service and believed he had received a lot of money from the government. At another point he, testified that they were angry because there was \u201cno justice\u201d following the 1996 accords. And at a third point Ordonez-Rojop asserted that he was targeted because the recruits\u2019 parents received food and money from the guerillas, believed he was being paid by the government, and \u201cbrainwashed\u201d the former recruits against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Between 1996 and 2002 Ordonez-Rojop worked along the coast because he was afraid he would be killed if he returned to his community. According to him, he returned home every few months to visit his wife, but never stayed because he feared for his life. Ordonez-Rojop stated that a group of forty men, made up of his former recruits, followed him around Guatemala during this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Ordonez-Rojop eventually fled Guatemala and entered the United States sometime in February 2003 without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer. He asserts that he is afraid to return to Guatemala, because\u2014 although his family has remained in his former community and has not been harmed\u2014civilians in his community have told his family members that \u201cif he comes, he is ours.\u201d Ordonez-Rojop says that several of his former recruits have become police officers in Guatemala, and he is afraid that they will find him if he returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">On June 29, 2012, the Department of Homeland Security charged Ordonez-Ro-jop with removability under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Before the IJ, he conceded removability and sought asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. The IJ denied his application. Ordonez-Rojop appealed to the BIA, which dismissed his appeal. He then filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Before considering the merits of Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s petition, we must assess our subject-matter jurisdiction. We determine de novo our subject matter jurisdiction. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">\u201cWe lack jurisdiction to review final orders in immigration eases unless \u2018the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u2019 \u201d Indra-wati v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 779 F.3d 1284,1297 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). \u201cA petitioner fails to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to a particular claim when [he] does not raise that claim before the,BIA.\u201d Id. Moreover, a petitioner\u2019s failure to assert a claim in his notice of appeal or brief to the BIA deprives this Court of jurisdiction even if the BIA considered that claim sua sponte. Amaya-Artunduaga, 463 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">Ordonez-Rojop failed to raise both his asylum and CAT claims before the BIA. In order to have raised a .claim before the BIA, a petitioner must have \u201cpreviously argued the \u2018core issue now on appeal\u2019 before the BIA.\u201d Indrawati, 779 F,3d at 1297. \u201cUnadorned, conclusory statements\u201d will not do. Id. Other than conclusory statements in his brief to the BIA and notice of appeal that he was appealing the IJ\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT, Ordonez-Rojop made no mention of either his asylum or CAT claim. His entire brief to the BIA dealt with his eligibility for withholding of removal. Indeed, the conclusion to that brief asks only that \u201cthe order of .the Immigration Judge denying Respondent\u2019s application for Withholding of Removal be reversed.\u201d As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>result, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the BIA erred when it upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and CAT relief, and Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s petition must be dismissed as to those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Ordonez-Rojop did properly raise his withholding of removal claim before the BIA. His brief to the BIA explained in detail why he believes the IJ erred in denying his application on that issue. We therefore have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision concerning withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">\u201cAn alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the [Immigration and Nationality Act] if he can show his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular' social group, or political opinion.\u201d Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 487 F.3d 855, 860-61 (11th Cir. 2007). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return to the country in question.\u201d Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u201cThe alien can meet his burden by showing either (1) past persecution in his country based on .a protected ground, in which case a rebuttable presumption is created that his life or freedom would be threatened if he returned to his country; or (2) a future threat to his life or freedom on a protected ground in his country.\u201d Delgado, 487 F.3d at 861 (quotation marks omitted). An alien need not show that the persecution he fears or has experienced will be or was solely motivated by his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir. 2006). But he must show that the past or future persecution \u201cwas [or will be], at least in part, motivated by\u201d his \u201crace, religion, nationality,, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Ordonez-Rojop contends that he met his burden because Guatemalans with prior service in the Guatemalan National Army constitute a particular social group and the evidence he presented showed that he had been persecuted in the past on account of his prior army service and would be persecuted because of that service if he returned to Guatemala. The BIA agreed with the IJ that Ordonez-Rojop had failed to show that any past persecution had been motivated by his service in the Guatemalan National Army. It concluded that he had failed to demonstrate that he was likely to be persecuted on account of a protected ground in the future for the same reason.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">\u201cWhere the BIA issues a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., 463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d Id. To the extent that the BIA adopted some of the IJ\u2019s findings and reasoning in this case, we review both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">Whether Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s persecutors were or are likely to be motivated to persecute him because of his prior army ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>vice is a question of fact.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test.\u201d Min Yong Huang v. Holder, 774 F.3d 1342, 1344 (11th Cir. 2014). \u201cUnder this test, we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo reverse the [BIA\u2019s] fact findings, [this Court] must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d Rodriguez-Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">There is substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Ordonez-Rojop has not been and likely will not be targeted on account of his prior military service. For example, Ordonez-Rojop testified at his hearing before the IJ that his recruits turned against him and became angry because they believed that, although they had not been paid for defending the community from guerrillas, the government had paid Ordonez-Rojop a lot of money that he did not distribute. That suggests that the reason Ordonez-Rojop was attacked and might be again if he returns to Guatemala is that the former recruits and their families feel he cheated them, not because Ordonez-Rojop served in the Guatemalan National Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">It is true that Ordonez-Rojop also testified that the members of his community, including his former recruits and their parents, were angry because there was \u201cno justice\u201d as a result of the 1996 peace accords. There would be no reason for them to take their anger over the accords out on Ordonez-Rojop unless they associated him with the government in some way. A fact-finder could infer that Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s persecutors based that association on his prior military service. But a factfinder could also have inferred that Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s persecutors associated him with the government because of his work recruiting and training young men in his community, which occurred after his military service had ended.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we are required to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the [BIA\u2019s] decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision,\u201d Tan, 446 F.3d at 1374, we must infer they associated Ordonez-Rojop with the government for that reason. Viewed in that light, Ordo-nez-Rojop\u2019s testimony that members of his community attacked him because they felt there was \u201cno justice\u201d after the peace accords could support the BIA\u2019s finding that any persecution he has or might experience would not be based on his prior army service.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Likewise, Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s testimony that the recruits\u2019 parents brainwashed their children against him because the parents were \u201cinfiltrated with\u201d the guerillas, being paid by the guerillas on the side, and thought Ordonez-Rojop was being paid by the government can be viewed two ways. The recruits\u2019 parents might have thought he was being paid by the government because he used to serve in the Guatemalan National Army. Or they could have thought the government was paying Ordo-nez-Rojop because he was in charge of recruiting and training young villagers to defend the village. Again, we are required to \u201cdraw all reasonable inferences in favor\u201d of the BIA\u2019s conclusion, id. at 1374, and viewed in that light this evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that they were not motivated by Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s prior military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Finally, the fact that Ordonez-Rojop\u2019s family in Guatemala have been told \u201cif he comes, he is ours\u201d does not shed any light on why Ordonez-Rojop is being threatened. An applicant for withholding of removal must do more than demonstrate that he faces future persecution for some undefined reason. He must show that he faces future persecution on account of \u201chis race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d Delgado, 487 F.3d at 860-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Because substantial evidence supports the findings of the BIA that Ordonez-Rojop has not been targeted in the past because of his prior military service and is not likely to be targeted on that basis in the future, we must deny his petition for review of the denial of his application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b854-8\">. The BIA also concluded that the threats against Ordonez-Rojop that were conveyed to him through his family while he was absent from Guatemala were not enough to demonstrate a likelihood of future persecution. But even if the threats were enough to demonstrate a likelihood of future persecution, Or-donez-Rojop would have to show that that persecution would be on account of a protected ground. As we will explain, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that he failed to make that showing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b855-6\">. Because we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Or-donez-Rojop has failed to show a nexus between his past persecution or any future persecution he fears and his prior army service, we need not\u2014and therefore do not\u2014 decide whether we would affirm the IJ\u2019s finding that former members of the Guatemalan National Army amount to a \"particular social group\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). We assume for the purposes of this opinion, that the IJ\u2019s finding on that point was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-7\">. In his brief to this Court, Ordonez-Rojop suggests in passing that his membership in this \"Civil Patrol\" after he left the army could be the basis for his persecution, indicating that we should consider whether the \u201cCivil Patrol\u201d (or perhaps the group of former recruiters for the \"Civil Patrol\u201d) is a particular social group and whether he is eligible for withholding on the basis of that protected ground. Because he did not raise this argument before the BIA, it is unexhausted and we have no jurisdiction to consider it. Jeune v. U.S. Att'v Gen\u201e 810 F.3d 792, 800, 802-03 (11th Cir. 2016) (\u201cA petitioner has not exhausted a claim unless he has both raised the \u2018core issue\u2019 before the BIA and also set out any discrete arguments he relies on in support of that claim.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
