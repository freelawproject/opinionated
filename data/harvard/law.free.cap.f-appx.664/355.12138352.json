We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b375-25\">In 2012, O\u2019Veal pleaded no contest to charges of committing injury to a child and waived his right to appeal. On June 14, 2012, he was sentenced to forty-five years of imprisonment. The Fourteenth Court of Appeals of Texas dismissed O\u2019Veal\u2019s direct appeal on August 23, 2012, because he had entered a plea agreement and had no right to appeal, <em>Oveal v. Texas, </em>No. 14-12-00567-CR, 2012 WL 3629196, at *1 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] Aug. 23, 2012, no pet.). O\u2019Veal did not seek discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-26\">In October 2012, O\u2019Veal wrote to the Harris County District Clerk to ask about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the. status of his direct appeal and the identity of his attorney. The clerk replied with a form containing the date the appeal was filed and the name of his- appointed counsel. The clerk\u2019s response did not indicate O\u2019Veal\u2019s appeal had already been dismissed. In May 2013, O\u2019Veal contacted the Fourteenth Court of Appeals again asking about the status of his direct appeal. In its reply, the court enclosed its opinion from nine months earlier dismissing O\u2019Veal\u2019s direct appeal. O\u2019Veal then filed a state application for a writ of habeas corpus on or about September 3, 2013. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cTCCA\u201d) denied the application on February 5,2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">O\u2019Veal filed the present federal habeas application on April 9, 2014, raising claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. On November 3,2014, the district court granted Respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case as barred by the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Several months later, O\u2019Veal contacted the district court and stated that he did not receive notice of the court\u2019s dismissal of his case until late March 2015. Thus, the district court granted his motion to reopen the time to file an appeal, and O\u2019Veal subsequently filed his .notice of appeal. This Court granted certificates of appealability with resp\u00e9ct to O\u2019Veal\u2019s procedural claims on, March 3, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), federal habeas applications are subject to a one-year period of limitations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). In the instant case, the district court calculated the limitations period pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), which provides that the limitations period will run from \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). .Notably, \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction 'or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). The one-year limitations period in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) is not jurisdictional and is therefore subject to equitable tolling. <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 645, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">The district court gave two alternative reasons for holding that O\u2019Veal\u2019s case had been filed after the limitations period expired. In its first calculation, the district court determined that direct review concluded when O\u2019Veal\u2019s direct appeal was dismissed on August 23, 2012, and' his conviction became final thirty days later upon the expiration of the time for filing a petition for discretionary review. After statutorily tolling the one-year limitations period to account for the pendency of the state habeas proceedings, the district court concluded that O\u2019Veal\u2019s federal habeas application became due on February 24, 2014. Because the district court also held that equitable tolling was not appropriate in this case, it found that O\u2019Veal\u2019s federal habeas application, which was filed on April 9, 2014, was untimely. In its alternative calculation, the district court determined that O\u2019Veal\u2019s conviction became final for purposes of AEDPA when he was sentenced on June 14, 2012, after pleading no contest and waiving his right to appeal. Accordingly, the limitations period expired one year later on June 14, 2013, and both the state and federal habeas applications were filed after the limitations period had run. On appeal, O\u2019Veal contends that (1) the district court erred in concluding that equitable tolling was not warranted and (2) direct review concluded under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) when th\u00e9 Fourteenth Court of Appeals dismissed his direct appeal on August 23,2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Equitable tolling is appropriate only in \u201crare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Mathis v. Thaler, </em>616 F.3d 461, 476 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting <em>In re Wilson, </em>442 F.3d 872, 875 (5th Cir. 2006)). To be entitled to equitable tolling, a petitioner must show \u201c \u2018(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way\u2019 and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549 (quoting <em>Pace v. DiGuglielmo, </em>544 U.S. 408, 418, 125 S.Ct. 1807, 161 L.Ed.2d 669 (2005)). The district court concluded that equitable tolling was not warranted in this case because O\u2019Veal did not show (1) \u201cthat he exercised reasonable due diligence throughout the entire course of his state proceedings\u201d or (2) \u201cthat the delay in receiving notice of the direct appeal\u2019s dismissal was an unconstitutional state-created impediment that prevented his timely filing of the instant petition.\u201d This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of equitable tolling for an abuse of discretion. <em>Mathis, </em>616 F.3d at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u201cLong delays in receiving notice of state court action may warrant equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Quarterman, </em>577 F.3d 596, 598 (5th Cir. 2009); <em>Phillips v. Donnelly, </em>216 F.3d 508, 511 (5th Cir. 2000), <em>modified on reh\u2019g, </em>223 F.3d 797 (2000). In <em>Hardy, </em>this Court held that a pro se habeas petitioner \u201csuffered a significant state-created delay when the TCCA failed in its legal duty to inform him that his petition had been denied\u201d for eleven months after the TCCA\u2019s decision. 577 F.3d at 599. In that case, however, the habeas petitioner was proceeding pro se, and he was unable to determine the status of his case solely because the TCCA failed to notify him and failed to respond to his requests for information. <em>Id. </em>at 599-600.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">In the instant case, the district court concluded that O\u2019Veal\u2019s failure to timely file his federal habeas application was due at least in part to his own lack of diligence. The Harris County District Clerk responded to O\u2019Veal\u2019s October 2012 request for information and provided the name of his attorney. The response from the clerk\u2019s office was probably inadequate and perhaps misleading given that O\u2019Veal\u2019s appeal had already been dismissed. However, at that point, O\u2019Veal could have tried to contact his attorney to inquire about the status of his case. O\u2019Veal has not indicated that he made any attempts to do so. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that O\u2019Veal did not show he had diligently pursued his rights. <em>See Lewis v. Cockrell, </em>33 Fed.Appx. 704 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that equitable tolling was not appropriate because the petitioner could have contacted his attorney to inquire about the status of his appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">O\u2019Veal also notes that his attorney was required to promptly notify him of the state court\u2019s decision on his appeal under Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 48.4. He contends that his appellate attorney failed to notify him of the decision and abandoned him during the appellate proceeding, An attorney\u2019s \u201cfailure to satisfy professional standards of care\u201d may constitute an extraordinary circumstance that stands in a petitioner\u2019s way and prevents him from timely filing. <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at 649-52,130 S.Ct. 2549. However, O\u2019Veal has not pointed to any authority suggesting that an attorney\u2019s failure to notify a defendant of the status of his case rises to the level of an extraordinary circumstance that prevents the defendant from timely filing a federal habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying equitable tolling in this case. Because the district court did not abuse its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>tion in this regard, we need not reach the issue of whether direct review continued for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) until the Fourteenth Court of Appeals dismissed O\u2019Veal\u2019s direct appeal on August 23, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of O\u2019Veal\u2019s habeas application as barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
