A certificate of appealability was issued on the following question: \u201c[w]hether the district court erred in determining that Pollock\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for a writ of habeas corpus was untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).\u201d Pollock contends the district court erred in dismissing his petition as untimely because equitable tolling should have applied. Specifically, he asserts that, under the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, he had a reasonable expectation he would be notified once a decision was rendered in his appeal from the state court\u2019s denial of his second amended Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion, but he did not receive such notification. He further contends he exercised due diligence in pursuing his case when he filed a Notice of Inquiry with the state appellate court one year and five months after he initiated the appeal. After review,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) provides for a one-year limitations period in which a state prisoner must file an application for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The one-year period begins to run from the latest of one of four triggering events, including, in relevant part, \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). Once the statute of limitations is triggered, it can be tolled in two ways, by statutory tolling or by equitable tolling. <em>Spottsville v. Terry, </em>476 F.3d 1241, 1243-46 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">\n<em>A. Statutory tolling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">Statutory tolling allows state prisoners to toll the limitations period while \u201cproperly filed\u201d state post-conviction actions are \u201cpending\u201d in state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). To toll the one-year limitation period under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), a proceeding must be a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d of the relevant judgment or claim. <em>Espinosa v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>804 F.3d 1137, 1140 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2)). \u201cAn application is filed when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record, and it is <em>properly </em>filed when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). A state-court petition for a belated appeal does not trigger a reexamination of a conviction or sentence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>and, thus, does not toll the federal statute-of-limitations period. <em>Id. </em>at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">The district court correctly determined that Pollock\u2019s federal habeas petition was untimely because it failed to meet the one-year statute of limitations required under AEDPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). As the district court found, Pollock\u2019s time began to run oh February 17, 2012\u201430 days after judgment and sentence were rendered. Pollock\u2019s first Rule 3.850 motion, filed 87 days after his time began to run, tolled 278 remaining days in which to file a federal habeas petition. Pollock\u2019s time began to run again on June 14, 2012, when that motion was dismissed as facially insufficient. Pollock\u2019s subsequent amended Rule 3.850 motion tolled no time because it was not properly sworn, and thus not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Accordingly, 36 additional days passed before Pollock\u2019s second amended Rule 3.850 motion, filed July 20, 2012, again tolled his time, leaving him 242 remaining days in which to file a federal habeas petition. His time began to run again on July 3, 2013, when a mandate was issued by the state appeals court, rendering his final deadline to file March 3, 2014. The district court correctly noted that Pollock\u2019s petition for a belated appeal, filed after, his second amended Rule 3.850 motion, did not toll his time under this Court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Espinosa, </em>804 F.3d at 1141. Accordingly, his federal habeas petition, dated May 9, 2014, was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">\n<em>B. Equitable tolling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Equitable tolling allows state prisoners to toll the statute of limitations based on extraordinary circumstances that are both beyond their control and unavoidable even with diligence. <em>San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir. 2011). Establishing a right to equitable tolling requires a petitioner to show \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 631, 649, 130 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010). Equitable tolling only applies in \u201ctruly extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>340 F.3d 1219, 1226 (11th Cir. 2003) (involving a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion). The appellant bears the burden of establishing his entitlement to equitable tolling. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the appellant was not entitled to equitable tolling where he took no action during the one-year grace period \u2022 after the AEDPA\u2019s effective date, and did not file a state collateral attack until almost two years after his conviction was affirmed on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 1228. In <em>San Martin, </em>we determined that equitable tolling was not appropriate where the appellant argued that he did not receive notice of the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>until the denial was docketed in the Florida Supreme Court two weeks later. <em>San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1268. Specifically, we determined that San Martin failed to show due diligence because he failed to show that he made any effort to contact the Supreme Court to inquire about his case, that anyone had agreed to contact him regarding the final disposition, or that the Florida Supreme Court docket was a better source of information about a Supreme Court ruling than the Supreme Court\u2019s docket would have been. <em>Id. </em>at 1270. Moreover, we noted that San Martin also failed to explain why he waited 349 days after the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment appeared on the Florida Supreme Court docket to file a post-conviction motion, and then waited another 15 days after the disposition of that post-conviction motion to file his federal habeas petition. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, in <em>Knight v. Schofield, </em>we determined that the petitioner was entitled to equitable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>tolling where the Supreme Court of Georgia assured him it would notify him when a decision was made, but sent the notification to the wrong person, and he exercised diligence in inquiring about the decision after 15 months had passed. 292 F.3d 709, 711 (11th Cir. 2002). We noted in <em>Knight, </em>however, that a petitioner was not necessarily entitled to equitable.tolling until he receives notice because \u201c[e]ach case turns on its own facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Pollock failed to demonstrate due diligence, and, thus was not entitled to equitable tolling. As an initial matter, Pollock\u2019s assertion the state appellate court failed to provide notice of its decision as mandated by Florida Rules of Judicial Administration was not refuted. The district court accepted as true Pollock\u2019s assertions of inadequate notice in making its due-diligence determination. Even assuming the state court\u2019s failure to provide notice was an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d beyond Pollock\u2019s control, it does not support Pollock\u2019s claim the district court clearly erred in determining he failed to show he pursued his claims with due diligence. <em>See San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267. Indeed, Pollock does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding he failed to inquire about the status of his state-court appeal of his second aniended Rule 3.850 motion until March 17, 2014\u201417 months after filing his initial brief. Rather, Pollock argues his single inquiry, along with his general record of timely filings in post-conviction proceedings, provided sufficient evidence of his due diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Pollock\u2019s single inquiry is insufficient to' show diligence. Pollock\u2019s case is distinguishable from <em>San Martin </em>and <em>Johnson </em>because Pollock showed he made' one attempt to ascertain the status of his second amended motion, and, taking his assertion as true, the state court failed to contemporaneously notify him of the decision, as it was required to do. <em>See San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1268; <em>Johnson, </em>340 F.3d at 1228. However, this case is also distinguishable from <em>Knight </em>because, first, Pollock waited longer to inquire about the status of his motion than the appellant in <em>Knight, </em>and second, Pollock received no personal assurances from the court that it would promptly inform him of a decision, but instead relied on generally applicable state administrative rules that mandate notification. <em>See Knight, </em>292 F.3d at 711. This Court specifically noted in <em>Knight </em>that a petitioner is not necessarily entitled to equitable tolling until he receives notice because each case is fact specific. <em>See Knight, </em>292 F.3d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Pollock has not provided evidence to counter the district court\u2019s findings, nor has he provided an explanation for his lengthy delay in inquiring other than his reliance on the court\u2019s general rules regarding notification. Additionally, the state court\u2019s quick response to his inquiry supports the circumstances were not out of Pollock\u2019s control, if only he had inquired sooner. Pollock has not demonstrated the district court clearly erred in its due-diligence determination, and thus, he was not entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See San Martin, </em>633'F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Pollock\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time barred is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\">. We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition as untimely under \u00a7 2244(d). <em>Day v. Hall, </em>528 F.3d 1315, 1316 (11th Cir. 2008). We also review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision on equitable tolling. <em>San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1265 (11th Cir. 2011). Factual findings, including findings regarding a party\u2019s diligence, are reviewed for clear error and will be affirmed unless the record lacks substantial evidence to support them. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
