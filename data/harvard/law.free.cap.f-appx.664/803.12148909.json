After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b823-25\">Following a jury trial in 1998, Defendant was found guilty of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Prior to trial, the Government filed a notice of intent to seek an enhanced penalty pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 851, based on Defendant\u2019s three prior state felony drug convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-26\">Applying the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines, the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) attributed 12.535 kilograms of cocaine base to Defendant and assigned him a base offense level of 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) because his offense involved more than 1.5 kilograms of co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>caine base. Defendant received two separate enhancements, which resulted in a total offense level of 44. Based on a total offense level of 44 and a criminal history category of VI, Defendant\u2019s advisory guideline range was life imprisonment. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(e)(2), Defendant was subject to a mandatory term of life imprisonment based on the sentencing enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 851. The district court consequently sentenced Defendant to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">In 2015, Defendant filed a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 782, arguing that Amendment 782 lowered his base offense level by two levels from 38 to 36 and resulted in an amended guideline range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Defendant contended that he should receive a sentence reduction greater than the two levels provided for by Amendment 782 because the Guidelines in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding are advisory under Kimbrough<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Booker<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The district court deferred ruling and administratively terminated Defendant\u2019s motion because no defendant could be released on the basis of Amendment 782 prior to November 1, 2015. Shortly thereafter, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>considered whether Defendant was eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court concluded that Defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction because Defendant was sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Defendant now appeals, arguing that he qualifies for a sentence reduction because Amendment 782 lowered his guideline range from the then-mandatory life sentence to 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. He also asserts that the district court violated <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Booker </em>by treating the Guidelines\u2019 provisions pertaining to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions as mandatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions on the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir. 2008). Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify a term of imprisonment when the original sentencing range has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To be eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant must identify an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that is listed in U.S.S.G, \u00a7 lB1.10(d). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">A defendant is not eligible for a sentence reduction if a guideline amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Stated another way, a reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not lower the defendant\u2019s guidelines range because \u201cof the operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as a statutory mandatory minimum term. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Here, the district court did not err by denying Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Defendant was not eligible for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>sentence reduction. Defendant relies on Amendment 782, which is listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d) and reduced the base offense levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 by two levels for most drug offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(d); U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 782 (2014). Defendant\u2019s life imprisonment sentence, however, was not based on the drug quantity offense levels listed in \u00a7 2D1.1, but instead was based on the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment listed in 21 . U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846, and 851. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846, 851. Because Defendant\u2019s guideline range was not based on the drug quantity guidelines, Amendment 782 did not lower the sentencing range upon which Defendant\u2019s sentence was based. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Indeed, Defendant would still be subject to a statutory minimum sentence of life imprisonment even after Amendment 782. <em>See United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1077-78 (11th Cir. 2010) (\u201c[T]he guidelines range for a defendant subject to a statutory minimum would not be lowered by an amendment, even if the amendment would otherwise be applicable to the defendant.\u201d (quotations omitted) (alteration in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Defendant\u2019s argument that the district court violated <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Booker </em>by applying the Guidelines\u2019 provisions that limit the extent to which a defendant is eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is without merit, as we have held that <em>Kim-brough </em>and <em>Booker </em>\u201cdo not prohibit the limitations on a judge\u2019s discretion in reducing a sentence imposed by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the applicable policy statement by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>United States v. Melvin, </em>556 F.3d 1190, 1192 (11th Cir. 2009). In short, because Defendant was subject to a statutory minimum sentence, the district court lacked authority to reduce Defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-8\">. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b824-15\">.In his initial brief, Defendant also argued that the district court abused its discretion by failing to provide an explanation for its denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Because Defendant expressly withdrew that argument in his reply brief, we do not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
