(\u201cHSBC\u201d) and Nationstar Mortgage, LLC, (\u201cNationstar\u201d), in which she alleged that the defendants wrongfully foreclosed on her property, and violated Regulation X of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (\u201cRESPA\u201d). On appeal, Clark argues that the district court erred in dismissing her Regulation X claim and in denying her leave to amend, because at the time of the foreclosure sale, she had not received any communication from her mortgage servi-cer as to the status of her request for loan modification. Further, she contends that HSBC was her mortgage servicer, and knew or should have known that she was under consideration for a loan modification with her previous loan servicer, Bank of America, and thus, Regulation X prevented HSBC from foreclosing on her property. After a careful review of the records and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim de novo. <em>See Run-nings v. </em>Texaco, 29 F.3d 1480, 1484 (11th Cir. 1994). Although we review the denial of a motion to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion, we review a denial due to futility de novo \u201cbecause [the district court] is concluding that as a matter of law an amended complaint would necessarily fail.\u201d <em>Fla. Evergreen Foliage v. E.I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., </em>470 F.3d 1036, 1040 (11th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Lastly, pro se pleadings are liberally construed and are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Bingham v. Thomas, </em>664 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir. 2011). However, where a pro se litigant fails to challenge an issue on appeal, the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>Irwin v. Hawk, </em>40 F.3d 347, 347 n.l (11th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">Here, the district court did not err in dismissing Clark\u2019s RE SPA claim, brought pursuant to Regulation X, for failure to state a claim because Clark did not comply with the regulations to warrant a claim, and HSBC is not a loan servicer and is therefore not subject to the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiffs complaint must state a claim that is plausible on its face and feature more than \u201cunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation[s].\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>566 U.S. 662, 678,129 S.Ct. 1937,1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). To satisfy the plausibility standard, the complaint must demonstrate more than a sheer possibility that the defendants have acted unlawfully. <em>Id. </em>We need not accept \u201clegal conclusion^] couched as a factual allegation\u201d or \u201c[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action supported by mere conclu-sory statements\u201d as true. <em>Id. </em>Determining whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss is a \u201ccontext-specific\u201d task and the allegations must permit the court, based on \u201cits judicial experience and common sense ... to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937,1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">\n<em>A. Clark Did Not Comply With Regulation\u2019s Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">Although it appears that Clark does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination regarding her RESPA claim against Nationstar, as she does not present any arguments against or mention Na-tionstar in her brief, to the extent that she has preserved that claim, the district court did not err in its determination because Clark\u2019s loss mitigation application was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>Under RESPA, a consumer protection statute that regulates the real estate settlement process, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) is tasked with prescribing rules and regulations. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C.S \u00a7 2617(a). RESPA\u2019s Regulation X, became effective January 10, 2014. <em>See </em>Mortgage Servicing Rules Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), 78 Fed. Reg. 10696-01, 10696 (Feb. 14, 2013). This regulation places certain obligations on mortgage servicers when a borrower submits a loss mitigation application and lays out distinct procedures and rules for submitting such applications regarding measures for assessing completeness, timelines and evaluation protocols. <em>See generally </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Regarding completeness, the regulation establishes that when a servicer receives an application 45 days prior to a foreclosure sale, the servicer is required to immediately ascertain whether the application is complete and notify the borrower of this determination in writing within 5 days. \u00a7 1024.41(b). Generally, an application is considered complete when the servicer \u201chas received all the information that the servicer requires from a borrower in evaluating applications for the loss mitigation options available to the borrower.\u201d \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1). If the application is deemed incomplete, the servicer must \u201cexercise reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information to complete [the] application,\u201d informing the borrower in the initial notification of \u201cthe additional iiocuments and information the borrower must submit to make the loss mitigation application complete\u201d and state \u201ca reasonable date by which the borrower should submit the documents and information.\u201d \u00a7 1024.41(b)(1), (b)(2). If the borrower fails to respond within the reasonable time provided and the application remains incomplete, the servicer may, at its discretion, evaluate the incomplete application. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1024.41(c)(2). However, if the borrower submits the requested documents or no additional information is requested, the application is considered complete and the servicer\u2019s evaluation obligations under subsections (c) are triggered as long as the application qualifies as complete\u2014either in actuality or facially\u2014more than 37 days before the foreclosure sale. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1024.41(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Pursuant to subsection (c), within 30 days of receiving the complete application, the servicer must evaluate the application and determine all loss mitigation options available to the borrower and \u201c[p]rovide the borrower with a notice in writing stating the servicer\u2019s determination of which loss mitigation options, if any, it will offer to the borrower on behalf of the owner or assignee of the mortgage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1024.41(c). Additionally, if the borrower submits a complete application more than 37 days before a scheduled foreclosure sale, the servicer is prohibited from proceeding with the foreclosure sale until the servicer either (a) notifies the borrower of its decision regarding loss mitigation options, (b) the borrower \u201crejects, all loss mitigation options offered\u201d, or (c) the \u201cborrower fails to perform under an agreement on a loss mitigation option.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1024.41(g). Notwithstanding these mandates, \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 1024.41 imposes a . duty on a servicer to provide any borrower with any specific loss mitigation option.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1024.41(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Clark submitted loan modification paperwork on March 25, 2015, only 13 days before the foreclosure sale scheduled for April 7, 2015. Thus, Clark\u2019s loan modification application was submitted outside Regulation X\u2019s prescribed timelines for both complete and incomplete applications, and therefore, Nationstar was not required to inform Clark of her mitigation options, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>if any, or stop the foreclosure process. <em>See 12 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.41(b)(2)(i), (c)(1), (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">\n<em>B. HSBC Is Not A Loan Servicer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Again, Regulation X\u2019s requirements only apply to mortgage servicers, and HSBC is not a servicer within the meaning of the regulation, thus the district court did not err in dismissing her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Under Regulation X, a \u201cservicer\u201d is the \u201cpers\u00f3n responsible for the servicing of a federally related mortgage loan,\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1024.2. \u201cServicing\u201d a loan is defined as \u201creceiving any scheduled periodic payments from a borrower pursuant to the terms of any federally related mortgage loan .., and making payments to the owner of the loan or other third parties ... as may be required pursuant to the terms of the mortgage servicing loan documents or servicing contract.\u201d <em>See </em>12 C.F.R, \u00a7 1024.2; <em>See generally </em>\u00a7 1024.41.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">According to Clark\u2019s complaint and the attached exhibits, Nationstar acted as Clark\u2019s mortgage servicer on behalf of HSBC, \u25a0 who merely owned the security deed. Nationstar was the party responsible for receiving payments on the mortgage, informing Clark of her default, arranging her foreclosure solutions, and taking her loan modification application-into consideration. Thus, Regulation X\u2019s requirements do not apply to HSBC, and the district court properly dismissed Clark\u2019s Regulation X claim against HSBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Additionally, the district court did not err in concluding that any attempt by Clark to amend her complaint to add an allegation that she submitted a previous loan modification request to Bank of America, who then failed to forward the paperwork to Nationstar, would be futile. This allegation would still not state a valid Regulation X claim against Nationstar. Clark\u2019s Bank of America loan modification application was submitted some time in 2011, before Regulation X became effective on January 10, 2014. <em>See </em>Mortgage Servicing Rules Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X), 78 Fed. Reg. at 10696. Nationstar has been her servicer the whole time Regulation X has been effective and Clark has never alleged that she submitted a loan modification application to Nationstar before the March 25, 2015 application referenced in her complaint (which was submitted outside Regulation X\u2019s 45 day timeframe). Thus, allowing Clark to amend the complaint to assert her' allegation that she submitted a previous loan modification request to Bank of America, who then failed to forward the paperwork to Nationstar, would have been futile. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Clark\u2019s RESPA claim against Nationstar and HSBC.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
