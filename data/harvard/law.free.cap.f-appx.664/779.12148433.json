Hollins\u2019s initial terms of supervised release were imposed after he was convicted of Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a), and use of a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). On appeal, Hol-lins argues that the district court plainly erred by imposing a \u201cgeneral sentence\u201d of \u00e1 four-year additional term of supervised release covering the violations of supervised release as to both counts of conviction, but which exceeded the statutory maximum of three years\u2019 supervised release allowed for the revocation underlying his Hobbs Act robbery conviction. After thorough review, we affirm. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"Aav\">We review de novo the legality of a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of supervised release. United States v. Ma-zarky, 499 F.3d 1246,1248 (11th Cir. 2007). However, when a party raises a challenge to a revocation sentence for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. United States v. Aguillard, 217 F.3d 1319, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>1320 (11th Cir. 2000). To show plain error, the defendant must show (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected his substantial rights. United States v. Turner, 474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir. 2007). If the defendant satisfies the three conditions, we may exercise our discretion to recognize the error if it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d Id. Plain error cannot be established where \u201cthe explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue\u201d and there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving an issue. United States v. Lejarde-Rada, 319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. 2003). \u201cA substantial right is affected if the appealing party can show that there is a reasonable probability that there would have been a different result had there been no error.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 472 F.3d 825, 831-32 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">\u201cA general sentence is an undivided sentence for more than one count that does not exceed the maximum possible aggregate sentence for all the counts but does exceed the maximum allowable sentence on one of the counts.\u201d United States v. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1025 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). We have held that a general sentence, including a general sentence of supervised release, in a final judgment of conviction is per se illegal and requires remand. Id. at 1023-25. However, we have never addressed whether a general sentence of an additional term of supervised release, imposed upon revocation of the original term of supervised release, is per se illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Section 5G1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines generally directs the district court to impose a sentence for each count of conviction when initially sentencing a defendant. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 (dictating the manner in which the district court should impose a sentence \u201con each such count\u201d or \u201csentences on all counts\u201d). But the imposition of a sentence upon revocation of supervised release is not governed by \u00a7 5G1.2. Instead, it is governed by Chapter Seven of the Guidelines, which contains no provision similar to \u00a7 5G1.2. See generally U.S.S.G. Ch. 7. Indeed, we\u2019ve previously declined to extend some requirements under U.S.S.G, \u00a7 5G1.2 to restrict the district court\u2019s discretion under Chapter 7 of the Guidelines. See United States v. Quinones, 136 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir. 1998) (holding that \u00a7 5G1.2 did not limit the district court\u2019s authority to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment upon revocation of supervised release, since the policy statements in Chapter 7 governed revocation sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">When a term of supervised release is revoked, a district court can impose a new term of supervised release after imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). \u201cThe length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">A conviction for Hobbs Act robbery has a 20-year statutory maximum sentence, and thus, constitutes a Class C felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a), 3559(a)(3). A conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) carries a statutory maximum sentence' of life imprisonment, and thus, constitutes a Class A felony. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(1); United States v. Pounds, 230 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir. 2000). The maximum term of supervised release for a Class A felony is five years, and the maximum term for a Class C felony is three years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(l)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Here, the district court did appear to impose a general sentence, since it im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>posed a single four-year term of supervised release that exceeded the statutory maximum for the Hobbs Act count (although it did not exceed the statutory maximum for the firearm charge). See Moriarty, 429 F.3d at 1025.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, any potential error committed by the district court in imposing this sentence was not plain. See United States v. Aguilar-Ibarra, 740 F.3d 587, 592 (11th Cir. 2014). While \u00a7 5G1.2 requires the district court to clearly state its sentence for each count of conviction in imposing an initial sentence, sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release are not governed by \u00a7 5G1.2, but by Chapter 7. See U.S.S.G. Ch. 7 Pt. A. Moreover, we\u2019ve previously declined to extend to revocation sentences the requirements of \u00a7 5G1.2 concerning whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences on multiple counts. See Qui-nones, 136 F.3d at 1295. Nor have we, or the Supreme Court, ever held that a general sentence may not be imposed upon revocation of supervised release, including an additional term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Indeed, while we seek to reduce confusion for a reviewing court no matter when a sentence is imposed, sentences imposed upon the revocation of supervised release do not raise all of the same concerns that initial sentences do. As the commentary to the Guidelines points out, a defendant who violates the conditions of supervised release has already been convicted and sentenced, and the new sentence imposed upon revocation of a term of supervised release is intended to sanction primarily the \u201cbreach of trust\u201d inherent in the violation. U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. 3(b). Consistent with this goal, the policy statements regarding revocation proceedings in U.S.S.G. Ch. 7 are intended to afford courts greater flexibility in dealing with violations of the conditions of supervised release. See U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, intro, comment. 3(a); United States v. Hofierka, 83 F.3d 357, 361 (11th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">In short, it is not plain under the Guidelines or under our precedent that the district court must impose separate sentences for each term of supervised release it revokes. Because there is no error, much less plain error, see Lejarde-Rada, 319 F.3d at 1291, we affirm Hollins\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-6\">. Hollins was initially sentenced to two terms of supervised release, one for each count of conviction, to run concurrently. Since both terms of supervised release carried the same requirements, Hollins\u2019s failed drug tests and failure to complete a drug treatment program constituted violations of both terms of supervised release. The district court did not specifically state that Hollins\u2019s supervised release for both convictions was being revoked. Nonetheless, nothing in the record suggests that the revocation applied to only one term of supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
