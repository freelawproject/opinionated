Canales-Bonilla argues that the district court erred by convicting, sentencing, and entering judgment against him \u201cbased on its determination that his 1997 California conviction for rape of a spouse qualified as a conviction for a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) and thus one for an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F).\u201d Relying primarily on <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), he argues that the definition of a crime of -violence in \u00a7 16(b), as incorporated by reference into the definition of an aggravated felony in \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F), is unconstitutionally vague on its face. He further contends that this court cannot apply \u00a7 16(b) in this case without violating due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-27\">The Government has filed an unopposed motion for summary affirmance, urging that Canales-Bonilla\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, </em>831 F.3d 670 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 29, 2016) (No. 16-6259). The Government is correct that <em>Gonzalez-Lon-goria </em>forecloses Canales-Bonilla\u2019s facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>vagueness challenge to \u00a7 16(b), and his challenge to our application of \u00a7 16(b) on due process grounds,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternate motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-16\">. The recent grant of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court on the issue whether \u00a7 16(b) is unconstitutional in light of <em>Johnson </em>in <em>Lynch v. Dimaya, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 137 S.Ct. 31, 195 L.Ed.2d 902 (2016), does not alter the analysis. This court is bound by its own precedent unless and until that precedent is altered by a decision of the Supreme Court. <em>See Wicker v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 155, 157-58 (5th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
