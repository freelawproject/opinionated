He now appeals his 38-month sentence, on the grounds that the district court\u2019s upward variance from the 12-to-18 months Guidelines range was both substantively and procedurally unreasonable. Gornitz argues first that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to provide an adequate explanation \u25a0for what he describes as its \u201cextraordinary\u201d 20-month upward variance from the Sentencing Guidelines. Second, Gornitz asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the court\u2019s reasons were not sufficiently compelling to support the upward variance in sentencing. He contends that the court erred in weighing certain 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In particular, Gornitz complains that the district court should have weighed his failure to pay any restitution before sentencing and his prior unscored grand-theft convictions less, and it should have weighed his gambling addiction and poor health more.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b826-14\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Rosales-</em>Bruno, 789 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir. 2015). Alternatively, if a party failed to raise a timely objection to the reasonableness of the sentence in district court, we review the objection on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328-29 (11th Cir. 2005). Gornitz objected to the reasonableness of the district court\u2019s upward variance and resulting sentence, so we review the reasonableness of Gornitz\u2019s imposed sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d at 1254.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-15\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b826-16\">\n<em>A. The District Court Adequately Explained its Variance from the Sentencing Guidelines.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b826-17\">In reviewing whether a sentence is procedurally unreasonable, we determine whether the district court erred in calcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>lating the Guidelines range, treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, faded to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Here, Gornitz concedes that the district court both correctly calculated the Guidelines range and considered the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a). We likewise find no indication that the court treated the Guidelines as mandatory or based the sentence on clearly erroneous facts. Gornitz does argue, however, that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable on the grounds that the court did not adequately explain the upward variance of his 38-month sentence from the Guidelines range of 12 to 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The district court is charged with imposing a sentence that is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in addition to the \u00a7 3553(a)(2) purposes listed above, include the following: (1) .the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the kinds of sentences available; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019s range for the offense; (4) the Sentencing Commission policy statements; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (6) the need to provide victims with restitution. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)\u2014(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">When explaining the imposed sentence, the district court need not reeite the specific Guidelines language or explicitly articulate its consideration of each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, \u201cso long as the record reflects the court\u2019s consideration of many of those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d 1256, 1262 (11th Cir. 2010). Rather, the district court must \u201c \u2018set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">The record here shows that the district court adequately explained Gornitz\u2019s sentence. The court specifically articulated the reasons behind its upward variance and discussed substantially all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1262. Indeed, after fully hearing arguments and Gor-nitz\u2019s allocution, the court stated that it had considered the Presentence Investigation Report, the character letter filed on Gornitz\u2019s behalf, the parties\u2019 arguments, the applicable guideline range, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>In particular, the court made clear that it had considered the nature and circumstances of the offense; Gornitz\u2019s characteristics, including his past criminal history; his need for education, vocational training, and medical care; the need to provide restitution; and the policy goals of the Sentencing Guidelines, including the need to deter crime and the need to protect the public. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7). The court explained that it believed these factors, taken together, warranted an upward variance in sentencing, particularly to ensure, achievement of the Guidelines\u2019s goal of deterring further criminal conduct, in light of Gomitz\u2019s prior recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">Our jurisprudence does not require that a court recite specific Guidelines language or explicitly address each \u00a7 3553(a) factor in explaining its sentencing. <em>Ghertler, </em>605 F.3d at 1262. The court here, though, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>that and more, providing a clear and reasoned basis for the imposition of an upward variance. As a result, the record provides a more than adequate basis for us to conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">\n<em>B. \u25a0 Gomitz\u2019s Sentence Was Substantively Reasonable.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">After reviewing for procedural reasonableness, we proceed to the second step of <em>Gall\u2019s </em>two-step inquiry and review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. At this step, we examine \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">If the court varied upward after weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, its justification must be compelling enough to support the degree of the variance, and its reasoning must be complete enough to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>United States v. Early, </em>686 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir. 2012); <em>see also Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (holding that a major variance in sentencing requires \u201ca more significant justification than a minor one\u201d). We have held as a \u201cmajor variance\u201d a deviation of 42 percent, for which a sufficiently compelling justification was required. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1196 (11th Cir. 2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>United States v. Smith, </em>573 F.3d 639, 660-61 &amp; n. 5 (8th Cir. 2009) (reduction of 33 percent constituted a \u201cmajor variance\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">While a \u201csufficiently compelling\u201d justification must exist, the Supreme Court has specifically rejected requiring either an \u201cextraordinary\u201d justification or the use of a \u201crigid mathematical formula\u201d that correlates the strength of required justification with the percentage of the departure. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586. Additionally, we \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the Guidelines is unreasonable and must give \u2018due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">So we may vacate a sentence only if we firmly believe that the district court \u201ccommitted a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (quotation omitted). A court\u2019s unjustified reliance upon any one factor to the exclusion of other factors indicates an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Crisp, </em>454 F.3d 1285, 1292 (11th Cir. 2006). Additionally, when \u201c[m]any of the bases for the district court\u2019s sentence were already accounted for in calculating the Guidelines range and nothing extraordinary about the circumstances of th[e] case\u201d exists, an upward variance may be substantively unreasonable. <em>United States v. Valdes, </em>500 F.3d 1291, 1293 n.2 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">But we will not \u201cset aside a sentence merely because we would have decided that another one is more appropriate.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1191. \u201c[T]he sentencing court is permitted to attach \u2018great weight\u2019 to one factor over others,\u201d and the weight it attaches to any factor is \u201ccommitted to [its] sound discretion.\u201d <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d at 1254 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 57, 128 S.Ct. 586, and <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir. 2008)). For example, we have explained that \u201c[placing substantial weight on a defendant\u2019s criminal record is entirely consistent with \u00a7 3553(a) because five of the factors it requires a court to consider are related to criminal history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1263. A sentence imposed well below the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>maximum penalty is generally an indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Baldwin, </em>774 F.3d 711, 732 (11th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1882, 191 L.Ed.2d 753 (2015). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable \u201cin light of the entire record, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the substantial deference afforded to sentencing courts.\u201d <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">Gornitz has not met this burden. Gornitz argues that the district court improperly weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by placing undue emphasis on his failure to pay any restitution before sentencing, weighing too heavily his prior unscored convictions that were 19 and 29 years old, and weighing too lightly his gambling addiction and poor health. But the record indicates that the district court gave full consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and imposed a sentence within its permissible discretion. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324; <em>Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">No evidence indicates that the court either relied solely on a single factor to the exclusion of others or that it improperly considered bases that had already been taken into account in the Guidelines calculations to justify the upward variance. Gor-nitz himself acknowledges that the court accounted for his prior criminal history, failure to pay restitution, and prior career as a lawyer, at the least, in coming to its sentence, negating any argument that the court relied unjustifiably on a single factor alone. <em>Crisp, </em>454 F.3d at 1292. The court recognized that because of the age of his convictions, Gornitz\u2019s prior criminal activity had not been taken into account in the guideline calculations, making this a factor that the district court could choose to consider in imposing an upward variance. <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d at 1254; <em>Valdes, </em>500 F.3d at 1293 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">Gornitz argues that the court imposed a sentence beyond what was necessary to adequately deter criminal conduct and achieve the purposes of the Guidelines. But the weight the court placed on each factor, whether great or slight, was fully within its discretion. <em>Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d at 1254. The district court explicitly accounted for its weighting, noting that it believed the upward variance was necessary to achieve the Guidelines goals of ensuring restitution and preventing further criminal conduct in light of Gomitz\u2019s past criminal sentencing and recidivism. We accord this conclusion the substantial deference it is due and find the court\u2019s reasoning sufficiently compelling to support the imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">Finally, we note that while the imposition of a 38-month sentence did constitute a major variance in this case, the sentence nonetheless falls well below the statutory maximum penalty of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641. <em>Baldwin, </em>774 F.3d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">The district court has provided a justification compelling enough to support the 20-month variance and reasoning complete enough to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>Early, </em>686 F.3d at 1221. We therefore affirm the sentence as both procedurally and substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
