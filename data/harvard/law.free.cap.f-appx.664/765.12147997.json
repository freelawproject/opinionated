Mr. Garcia-Enriquez argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Specifically, he contends that certain features of his personal history justified a downward variance: (1) he was only removed from the United States one time, and that was in 2008; (2) his reason for illegally reentering the United States was to support his family in Honduras; (3) he had substantial ties to the United States; and (4) he had unresolved mental health issues. With respect to the district court\u2019s weighing of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Mr. Garcia-Enri-quez argues that a sentence well-below 24 months\u2019 imprisonment would reflect the seriousness of his offense, provide individual and general deterrence, and assist him in helping himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-20\">We review the reasonableness of sentences under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because Mr. Garcia-Enriquez does not argue that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable, we must determine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>the circumstances. <em>See id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Mr. Garcia-Enriquez, as the party challenging the sentence, bears the burden of showing that it is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3558(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Tome, </em>611 F.3d 1371, 1378 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">A district court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in \u00a7 3553(a), including the need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, ... to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, [and] to provide the defendant with needed ... medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(D). Additional factors include the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In the context of sentencing, the weight given to any specific factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and a district court does not commit reversible error simply because it attaches significant weight to a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir. 2008). A district court abuses its discretion and imposes a substantively unreasonable sentence only when it \u201c(1) fails to afford consideration to relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosales-Bruno, </em>789 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc)). Although the district court must adequately and properly consider the factors, nothing requires it to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. West, </em>898 F.2d 1493, 1503 (11th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">Mr. Garcia-Enriquez has not demonstrated that the 24-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. When it considered the appropriate sentence, the district court took into account the same circumstances and characteristics that Mr. Garciar-Enriquez raises on appeal. Indeed, as the sentencing transcript shows, the district court considered the presentence investigation report, Mr. Garcia-Enri-quez\u2019s statement, his mother\u2019s statement, his pastor\u2019s letter, and defense counsel\u2019s arguments in favor of a downward variance. These materials described Mr. Gar-eia-JOnriquez\u2019s troubled past, his ties to the United States, and his reasons for illegally reentering the country\u2014the exact matters Mr. Garcia-Enriquez raises in this appeal. The district court also considered Mr. Garcia-Enriquez\u2019s prior criminal history and his mental health issues. After weighing these considerations, the district court noted Mr. Garcfer-Enriquez\u2019s most recent criminal charges and explained that Mr. Garcia-Enriquez\u2019s stated reasons did not warrant a downward variance from the advisory guideline range. To the extent Mr. Garcia-Enriquez argues that the district court failed to give due weight to the factors he asserted in support of a lower sentence, that decision was within the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir. 2007). .</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">In addition, although we do not presume that a sentence falling within the advisory guideline range is reasonable, we ordinari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>ly expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir. 2008). Here, the district court\u2019s sentence of 24 months represented the lowest end of the applicable guideline range of 24 to 30 months. A sentence imposed well-below the statutory maximum penalty is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (holding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it .was well below the statutory maximum). Mr. Garcia-Enri-quez\u2019s 24-month sentence was well-below the statutory maximum of 20 years. Accordingly, Mr. Garcia-Enriquez has not shown an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Giving appropriate deference to the district court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, Mr. Garcia-Enriquez sentence of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment is not substantively unreasonable. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
