Johnson, PA, Ocoee, FL, for Defendant-Appellant</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b859-20\">Before TJOFLAT, MARTIN and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b859-21\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b859-22\">In this case, after Johnathan Everett Johnson was indicted for two offenses: Count One, possession of a firearm after being convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and Count Two, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the Government filed a notice of maximum penalty indicating that it would seek a sentence enhancement for the Count One offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The-ACCA provides that if a convicted felon has \u201cthree previous convictions ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both,\u201d he faces a minimum of 15 years\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). The Government\u2019s notice stated that Johnson had a 1994 Florida conviction for armed robbery, a 1999 Florida conviction for selling cocaine, a 2007 federal conviction for bank fraud,, and a 2007 federal conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and for using and carrying a firearm in relation to a .drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">Johnson pled guilty to both counts of the indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, he objected to the ACCA enhancement on the ground that the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), was unconstitutionally vague because it relied on the maximum sentence prescribed for a particular drug offense rather than on the drug quantity or type of drug involved in the offense. Hence, the District Court erred in treating his 1999 Florida conviction for selling cocaine as a serious drug offense under the ACCA, a second-degree felony punishable by a term of imprisonment of 15 years. He did not dispute, though, that his 1994 conviction for armed robbery and his 2007 conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute qualified as predicate convictions for an ACCA enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The District Court overruled Johnson\u2019s objection, concluding that the ACCA applied, and sentenced him on Count One to a prison term of 15 years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He appeals the sentence, presenting the same constitutional argument he presented to the District Court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The ACCA, in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), defines \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii). In <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>in discussing the propriety of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii), the Supreme Court stated that Congress\u2019s choice \u201cto rely on the \u2018maximum term of imprisonment ... prescribed\u2019 by state law as the measure of the seriousness of state offenses involving the manufacture, distribution, or possession of illegal drugs\u201d demonstrated that Congress was deferring to state lawmakers\u2019 judgment that an offense punishable by ten years\u2019\u2019imprisonment is sufficiently \u201cserious.\u201d 553 U.S. 377, 387-88, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008). Johnson\u2019s 1999 Florida conviction for selling cocaine was punishable by a maximum sentence of 15 years, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 775.082(3)(d), 893.13(l)(a)(l)(1999), and thus, by definition, qualified for sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">Johnson argues that although the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-10\">\u201c10 year or greater maximum penalty for a \u2018serious drug offense\u2019 appears to create a bright line rule that should be easy to follow, [it] unjustly punishes those based upon the happenstance of where they committed their offense(s) and the 10 years is not linked in any way to the circumstances of the offense or the quantity of the drug involved in the crime. In its essence, this law creates what could be called a reverse vagueness problem and is overly broad.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. In short, Johnson argues that his sentence should be set aside because, depending on the circumstances surrounding the prior drug conviction, the definition fails to provide a person with adequate notice that the conviction could be used to enhance a sentence under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>the ACCA. Put another way, no ordinary, reasonable person reading the statutory words, \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d would understand precisely what conduct constitutes such offense especially since the drug-related conduct that might invoke a sentence of 10 years or greater varies from state to state.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The Fifth Amendment provides that \u201cno person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. Due process encompasses the concepts of notice and fair warning. At its core, \u201cthe ... principle is that no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u201d <em>United States v. Lanier, </em>520 U.S. 259, 265, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 1225, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (quoting <em>Bowie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1701, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964)). <em>Bankshot Billiards, Inc. v. City of Ocala, </em>634 F.3d 1340, 1349 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Vagueness, the <em>sine qua non </em>of Johnson argument, \u201cis a \u2018related manifestation[ ] of the fair warning requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lanier, </em>at 266,117 S.Ct. at 1225. The question here is whether the ACCA, read as whole, gave Johnson fair notice\u2014at the time he committed the Count One \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense\u2014that his 1999 Florida cocaine conviction would qualify as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d and, coupled with his other previous offenses, would likely subject him to an enhanced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">We conclude that the challenged definition gave Johnson the fair notice due process required, that the 1999 Florida conviction was a serious drug offense. The conviction fell clearly within the definition. We do not determine whether or not treating some other drug conviction from Florida or another state as a \u201cserious drug conviction\u201d would deny an accused due process. Our focus is only on this case and a specific Florida conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\">.
