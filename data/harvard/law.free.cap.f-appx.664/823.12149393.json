Stat. \u00a7 760.10(1)(A) and (7). No reversible error has been shown; w\u00e9 affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Garrison began working for the City of Tallahassee, Florida (\u201cCity\u201d), as a full-time Purchasing Agent in 2003. Garrison testified that part of her job included working directly with internal department representatives\u2014both in person and over the phone\u2014and interacting with outside vendors, some of whom would arrive unannounced to the office for assistance. Garrison was also responsible for conducting vendor training sessions and for serving, at any one time, on \u201cmultiple\u201d committees for the selection of vendors.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">In 2006, Garrison was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. As a result of her chronic condition, Garrison began missing significant amounts of work. Between 2007 and 2013, Garrison requested\u2014and the City granted\u2014a number of reasonable accommodations. For example, the City permitted Garrison to wear comfortable clothes and noise-cancelling headphones, relocated Garrison\u2019s office closer to a restroom, assigned Garrison a parking space close to the building, and posted signs requesting that others refrain from spraying fragrances. The City also granted in part Garrison\u2019s requests to work a modified work schedule: allowing her to work one half day a week, and from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. during the remainder of the week. Despite these accommodations, Garrison continued to miss significant amounts of work due mainly to sporadic, unplanned absences. On average, Garrison (who was scheduled to work 40 hours per week) worked only 30.5 hours per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">In July 2013, Garrison submitted an updated request for reasonable accommodations. Among other things, Garrison requested again that the City allow her to telecommute during \u201cflai-e-ups\u201d of her condition and to work \u201cas needed\u201d after hours to make up time she missed due to her absences.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>During meetings in July and September 2013, City representatives discussed Garrison\u2019s July 2013 request for reasonable accommodations, including her request to telecommute. Concerns were expressed about Garrison\u2019s poor attendance record despite her flexible work schedule and about Garrison\u2019s ability to interact with vendors if she was permitted to telecommute. The City concluded ultimately that full-time regular attendance was an essential function of Garrison\u2019s job. As a result, the City decided to deny Garrison\u2019s request to telecommute and, instead, to offer Garrison the option of a City-wide three-month job search as a reasonable accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In November 2013, Garrison filed a formal internal complaint against two of her supervisors. Garrison contended that her supervisors had discriminated against her based on her disability. Garrison also complained about the delay in receiving a response to her July 2013 request for reasonable accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">On 13 December 2013, the City informed Garrison of its decision to deny her request to telecommute. The City explained that full-time regular attendance was an essential function of Garrison\u2019s position and that Garrison had been unable to satisfy this requirement, despite having already been granted a flexible work schedule. Because Garrison was unable to perform an essential function of her job\u2014 regular full-time attendance\u2014the City notified Garrison that it was implementing its reasonable-accommodation policy. Under the policy, the City would search all vacant positions over a three-month period for a job whose essential functions Garrison could perform. On 24 February 2014\u2014 before the end of the City\u2019s three-month job search\u2014Garrison notified the City that she was taking an early retirement, effective immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Garrison filed this civil action against the City, alleging that the City discriminated against her by not providing her with a reasonable accommodation. Garrison also alleged that the City retaliated against her for filing a complaint about disability discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">The district court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court concluded that Garrison failed to establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination because she had not demonstrated that she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d In particular, the district court determined that Garrison could not perform an essential function of her job: full-time physical presence in the office. The district court also concluded that Garrison failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Holloman v. Mail-Well' Corp., 443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against a \u201cqualified individual\u201d on the basis of the individual\u2019s disability. Earl v. Mervyns, Inc., 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a)). Because \u201cdisability-discrimination claims under the FCRA are analyzed using the same framework as ADA claims,\u201d we consider Garrison\u2019s ADA and FCRA discrimination claims together. See Holly v. Clairson Indus., LLC, 492 F.3d 1\u00be47,1255 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">\u201cTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must show: (1) she is disabled; (2) she is a qualified individual; and (3) she was subjected to unlawful discrimination because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>of her disability.\u201d Earl, 207 F.3d at 1365. That Garrison is disabled within the meaning of the ADA is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">About the second factor, a \u201cqualified individual\u201d is someone who can perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The essential functions of a position \u201care the fundamental job duties of a position that an individual with a disability is actually required to perform.\u201d Holly, 492 F.3d at 1257. Whether a function is \u201cessential\u201d is determined on a case-by-case basis. Id. In determining whether a function is \u201cessential,\u201d the district court must consider the employer\u2019s judgment about the essential functions of a position and any written descriptions the employer prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants for the position. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201c[Although the employer\u2019s view is entitled to substantial weight in the calculus, this factor alone may not be conclusive.\u201d Holly, 492 F.3d at 1258 (quotations omitted). Other pertinent factors to consider include (1) the amount of time the employee spends performing the function; (2) the consequences of not requiring the employee to perform the function; (3) the work experience of past employees in the position; and (4) the current work experience of employees in similar jobs. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(n)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">An employer must provide a reasonable accommodation for an employee with a known disability, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer\u2019s business. Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1255 (11th Cir. 2001). A reasonable accommodation may include job-restructuring, permitting a part-time or modified work schedule, reassigning the employee to a vacant position, or acquiring or modifying equipment or devices. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). \u201cThe plaintiff bears the burden of identifying an accommodation, and of demonstrating that the accommodation allows him to perform the job\u2019s essential functions.\u201d Lm cas, 257 F.3d at 1255-56. The employee is not, however, necessarily entitled to the accommodation of her choice. See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The district court committed no error in concluding that Garrison was unable to perform an essential function of her job\u2014full-time physical attendance\u2014and, thus, was no \u201cqualified individual.\u201d First, the City asserts that Garrison\u2019s physical presence in the office during regular' business hours was an essential function of her position. And we owe the City\u2019s judgment \u201csubstantial weight.\u201d See Holly, 492 F.3d at 1258. Moreover, Garrison\u2019s own testimony establishes that her job required her to communicate regularly\u2014both in person and over the phone\u2014with internal department representatives and with external vendors, some of whom would arrive at the office without prior notice. Garrison also conducted vendor training sessions and served on multiple vendor-selection committees, both of which required her to be present in the office. In the light of this evidence, the district court concluded correctly that Garrison\u2019s position was customer-service oriented and that being physically present in the office during regular business hours was an essential function of Garrison\u2019s job.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">Contrary to Garrison\u2019s assertions on appeal, nothing evidences that other similarly-situated Purchasing Agents were permitted to telecommute or to work outside regular business hours. Nor has Garrison identified a single employee who was permitted to telecommute on the kind of regular, unscheduled, and long-term basis that Garrison had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Garrison has identified no reasonable accommodation that would have allowed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>to perform the essential functions of her job. Garrison has, thus, failed to establish that she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d for purposes of stating a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA or the FCRA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Both the ADA and the FCRA prohibit employers from retaliating against an employee for opposing an unlawful employment practice. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.10(7). We assess retaliation claims under the ADA and FCRA using the same framework employed for Title VII retaliation claims. Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, 117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir. 1997) (ADA); Wilbur v. Corr. Servs. Corp., 393 F.3d 1192, 1195 n.l (11th Cir. 2004) (FCRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">To avoid summary judgment on a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must show (1) statutorily protected expression; (2) a materially adverse action; and (3) a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action. Stewart, 117 F.3d at 1287. \u201cAn employment action is considered \u2018adverse\u2019 only if it results in some tangible, negative effect on the plaintiffs employment.\u201d Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1261. The Supreme Court has said that a \u201cmaterially adverse action\u201d is one that \u201cmight have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White, 548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">Garrison has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation. Garrison engaged in statutorily protected speech when she filed her formal complaint in November 2013.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> About the second element, Garrison has identified no \u201cmaterial adverse action\u201d taken against her. Because Garrison\u2019s requests to telecommute and to work outside regular business hours were no reasonable accommodations, the City\u2019s refusal to grant Garrison\u2019s requests constituted no material adverse action. Cf. Lucas, 257 F.3d at 1261. And Garrison\u2019s allegations that the City terminated her employment and denied Garrison alternative employment with the City are unsupported by the record: Garrison testified that she decided to retire before the end of the City\u2019s three-month job search.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Garrison has also failed to demonstrate that she was qualified for the Procurement Manager position: a position that required full-time regular attendance in the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">Garrison also contends that she was subjected to retaliatory harassment. But the alleged harassment\u2014complaints from Garrison\u2019s supervisors about her frequent absences\u2014was not \u201csufficiently se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>vere or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d See Gowski v. Peake, 682 F.3d 1299, 1312 (11th Cir. 2012). Moreover, nothing indicates that the alleged harassment \u201cmight have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d See Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry., 126 S.Ct. at 2415.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Even if we assume that Garrison could identify a materially adverse action (which she has not), Garrison has also failed to show a causal link between her protected activity and the alleged adverse acts. The record evidences that the complained-of conduct\u2014the alleged harassment, the City\u2019s failure to promote Garrison to a management position, the City\u2019s decision to deny Garrison\u2019s requests to telecommute, and the City\u2019s decision to implement a City-wide three-month job search\u2014occurred before Garrison filed her November 2013 formal complaint. Moreover, that the City denied Garrison\u2019s 2007 and 2012 requests to telecommute, on the basis that Garrison\u2019s position required full-time attendance in the office, further undercuts Garrison\u2019s argument that the City\u2019s refusal to grant Garrison\u2019s 2013 request to telecommute was causally related to Garrison\u2019s formal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Because Garrison has failed to demonstrate either a materially adverse action or a causal link, the district court granted properly summary judgment on Garrison\u2019s claims for retaliation under the ADA and the FCRA,</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">. Because Garrison has failed to satisfy her burden of identifying a reasonable accommodation, the City was \"under no duty to engage in an 'interactive process\u2019 or to show undue hardship.\u201d See Earl, 207 F.3d at 1367.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-9\">. In the district court, Garrison asserted only that she was retaliated against in response to her November 2013 formal internal complaint. Thus, to the extent Garrison now identifies other forms of protected speech in support of her retaliation claim, we will not consider those arguments on appeal. See Access Now, Inc, v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b847-13\">.In her appellate brief, Garrison makes passing reference to her contention that the City\u2019s conduct \"forced\u201d her to take an early retirement. Because she makes no substantive argument for constructive discharge, however, that argument is abandoned. See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., 739 F.3d 678, 681 (11th Cir. 2014) (\u201can appellant abandons a claim when he either makes only passing references to it or raises it in a perfunctory manner without supporting arguments and authority.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
