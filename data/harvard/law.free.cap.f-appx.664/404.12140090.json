Penal Code \u00a7 22.04. Guerrero-Araniva argues for the first time on appeal that the distinct court plainly erred by characterizing his 1991 Texas conviction for injury to a child as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) for purposes of applying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) sentencing enhancement and for convicting and sentencing him under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Relying primarily on <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), Guerrero-Araniva argues that the definition of a crime of violence in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), which is incorporated by reference into \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F)\u2019s definition of an aggravated felony, is unconstitutionally vague on its face. He further contends that this court cannot apply \u00a7 16(b) in this case without violating due process. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The Government has filed an unopposed motion for summary affirmance, urging that Guerrero-Araniva\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, </em>831 F.3d 670 (5th Cir. 2016) (en banc), <em>pet. for cert. filed </em>(Sept. 29, 2016) (No. 16-6259). The Government is correct that <em>Gonzalez-Longoria </em>forecloses Guerrero-Araniva\u2019s facial vagueness challenge to \u00a7 16(b), as well as his challenge to our application of \u00a7 16(b) on due. process grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternate motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-30\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-9\">. The recent grant of certiorari by the United States Supreme Court on the issue whether \u00a7 16(b) is unconstitutional in light <em>o\u00ed Johnson </em>in <em>Lynch v. Dimaya, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 137 S.Ct. 31, 195 L.Ed.2d 902 (2016), does not alter our analysis. This court is bound by its own precedent unless and until that precedent is altered by a decision of the Supreme Court. <em>See Wicker v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 155, 157-58 (5th Cir. 1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
