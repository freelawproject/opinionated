Is the jurisdiction which the court is now called upon to exercise, appellate or original?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-5\">Appellate jurisdiction is that sort of jurisdiction which is exercised by a superior court over the orders; judgments, and decrees *of an inferior court, on the removal of the record of the inferior into the superior court. 2 Yerger, 499 ; 10 lb. 200.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-6\">This idea of an appeal, from the decision of an inferior to a superior tribunal, is wholly wanting in the case in hand, of a petition to the court to review its own decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-7\">The evil to be remedied by the appeal from the inferior court, is the judgment or decree of that court. Under our present system, like that of the federal courts, the judgment or decree of the Supreme Court is remanded, for execution, tq the court below; and when its power is exercised by the rendition of a final judgment or decree, and the cause is remanded to the court below for execution of such final judgment or decree, it has become <em>functus officio; </em>that power and jurisdiction which were called into action by the appeal, having been fully exercised, is exhausted; and if the final judgment or decree, which has been pronounced by the court of <em>dernier ressort, </em>shall ever again come to be reviewed (which could only be done in the same court), it evidently would be, in virtue of the exercise of some other jurisdiction than the exhausted, appellate jurisdiction, in virtue of which the judgment or decree to be reviewed was rendered. 7 Wheat. 58; 1 Hen. &amp; Mun. 13; 2 Paige, 45; 3 How. S. C. 413.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b581-8\">The Supreme Court of Ohio is an appellate court of <em>dernier ressort, </em>with very limited original jurisdiction \u2014 in this respect being almost exactly like the Supreme Court of the United States. Cases have been brought before that court (U. S.) by appeal, in which for reasons wholly overlooked by attorneys and court, the federal courts had not. any jurisdiction, but which passed into final judgment or decree in the Supreme Court. And these same cases, after being remanded to be further proceeded in by the court below, and for execution of the decree, have again been brought before the Supreme Court \u2014 the whole record \u2014 and the errors for want of jurisdiction pointed out, and the court invoked to vacate its former <em>final </em>adjudications. But this has been *refused as often as asked, not because the court was not made sensible of the error, but <em>for the want of power, </em>and this, too, in cases regularly brought before the court, <em>by appeal, </em>after further and final orders in the lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>court \u2014 the Supreme Court holding, in all such cases, that, having once exercised its power and jurisdiction in the case, and. upon the record in which the alleged error existed, it had no power to review and reverse its own judgments and decrees.. 3 How. U. S. 413.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-4\">The jurisdiction by which an appellate court of final resort would supervise its own decisions, is not <em>appellate </em>but <em>original, </em>and therefore this court, for constitutional reasons, has not the power to exercise such jurisdiction. If such jurisdiction can be holdon to be <em>appellate, </em>it can only be exercised by the court, when authorized by law so to do; and as yet no law exists warranting its exercise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-5\">The authorities principally relied upon, in support of the propositions contained in this argument, are the following, the points decided in each, applicable to the case, being here briefly stated:</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-6\">\u201cA rehearing not allowed in equity cause, after it has been remitted to the court below to carry into effect the decree.\u201d Browder <em>v. </em>McArthur, <em>7 </em>Wheat. 58.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-7\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has no power to review its decisions whether in a case at law or in equity.

G-wynne, </em>for defendant, in support of the motion to dismiss, made the following points :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b582-14\">The Supreme Court of Ohio, under the constitution of 1851, can not entertain a bill of review, to a decree rendered by the same court, in a cause reserved to it, after the constitution of 1851 took \u2022effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u201c The original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited, by the constitution, to writs of <em>quo </em>warranto, <em>mandamus, habeas corpus, </em>and. <em>procedendo; </em>and as this case does not come under either of the heads of original jurisdiction, it must be entertained under the appellate jurisdiction orbe dismissed.\u201d The Logan Branch, ex parte, 20 Ohio, 432 ; 2 Ohio St. 498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-5\">The most imperative mandate by the legislature, that a bill of review may, or can, be filed in the Supreme Court, can avail naught, if that court has not the power, by the constitution, to hear and \u2022determine it; if it has not, in other words, jurisdiction over it. 6 Pet. 709; 2 How. U. S. 338. Notwithstanding, therefore, express provisions of law, courts, having appellate jurisdiction, have refused to act upon original applications ; such as petitions to issue writs of <em>mandamus </em>or <em>habeas corpus. </em>1 Cranch, 135, 175; 7 Eng. 103; 4 Florida, 165; 9 Porter, 383, 389. If jurisdiction be wanting, all proceedings of courts are void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-6\">The proposition, that a court, with appellate jurisdiction, may entertain, a bill of review, filed in that court, can only be maintained by showing that such a bill does not come within the purview of \u25a0original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-7\">In Cox &amp; Catron <em>v. </em>Breedlove et al., 2 Yerger, 499, it was decided that a bill of review will not lie upon a decree rendered *in the Supreme Court of Tennessee. This is supported by Overton <em>v. </em>Bigelow, 10 Yerg. 48.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-8\">In Mercer <em>v. </em>Stark, 1 Sm. &amp; Mar. Ch. 479, 485, the chancellor speaks of the high court of errors and appeals, in Mississippi. \u25a0\u201c That jurisdiction of a bill of review does not belong to a tribunal having mere appellate jurisdiction, is, I think, perfectly clear. Bills <em>of </em>review are classed, by Lord Redesdale, as bills in the nature of original bills. If this is their true character, if they partake of the nature of an original bill in chancery, it would seem difficult to sustain the jurisdiction of a court, that is declared to have no jurisdiction but such as belongs to a high court of errors and appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b583-9\">See opinion of the Court of Appeals of Virginia, Reid\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>v. </em>Striker\u2019s Adm\u2019r, 7 Grattan, 76, 80.

An appeal from the decree of the chancellor or vice-chancellor to the House of Lords, is, by petition to reverse or vary the decree, upon the grounds stated, and is analogous to a writ of error? or certiorari at law. 2 Smith Ch. Prac. 39-47, sec. 42; 2 Harrison Ch. Prac. 127, 128.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARd4\">II. The decrees of the United States district courts are *reversible by the United States circuit courts, upon a writ of error. Gordon Dig. 99 ; Ingersol Dig. 92 ; sec. 22, judiciary act of September 26,1789 ; appeal by section 21, judiciary act of September 26, 1789, in admiralty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-8\">III. Decrees of United States circuit. court are revisable in the United States Supreme Court, on writs of error, as at law. Sec. 22, judiciary act of September 24, 1789; Ingersol Dig. 92; Gordon Dig. 83.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-9\">IV. Decrees of the state courts are revisable in the United States Supreme Court, on writs of error, where is drawn in question the validity of a state statute, upon the ground of its repugnancy to the United States constitution, etc. Sec. 29, judiciary act of September 24, 1789; Ingersol Dig. 99 ; Gordon Dig. 81.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-10\">V. In admiralty cases the appeal suspends the sentence altogether, and it is not <em>res adjudieata </em>till the final sentence of the appellate court. Gordon Dig. 84 ; 5 Cranch, 280; 5 Wheat. 434; 10 Wheat, 502.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-11\">VI. In Kentucky an appeal, like a writ of error, does not vacate the decree appealed from, but is simply a proceeding to review the decree or action of the inferior court. It operates as a supersedeas, in the same way, and upon the same terms, that a writ of error operates, and not otherwise. 1 Ky. Dig. (1834) 127,142.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b584-12\">VII. In New York an appeal from the final decree of the chancellor does not vacate or stay the proceedings on the decree of the chancellor, but takes up all his proceedings connected with the final decree. 1 Johns. Ch. 77,189; 3 lb. 66; 7 lb. 295.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696, 697\">*696, 697</page-number>y-III. In New York an appeal from the decree of the chancellor to the court of errors is by petition precisely like the petition for an appeal to the House of Lords. It is to vacate, alter, etc., the chancellor\u2019s order. 1 Johns. Ch. 325, 560; 20 Johns. 501; 9 lb. 442-</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-5\">IX. 1. The judiciary act of 1803 gave the Supreme Court of *Ohio original jurisdiction in certain casos, and appellate jurisdiction from the common pleas in land cases, and other cases over \u00a7100, and regulated appeals. 1 Chase Stat. 355, sec. 3; 357, see. 9; 1 Ohio, 176.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-6\">2. This act is silent as to the effect of proceedings on an appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-7\">X. 1. The chancery act of 1804 gives to the Supreme Court of Ohio original jurisdiction in certain cases, and appellate jurisdiction from common pleas, in cases over $100, and land cases. It regulates and directs how appeals shall be taken. It allows also bills of review. 1 Chase Stat. 432, secs. 1, 2, 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-8\">2. The chancery act of 1807 recognizes the act of 1804, but is silent as to appeals. 1 Chase Stat. 565.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-9\">3. The chancery act of 1810 gives to the Supreme Court of Ohio -original and appellate jurisdiction in certain cases (sec, 2), and gives appeals as in law cases (sec. 51). It allows reviews (sec. 63). I Chase Stat. 690.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-10\">4. The practice act of the same year, and taking effect at the same time, allows final decrees to be re-examined by writ of error in\u2019 the .Supreme Court. 1 Chase Stat. 707, sec. 13. It also allows appeals, and declares the effect thereof to be to render the judgment or decree appealed from void. 1 Chase Stat. 711. secs. 41, 42, 1 lb. 707, sec. 13; 711, secs. 41, 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-11\">5. The practice act of 1816 is in these respects similar to the practice act of 1810; 2 Chase Stat, 970, secs. 95-98; 2 lb. 971, secs. 99, 100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-12\">6. The practice act of 1824 is similar to the prior acts (2 Chase Stat. 1275, secs. 95, 97-99), with this qualification: the lien remains, .and the decree or judgment is suspended by the appeal. 2 Chase Stat, 1276, secs. 100-102.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-13\">7. The chancery act of 1824 allows appeals as in suits at law, also reviews. The practice act of that year allows writs of error on decrees. 2 Chase Stat. 1282, sec. 45; 2 lb. 1286, sec. 66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b585-14\">*8. The practice act of 1831 is like that of 1824 upon appeals, but does not allow writs of error upon decrees. 3 Chase Stat. 1690, secs. 108-112.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>9. The chancery act of 1831 allows appeals as at law, and liens-preserved, etc. 3 Chase Stat. 1702, see. 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-5\">XI. It is very apparent that the purpose and object of the remedy given by an appeal from the chancellor or vice-chancellor in England to the House of Lords, or from the United \u00a1States circuit court to the United States Supreme Court, or from the chancellor to the court of ei\u2019rors in New York, or from the circuit court in chancery in Kentucky to the court of appeals, are, to re-examine the decree of the inferior court, for affirmance or reversal. The appellate court acts entirely as a court of errors at law. The decree below stands until reversed, and may be proceeded in, unless suspended by an order, bend, etc., for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-6\">XII. In Ohio, upon her appellate system under the constitution of 1802, far different has been the practice. The appeal certainly, after the chancery act of 1810, vacated the decree appealed from, and simply transferred the case from one chancellor to another, to be considered and examined, <em>de novo, </em>as if no decree had ever been pronounced \u2014 even upon new pleadings and new jiroofs, if necessary. The case, though appealed, is still before the chancellor-as an original case, and not as a case passed upon and for revision, where the decree appealed from is to be affirmed, modified, or reversed. So the law continued from 1810 until 1824. The law of 1824 retained the lien of the decree appealed from, but suspended it until the appellate court made its order upon the original case, as a court of chancery, and not as a court of errors. In Ohio, the-whole effect of the appeal was to transfer the case from one chancellor to another, to be taken' up, heard, considered, and decreed upon, precisely as if no transfer had ever been made, and no adjudication had been had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b586-7\">XIII. It is quite evident, then, there is no analogy between these appellate systems; and while it is eminently true the one-*does not allow bills of review in the court of errors to reexamine its decrees, the other does; because its court is not a court of errors acting upon a decree, but a court of chancery acting uj)on the original case without or aside from any former decree. And as-the known usages of chancery, as well as the statutes regulating our chancery practice, have always allowed reviews of all chancellors\u2019 decrees, no good reason can be given why the one chancellor\u2019s-decrees should not be reviewed as well as the decrees of the other. In fact, all decrees of all chancellors come under the same usaga- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>and the same statute, and in Ohio the decrees of the Supreme Court can be examined on review precisely as the decrees of the court of common pleas.' In this respect, the rule and the statute applicable to the decrees of the one court are equally applicable to the decrees of the other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-5\"><em>M. </em>Stanbery, on the same side:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">This was a case in chancery, <em>pending </em>in the Supreme Court for Hamilton county, on the 1st September, 1851, when the new constitution went into force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\">The final decree in common pleas was rendered in the common pleas of Hamilton at the February term, 1851.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-8\">Having been transferred from the Supreme Court for Hamilton county to the district court for the same county, it was, by the district court, at the November term, 1852, reserved to the Supreme-Court under the new constitution; and at the January term, 1853, the final decree \u2014 being a decree reversing the original decree \u2014 was-rendered in that court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-9\">The question now presented is, whether the remedy, by bill of review, may be resorted to in the Supreme Court by Mr. Longworth, the party against whom the decree of reversal was pronounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-10\">I think the question depends on the true construction of section 4 of the schedule of the constitution, and section 533 of the code.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-11\">*In the first place, it is clear that if a bill of review will not lie in this court, it will not lie at all. The final decree was rendered here, not in the district court. Of course the remedy by bill of review must be in this court, and not in the district court. To deny that remedy to us here, is to deny it altogether. -Now, it is undeniable that, as this suit was a suit in chancery, pending when the hew constitution took effect, one of its incidents, or, to speak more correctly, one of its <em>remedies, </em>under the laws then existing, was the right of either party to file a bill of review upon the final decree of <em>any </em>court having jurisdiction in the case. The courts in which such final decree might have been had at that tim\u00e9, were the common pleas and the Supreme Court on the circuit, whether the decree were rendered on the circuit, or after reservation, in the court in bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-12\">The new constitution provides for a new organization of the courts \u2014 a new common pleas, a district court, and a Supremo Court; and it provides, as to cases pending in either of these courts, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>they shall be transferred to the new courts; that is to say, from the old common pleas to the new common pleas \u2014 from the Supreme Court on the circuit to the district court, and from the Supremo Court in bank to the new Supreme Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">This case, as has been stated, was, at the date of the new constitution, and at the date of the first act organizing the courts under it (February, 1852), pending in the Supreme Court on the circuit; and was, accordingly, under the 12th article of the schedule, transferred to the district court for Hamilton county, <em>11 to be proceeded in\" </em>(as is the language of this section) <em>\u201cas though no change had been made in said Supreme Court.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">It is very clear, that while the now constitution contemplates a new system of procedure, and provides for a new organization of courts, that it carefully excepts \u201c <em>cases pending </em>\u201d from its operation. They are not to be \u201c <em>affected \" </em>by it; but are simply transferred into the new courts, as successors of the old, to be <em>proceeded </em>in, without any <em>change </em>\u2014 a <em>change </em>merely of the <em>forum, </em>not of the <em>mode of procedure.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3T\">*Next comes the code \u2014 the new law of remedies \u2014 the change from the old mode of procedure. It abolishes all suits in chancery \u2014 all bills, original and not original \u2014 and, among others, all bills of review. No court in Ohio has any longer jurisdiction of a suit in chancery, to be thereafter instituted, with the exception clearly provided for in section 533.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">That section, in the plainest language, provides a saving of the remedy by bill of review. It- provides this remedy as well for final decrees in chancery theretofore rendered, as for final decrees thereafter to be rendered in cases then pending. It provides or saves this remedy as to all final decrees, without any saving or qualification, or exception of any court, which has rendered, or which may render, such final decree. It provides that all chancery cases then pending, in whatever court, may be prosecuted to final decree \u2014 and after final decree, maybe \u201creviewed in the same manner \u201d \u2014 that is, by bill of review in the court where the final decree is rendered \u2014 \u201c and within the same time as if this code had not taken effect \u201d \u2014 that is, within five years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-9\">Now, what sort of a case have we here? A case in chancery pending when the new constitution took effect, and therefore not to be affected by that new constitution \u2014 a proceeding in chancery pending when the code took effect, and to be proceeded in, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>be reviewed in the same manner and within the same time, as if the code had never been passed ! And yet it is argued that the constitution or code, or both together, have affected this pending suit in a most vital particular \u2014 have changed the mode of procedure, and have cut off one of the pro-existing remedies !</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-5\">A very artificial and, I may add, unsound process of reasoning, leads the opposite counsel to this result.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-6\">They say that the present Supreme Court has no original juris\u2022diction,' except in the four cases specified in the constitution \u2014 that, a bill of review is the exercise of original jurisdiction. They say,, further, that the present Supreme Court is a tribunal in the last resort, and therefore its decision is final, and not to'be *questioned on a bill of review, even if such a proceeding is in the nature of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-7\">In this reasoning, we lose sight of the case. \"We are not considering the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as now fixed by law, .\u2022and as a question at largo. If we were, there would be a shorter .answer to our bill of review; and that is, that it has no jurisdiction proper in any chancery case, either original or appellate, upon an original bill, a bill of review, or any other mode of proceeding in chancery. <em>We </em>are to consider its jurisdiction in an excepted class of cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-8\">There are now several chancery cases upon the docket of the present Supreme Court. They are here i\u00f1 consequence of the \u2022savings in the constitution and the code. They involve a sort of jurisdiction \u2014 a mode of procedure which no court in Ohio can exorcise under its proper jurisdiction. They are the excepted cases, not merely to be decided, but to be proceeded in, and especially to be reviewed, in the old manner, and not according to the new manner. It is true these proceedings are to be had in the new courts, but the new courts, <em>pro hac vice, </em>must conform to the old proceedings and remedies, and are inevitably invested with all jurisdiction, call it what you will, appellate or original, necessary to that end.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-9\">In arranging these new courts, our case has been transferred, first \u25a0into the district court, and then taken, without any decision in the \u25a0district court, to the present Supreme Court, where a decree was rendered against us, at the January term, 1853. Every stop in the proceedings to this final deerbe, has been according to the old forms. It was a case ponding when the new constitution took effect, and a -decree in and the time not for a review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702, 703\">*702, 703</page-number>when the code .took effect. The constitution says the new organisation of the courts shall not affect the case, and the code says the-decree may be reviewed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-4\">It is not to be overlooked that these savings and provisions are-in relation to the remedies, and therefore are to receive a liberal ^interpretation. But what sort of interpretation is claimed upon this motion? Directly in the face of these savings, we are-told that the right to file a,bill of review is taken away. The constitution saves the right, and the code not only saves it, but gives it expressly \u2014 and yet it is argued that it is taken away!</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">Suppose the case had not been reserved to this court, but that the final decree had been rendered in the district court, could we have been refused our bill of review then ? The reasoning of the opposite counsel would have denied it to us ; for that court has no more original jurisdiction than the Supreme Court; and so all the savings and provisions made to save our rights, would be frustrated. Are we in a worse condition 'because our case has been, on the motion of the other party, and by the'act of the district court, transferred to this tribunal for decision? We answer in the negative. The right existing in us, the right saved to us, was to prosecute a bill of review upon any final decree, in any court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">The matter seems to me to be too plain for much argument; I shall not urge it further. At the same time, I do not admit that anything like original jurisdiction is involved in a bill of review, or that the cases cited from the Supremo Court of the United States have anything to do with the question now presented. It is one thing to consider how far this court will review, upon error or otherwise, its decisions upon cases that come before it, appropriately,, under the new system \u2014 quite another thing it is, to consider what this court will do upon cases like one now in hand, over which it exercises a sort of vicarious jurisdiction, and which come to it as remains of an old system, and to be proceeded in, and settled, upon the old remedies.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ai_3\">Kennon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">A bill of review was filed, in the court of common pleas of Hamilton county, to reverse a decree of that court. The cause was taken to the Supreme Court of that county, by appeal, and was there pending when the new constitution took *effect ; was regularly transferred to the district court, and by that court reserved for decision by the Supreme Court. At the January term,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>1853, tbe Supreme Court reversed tbe decree of the court of common pleas, and remanded the cause to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The hill under consideration was filed in this court, to review and reverse its own decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Sturges and Anderson, who are defendants to this last bill of review, moved the court to dismiss the bill. The princij&gt;al grounds-for the motion are\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">1. That, by the present constitution of Ohio, the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction only in <em>quo warranto, habeas corpus, mandamus, </em>and procedendo; that, in the consideration of this bill of review to its own decision, the Supreme Court would be exercising' original, and not appellate, jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">2. That, if it be the exercise of appellate jurisdiction, still the legislature, although authorized by the constitution to do so, has'not as yet conferred that jurisdiction on the Supreme Court; and, therefore, whether it be the exercise of original or appellate jurisdiction, this court can not entertain jurisdiction, and the bill must be dismissed. <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">On the other side, it is claimed\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">1. That, whether the entertaining of a bill of review be the exercise of an original or appellate jurisdiction by this court, it can rightfully entertain jurisdiction, for the reason that the original bill was pending when the new constitution took effect, and that,, by a provision in the constitution and subsequent acts of the legislature, the right to correct an error <em>of </em>the Supreme Court, <em>by </em>bill of review, is saved to the parties to such pending suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">' 2. That the Supreme Court, in entertaining a bill of review,, would be exercising appellate and not original jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">The motion has been argued on both sides by able counsel, and with great ability, and has received a very careful consideration, from this court. This question is one not free from doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">*It is very clear, that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction of the case in which it made the decree, to reverse which the j&gt;resent bill of review is filed. This indeed is not denied. It could not be with any show of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">It is equally clear, that however erroneous the decree may be,, if this court can not review its own decree, no <em>other </em>court can, and' the party is wholly without remedy. The truth of this proposition is admitted by the counsel who make this motion, but they claim: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>that it is the necessary consequence of a decision of a court of the last resort, having no more <em>original </em>jurisdiction than is conferred on our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Indeed, it is argued with much force, \u201cthat it would be far better for the parties litigant \u2014 all who are engaged as lawyers, parties, and judges, in preparing and disposing of business before it, to understand that its determinations are, in the full sense of the word, <em>final, </em>than that the court might be required to review its determinations; that the business would be better prepared for the action of the court, the court would deliberate more carefully, and that which is, in most cases, of equal importance would follow, viz., there would be an end of litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">That the legislature, under our constitution, could authorize an appeal, in all cases, from the decisions of the district courts to the Supreme Court, there can be no doubt. The Supreme Court, by the constitution, \u201c shall have original jurisdiction in <em>quo warranto, .habeas corpus, mandamus, </em>and <em>procedendo, </em>and such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by law.\u201d The Supreme Court is <em>capable </em>of receiving appellate jurisdiction directly from any court in the state. The legislature might lawfully provide, that every case tried in the several courts of common pleas, whether the questions were of law or of fact, might be appealed to the Supreme Court of the state; that such appeal should vacate the the judgment below; and that the case, when so appealed, should be tried in the Supreme Court, in the same manner as in the common pleas; and that the Supreme Court should have the same power *and control over the case, which the court of common pleas had before the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Such case could not originate in the Supreme Court; but, having \u2022originated in the court below, and having been properly brought to the Supreme Court, by appeal, the question might arise, what power could the legislature confer upon the Supreme Court over the ease, and the parties in the Supreme Court? Is that court not capable of receiving power to try a case by a jury \u2014 to receive the verdict, render judgment, and enforce its own judgment by execution ? Is it not capable of receiving power to grant a new trial, either on account of the verdict being against evidence, or on account of the court receiving incompetent or rejecting competent evidence, or on account of the misdirection of the court to the ury on points of law? The Supreme Court, as an appellate court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>has jurisdiction of the cause; and it could scarcely be doubted but that all these powers might be conferred on such appellate court, as necessarily incident to the proper determination of the cause. The time within which such application to the Supreme or appellate court, for a new trial, could be made, might also be prescribed by the legislature. It might be required to be made at the same term at which the judgment was rendered, or the time might be extended until the first day of the next term of the court after the rendition of the judgment. We think such legislation would not be liable to the objection that it was unconstitutional because it conferred upon the court original jurisdiction. It would be appellate jurisdiction if the language of the constitution had been stronger than it is, and if it had provided that the Supreme Court should have original jurisdiction in <em>quo warranto, habeas corpus, mandamus, </em>and <em>procedendo, </em>and in no other case whatever. Still, we think the time for making application to that court for a new trial might constitutionally, by legislation, be extended to a term of the court subsequent to that in which the judgment was rendered. The granting of such new trial, and vacating the judgment, would not be the exercise of original jurisdiction. The superior court would *kave acquired jurisdiction of the cause, and of the parties, by appeal; and having rightfully acquired that jurisdiction, under the constitution, the question would be, what power is the court capable of receiving over the cause and the parties, as an appellate court; or, in other words, where the superior court has, by appeal from some inferior court, rightfully acquired jurisdiction of a cause, can the legislature, without a violation of the constitution of the state, confer on the court the power to correct its own decisions in such appellate cases, at a subsequent term of the court, and after it has rendered a judgment or decree, by writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>or by a bill of review?</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">That a bill of review in such case would be an original proceeding, and that, in entertaining it, the court would be exercising an original jurisdiction, and powers which can not be conferred on the Supreme Court, is the claim of the parties making this motion. It is said that when the decree is once made, and the term of the court closed, both parties and the cause are beyond the power of the court; and after that term, jurisdiction could be acquired only by an <em>original proceeding, </em>and, on the part of the Supreme Court, would be the exercise of an original jurisdiction, which is not, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u2022can not be, constitutionally conferred on that court. If this claim be true, it certainly-puts an end to the controversy, and the bill must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">It is undoubtedly true, that no bill of review can be filed until after a final decree is rendered, and the parties, in effect, out of court. Can the parties be brought into court a second time, for the purpose of having that decree reversed, unless by an original proceeding? The complainants in the original bill may be the defendants in the bill of review, and, according to our practice, the defendants must be brought into court by a subpena in chancery, if \u2022one can be served. It does not, however, follow that, because the bill prays a subpena, and the court issues one, the court is necessarily exercising an original jurisdiction. If a cause is brought into the Supreme Court by a writ of error to an ^inferior \u25a0court, some process must be served on the defendant in error; and yet it could hardly be contended that the Supreme Court, in such \u2022case, was exercising an original jurisdiction, merely because the parties were, for the first time, brought before the Supreme Court by a process issued by that court; so that it can not be determined \u25a0that the Supreme Court is in the exercise of original jurisdiction, merely because it brings the parties before it by original process.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Is a bill of review an original proceeding ? Is it any more so than a writ of error, to reverse the judgment of an inferior court ? The one is prosecuted to reverse a judgment of an inferior court, the other to reverse the decree of the same court;' the rights of the parties have, in both cases, been determined by a competent tribunal, and the object of the proceedings, in both cases, is to reverse that determination. It might be difficult to find any treatise \u25a0on chancery proceeding in which it is distinctly claimed that a bill \u25a0of review is an original bill. Some authors treat it as a bill in the <em>nature </em>of an original bill; others as a secondary bill; and Cooper, in his Treatise on Equity Pleadings, says it is <em>not </em>an original bill. He divides bills into original and not original bills. He calls all those original bills which relate to some matter \u201c not before litigated in the court by the same parties,\u201d and those <em>not </em>original \u201c which relate to some matter already litigated in the court by the same parties, and which are either an addition to or continuance of an original suit.\u201d Cooper\u2019s Eq. Pleadings, 43. Among these bills not original, he names a bill of revivor, a supplemental bill, a .bill of revivor and a cross-bill, a bill to a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708, 709\">*708, 709</page-number>in a former suit into execution, a bill to impeach a decree for fraud, .and a bill of <em>review. </em>\u2022 These several bills are said, by Cooper, not to be original bills; they all relate to matters already litigated by the parties. Story says : \u201c The most general division of bills is into those which are original and those which are not original. Original bills are those which relate to some matter not before litigated in the court *by the same persons and standing in the same interests. Bills not original are those which relate to .some matter already litigated in the court by the same persons, and which are either an addition to or a continuance of an' original bill, or both. There' is another class of bills which is of a mixed nature, and sometimes partakes of the character of both of the -others. Thus, for example, bills brought for the purpose of cross-litigation, or of controverting, or suspending, or <em>reversing </em>some -decree or order of the court, or of obtaining the benefit of a former decree, or carrying it into execution, are not considered as strictly a continuance of the former bill, but in the nature of original bills.\u201d \u25a0Story\u2019s Equity Pleadings, sec. 16. Indeed, an application to the same court in which a decree was made to reverse its own decision is sometimes termed an <em>appeal, </em>and consequently may be said to be, on the part of the court determining such application, the exercise of apq&gt;ellate jurisdiction. Chief Baron Gilbert says : \u201c The sentence by the canon and civil law was two-fold \u2014 interlocutory and \u25a0definitive. The interlocutory was any order pronounced by the judges in the .cause touching the proceedings before they came to a definite sentence; and the interlocutory order is always alterable before the definitive sentence. The definitive sentence must always be in writing, and can not be altered after it is pronounced and signed by the judge; but after it is so signed, they might appeal to a superior jurisdiction. But where they were in the last resort, as when it came up to the prince, there they might appeal from the prince uninformed to the prince better informed, which was in the nature of a review of the same sentence. Thus it is in the court of chancery; for all orders are interlocutory till they come to the definitive sentence, which is signed by the court; for that sentence, signed and enrolled, is the definitive sentence in the cause, and all preparations before that are but interlocutory. For the decree pronounced on the hearing, which is taken down by the register, is but an interlocutory sentence, till it comes to be signed by the \u25a0*judge of the court and enrolled.\u201d Story\u2019s Eq. Pleadings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>321, note I. This was probably the origin of our bills of review; and if so, in their very origin, when the cause was in a court of the <em>last resort, </em>by appeal, a proceeding in the nature of a bill of review to the decision of the same court, is called, by Chief Baron Gilbert, an <em>appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">A bill of review is, in chancery, what a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>is at law, and if sustained, places the parties where they stood at the time the error occurred. The latter is sustained for error in fact only, while the former may be for either an error in law or for newly-discovered evidence, which could not possibly have been used at the time when the decree passed, or, at least, could not have been used by the exercise of proper diligence. A bill of review does, indeed, in many respects, assume the form of an original bill; but it can not, in its very nature, be an original action; it must necessarily be founded on a matter already litigated and determined between the same partifcs. Its effect on a decree in the same court is precisely what the effect of a writ of error is on the judgment of an inferior court. They are .both founded on a previous adjudication, and the object of both is to reverse that adjudication. The-one which originates in the Supreme Court to reverse the judgment of the district court, is said to be appellate; while the other, originating in the same court, to reverse its own decree, is said to be the exercise of original jurisdiction. It is insisted that it is essential to appellate jurisdiction that the cause must-have <em>originated </em>in an inferior court; that the first step in the case must be taken in the low^r court; and this is undoubtedly true as to the general acceptation of the term \u201cajDpellate jurisdiction.\u201d It is true, under our-constitution, that the only jurisdiction which our courts, can have, may bo said to be either original or appellate, and the difficulty in this case is to detox-mine what is original and what appellate jui-isdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The district court, under our constitution, is capable of receiving no more original jurisdiction than the Supreme Court. The ^constitution provides in art. 4, see. 6, that the district court shall have like original jurisdiction with the Supreme Court, and such appellate jurisdiction as may be provided by law. Nearly all cases originating in the court of common pleas may be appealed to the district court, and the judgment or decree thereby in effect vacated. The whole case is in the district court, and it makes a final decree; but it has no to entertain a bill of review to its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>decree, because, as is claimed, that would be the exercise of original jurisdiction, and the bill filed in such case would be an original bill or suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Independent of any statutory provision, a court having equity jurisdiction could entertain a bill of review. The court making a decree could always review it, or, at any rate, a court having original chancery jurisdiction could do so. The only two cases in which this bill could be brought, are declared by the ordinances in chancery of Lord \u00abBacon, one of which is, that \u201cno decree shall be reversed, altered, or explained, being once under the great seal, but upon bill of review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The entertaining a bill of review is a long-established practice of courts of chancery, a power incident (at least) to a court having original chancery jurisdiction. To prefer such a bill had become an established remedy to correct errors of the court making the decree. Our statute directing the mode of proceeding in chancery, did provide that any person who was a party to a decree of a court of chancery, his heirs, executors, or administrators, might file, a petition for a review of the proceedings, in which such former decree was rendered, at any time within five years next after the rendering of such decree, etc. But I think it may be safely said that this section of the statute operated rather as a limitation of the time within which the petition might be filed than as conferring a power upon a court of chancery to entertain a bill of review. The power existed without this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">It seems to follow that before the adoption of the new constitution, *if chancery jurisdiction had been conferred on the court of common pleas, it could, without the aid of a statute, have reviewed its own decree upon a bill of review. In such ease, if the legislature had authorized an appeal to the Supreme Court from the original decree, thereby carrying the whole case to the Supreme Court, to be by it considered and determined, it would be strange if the appellate court could not review its own decree. It would, in effect, be appealing from the decision of a court of full and ample jurisdiction, to make a final decree, and afterward to correct errors in the decree to a supreme or higher court, with less jurisdiction, with less power, than the court from which the appeal had been taken. The lower court could, but the court higher in title could not, correct its errors made in its own decree. If such be^ the law, it must be based on the idea either that the higher court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>can not err, or that it is for the good of tbe public that there should be an end of litigation, whether the decree be wright or wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Our old system of appeals from the decision of facts was almost peculiar to Ohio alone. It amounted to a second trial of the same case in another court. It was not confined to questions of law, but embraced the trial of questions of fact also. Under such a system, it would seem to be almost a matter of necessity that the Supreme Court should have at least as much power as the inferior court from which the case had been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The reasons for limiting the power or jurisdiction of an inferior and a superior court are very different. The reason for not conferring certain jurisdiction on a justice of the peace or probate judge, would not be the reason why the same jurisdiction should not be conferred on the Supreme Court. Various and cogent reasons might exist why <em>original jurisdiction </em>in all cases should be conferred neither upon the district nor the Supreme Court; but when the constitution makes these superior courts capable of receiving <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction, and the law authorizes the ^appeal, as at now does, of the whole case from the decision 'of the court of (Common pleas to the district court, no good reason can be given in \u00a1such case for <em>limiting </em>the <em>power </em>of the district court over the case -thus appealed, or for giving it less power than the court, from which -the appeal was taken, had before the appeal. The district court \u2022.should have at least the same power over the case and parties \u25a0which the court of common pleas had. The constitution contcm\u00a1plated the right of appeal from the common pleas to the district \u25a0 court, and provided for appellate jurisdiction in that court of any .amount of business, and therefore limited its original jurisdiction \u2022to the four cases mentioned in that instrument. If the code, which \u00a1undertakes to abolish the distinctions between actions at law and suits -in chancery, had never been passed, or should be repealed, and the \u00a1distinction between the two jurisdictions still existed, or should be \u2022restored, we think, by a fair construction of our constitution, the legislature might confer, on either the district or Supreme Court, jurisdiction to review all decrees by them made in the same manner as if the cases had, or could have, originated in those courts. That a bill of review is not an original bill or suit, but depends \u25a0 entirely on the fact that the case has already been litigated in court iby the same parties; that when a court of chancery acquires jurisdiction of a case by appeal, it has jurisdiction, by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>its appellate power, to review its own decisions; and that a law, authorizing either of these courts to do so, would be a constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">We therefore come to the conclusion that power may, constitutionally, be conferred on either the district or Supreme Court to review its own decrees or decisions, after the expiration of the term at which the decree or decision was made. In coming to this conclusion, we have overlooked neither the arguments made, nor authorities cited, against the correctness of this conclusion. In some of the cases cited the law has been held otherwise. The opinion of the court, in the case of Cox &amp; Catron <em>v. </em>Breedlove et al., 2 Yerger, 499, is quoted at great length in the argument. *It might, without fully examining the constitution and statutes of Tennessee, be very difficult to distinguish that case from the one under consideration. Indeed, the case is probably in point and against the opinion here expressed. The court in that ease, after quoting various authorities to show what a bill of review is, says: \u201cThe prayer of the bill is, that the decree which has been pronounced may be reviewed and reversed; that the complainant may have a subpena (which is an original process out of chancery) requiring the defendant to appear and answer the bill, and also for an injunction. All the parties to the original bill must be parties to the bill of review. What is all this but the exercise of original jurisdiction?\u201d We do not assent to the correctness of this reasoning; all these things may be done in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In a note to the argument of one of the counsel who supports this motion, various eases are cited to sustain the propositions contained in the argument. The case of the Washington Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Stewart, 3 How. S. C. 413, is cited to support the proposition, \u201cthat the Supreme Court of the Hnited States has no power to review its own decisions, whether in a case at law or in equity; a final decree in chancery is as conclusive as a judgment at law.\u201d The case itself did not present the point here made. It was not a bill of review. The original proceeding was a bill in equity, which had been appealed to the Supreme Court, and a decree made in that court affirming the decree of the court below. The case was then in the lower court, in pursuance of its original decree, referred to an auditor, and a final decree made. Erom this last decree a second appeal was taken, by the same party, to the Supreme Court, and' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714, 715\">*714, 715</page-number>an attempt made in that court, upon the appeal from the second decree, to induce the Supreme Court to reconsider its first decree of affirmance. Judge \"Wayne, in delivering the opinion of the court, refusing to reconsider its first decision, on the second appeal, uses the very language quoted by counsel. The language used by Judge \"Wayne is quoted from the opinion of Justice *Baldwin, in <em>ex parte </em>Sibbold, 12 Pet. 492. The case of <em>ex parte </em>Sibbold, was not a bill of review, but (in part) a motion to reform a mandate, issued by the Supreme Court to the court below. Justice Baldwin, in delivering the opinion of the court, makes use of the language above quoted, but adds: \u201c Bills of review and writs of error <em>coram </em>nobis, at' law, are <em>exceptions </em>which can not affect the present <em>motion;\u201d </em>so that, if any inference can be drawn from the expression used by Justice Baldwin, it would be, that a-bill of review might be entertained by the Supreme Court. However that may be, neither of these two cases is authority against the right of a supreme appellate court to entertain jurisdiction of a bill of review. Another case is that of Stafford <em>v. </em>Bryan, 2 Paige, 45. It is claimed that this last case sustains the doctrine, \u201cthat a bill of review will not be allowed for newly-discovered facts, to review a decree affirmed in the court of errors, unless the right is expressly reserved in the final decree of the appellate court.\u201d The case is a short one, with a long syllabus. Stafford filed a bill against Bryan, in the court of chancery, for the purpose of recovering the amount of a lost note. The bill was dismissed, and an appeal taken from the decree of dismissal to the court for the correction of errors. Pending the appeal, Stafford examined Bryan as a witness in another case, and after such examination, applied to the court of errors to stay the hearing in that court, until he could apply to the court below for leave to file a supplemental bill, in the nature of a bill of review, for the purpose of showing that, upon such examination, the defendant admitted that he had not paid the note. That motion having been refused, and the remititur, containing the affirmance of the decree of dismissal, being brought into the court below, Stafford presented a petition, in the lower court, for leave to file a supplemental bill, in the nature of a bill of review. The chancellor, refusing leave to file the petition, among other things, said: \u201c If this court can review, on new evidence, a decree affirmed in the court of <em>dernier ressort, </em>it can also review a decree which has *been reversed there. But I doubt the authority of the chancellor to do it in either case, unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the court has expressly reserved to him that right. . If the facts in this ease had been sufficient to authorize such a proceeding, a provision to that effect might have been inserted in the decree of affirmance. But if that decree was not in the way of this application, I think the facts in this case are not sufficient to authorize the filing of a bill of reviewand the chancellor dismissed the petition with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">It is not easy to see what direct bearing this case can have upon the question before this court. If the chancellor was right in supposing that the court for the correction of errors had power, and did decide the question, that a sufficient case was not made to authorize the filing of a bill of review, then he was undoubtedly right in not reversing the decision of the higher court; but if he means to say that, where a case is taken to the court for the correction of errors, for the purpose of reversing a decree of the chancellor, for errors apparent, and the decree is affirmed, and the cause remanded to the court below, and afterwards application is made to the court below for leave to file a bill of review, for newly-discovered evidence, discovered after the decree of the court above, the application must of necessity be refused; the accuracy of such an opinion may well be doubted, on the authority of the case of Barbon <em>v. </em>Stearle, 1 Vern. 416, and Story\u2019s Eq. Pl., sec. 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">But we do not propose to review the case cited; we place our opinion upon what we think is the proper construction of our constitution, connected with the nature of our own appellate system, in operation for half a century before the adoption of the constitution, 'and at the time of its adoption, and upon a ground of authority that a bill of review is not an original bill or suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Still, however, it is claimed that the legislature has not conferred this jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court, even if it shall be considered appellate jurisdiction. I have already incidently, to some extent, considered this question.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Lz\">*As before stated, the original decree sought to be reversed by this bill of review, was made at the January term, 1853, of this court. The code did not take effect until July following.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">By the 533d section of the code, it is provided that \u201cthe final orders or decrees of courts of chancery <em>heretofore </em>rendered, or which may be hereafter rendered, in any chancery proceeding ponding when this code takes effect, may be reviewed in the same manner, and within the same time, as if this code had not taken effect.\u2019 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>12th section of the schedule of the constitution, provides that the district courts, in their respective counties, shall be the successors of the present Supreme Court, and all suits pending in said Supreme Court, in the several counties of any district, shall be transferred to the respective district courts of each county, and be proceeded in as though <em>no change </em>had beep made in said <em>Supreme Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">By tbe 5th sec. of the act relating to the organization of courts of justice, passed February 19,1852, the judge of the district court or any judge of the Supreme Court, sitting therein, may, on motion of either party, reserve any important or difficult question, arising in any proceeding pending in the district court, for decision in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The Supreme Court may, by special mandate, require the district court or court of common pleas of the county in which any suit determined in the Supreme Court may have originated, to carry the judgment or decree of the Supreme Court into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">By the 1st sec. of an act regulating appeals, passed March 23, 1852\u2019 appeals may be taken, in all civil actions or suits, from tbe common pleas to the district court; and it is provided that the cause so appealed shall be again tried, heard, and decided, in the district court, in the same manner as though the district court <em>had original jurisdiction </em>of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">By what is very appropriately termed by counsel \u201c a labor-saving process,\u201d the legislature, in 1853, passed an act to *amend the act of July 19, 1852, by the 6th section of which it is provided, that \u201c all process and remedies authorized by the laws of this state, when the constitution took effect, may be had and resorted to, in the courts of the proper jurisdiction, under the present constitution;\u201d and all the laws regulating the practice of, and imposing duties on, or granting powers to the Supreme Court, or any judge thereof, and to the court of common pleas, or any judge thereof, respectively, under the former constitution, in regard to matters not hereinbefore provided for, etc., shall govern the practice, and impose like duties on the <em>district courts </em>and courts of common pleas, and the judges thereof, respectively, created by the present constitution, so far as the same are applicable to said courts, respectively, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">From the provision of the constitution above recited, in relation to pending suits, as well as from the legislature, since the adoption of the constitution, it is very clear, that it was intended that par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ties to <em>pending </em>suits should be placed in no worse situation than those who became parties to suits instituted <em>after </em>the adoption of the new constitution. By the constitution, suits transferred from the old Supreme Court to the district court were to be <em>\u201c </em>pi'oeeeded in as though <em>no change </em>had taken placean the <em>Supreme Court.\u201d </em>The very least that can be said of this provision is, that the right of action, as well as the remedy of a trial in the district court, without the necessity of commencing a new suit, should be saved to parties to pending suits. \u201c The case should proceed, or go forward, precisety as though no change had taken place in the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">If the forms of action had not been abolished, and a suit in chancery had been commenced after the adoption of the constitution, and appealed to the district court, the case pending at the time of the adoption of the constitution, and transferred to the district court, and the suit commenced after the adoption of the constitution, and appealed to the district court, would both at least stand, in the district court, on the same ground, and the parties *in each suit would have the same rights and remedies in that court. This, we think, is the very least effect which can be claimed for this provision of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">So, also, the very least effect which can be claimed from the 533d section of the code is, that if a decree had been rendered in any ease, before the adoption of the code, that the decree might be reviewed in the same manner, and within the same time, as if the forms of action had not been abolished by the code, and no new mode of revising or reviewing judgments or decrees had been provided by the code; in a word, that if the right to a bill of review existed before the adoption of the code, that right was not taken away by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The least effect which could be claimed for the \u201c labor-saving \u201d section, and the act to which it is an amendment, would be, that the remedy by bill of review might be used in the <em>district court </em>and court of common pleas, unless taken away by the constitution, or by some statutory provision; and if not taken away by either of these, then this section kept in force the chancery practice in relation to bills of review, precisely as if \u201c no change had taken place ir the old Supreme Court,\u201d and the district court had been its successor, possessing the same jurisdiction and powers of the old Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">We have already said that, in our opinion, the constitution did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>not prohibit the legislature from conferring on the district or Supreme Court the power to review its own decisions. These sections of the statute, by any fair construction, conferred on the <em>district court </em>the power to entertain a bill of review, or any other remedy, not taken away by the constitution or statute; and so far from being <em>taken away </em>in this case by statute, it is saved, in a pending suit, by the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">But we go still further on this subject, and, without the aid of the \u201clabor-saving section,\u201d hold that the authority of law to appeal a case from the common pleas to the district court, when such appeal vacates the decree below (even if a lien is preserved), *and where the case is retried in the district court, precisely as if it bad not beep heard in the coui\u2019t below&gt; and where the district court is authorized to enter a final decree in that court upon the merits, such law necessarily confers on the district court the power to entertain a bill of review to its own decisions, such bill, in our opinion, not being an original suit, or bill, but a proceeding known and practiced for ages in courts of chancery, for the correction of its own errors. And not only for the correction of its own errors, but also for the purpose of opening a decree, to permit a party to introduce newly-discovered evidence, which he by no possibility could have introduced, on the hearing of the cause, before the final decree; evidence which would show the real truth in the case, change the decree, and do justice and equity between the parties. To say, because a case had been appealed to the district court, to be there (in the language of our statute of appeals) \u201ctried, heard, and decided, in the same manner as though said district court had original jurisdiction of the. cause,\u201d and that neither the district, court, nor any other court, could entertain jurisdiction to review the decree of the district court for errors of law or newly-discovered evidence, would be to say that we had a judicial system in which plain justice could not be obtained by the citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The district court has the same power over the parties and cause; by virtue of the appeal, as though it had had original jurisdiction of the cause. If such language does not confer on the district court as much power in the case as the court of common pleas had, it is difficult to conceive what language would confer such power. We are therefore clearly of opinion that the legislature has conferred power on the district court to review its own decisions, by bill of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720, 721\">*720, 721</page-number>Having therefore arrived at the conclusion, 1. That both the Supreme and district courts are, by the constitution, made capable of receiving jurisdiction to entertain a bill of review; and, 2. That such jurisdiction has been conferred on the district court *by the operation of the appeal of the cause, without any other legislation for that purpose, it remains to be considered whether the same jurisdiction has not also been conferred on the Supreme Court; and this is the only question of doubt in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">When two cases are in the district court, one taken there by an appeal from the court of common pleas, and the other by being transferred from the old Supreme Court, they both occupy the same grounds. The court has at least as much power over the one as the other case, and the parties in each case have at least, equal rights and remedies in the district court. If the district court makes a final decree on the merits, that decree may be reviewed, either for error in law, or for newly-discovered evidence. Suppose, however, that the district coui\u2019t makes no decree whatever, but is divided in opinion, or the judge of the Supreme Court, upon motion of one of the parties, reserves the case to the Supreme Court, to be there decided, and a final decree is made in the Supreme Court, can such decree be reviewed ? is the question. The case is now in a court of the last resort, and it has made an erroneous decision, or new evidence has been discovered since the reservation, and since the decree ; the decree must be reversed by this court of <em>dernier ressort, </em>or it can not be reversed at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">It is one thing for the supreme judicial tribunal of a state or nation to say, we will not review our decisions; but it is quite a different thing to say, wo have no power to do so. When such court hasno other power than a revising power, perhaps it might well say, we can not review our decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">If this case, instead of being a bill of review to review a decree upon a bill of review revising the decree below, had been a bill of review to review a final decree, or an original bill, how would the case then have stood ? In such case, there would have been no decree in the common pleas, for that would have been vacated and annulled by the appeal to the district court; there would have been no decree in the district court, for the *cause was, without docree, reserved to the Supremo Court; and the only decree in existence, in any court, would be the decree in the Supremo Court, and, therefore, the only decree which could be reviewed. And so is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>case before us. The appeal from the common pleas vacated the decree in that court; no decree could have been made in the district court, otherwise the cause could not have been reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Upon what principles then did the original bill of review, upon which the decree was made in this court, get here ? When the case was in the district court, that court had power to hear and determine the case, as though it had had original jurisdiction of the case. But the cause is reserved for decision by this court. Had the Supreme Court any loss jurisdiction over the cause and the parties, upon the question reserved and decided, than the district court had? We think it had-not; that the district court reserved the cause, as by law it had a right to do, and in that reservation, the same power over the question reserved, and parties, was conferred on the Supreme Court which the court had from which the case was reserved, viz., to hear and decide, as though the question had originated in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">* But again. By the act before mentioned, of March 14, 1853, it is provided that \u201call process and remedies authorized by the laws of this state when the present constitution took effect, not hereinbefore. provided for, may be had and resorted to, in the courts of proper jurisdiction, under the present constitution.\u201d The meaning of this is, that the present courts, respectively, shall (so far as the constitution and laws since passed will permit) exercise the same jurisdiction that was exercised by their respective predecessors, when the constitution took effect. Now, when the constitution took effect, a bill of review was a \u201cremedy\u201d authorized bylaw; and the \u201ccourt of proper jurisdiction\u201d to entertain it, was the court in which the decree complained of had been rendered. This \u201c remedy \u201d is saved by the act, and the \u201c court of the proper jurisdiction \u201d is authorized to afford it; *tbat is, whichever of our courts has power to render the original decree, has power given to it by this act to afford the remedy, namely, a correction of error upon a bill of review. This court undeniably possessed the power to render the decree in question, and the above act gives it the power to correct its errors, if it committed any.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The motion 'to dismiss is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
