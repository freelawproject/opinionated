D. Harris <em>v. </em>Joseph G. Gest.</parties>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">Reserved from the district court of Franklin county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">This was a motion to dismiss the appeal in the district court, upon the ground that the appeal bond was not filed <em>\u201c </em>in thirty days from the rising of the court\u201d of common pleas. The question is entirely as to what constituted the June Term, 1854, of the court of common pleas of Franklin county, Ohio. The facts are as follows : At the June Term of the court of common pleas, to wit, on 9th day of June, a. d. 1854, the plaintiff obtained a verdict against defendant for three hundred dollars, and thereupon judgment was enter'ed upon the verdict and for costs. The defendant at that time gave notice of his intention to appeal. No other order was made in the case at that term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">On the 26th day of June, at same term, the following order was entered upon-the journal: \u201cOrdered that an additional and adjourned term of this court be held, commencing on the 5th day of July next, such additional and adjourned term being necessary for the purpose of completing the business now on the docket and unfinished for the want of time.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">On the 26th day of June the following entry was made at the close'of the day: \u201c And thereupon the court adjourned until nine o\u2019clock on the 5th day of July next.\u201d And on the 5th'day of *July, the following entry commences the day\u2019s proceedings: \u201cWednesday morning, July 5, A. d. 1854, court met pursuant to adjournment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-9\">During the interval between June 26 and July 5, the court of common pleas was held in Madison county by the same judge that presided in the Franklin common pleas. The regular summer term thereof commenced on the 27th day of June, and ended by a <em>sine die </em>adjournment before the 1st day of July. Madison and Franklin are in the same subdivision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-10\">On the 7th day of July, the following order was made on the journal of the court of commou pleas of Franklin county, Ohio : \u201c Ordered by the court that all causes on the docket in which decrees, orders or judgments have not been entered, and all motions, applications and petitions on file, and all other matters and things undisposed of, be continued until the next term.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>On the 10th day of July, the final entry on the journal as follows : \u201c And the court adjourned <em>sine die.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">The defendant executed his undertaking for his appeal with good \u25a0 and sufficient sureties, which was approved and filed on the 2d \u25a0day of August, <em>A. </em>d. 1854, within thirty days of the last adjournment, but more than thirty days after the first adjournment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">The law provides, 52 Ohio Laws 10, sec. 5: \u201c That whenever the \u2022state of business in any of the courts of common pleas [in the 5th \u25a0district] is such as to render it necessary, such court shall have power to appoint and hold an <em>additional </em>term for the purpose of \u25a0completing the business of any regular term upon notice thereof being entered upon the journals.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-7\"><em>Swayne &amp; </em>Baber, and <em>Galloway &amp; </em>Matthews, in support of the motion to quash the appeal.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">I. If the \u201cadditional and adjourned term \u201d was a part and continuation of the term at which the judgment was entered, then the \u25a0appeal bond was filed in time, otherwise not. Constitution, art. 4, sec. 3 ; 52 Ohio L. 10, sec. 5; Swan\u2019s new Stat. 107, sec. 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">II. *If it was a mere continuation of the regular term, then, in contemplation of law, the common pleas courts were in session in two counties of the same subdivision \u2014 Madison and Franklin \u2014 at the same time; which is not constitutional. Cons., art. 4, sec. 3. It follows, that the regular term in Franklin ended when the'law required the term in Madison to begin. Gregg <em>v. </em>Cook, Peck, 82; Garner <em>v. </em>Carral, 7 Geyer, 365.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">III. The language of the act is, \u201can <em>additional </em>term for the purpose of completing the business of any regular term.\u201d Nothing is said of an <em>adjourned </em>term. The use of the word \u201c adjourned \u201d in the order of the court, was from carelessness, or accident. The word \u25a0is mere unmeaning surplusage. Now the order shows that the court was acting <em>under the statute, </em>for it limits the business to be done in July, as the statute limits the business of an additional term. Hence, as the statute contemplates a distinct term, the court must \u25a0be held to have done so. The court has no power to so limit the business of any part of a <em>regular </em>term, whether held before or after an adjournment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-11\"><em>Henry C. Noble, </em>against the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-12\">I. We admit that \u201can additional term\u201d is different from an ad-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>journod term; that an adjourned term is the continuance by adjournment pf the same term. 5 Mass. 535. An additional term is an independent, separate term. If, therefore, the court find this \u201c an additional term,\u201d the motion should be sustained; if <em>\u201c an adjourned term,\u201d </em>or an adjournment of the June term, then should the motion be overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">II. We maintain that every court has the right to control its own sessions, unless expressly prohibited by law;-and that in pursuance of that right they may adjourn not only from day to day, but from one day to a distant day specified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">In The Mechanics\u2019 Bank of Alexandria <em>v. </em>Withers, 6 Wheat. 106, C. J. Marshall says :</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The sole question in this case is whether the adjournment *from the 16th of May until the fourth Monday in June was a continuation of the April term, or constituted a distinct term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">\u201c There being nothing in any act of Congress which prevents the courts of the district <em>from exercising a power common to all courts, that of adjourning to a distant day, </em>the adjournment on the 16th day of May to tho fourth Monday in June would be a continuance of the same term, unless a special act of Congress expressly enabling the courts of the district to hold adjourned sessions, may be supposed to vary the law of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">In that case the court decided that a law enabling the court to hold \u201c <em>an adjourned session </em>\u201d was simply an affirmance of the common-law power above mentioned, as an adjourned session meant \u201cthe same session with that at which the adjournment was made,\u201d and therefore did not affect the question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-10\">III. That the order of June 26 was out of abundant caution, and not to appoint an additional term under the statute. That this is evident by the using of the words \u201cand an adjourned term\" to qualify the words additional term; and we infer this from the journal entry at the end of the 26th June and beginning of the 5th of July sittings; as, also, from the fact that the general order of continuance was not made until July 7.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-11\">IV. We think that the order entered on June 26 does not affect the general power of the court to adjourn its sessions for any length of time, by an adjournment to a fixed day, which it did, as appears by the journal entries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-12\">V. The constitution, section S, article 4, authorizes two sittings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>at once in the district, and therefore in the same subdivision, if two-sittings were held at once in Madison and Franklin counties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-4\">Thurman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"As-\">The judges of the courts of common pleas are judges of their respective districts, and not of the mere subdivisions thereof. The subdivision of the districts is for election purposes merely. Const., art. 4, sec. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">There is nothing in the constitution that forbids the holding of ^common pleas courts in different counties of a subdivision, at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Courts are not limited, in their power of adjournment, to an adjournment from one day to the succeeding day. They have an inherent power to adjourn to a more distant day, when not restrained by the constitution or statute law; and there is no such restraint upon the common pleas courts in Ohio. 6 Wheat. 106. When this-power is exercised, the sitting after the adjournment is a prolongation of the regular term, and, in contemplation of law, there is but one term. 6 Wheaton, <em>supra. </em>But the \u201cadditional term,\u201d provided for by section 5 of the act of January 31, 1854 (52 Ohio L. 10), is a distinct term, and not a prolongation of a regular term.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">When the journal entries leave it doubtful whether it was intended to appoint an \u201cadditional term,\u201d under said section, or-merely to adjourn the regular term to a distant day, the former' construction ought to be preferred, since adjournments to a distant day are, in general, highly impolitic, and ought not, except for very weighty and special reasons, to take place. In this case, the limitation upon the business to be transacted at the July sitting, contained in the order appointing that sitting, shows that a distinct term, under the statute, was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">An appeal bond executed more than thirty days after the regular term at which judgment was rendered, but within thirty days after an \u201c additional term,\u201d held under said statute, is not within the time-required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\n<em>Appeal quashed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
