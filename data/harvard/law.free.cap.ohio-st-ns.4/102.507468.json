And this he is ready to verify; wherefore he prays judgment and his damages aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-11\">There was judgment for the plaintiff below upon the demurrer, and upon the assessment of damages, a bill of exceptions was taken to the rulings of the court, of which a copy is now here given:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-12\">\u201cBe it remembered that upon the inquiry of damages which was made by the court, neither party requiring a jury, the plaintiff proved the value of the building removed by the defendant to be the sum of \u00a7229.32. The defendant then offered to prove that the said building, for the removal of which this suit was brought, was sold upon an execution as set forth in the defendant\u2019s plea, and also \u2022offered to prove the other facts set *forth in said plea as to said Bailey\u2019s account, and his lien on said building for the same, and .also offered to prove that the money arising from such sale was applied first to the payment of said Bailey\u2019s judgment, and the resi\u25a0due to the payment of accounts of other mechanics who had performed labor on said building, and who had taken the steps required by the statute, to assert and continue such liens, and claimed that the judgment for the plaintiff should be for nominal damages only. This evidence the court refused to receive, and decided that the true rule of the plaintiff\u2019s damages was the value of the building, to which decisions of the court the defendant, by his counsel, excepts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>and prays the court to sign and seal this, his bill of exceptions, and that the same be made a part of the record, which is accordingly done.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-5\"><em>Goddard &amp; </em>Eastman, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-6\"><em>Jewett &amp; O\u2019Neal, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b94-7\"><em>Goddard &amp; Eastman, </em>for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-8\">I. The builders had a lien upon the property in question, and no interest in the house was acquired by the owner of the lot, whether owner of the term'for years or owner of the reversion, until they were paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">II. The Hope Hose Company were, in the sense of the statute, the <em>owners </em>of the lot. The statute does not say owners in fee, nor owners of a term of ninety-nine years, but simply owners. Choteau <em>v. </em>Thompson &amp; Campbell, 2 Ohio St. 114. This sale, it is true, was not a sale of the leasehold interest of the company. It was a sale of a building which stood on it. The hose company do not complain that a part of their interest has been sold, and not the whole, nor can the reversioner,</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-10\">III. But the first section of the lien law gives a lien upon the building, independent of the lot upon which it stands. A true paraphrase would run thus : 11 Any person who shall perform labor on any building, by virtue of a contract with the *owner of the building, shall have a lien upon the building, and also upon the lot on which the building stands, to the extent of the interest which the owner has in the lot.\u201d Suppose the mechanics had agreed with these lessees to build for them, the builders to retain a lien on the building for their unpaid bills, to be enforced by sale and removal of the building during the term of the lease, could the lessee have prevented the enforcement of such a lien ? The statute (enacted before this lease was made) takes the place of such a contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-11\">IY. The tenth section of the act has no application. There was no equitable title requiring that section to be observed. The title of the hose company, under the lease in question \u2014 good under our statutes for three years \u2014 was the legal title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-12\">Y. The case of Thornton <em>v. </em>Williams, 14 Pick. 49, has no application. In that case, Smith had an equity only, and no right of possession, though probably he had actual possession. Ho was not the <em>proprietor </em>of the land, and none but such proprietor could, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the Massachusetts law, subject the building to lien. Our statute-gives the lien upon the building <em>and </em>the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">YI. Wilson had no <em>lien </em>on the improvements which should be-made on the lot. The lessees were bound to deliver up the improvements when the lease should expire. ,. This gave him no lien; but, if it did, such lien could not attach till the improvements were discharged from the mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">YII. But, in any view, what damages ought Wilson to have, if he recover at all? This suit is brought a very few months after-the commencement of the lease. <em>Non </em>constat, but that at the expiration of the lease the lessees would have a substantial frame house, and deliver it up to the lessor. At most, he could only recover for the technical injury to the land, and in such case the-damages would be nominal only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-7\"><em>Jewett &amp; </em>O'Neal, for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-8\">I. The condition of this property was not such as to authorize-^the mechanics\u2019 lien. The lien given by the first section of the law is upon the building, <em>\u201c and upon the lot of land upon which-the same shall stand,; \u201d </em>but to enable the mechanic to take advantage of this provision of the law, -the labor performed and the materials furnished must be \u201c <em>by virtue of a contract or agreement with the owner thereof.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-9\">By the terms of the lease the house removed was to be replaced by another one, and all other improvements put upon the lot were to remain there for the benefit of Wilson. They became his property in law and in fact. He became the owner, and he would have been entitled to his remedy against the lessees, if they, during the existence of their lease, had attempted to remove that or any other building erected on the lot. Having- removed the building that was upon it at the time they took possession, their power to remove was exhausted. All other buildings erected, thereafter, attached to the freehold, and by operation of law, as well as by the provisions of the lease, vested in Wilson the lessor and the owner-of the lot.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-10\">II. Whether or not a mechanic can assert a lien upon a building, not a fixture, is a question which does not necessarily arise in this case. It is not claimed that the building in controversy in this case was not a fixture; nor is it denied that the ownership of the lot was in Wilson. But if we understand the claim of the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>plaintiff in error, it is, that the first section of the law under discussion, is susceptible of a division ; that the lien may attach to the <em>building, the fixture, the appurtenance to the land, </em>without <em>attaching to the land itself; </em>and that if the owner of the building is a \u25a0different person from the owner of the land, then the building may bo sold and removed' from the land. No foundation for any such \u25a0 claim can be found in the statute. The very provision which authorizes this lien, and the only provision, is in the first section of \u25a0the act; and by its terms whenever the lien attaches to the building, it must attach to the land upon which the building is erected. Mil. The section referred to is the only section of the law \u25a0that gives to the mechanic a lien for the labor and materials furnished. The law does not embrace all mechanics, nor extend to .all kinds of labor. The engine and car builders can not secure liens for the labor and materials by them furnished, in carrying \u25a0on their business; and the same remark is equally true in regard to almost every other class of mechanics, except those whose business is indicated by the law in the character of the structures named in the first section of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">There was reason for authorizing a lien upon a water-craft, \u25a0which on the day of its completion might be floated beyond the jurisdiction of our courts and into another state. But the legislature saw no necessity for embarrassing the ordinary business of the country, with these special liens, upon structures of a movable character, and in which our mechanical interests are more deeply involved, perhaps, than in any other species of property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">A tenement, not a fixture, is no more permanent than a carriage. It may change owners daily. It may be moved from place to place \u25a0to suit the convenience of its last owner. If it be subject to this lien, then two years, for instance, after its construction, the owner of it at that time, the man who has paid for it and purchased it without notice, because he has no means of obtaining any, for it has no name and no locality, may be called on to pay the mechanic the full amount of what it originally cost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">IY. The Massachusetts statute in relation to mechanics\u2019 liens is similar to our own, and in support of our views we refer to the \u2022case of Thaxter <em>v. </em>Williams et al., 14 Pick. 49.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-8\">Y. Upon the general question of our right to recover and the \u2022rule of damages; we refer to 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 855; 11 Mass. 518; 8 Pick. 235 ; 19 Ib. 156 ; 16 Ib. 464.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Thurman, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATF\">By the terms of the lease all the improvements-that the -lessee should put on the premises, were to be delivered up-with the lot to the lessor, at the expiration of the Please. The building in question was erected by the lessee, and was a fixture. The interests of the parties then were, a leasehold estate in the hose company, and a reversion in fee in Wilson, the lessor. The lien of the mechanic who erected the building for the company, was upon the leasehold estate, and no more. This point was-decided in Choteau <em>v. </em>Thompson, 2 Ohio St. 123, where it is said: \u201c The word \u2018 owner,\u2019 in the first section of the act, is not limited in its meaning to an owner of the fee, but includes also an owner of a leasehold estate. If the ownership is in fee, the lien is upon the fee, if it is of a less estate, the lien is upon such smaller estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">It follows that Dutro acquired by his purchase no greater estate than that of which the hose company was seized, and as they had no right to remove the building, he acquired no such right. The-demurrer was therefore properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">For the same reason the testimony offered by Dutro, on the inquiry of damages, was properly ruled out, and the rule of damages-claimed by him properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The language of the bill of exceptions is not very clear in respect to the rule of damages adopted by the court, but we infer that by the expression, \" the value of the building,\u201d is meant its value to the lessor; that is, the value of his reversionary interest in it. In other words, a not very happy phraseology is employed to express \u25a0 the true rule of damages, which was the amount of injury done to the reversionary estate in the lot by the removal of the building. We are strengthened in this inference by the fact that the only exception taken to the assessment is, that no deduction was made of' the amounts for which the mechanics had held liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
