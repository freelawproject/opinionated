While this action was pending, on January 8, 2019, Jared Polis became the governor of Colorado.

The issue currently before us is whether certain school districts, a special district board, and/or a county commission have standing to challenge Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (\"TABOR\"). Colo. Const. art. X, \u00a7 20. TABOR allows the people of Colorado to raise or prevent tax increases by popular vote, thereby limiting the power of Colorado's legislative bodies to levy taxes. On a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), the district court held that plaintiffs had Article III standing but that they lacked political subdivision standing and prudential standing. Accordingly, the court dismissed the complaint. Plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case is rife with difficult issues, and we applaud the district court for its attempts to \"don waders\" and generate some cognizable structure out of the sludge. Nevertheless, we conclude that it could not properly reach its conclusions at this stage of litigation. Because we hold that the political subdivision plaintiffs are not barred by standing requirements, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that TABOR denies them a \"republican form of government\" as guaranteed by Congress in the Colorado Enabling Act, ch. 139,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Stat.%20474\">\n    18 Stat. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1875) (\"Enabling Act\"), because it takes power from the legislature and puts it into the hands of the people of Colorado in violation of the Guarantee Clause,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art.

We instructed the district court to determine whether any other plaintiffs had standing. Back at the district court, plaintiffs amended their complaint to add certain additional entities: eight school boards, the Board of County Commissioners of Boulder County, and a special district board. As noted, the district court thereafter dismissed the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   TABOR prevents the state legislature and local entities from enacting new taxes or raising taxes except by popular vote. Particularly significant to plaintiffs in this case, TABOR\n   <em>\n    prohibits\n   </em>\n   state and local governments from appropriating revenue in excess of the prior year's spending, and it\n   <em>\n    requires\n   </em>\n   the state and local governments to refund taxpayers for revenues appropriated in excess of the prior year's spending. Colo. Const. art. X, \u00a7 20 (7)(a) &amp; (d). TABOR also causes plaintiffs to incur costs from presenting matters to voters. Plaintiffs allege that these requirements inhibit them from performing their mandated responsibilities under Colorado law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Colo. Const. art. XIV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a condition of admitting Colorado to the Union, Congress required that the state's constitution \"shall be republican in form.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Stat.%20474\">\n    18 Stat. 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This language mimics the language from the Guarantee Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 4. Under the Supremacy Clause, federal law controls when federal and state law are in conflict with one another. U.S. Const. art. VI, \u00a7 2. Plaintiffs contend that TABOR denies them the republican form of government required of the state of Colorado by the Enabling Act and is thus unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We review the district court's \"dismissal for lack of standing de novo, applying the same standard used by the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Petrella v.

Thus, if at least one plaintiff can demonstrate standing, we need not consider standing for the other plaintiffs. The district court determined that the political subdivision plaintiffs established Article III standing and defendants do not contest this conclusion on appeal. Even so, the district court dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it concluded that two independent doctrines barred these plaintiffs: political subdivision standing and prudential standing. The issue before us is whether these other limitations indeed preclude the political subdivision plaintiffs from establishing standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin by determining whether there are \"prudential standing\" limitations preventing plaintiffs from challenging TABOR.

Because the political-subdivision standing bar is an independent jurisdictional bar, I would affirm the district court's ruling solely on this basis.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sinochem Int'l Co. v.

First, although the majority evinces some uncertainty as to whether political-subdivision standing is properly considered a type of \"prudential standing\"-notably, intimating that\n   <em>\n    Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/572/118/\">\n    572 U.S. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706985,12579076\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1377/\">\n    188 L.Ed.2d 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), may have put in doubt on whether this form of standing is a jurisdictional bar,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 1194-95 n.4, 1195-96 n.6-the majority ultimately follows our prior cases that treat political-subdivision standing as a jurisdictional matter, and it thus analyzes political-subdivision standing entirely separately from prudential standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831693\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1251/#p1256\">\n    656 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1255 n.4 (observing that\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   \"casts the matter [of political-subdivision standing] as one of jurisdictional standing\"). Second, although the majority voices concerns about the contours and workability of applying the \"directed at protecting\" component of\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   , it expressly declines to \"resolve\" these concerns (albeit while citing them as \"supplementary support\" for its result). Maj. Op. at 1195 n.6. Third, it declines to determine the \"precise reach\" of\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   or choose definitively between the differing readings offered by the Plaintiffs and the district court because, in its view, \"under either proffered formulation the district court erred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Instead, the crux of the majority's analysis is that \"[e]stablishing\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   was intended to benefit from the Enabling Act's 'republican in form' requirement necessarily begs the question of\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   a 'Republican Form of Government' is, which is the issue ultimately to be resolved if any court ever succeeds in reaching the merits of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1196. In other words, in the majority's view, grappling with the \"directed at protecting\" component of\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   would require \"impermissibly delving into the merits of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1196.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   I part ways with the majority here. Our cases\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   generally emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the standing inquiry and merits issues, with the latter including the elements of a claim and whether that claim has been successfully\n   stated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1198-99;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Day v.

However, the cases the majority relies on do not involve the political-subdivision standing doctrine or the embedded \"directed at protecting\" requirement. In that context, as I have set forth\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   is our primary guidepost. That case reiterates that political-subdivision standing is jurisdictional,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831693\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1251/#p1256\">\n    656 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1255 n.4, and requires a political-subdivision plaintiff to show-as part of a\n   <em>\n    threshold jurisdictional standing\n   </em>\n   inquiry-that it seeks enforcement of a federal statute directed at protecting or specifically providing rights to political subdivisions like it,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831693\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1251/#p1256\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831693\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/1251/#p1256\">\n    at 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in analyzing standing in this specific context,\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   requires a federal court to analyze the nature of the claim or rights at issue, at least as far as is necessary to determine who may seek to enforce them. Irrespective of whether this may sometimes resemble a merits analysis, it is precisely what\n   <em>\n    City of Hugo\n   </em>\n   contemplates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   I note further that falling back on\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   is of no avail to the majority's position: although a \"directed at protecting\" requirement is not clearly stated in that case,\n   <em>\n    Branson\n   </em>\n   still considered and ultimately found \"[m]ost important[ ]\" to its analysis the fact that the plaintiffs were \" 'essentially' the beneficiaries of the federal trust at issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1366475\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/161/619/\">\n    161 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, our precedent certainly permits, and in my view requires, a court to determine a federal statute's beneficiaries as part of its standing analysis and contemplates that a court may make such a determination without impermissibly implicating the merits. I respectfully submit that the majority, in concluding otherwise, fails to correctly apply this precedent. Nor does the majority attempt to persuasively distinguish this precedent, much less demonstrate that it has been superseded by subsequent Supreme Court authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Much of the majority's disquiet seems to be based on a perceived lack of \"workable standards\" and its view that \"disentangling\" the meaning of \"republican form of government\" will be an \"immense task\" not amenable to resolution in the context of a Rule 12(b)(1) motion.

I see no reason why-if required-a similarly searching analysis might not be undertaken in this context, and similarly fine distinctions might not ultimately be drawn between standing and merits issues, in evaluating\n   <em>\n    whom\n   </em>\n   the Enabling Act's requirement of a republican form of government was directed at protecting or specifically providing rights to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   To be sure, there may be conceivable arguments for reevaluating or cabining our political-subdivision standing doctrine. But the majority does not meaningfully grapple with those arguments here, let alone expressly adopt them. Instead, the majority purports to\n   <em>\n    accept\n   </em>\n   the jurisdictional, decisional rubric laid out in our political-subdivision standing cases but then effectively departs entirely from the requirements of that rubric in resolving this case. I cannot travel this path.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Although the Fourth Amended Complaint alleges that TABOR also runs afoul of other laws, e.g., the federal Constitution's analogous Guarantee Clause and Colorado's state constitution, Aplts.' App., Vol. XII, at 1447-49, the Plaintiffs' political-subdivision standing arguments are premised on the Enabling Act and Supremacy Clause, Aplts.'
