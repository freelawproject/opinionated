Each alleges that he was subject to \"dumping,\" the practice of sending a resident to a hospital for medical or mental health treatment but refusing to readmit the resident after discharge from the hospital. The Residents maintain that because Medi-Cal provides less compensation than Medicare or private insurance, nursing homes have a strong financial incentive to engage in dumping if Medi-Cal is paying for the resident's stay. \"Dumping,\" the Residents allege, is \"one of the biggest problems\" nursing home residents in California face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Using the appeals process established by the State, all three Residents challenged their respective nursing homes' refusal to readmit them after their hospitalization, and all three prevailed. None, however, has been readmitted. Each Resident's respective nursing home continues to refuse readmission, and, Plaintiffs allege, both DHCS and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) have taken the position that the agencies are not obligated to enforce decisions resulting from the appeals process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In October 2015, the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform (CANHR), a nonprofit advocacy group, sent a letter to DHCS requesting that the agency enforce its decision in resident Bruce Anderson's appeal. In response, DHCS reiterated that it \"ha[d] no authority to enforce its own orders,\" but noted that it was \"looking at the issue.\" About a month later, CANHR met with Diana Dooley, then Secretary for the California Department of Health and Human Services, and \"requested her to make the agencies over which she ha[d] oversight follow the law.\" Although \"Secretary Dooley represented that the State was 'doing something' to fix the problem,\" nothing concrete came out of that meeting. CANHR then wrote a letter to Secretary Dooley notifying her that, \"absent immediate relief from the State,\" it would file suit. The State responded, \"listing various enforcement actions it could take,\" but none of those actions \"involved enforcing DHCS readmission hearing orders.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Unsatisfied, CANHR, joined by the three individual residents, filed an action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Secretary Dooley in her official capacity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint stated that FNHRA creates a federal right to \"a fair mechanism ... for hearing appeals on transfers and discharges of residents.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(e)(3). According to the Residents, because \"there is no agency in California that enforces DHCS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   readmission orders ..., the State has not provided residents with their right to an administrative procedure that provides for prompt readmission if they are successful.\" The Residents sought declaratory and injunctive relief. California moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the FNHRA provision was not enforceable under \u00a7 1983. The district court agreed, concluding that the residents \"have no private federal right enforceable through \u00a7 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Far from mentioning \"residents\" only \"in passing,\" as the district court stated,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, FNHRA directly focuses on them in discussing the appeals process for transfers and discharges, using \"rights-creating terms,\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzaga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    536 U.S. at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . FNHRA's notice requirements-listed under a subsection titled \"[t]ransfer and discharge\n   <em>\n    rights\n   </em>\n   ,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(c)(2) (emphasis added)-instruct that nursing homes must provide notice to residents before attempting to transfer or discharge them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(c)(2)(B).

Thus, FNHRA expressly states that the appeals process, mandated by FNHRA as a condition of federal funding, provides residents with a\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to use that process, as well as notice of that right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Moreover, the district court's underlying reason for its conclusion-that a statute cannot create rights when phrased as a directive to the state-is wrong. It has never been a requirement that a statute focus\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on individuals, to the exclusion of all others, to demonstrate congressional intent to create a statutory right. To the contrary, cooperative federalism programs like Medicaid, under which \"Congress provides funds to the states on the condition that the state spend the funds in accordance with federal priorities,\" Roderick M.

Instead, the State maintains that any such right does not include any state implementation of the decision reached on appeal. At bottom, the State's position is that the FNHRA provides only the right to the hearing decision itself. That decision, according to the State, need not have any real-world effect. The statute's text, structure, implementing regulations, and overall purpose lead us to conclude otherwise. The right to an appeal under FNHRA, we hold, includes within it provision for some state-provided process capable of providing relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   First, the text: Again, FNHRA requires states to \"provide for a fair mechanism ... for hearing appeals on transfers and discharges of residents.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(e)(3). The statute further specifies that this provision vests residents with the \"right to appeal the transfer or discharge under the State process established under subsection (e)(3) of this section.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780023\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/677/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(c)(2)(B)(iii)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   An \"appeal\" in legal parlance ordinarily refers to a process by which an earlier action-here, the transfer or discharge of a resident-can be challenged and, if the facts establish that the decision to take that action was invalid, overturned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appeal, Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2014) (\"A proceeding undertaken\n   <em>\n    to have a decision reconsidered\n   </em>\n   by a higher authority.\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    Appeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2d ed. 1989) (\"The transference of a case from an inferior\n   to a higher court or tribunal,\n   <em>\n    in the hope of reversing or modifying the decision of the former\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added)). Implicit in these definitions is the understanding that a successful appeal will have some actual effect on the challenged action, here a transfer or discharge. An appeal lacking the practical capacity to reverse or modify the prior decision is but \"an arid ritual of meaningless form.\"\n   <em>\n    Staub v. City of Baxley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n    355 U.S. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 320,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n    78 S.Ct. 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n    2 L.Ed.2d 302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958). So the statutory use of the term \"appeal\" encompasses the issuance of an enforceable order to redress an invalid original decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That conclusion is bolstered by the structure of FNHRA. FNHRA prohibits nursing homes from transferring or discharging residents except in six narrow circumstances, setting forth specific grounds for invalidating a nursing home's transfer or discharge decision on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(c)(2)(A). The statute also provides comprehensive safeguards for ensuring that each resident's right to an appeal will be protected. Before undertaking a transfer or discharge of a resident, a nursing home must \"notify the resident (and, if known, an immediate family member of the resident or legal representative) of the transfer or discharge and the reasons therefor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(c)(2)(B)(i)(I). FNHRA further requires a nursing home to \"record the reasons\" for each transfer or discharge \"in the resident's clinical record\" so that a record of the nursing home's decision is available for review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(c)(2)(B)(i)(II). Providing such extensive procedural protections for each resident's right to appeal would be entirely pointless if that right resulted in a purely advisory opinion, not including any possibility of reversing the action challenged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, FNHRA expressly equips states with tools for enforcing the nursing home standards imposed by the statute. FNHRA provides that a state may terminate a nursing home's participation in Medicaid if the state finds that the nursing home fails to comply with FNHRA's standards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(h)(1). FNHRA also requires states to \"establish by law (whether statute or regulation)\" a number of remedies against noncompliant nursing homes, including the denial of Medicaid reimbursements, civil monetary penalties, the appointment of temporary management, and the closure of nursing homes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6165621\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/313/#p320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1396r(h)(2)(A). FNHRA therefore suggests possible sanctions available to the states if a nursing home does not comply with a directive to readmit a discharged or transferred resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Our conclusion that the right to appeal includes the ability to obtain relief accords with the overall purpose of FNHRA. FNHRA was enacted to address a \"broad consensus that government regulation of nursing homes, as it now functions, is not satisfactory because it allows too many marginal or substandard nursing homes to continue in operation.\" Comm. on Nursing Home Regulation,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 2. Congress was \"deeply troubled that the Federal government, through the Medicaid program, continues to pay nursing facilities for providing poor quality care to vulnerable elderly and disabled beneficiaries.\" H.R.

As CMS's regulation indicates, enforcement of the appeal begins with an order to the nursing home to admit or readmit transferred or discharged residents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20431.246\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 431.246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, DHCS already provides such orders-the individual residents in this case received appeals decisions invaliding their nursing homes' transfer or discharge decisions and ordering readmission.

Again, our conclusion that the right to an appeal includes the opportunity for redress is an interpretation of FNHRA's text, not its implementing regulations. Given that interpretation, we understand \"if appropriate\" in \u00a7 431.246, consistently with our interpretation of the statute, to require \"admission or readmission\" if (1) the hearing decision so requires and (2) there is no practical impediment to enforcement. As to (1), a hearing decision can be favorable to a challenger but not order admission or readmission.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    St. John\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12454821\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-5th/2/638/#p647\">\n    2 Cal.

As to (2), an admission order may as a practical matter become unenforceable because, for example, the resident has passed away or no longer needs nursing home care, or the nursing home has closed. But where (1) and (2) obtain, as a statutory matter, redress is, in the language used in the regulation, \"appropriate,\" and the state must in some manner assure it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appropriate, Oxford English Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (2d ed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   1989) (\"Specially fitted or suitable, proper.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, under the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Blessing\n   </em>\n   test, we ask whether \"the statute ... unambiguously impose[s] a binding obligation on the States.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/#p340\">\n    520 U.S. at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651863\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/329/#p340\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Congress is unlikely to be aware of such remedies, which will vary from state to state and may not exist in some states. Here, the diverse remedies for improper nursing home transfers or discharges offered by California law-private suits against the nursing homes, investigations by state agencies, and enforcement actions by the California Attorney General-cannot speak to whether\n   <em>\n    Congress\n   </em>\n   intended to foreclose enforcement under \u00a7 1983 of the FNHRA right to appeal nursing home transfers and discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The federal law remedies on which California relies fare no better. The State notes that FNHRA itself requires that \"each State establish by law\" certain remedies against noncompliant nursing homes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r(h)(1), (h)(2)(A). Those remedies, California contends, should impliedly foreclose the availability of a \u00a7 1983 remedy. Not so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The remedies California posits pertain to \"enforcing facilities' compliance\" with FNHRA. But the Residents are not suing under \u00a7 1983 to enforce a right to readmission\n   <em>\n    against the nursing homes\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the Residents seek to use \u00a7 1983 to enforce\n   <em>\n    against the state\n   </em>\n   the statutory right to an appeal. Thus, these federal provisions for compelling nursing home compliance do not independently provide redress for the right the plaintiffs allege has been violated here-the FNHRA provision for a right to an appeal that includes some form of state implementation of a favorable decision. Instead, as we have explained, the availability to the states of statutory remedies to compel nursing home compliance reinforces our conclusion that the right to an appeal under FNHRA includes the opportunity for state implementation of an order issued on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   pp. 19-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721902\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/453/1/#p20\">\n    101 S.Ct. 2615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The only remedy on which California relies directed at the State's appeals process is the federal government's approval process for state Medicaid plans, and its concomitant ability to withhold federal funds.
