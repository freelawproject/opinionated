In his view, this error warrants resentencing by way of analogy to\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez v. United States\n   </em>\n   where the Supreme Court held that an incorrectly calculated United States Sentencing Guidelines range presumptively satisfies the prejudice prong of plain-error review because of its \"centrality\" to a district court's sentence. --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12595701\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1338/#p1346\">\n    136 S.

We agree that there was error but decline to extend the presumption of prejudice recognized in\n   <em>\n    Molina-Martinez\n   </em>\n   to this context because a mistaken understanding about the applicable statutory range, without more, has far less bearing on the actual sentence imposed than a Guidelines-calculation error. However, because we conclude on this record that the error did affect Payano's substantial rights and without correction would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings, we will vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Payano is a citizen of the Dominican Republic who first came to the United States legally with his parents at age twelve. In 1998, at age eighteen, he pleaded guilty to first degree possession of a controlled substance in New York state court, and in 2001, after completing his sentence of three years to life imprisonment, he was removed based on that drug possession conviction. Although Payano illegally reentered the United States in 2012, his presence was not discovered until\n   2017 when a Pennsylvania state trooper pulled over his vehicle. After an extended traffic stop, the trooper obtained consent to search the vehicle and found a kilogram of cocaine hidden in an interior panel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania indicted Payano for illegal reentry, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(II). On Payano's pretrial motion to suppress, the District Court agreed with him that the drugs found in the vehicle were fruit of an unconstitutional search because the trooper lacked reasonable suspicion to prolong the stop. The Government then dismissed the drug charge, and Payano pleaded guilty to illegal reentry. Because Payano's 1998 conviction was for drug possession and not drug distribution, it qualified under federal law as a felony, but not an aggravated felony, for purposes of the illegal reentry offense. Accordingly, Payano's plea was to a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), which applies to illegal reentry following a \"felony (other than an aggravated felony)\" and carries a maximum sentence of ten years, and not\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), which applies to illegal reentry following an \"aggravated felony\" and carries a maximum sentence of twenty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In anticipation of sentencing, the United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Report (PSR). That report correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines range as 24-30 months' imprisonment and correctly listed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment as ten years. However, instead of citing \u00a7 1326(b)(1) as the offense of conviction, it cited \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Although the PSR made no reference to illegal reentry following an aggravated felony nor made mention of \u00a7 1326(b)(2)'s twenty-year maximum, the citation error was compounded when the Government argued in its sentencing memorandum seeking an upward variance that Payano had been \"convicted of an aggravated felony prior to his deportation,\" JA 69 n.2, and when it requested at the sentencing hearing that the District Court \"correct\" the PSR to reflect that Payano had pleaded guilty to \"aggravated reentry,\" carrying a twenty-year statutory maximum sentence. JA 92-93. The District Court ordered that the PSR be amended to reflect that change-a \"correction\" to which Payano's counsel agreed. JA 92. Neither the District Court nor the parties mentioned it again during the proceedings, but at the conclusion of the hearing, the District Court granted the Government's motion for an upward variance. It then imposed a four-year sentence, 18 months above the Guidelines range, yet well below the applicable ten-year statutory maximum and,\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   , well below the twenty-year maximum that the District Court believed applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
