Plaintiff DRM is the PAIMI agency for Montana. As such, DRM is the organization tasked by Congress with \"ensur[ing] that the rights of individuals with mental illness are protected\" and \"protect[ing] and advocat[ing] for the rights of such individuals through activities to ensure the enforcement of the Constitution and Federal and State statutes\" for Montana's mentally ill individuals.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010801\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under this authority, DRM challenges the treatment of individuals with serious mental illness in the Montana State Prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DRM claims that the DOC defendants have violated the rights of \"all prisoners with serious mental illness who are confined to the Montana State Prison ... to be free from cruel and unusual punishment\" though policies and practices in place at the prison. DRM's complaint is divided into roughly three sections. The first section of the complaint contains system-wide allegations about the treatment of inmates with \"serious mental illness\" in the Montana prison. The second section contains detailed allegations about particular inmates to illustrate the treatment seriously mentally ill patients are given in Montana's prison. The third section alleges several different ways that the DOC defendants had been placed on notice of the risks posed by their treatment of prisoners with serious mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The complaint alleges that the defendants act under the color of state law in administering the prison and that they remain responsible for administering the policies and practices that are the subject of the complaint. Specifically, the complaint isolates nine prison practices and/or policies that DRM contends are constitutionally suspect:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1) placing prisoners with serious mental illness in various forms of solitary confinement for 22 to 24 hours per day for months and years at a time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2) placing prisoners with serious mental illness on behavior management plans that involve solitary confinement and extreme restrictions of privileges;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   3) having no standards for determining whether placing a prisoner with serious mental illness in solitary confinement or on a behavior management plan will be harmful to the prisoner's mental health;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   4) engaging in a pattern of refusing to properly diagnose prisoners as suffering from serious mental illness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5) engaging in a pattern of refusing to provide prisoners with medications for serious mental illness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   6) failing to have a system in place to review and evaluate the diagnosing and prescribing practices of its mental health staff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   7) failing to have a system to classify prisoners according to their mental health needs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   8) failing to adequately consider prisoners' serious mental illnesses when making decisions about prisoners' housing and custody levels; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   9) having no system in place for auditing, evaluating or ensuring the effectiveness of its mental health care program in treating prisoners with serious mental illness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The complaint goes on to allege specific facts supporting the existence of these policies and their effect on prisoners with serious mental illness. For instance, the\n   complaint alleges that the mental health treatment community has established that \"subjecting prisoners to extended periods of solitary confinement is detrimental to their mental health,\" citing statements from national correctional health organizations on the inappropriateness of using such punishments on the seriously mentally ill. The complaint then describes in detail the solitary confinement procedures used at the prison, alleging that \"[t]he Prison regularly places prisoners with serious mental illness in all of the forms of solitary confinement described above for weeks and months at a time.\" The complaint alleges that prison staff identify individuals with serious mental illness as \"good candidates\" for solitary confinement, placing them in solitary confinement for weeks and months at a time. The complaint further alleges that the DOC defendants subject prisoners to being locked alone in their cells for 22 to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that while in solitary confinement, a prisoner's \"primary contact with mental health staff ... lasts no more than a few minutes and is conducted at the prisoner's cell door,\" with no privacy from other prisoners or staff. Throughout the first section, the complaint supports its objection to each of the policies and practices listed with specific factual descriptions of how prisoners are typically treated and the accessibility and quality of mental health care at the prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The second section of the complaint provides allegations, consistent with the system-wide allegations, concerning nine individual prisoners. In substance, the allegations are horrifying, involving prisoners with very severe symptoms of mental illness who went largely untreated and who were subjected to extreme and lengthy solitary confinement punishments. The policies and practices DRM alleged to be in place at the prison are evident in these examples. The facts alleged in these illustrative examples include numerous instances of prison mental health staff deciding to limit prisoners' access to prescribed mental health medication, including staff denying mentally-ill inmates their medications entirely. In graphic detail, DRM's complaint describes how these policies and practices allegedly harm the mental health of prisoners, harm that allegedly culminated in the suicides of three of the described prisoners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The third section of DRM's complaint specifically alleges the DOC defendants' involvement in the complained of policies and practices. DRM alleges that defendants are aware of the fact that solitary confinement harms prisoners with serious mental illness, are aware of prison mental health standards that contradict their practices, have no standards for guiding mental health staff in the punishment of prisoners misbehaving because of mental illness, have been made aware of the plight of seriously mentally ill prisoners through repeated administrative and grievance proceedings, have been sued twice in Montana for their treatment of mentally ill prisoners, and have been repeatedly informed of the deficiencies of their treatment of prisoners with serious mental illness by DRM itself. Based on this description of the DOC defendants' knowledge of the objectionable policies, DRM finally alleges that \"[g]iven their knowledge of these practices, and their knowledge of the serious harm that can be caused by these practices,\n   and their refusal to change these practices, the DOC Defendants have been deliberately indifferent to the serious medical needs of prisoners with serious mental illness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DRM initially included these Eighth Amendment claims against the DOC defendants in a broader suit that also alleged due process claims against the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (\"DPHHS\"). The due process claims concerned how people convicted as \"Guilty But Mentally Ill\" were transferred between the Montana State Hospital and the Montana State Prison. At a status conference, the district court orally ordered DRM to replead its claims in separate complaints, confusingly theorizing that there should be three separate cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   DRM then filed two separate complaints-separating the Eighth Amendment claims against the DOC defendants from the due process claims against the DPHHS. This appeal only concerns the case against the DOC defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Shortly after the claims were separated, the DOC defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Eighth Amendment case for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court decided this motion in a hearing held immediately after a hearing on a motion to dismiss in the separate case brought against the DPHHS. At the conclusion of the hearing in the present case, the district court orally granted the motion to dismiss, ostensibly holding that the claims were not \"adequately pleaded to withstand this\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   Motion to Dismiss.\" However, the court's stated rationale was focused entirely on the due process claims that were at issue in the suit against DPHHS, repeatedly mentioning \"liberty interest,\" \"transfer,\" and a statute governing transfers between the hospital and the prison. The court did not give an explanation as to how DRM had failed to plead an Eighth Amendment claim against the DOC defendants. The DPHHS defendants filed a motion requesting that the district court revisit its orders on the motions on the basis that the court had mistaken the two cases for one another. Before DRM could do the same, the district court issued an order denying the motion and again stating that it had correctly dismissed the case against the DOC defendants. This appeal resulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We review dismissals under rule 12(b)(6)\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Applied Underwriters, Inc. v.

DRM made extensive factual allegations about the effect that the prison's punishment practices have on prisoners with serious mental illness. DRM's complaint alleged that prisoners with serious mental illness are denied diagnosis and treatment of their conditions, described a distressing pattern of placing mentally ill prisoners in solitary confinement for \"weeks and months at a time\" without significant mental health care, alleged the frequent, improper use of this punishment for behavior arising from mental illness, marshalled relevant quotations from national prison health organizations about the unacceptability of subjecting prisoners to extensive solitary confinement, and alleged that the defendants did not respond appropriately to threats of suicide by mentally ill prisoners, increasing the risk of suicide. Far from being \"a wholly conclusory statement\" of its claim, DRM's complaint provides detailed allegations on each of these points, reflecting significant information about the function of the prison and its policies with respect to the seriously mentally ill.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    550 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p570\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   These allegations, by themselves, were enough to make it plausible that prison policies and practices pose a substantial risk of serious harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheppard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523608\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1045/#p1048\">\n    694 F.3d at 1048-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When the district court dismissed DRM's claims, its oral reasoning concerned the case against the DPHHS defendants, and in our view had nothing to do with this case. The district court was then presented with a motion by the DPHHS defendants pointing out that the district court had erred in confusing the case against the DOC defendants with the case against the DPHHS defendants. Yet, the district court declined to revisit its decision, letting an obviously incorrect decision stand that resulted in this appeal with the issues it presents. Because the district court did not correct its mistake and issue a reasoned decision, the district court's error has more impact on plaintiffs than a mere oversight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As we have previously held, \"adamancy in erroneous rulings may justify remand to [a] different judge.\"\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9321723\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/1152/#p1159\">\n    313 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1159-60 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1565256\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/785/777/#p780\">\n    785 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   780 ). This holding reflects the sound reasoning that judges who have insisted on erroneous rulings, even when their errors are obvious and have been highlighted for the court, might not appear to the disfavored parties to be likely to decide in accord with the law in the future. When a district court errs in this way, especially when the court gives no plausible justification for its decision, parties and observers may justifiably doubt whether the future disposition of their\n   matter in the continuing proceedings will be based on proper considerations of law and equity. In such circumstances, we conclude that the appearance of justice requires that judicial decisions be responsive to the facts and rational arguments before the court. The appearance of justice is undermined when a court's actions are unresponsive to those considerations. When a court confuses two different cases and chooses to erroneously dismiss a party's claim rather than to revisit its decision, its actions are sufficiently unresponsive to those considerations as to merit reassignment. Because this case remains at the pleading stage, \"any duplication of judicial efforts will be minimal,\" and the benefits of reassigning will far outweigh the costs.\n   <em>\n    Manley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188359\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/847/705/#p712\">\n    847 F.3d at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This case is controlled by the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

This makes good sense because once persons are incarcerated, they can no longer see to their own medical needs.

Plata\n    </em>\n    was itself concerned with \"[p]risoners in California with serious mental illness\" and directly held that such prisoners are entitled to a certain standard of mental health care.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223362,12459535\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/493/\">\n     563 U.S. 493\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 503,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223362,12459535\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/493/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 1910\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223362,12459535\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/493/\">\n     179 L.Ed.2d 969\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Coleman v.

Supp. 1282\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1301 (E.D. Cal. 1995) (holding that case law sufficiently \"provides a legal gloss\" on the term \"serious mental disorder\"). Both our court and the district court lack authority to second guess this holding. Moreover, the complaint alleges a specific definition of \"serious mental illness.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The district court expressed skepticism about the legal relevance of facts about deceased prisoners to the current claim. But these allegations, if true, would clearly provide powerful support to DRM's claim that Montana's punishing treatment of prisoners with serious mental illness is constitutionally defective.\n    <em>\n     See e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Plata\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223362,12459535\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/493/\">\n     563 U.S. at 508, 519\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223362,12459535\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/493/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 1910\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing the suicides of prisoners kept in administrative segregation as evidence of defective prison mental health care).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The district court left counsel \"discretion\" in how to design the new complaints, but suggested they might be separated into the claims of deceased prisoners, seriously mentally ill prisoners, and Guilty But Mentally Ill prisoners. Those three categories of prisoners are not mutually exclusive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    These cases are different from those in which a plaintiff alleges \"that the care provided on any particular occasion to any particular inmate (or group of inmates) was insufficient.\"\n    <em>\n     Parsons\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055495\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/657/#p677\">\n     754 F.3d at 677\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Moreover, cases like this one for official or supervisory liability must meet a different standard than cases for municipal liability. The DOC defendants' numerous citations to the municipal liability standard are therefore unhelpful.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The DOC defendants' contention that DRM does not have standing to seek injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") is baseless. The PLRA addresses the scope of injunctive relief and not the pleading requirements plaintiffs face.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203626\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(1)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
