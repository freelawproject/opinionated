Specifically, CERCLA provides the EPA with two mechanisms for doing so. First, the EPA can take \"response actions\" to address past or impending releases of hazardous substances.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, the commenters urged that the Proposed Rule \"failed to consider relevant evidence,\" including \"the role of federal and state mining programs and voluntary protective mining practices in reducing risks at current hardrock mining operations\" as well as \"the reduced costs to the taxpayer resulting from effective hardrock mining programs, including existing financial responsibility requirements, and owner or operator responses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The EPA ultimately agreed with those opposed to the Proposed Rule and announced on February 21, 2018 that it had decided not to issue financial responsibility regulations for the hardrock mining industry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n    at 7556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Final Action).

The text of \u00a7 9608(b) suggests that the Congress may have intended \"risk\" to have different meanings in the three clauses. For example, the Congress included the phrase \"of injury\" to modify \"risk\" in the prioritization clause but omitted it from the other two clauses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209608\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

It is plausible, as the EPA contends, that the Congress intended it to consider the same risks in deciding whether to issue any financial responsibility requirements under the general mandate clause. The structure of \u00a7 9608 supports the EPA's position. Section 9608(a), the immediate predecessor provision, creates financial responsibility requirements for vessels to cover their liability to the EPA in the event of a Superfund-financed cost recovery action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209608\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 9608(a).

As an initial matter, this objection appears to be an attempt to resuscitate the Environmental Groups' arguments regarding risks to health and the environment-arguments foreclosed by the EPA's reasonable interpretation of \"risk\" in \u00a7 9608(b),\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A.1. Regardless, the EPA discussed the role of natural resource damages in setting financial responsibility requirements.

The EPA thus did not arbitrarily or capriciously ignore costs associated with natural resource damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, the Environmental Groups contend that the EPA failed to consider that hardrock mining has a higher rate of bankruptcy than most industries and therefore poses a higher risk that abandoned hazardous waste will require long-term\n   remediation efforts. The EPA, however, expressly considered the consequence of bankruptcies in its Final Action. It recounted that states have changed their financial responsibility requirements to account for the risk of bankruptcy and accordingly determined that existing regulations sufficiently account for the risks of long-term remediation efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Action,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n    83 Fed.

We believe its analysis of the risk of bankruptcy was neither arbitrary nor capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As a last note, the Environmental Groups highlight several mining sites for which they believe existing financial responsibility requirements are inadequate. Whatever the merits of the Environmental Groups' concern regarding the sites, it does not undermine the reasonableness of the EPA's decision not to promulgate additional financial responsibility requirements for the entire hardrock mining industry. As noted, the EPA found that only a small fraction of Superfund funds spent on response actions at hardrock mining sites went to address active spills at currently operating mines.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n    at 7567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To start, the Environmental Groups point out that most of the $111 to $171 million the hardrock mining industry would need to expend to comply with the Proposed Rule represents a transfer of money from the mining industry to institutions providing financial responsibility instruments. Excluding the amount of the transfer, the Environmental Groups explain, would have yielded a net societal cost of only $30 to $44 million, not $111 to $171 million. The EPA acknowledged as much. Final Action,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n    83 Fed. Reg. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7585 n.321. Importantly, the Environmental Groups' critique misses the point of the EPA's analysis. The EPA expressly recognized that its estimates of $111 to $171 million in costs to the hardrock mining industry and $15 to $15.5 million in savings to the federal fisc are \"not readily comparable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n    at 7585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Its acknowledgement demonstrates that the EPA did not intend to conduct a rigorous societal cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the EPA compared\n   in broad strokes the potential impact of the $111 to $171 million annual bill on the hardrock mining industry-more mine closures and bankruptcies and stunted mining development due to lost capital,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%207556\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   -to the relatively small benefit to the federal fisc. Such a general comparison is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v.

As the EPA's analysis elsewhere makes clear, existing federal and state programs impose significant financial responsibility requirements on the hardrock mining industry,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7571-80, and thereby already secure these benefits. The EPA therefore need not have considered these benefits as additional reasons to adopt the Proposed Rule.
