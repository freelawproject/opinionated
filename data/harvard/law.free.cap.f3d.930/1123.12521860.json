Lori objected that the confiscation and retention of the firearms, in which she had ownership interests, violated her Second Amendment right. The court granted the City's petition over Lori's objection. Lori appealed that decision, and the California Court of Appeal affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Lori re-registered the firearms in her name alone and obtained clearances to own the guns from the California Department of Justice (\"California DOJ\"), the City still declined to return the guns. Lori sued the City, the San Jose Police Department, and Officer Valentine (collectively, \"Defendants\") in federal district court. She argued that the seizure and retention of the firearms violated her rights under the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and that she was also entitled to return of the firearms under California Penal Code \u00a7 33800\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The district court rejected these arguments and accordingly granted summary judgment for Defendants. Lori appealed. We hold that Lori's Second Amendment claim is barred by issue preclusion and that her Fourth Amendment claim fails on the merits. We therefore affirm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Late one night in January 2013, Lori called 911 to ask the San Jose Police Department to conduct a welfare check on her husband, Edward. This was not the first time that Lori had made such a call-San Jose police officers had been to the Rodriguez home on prior occasions because of Edward's mental health problems. Before they arrived, Officer Valentine and the other responding officers learned that there were guns in the home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the Rodriguez home, Officer Valentine found Edward ranting about the CIA, the army, and people watching him. Edward also mentioned \"[s]hooting up schools\" and that he had a \"gun safe full of guns.\" When asked if he wanted to hurt himself, Edward attempted to break his own thumb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Concluding that Edward was in the midst of an acute mental health crisis that made him a danger to himself and others, Officer Valentine and other officers on the scene decided to seize and detain him pursuant to California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 5150 for a mental health evaluation. Section 5150 allows an officer, upon probable cause that an individual is a danger to himself or another because of a mental health disorder, to take the person into custody and place him in a medical facility for 72-hour treatment and evaluation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205150\">\n    Cal.

The officers detained Edward and placed him in restraints in an ambulance to travel to a nearby hospital for a psychological evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After removing Edward from the home, the officers spoke with Lori, who confirmed that there were firearms in the home in a gun safe. Officer Valentine informed her that, pursuant to California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 8102, he would have to confiscate the guns. Section 8102(a) requires law enforcement officers to confiscate any firearm or other deadly weapon that is owned, possessed, or otherwise controlled by an individual who has been detained under California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 5150.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With Lori providing the keys and the combination code, the officers opened the safe and found twelve firearms, including handguns, shotguns, and semi-automatic rifles. One of the firearms was a personal handgun registered to Lori alone, which she had obtained prior to marrying Edward. The other eleven were either unregistered or registered to Edward. Lori gathered cases for the guns while the officers packed up and documented them. She specifically objected to the removal of her personal handgun, but the officers confiscated it along with the other eleven firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Meanwhile, in the ambulance, Edward repeatedly broke the restraints holding him to a gurney. Once at the hospital, Edward was evaluated and determined to be a danger to himself, so he was admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was discharged approximately one week later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   One month after the officers confiscated the firearms, the City filed a petition in California Superior Court under California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 8102(c), seeking an order of forfeiture based on a determination that the guns' return would likely endanger Edward or others. Edward did not respond to the petition, but Lori intervened, asserting outright ownership of her personal handgun and community property ownership of the other firearms. Lori argued that the court had no power to interfere with her Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms because, even if Edward was prohibited from possessing and owning guns, she was not prohibited. In support, she emphasized that she had obtained a notice of eligibility to own and possess guns from the California DOJ Bureau of Firearms. Lori further represented to the court that, if returned, the guns would be secured in her gun safe and that she had changed the combination code so that Edward would not have access to them. The return of the guns, she contended, therefore would not present a danger to Edward or others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court granted the City's petition. The court acknowledged that Lori could legally \"walk ... into any gun store and qualify to buy a handgun ... and put [it] in that gun safe.\" But it held that the City was nevertheless authorized to take the \"low hanging fruit\" of the guns the Rodriguezes already owned, irrespective of Lori's ability to buy more, because of the danger that Edward presented. Stating that it was not \"ignoring [Lori's] Constitutional Rights,\" the court concluded that it was not appropriate to return the firearms given the public safety concerns at stake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Lori appealed to the California Court of Appeal, arguing that the superior court order was not supported by substantial evidence of danger and that it violated her Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. In April 2015, the appellate court affirmed.\n   <em>\n    City of San Jose v.

App. Apr. 2, 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez I\n   </em>\n   \"). The court held that there was substantial evidence supporting the superior court's determination that returning the guns to the Rodriguez home would likely result in endangering Edward or others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5-6, 9. On the constitutional issue, the court held that Lori had not demonstrated a viable Second Amendment claim under the United States Supreme Court's case law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-9. The court also explained that Lori had \"other viable options,\" including selling or storing the guns outside the home, and \"that the procedure provided by [California Penal Code] section 33850 et seq. for return of firearms in the possession of law enforcement remains available to Lori.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7-8.

She changed the registration and ownership so that all twelve guns were in her name only and obtained gun release clearances from the California DOJ. She then asked the City again to return the guns\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The City denied the request one month later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lori subsequently sued Defendants under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Lori was joined in the lawsuit by co-plaintiffs the Second Amendment Foundation, Inc. (\"SAF\") and the Calguns Foundation, Inc. (\"CGF\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). The Complaint alleged violations of Lori's Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as a state law claim under California Penal Code \u00a7 33800\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs sought return of the guns, damages to compensate Lori, and injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent future violations of Lori's rights and the rights of the organizations' members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants moved for summary judgment, raising various defenses including that SAF and CGF lacked Article III standing, but not including estoppel defenses to any of Plaintiffs' federal law claims. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants.

As she does now, Lori contended in the state court proceedings that Defendants were violating her \"right to keep and bear arms\" by refusing to return the firearms because of her husband's prohibited status, even though \"she was not prohibited from acquiring or possessing firearms and had promised to take all steps required under California law to secure the firearms in a gun safe.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201541988\">\n    2015 WL 1541988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, 6-7.

But neither purported \"change\" affects the premises underlying the state court's Second Amendment analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   First, the fact that Lori obtained exclusive ownership is irrelevant for preclusion purposes because the state appellate court already assumed that Lori had an ownership interest in the guns under California's community property laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201541988\">\n    2015 WL 1541988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (stating that the parties stipulated that Lori had standing to assert a Second Amendment right to the firearms based on her community property interest in them). Moreover, it is undisputed that at least one of the twelve guns, Lori's personal handgun, was always her separate property-accordingly, the court must have considered her exclusive ownership of that gun as part of its analysis and determined that ownership did not affect the outcome under the Second Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, the fact that Lori has now completed the procedural requirements of California Penal Code \u00a7 33850\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   to be eligible for the return of her firearms does not make her current situation materially different from that considered by the California Court of Appeal. The court requested and received supplemental briefing from both parties on the effect of \u00a7 33850\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   on Lori's Second Amendment right. After considering the parties' arguments, and after observing that \"[a]ccording to Lori, the evidence showed that she is not prohibited from owning or possessing firearms\" and that \"she could secure [the guns, if returned] in a gun safe to prevent Edward from having unauthorized access,\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201541988\">\n    2015 WL 1541988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5, the state appellate court held that the seizure and retention did not violate Lori's right to keep and bear arms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Although the court noted that \"the record on appeal shows that the procedure provided by section 33850 et seq. for return of firearms in the possession of law enforcement remains available to Lori,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *8, it did not hold that completing the section's procedural requirements would alter the Second Amendment analysis. Instead, the appellate court concluded that \"Lori ha[d] failed to show that the trial court's ... order violate[d] the Second Amendment by precluding her from keeping firearms for home protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. In other words, as we understand the appellate court's decision, whether Lori might alternatively be able to regain the guns through a state administrative procedure was not necessary to the court's conclusion that her Second Amendment right had not been violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9.

But neither organization presents any evidence of expending resources to assist Lori apart from incurring litigation costs as co-plaintiffs in her federal litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The mere fact that these organizations represent California gun owners and provide legal advice in navigating California's gun laws does not automatically lead to the conclusion that the confiscation and retention of Lori's guns frustrates their missions or requires them to divert resources. Because SAF and CGF have offered no theory explaining their organizational harm-let alone evidence supporting such a theory, as is required at the summary judgment stage-they have not demonstrated Article III standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And without the presence of the organizational plaintiffs, we are left considering issue preclusion against only Lori, the same party who litigated the state court proceedings.

Throughout the state court proceedings, the question whether the seizure and retention of the firearms violated Lori's Second Amendment right was at center stage. The California Superior Court and the California Court of Appeal both expressly considered and ruled on that issue. Redeciding it now, when the facts and Lori's arguments have not materially changed from what was presented in the state proceedings, would undermine the issue preclusion doctrine's goals of comity and judicial economy, so the requirements of the sixth\n   <em>\n    Lucido\n   </em>\n   factor are also met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For these reasons, we hold that Lori's Second Amendment challenge is precluded under California law.

The seizure of the firearms did affect a serious private interest in personal property kept in the home. On the other\n   hand, the public interest at stake here was also very significant. San Jose police officers had previously been to the home on prior occasions because Edward was acting erratically, and on the day in question, Edward was ranting about the CIA, the army, and other people watching him. He also mentioned \"[s]hooting up schools,\" specifically referencing the guns in the safe. Edward's threats may not have been as explicit as the threats made in\n   <em>\n    Mora\n   </em>\n   , but a reasonable officer would have been deeply concerned by the prospect that Edward might have had access to a firearm in the near future. Consequently, there was a substantial public safety interest in ensuring that the guns would not be available to Edward should he return from the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   With significant private and public interests present on both sides, the urgency of the public safety interest is the key consideration in deciding whether the seizure here was reasonable. We believe that, on this record, the urgency of the situation justified the seizure of the firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Importantly, the officers had no idea when Edward might return from the hospital. Even though California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 5150 authorized the detention of Edward for a period of up to 72 hours for treatment and evaluation, he could only be held for that period if the hospital staff actually admitted him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175889\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/1022/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5150 (2013), 5151 (2013). As Lori conceded at oral argument, as far as the officers knew, Edward could have returned to the home at any time-making it uncertain that a warrant could have been obtained quickly enough to prevent the firearms from presenting a serious threat to public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Lori asserts two primary counterarguments to the conclusion that there was sufficient urgency to justify the warrantless seizure of the firearms. First, she argues that any urgency was diminished because she could change the combination to the gun safe, preventing Edward from accessing the guns. But even assuming Lori could have changed the combination before Edward could have returned, it was reasonable to believe that Edward, who weighed 400 pounds, could have overpowered her to gain access to the guns. Second, Lori contended at oral argument that telephonic warrants are available in San Jose and that the officers could have obtained such a warrant more quickly than Edward could have returned if the hospital had not admitted him. But she has offered no support for either assertion. And without evidence or other support for her conclusory statements, Lori has not carried her burden in opposing summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Lori is wrong on two levels. First, even if Lori would not be violating a criminal statute if the guns were returned to her, nothing in California Penal Code \u00a7 25135 suggests that complying with that statute vitiates a California court order forfeiting firearms under California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code \u00a7 8102.
