On appeal, Williams argues that (1) the loaded firearm found in the center console of the rental car that he was driving on the day of his arrest should have been suppressed at trial because it was discovered during an improper second inventory search of the vehicle; (2) his exculpatory post-arrest statements denying knowledge or ownership of the firearm should have been admitted when his oral and written statements confessing ownership were introduced; and (3) evidence as to his gang affiliation and willingness to assist police in finding guns and drugs should have been excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403 and 404(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that (1) police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by returning to search Williams's car again after detectives overheard Williams make a phone call that aroused their suspicion that they may have missed something of value in the car during their initial inventory search; (2) contrary to Williams's claim, neither the doctrine of completeness nor the Fifth Amendment mandated the admission of his post-arrest statements denying ownership or knowledge of the gun; and (3) Williams's arguments as to the inadmissibility of the evidence of his gang affiliation and willingness to assist the police either (a) fail because the evidence was properly admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b) and was not unfairly prejudicial or (b) are waived. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the clear morning of August 27, 2015, three plainclothes detectives from the New York City Police Department's (\"NYPD\") Brooklyn South Gang Squad sat in an unmarked car on Utica Avenue in Brooklyn. Inside a nearby funeral home, mourners were gathered for funeral services. The deceased had been in a gang, so Detective Dominick Latorre (\"Detective Latorre\") and his colleagues were keeping an eye on the surrounding area in case rival gangs showed up looking to cause trouble. At around 10 A.M., the detectives spotted a white Nissan sedan traveling at a high rate of speed. The driver was recklessly weaving between traffic lanes so as to cut others off, and was heading in the direction of the funeral home. The detectives gave chase, caught up to the Nissan, and signaled to the driver, Williams, to pull over. Williams pulled to the side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Detective Latorre approached the driver's side of the car and asked Williams, who was alone in the sedan, for his license and registration. Williams provided his license and a rental agreement for the Nissan. Detective Latorre immediately observed that the car had been rented to someone else, Jennisha Hosam (\"Hosam\"), and that Williams was not listed in the agreement as an authorized driver. Williams claimed the Nissan was his \"girl's car.\" GA-55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detectives then arrested Williams for unauthorized use of the rental car as well as for speeding and driving recklessly. He was placed in the back of the detectives' car and transported to the nearest precinct by Detective Latorre and one of his colleagues, Detective Joseph Fichter (\"Detective Fichter\"). The third detective, Detective Michael Christiano, followed in Williams's car and parked it out front.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the precinct, Williams was put in a holding cell while the detectives began to process the arrest. Detective Fichter commenced an \"inventory search\" of Williams's car while Detective Latorre observed. According to Detective Latorre, an inventory search is mandatory in arrest processing: \"[I]ts importance is to make sure that things are returned to the proper owner and that the wrong things or dangerous things are not returned to anyone.\" GA-38-39. The car's interior, glove box, and trunk were all searched, yielding several items, including: (1) a roll of duct tape, in the glove box; (2) a pair of black gloves, from the driver's side door; and (3) a black mask made of hard plastic, which Detective Fichter discovered in the trunk of the car, wedged inside the enclosed area containing the spare tire. Detective Fichter also recovered postmarked envelopes from the Nissan dated August 21, 2015, and addressed to Williams. After finding these items, Detectives Latorre and Fichter went back inside the precinct to continue processing Williams's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As Detective Latorre was fingerprinting Williams, Williams asked what was going to happen to the rental car. Detective Latorre informed him that the car was probably going to be towed back to the rental agency. Seemingly alarmed by this prospect, Williams said \"I'm entitled to a phone call. I want to make one.\" SPA-6. Detective Latorre handed Williams a phone. Williams proceeded to call someone (he said it was his girlfriend) and, standing about two or three feet away from Detective Latorre, told this person that he or she needed to \"come get this car right now\" because the police were \"looking to tow it.\" GA-41-42; SPA-6-7. Williams spoke at a high pitch and fast pace that Detective Latorre took to indicate that Williams's \"stress level was elevated ... he sounded definitely more stressed.\" GA-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Detective Latorre thought Williams's agitation was curious. He and Detective Fichter decided to go back and search the car again to make sure that \"there was [not] something more important in the vehicle that we didn't see yet.\" GA-42-43; SPA-7. As Detective Fichter put it, \"I felt I missed something.\" GA-97. On the way to the car, in what turned out to be a fortunate encounter, they ran into Detective Ashley Breton (\"Detective Breton\"), who volunteered to help as \"an extra pair of eyes.\" GA-42; SPA-8. After just one to two minutes of searching the interior of the car, including the front area, arm rests, and front and rear seats, Detective Breton popped open the car's center console,\n   which Detective Fichter had not previously examined. There, Detective Breton discovered a loaded gun. According to Detective Breton, though the console in the Nissan is not designed to open, it can be opened easily with no need for special tools or force by unsnapping three plastic pieces \"that connect to the left side paneling\" and that can be easily snapped back into place to close the console. A-110; GA-11. Indeed, Detective Breton testified that he usually checks inside car consoles during inventory searches, because he has located contraband there \"more than once.\" A-111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the firearm was discovered, Williams was rearrested and taken to a private room to be interviewed. There, Detectives Latorre and Fichter read him his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, using a standard form. Williams agreed to waive his rights and signed the form, affirming his willingness to answer questions. Williams thereafter orally acknowledged that the firearm belonged to him and, at the detectives' request, he wrote out a statement memorializing this confession. The signed statement reads in full: \"I had the gun. I had no intenten of hurting any1 Im sorry.\" A-162; GA-48-49. During the same interview, Williams told the detectives that he is a member of the Crips gang, that he is also known as \"Spillz,\" and that he associates with people in both the Crips and Folk Nation gangs. Williams further indicated that he was \"willing to work,\" and could \"get firearms and narcotics.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   GA-104-05, 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Hosam, who rented the white Nissan sedan, testified at Williams's trial. A student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, Hosam gave Williams a lift one day when she saw him in the Brooklyn neighborhood where her son goes to day care. (She had known Williams for about a year at that time, she ran into him periodically, and she was not his girlfriend.) Hosam was then driving a red Nissan Altima that she had rented for the weekend. Upon learning that Hosam was driving a rental car, Williams asked if she would be willing to rent a car for him, as he did not have a credit card. Hosam first extended the rental of the red Nissan, giving Williams its use. Williams paid Hosam for the rental in cash, which \"worked in [her] favor too pretty much,\" as she \"could use the car as well without paying for it.\" GA-74, 80. When the red Nissan Altima was shortly thereafter involved in a minor accident, Hosam exchanged it for a light-colored vehicle, which she also provided to Williams. The only occasion on which she drove this second car, which she did not recall well, was \"[t]he day that we exchanged it,\" and after providing the car to Williams, she saw him only twice between July and late August 2015. GA-76, 141. She left no personal items in the second car, and specifically left neither gloves nor a mask in the vehicle. She also did not leave a firearm in the car and had never owned one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Williams was indicted by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York in October 2015, less than two months after his arrest, and was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Williams pled not guilty. He moved to suppress the firearm, arguing that police had violated the Fourth Amendment when, after conducting the first inventory search, they returned to the\n   car following his phone call and located the concealed and loaded weapon. The magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing at which Detectives Latorre and Breton testified. The magistrate judge then issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that Williams's suppression motion be denied. The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation and denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The first of what would ultimately be three jury trials commenced on October 24, 2016, and ended in a mistrial two days later because the jury could not reach a unanimous verdict. The second trial commenced on December 12, and again ended in a mistrial. The third trial commenced on May 23, 2017, and a week later the jury convicted Williams of being a felon in possession of a firearm. After Williams's conviction, Judge DeArcy Hall sentenced him to 56 months' imprisonment to be followed by three years' supervised release. Williams timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Williams makes three arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the second search of his car was not a valid inventory search pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and that the loaded gun, accordingly, should have been suppressed. Second, he argues that the district court erred by precluding him from introducing his post-arrest statements in which, before admitting to ownership of the weapon, he denied any knowledge of it. Finally, Williams argues that the district court erred by allowing the government to introduce his post-arrest statements regarding his gang affiliation, as well as the images from his Facebook page, because this evidence was inadmissible propensity evidence and unfairly prejudicial. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Car Searches\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Williams first argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the gun seized during the second search of his car on the theory that this second search violated the Fourth Amendment. In Williams's view, only the detectives'\n   <em>\n    initial\n   </em>\n   search of the car was a valid inventory search. He contends that the second search-conducted after Detective Latorre overheard Williams make a phone call during which Williams nervously insisted to the other person on the line that he or she needed to \"come get this car right now\"-was a \"purposeful investigatory search\" and not an inventory search permissible among \"the category of 'caretaking activities' that police departments [must] perform.\" Appellant Br. 34.

A police department's standardized procedures may be established at trial by written rules and regulations or by testimony regarding the department's standard practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Patrol Guide provides that \"[w]henever [an automobile] comes into the custody of [the NYPD],\" officers should \"[s]earch the interior of the vehicle thoroughly,\" including \"\n   <em>\n    any area\n   </em>\n   that may contain valuables.\" A-39 (emphasis added). The Patrol Guide also authorizes officers to \"[f]orce open [the] trunk, glove compartment, etc.,\" so long as it can \"be done with minimal damage.\" A-39. Detective Breton testified at the suppression hearing, based on his \"hundreds\" of inventory searches, that searching behind the paneling of a car's center console is a \"common\" practice. GA-8; A-110-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There is no dispute that the first search followed NYPD procedures. As to the second, although his briefing to this Court did not challenge the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which this search was performed, at oral argument Williams made much of the fact that during the second search, Detective Breton had to \"force open\" the console of Williams's car by removing the console's paneling in order to reveal the gun.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recording of Oral Argument,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-3741 (2d Cir. Nov. 29, 2018), at 5:00-7:20, 22:20-23:00. However, the Patrol Guide specifically says that officers can force open the \"trunk, glove compartment,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   ,\" if only minimal damage will be done, and Detective Breton testified that it was common for police to search center consoles during inventory searches. A-39 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A-110-11. Detective Breton also testified that he did not have to use any sort of \"special tool\" to remove the paneling; nor did it take much force; nor was any damage done to the car, as the paneling could be \"snap[ped] right back into place.\" GA-11-12; A-110. The district court did not err in determining that removing the paneling to check inside the car's center\n   console was consistent with the NYPD's standard procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Williams principally argues as to the second inventory search that it was impermissible for the detectives to conduct the second search at all, pointing out, at the start, that the Patrol Guide is silent as to the validity of\n   <em>\n    multiple\n   </em>\n   inventory searches. However, we have stated that \"we do not think ...\n   <em>\n    every detail\n   </em>\n   of search procedure must be governed by a standardized policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051917\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/364/#p369\">\n    547 F.3d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

When the detectives informed him that they had found a gun in the car, he at first denied knowing anything about the weapon, and claimed that he was merely trying to return the car.

In both its brief and in oral argument, the government has suggested, to the contrary, that Williams's statements were hearsay when proffered by him, and so inadmissible \"unless they fell under some exception to the hearsay rules.\" Gov. Br. 30. The government also argues that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Williams's initial claim to know nothing about the gun neither explains his later admissions nor dispels a misleading impression as to them, so that completion was not required. We reject the government's first argument, but are persuaded by its second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With respect to the government's suggestion that evidence proffered under the rule of completeness may be excluded whenever not independently admissible due to the hearsay rule, this is simply not correct. True, a party cannot circumvent the hearsay rule simply by invoking the doctrine of completeness so as to render otherwise inadmissible evidence admissible for its truth. As Wigmore recognized, completing evidence \"merely aids in the construction of the utterance as a whole, and is not itself testimony.\" 7 Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2113, at 659. But when the omitted portion of a statement is\n   <em>\n    properly\n   </em>\n   introduced to correct a misleading impression or place in context that portion already admitted, it is\n   <em>\n    for this very reason\n   </em>\n   admissible for a valid,\n   <em>\n    nonhearsay\n   </em>\n   purpose: to explain and ensure the fair understanding of the evidence that has already been introduced. As we have said before, \"even though a statement may be hearsay,\" it nevertheless \"must be placed in evidence if necessary to explain the admitted portion [of this statement], to place the admitted portion in context, to avoid misleading the jury, or to ensure the fair and impartial understanding of the admitted portion.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045933\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/507/793/#p796\">\n    507 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   796 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, the doctrine \"can adequately fulfill its function only by permitting the admission of some otherwise inadmissible evidence when the court finds in fairness that the proffered evidence should be considered contemporaneously.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sutton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3611276,10552204\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/801/1346/\">\n    801 F.2d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1368 (D.C. Cir. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The government's first argument is thus unavailing. We are persuaded, however, by its second: that although it was within the district court's discretion to permit Williams to elicit his initial false exculpatory statements, Williams has failed to show that the district court\n   <em>\n    abused\n   </em>\n   its discretion in deciding to exclude them. To require completion under the doctrine of completeness, Williams had to demonstrate that admission of his initial statements denying ownership of the gun was \"necessary to explain\" his later statements that the gun was his, \"to place [these statements] in context, to avoid misleading the jury, or to ensure fair and impartial understanding\" of these later statements.\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689631\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/571/#p575\">\n    813 F.2d at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Williams did not make such a showing. It is not uncommon for a suspect, upon interrogation by police, to first claim in a self-serving manner that he did not commit a crime, only thereafter to confess that he did. But the rule of completeness does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all circumstances,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661444\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/55/#p73\">\n    180 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 73 (2d Cir. 1999), and the mere fact that a suspect denies guilt before admitting it, does not-without more-mandate the admission of his self-serving denial. As the district court here aptly pointed out, Williams's confession was \"simply a reversal of his original position.\" A-244-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Williams argues that the juries at his first two trials heard the exculpatory portions of his post-arrest statements and that the deadlock of these juries demonstrates the importance of this evidence and the error in excluding it at his third trial. We disagree. The standard of review here is abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11661444\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/55/#p73\">\n    180 F.3d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that district court's application of rule of completeness doctrine \"is reviewed only for abuse of discretion\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689631\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/571/#p575\">\n    813 F.2d at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (observing that reviewing courts \"must limit [themselves] to inquiring whether the district judge's actions amounted to an abuse of discretion\" in assessing rule of completeness determinations). And regardless whether Williams's exculpatory statements were admitted in earlier proceedings, we can discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's conclusion that Williams's statements that he didn't know anything about the gun, but was just bringing the car back to his \"girl,\" did not \"explain\" his subsequent confession, and were thus not necessary to correct a misleading impression arising from the admission of his inculpatory statements alone. We note, too, that Williams's third trial was the\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   occasion on which the government called Hosam, who explained how Williams came to be driving the car she had rented and who disclaimed any knowledge of the loaded weapon in that car. It is thus highly speculative, at best, to contend that the conviction here resulted from exclusion of exculpatory portions of Williams's post-arrest statements, when a more pertinent difference between the third trial and its predecessors was the introduction of direct testimony to the effect that the weapon in the car was in no way associated with the person who had rented the vehicle.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The analysis here is also sufficient to explain why Williams's Fifth Amendment claim is meritless. Williams cites a footnote from this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marin\n   </em>\n   , which states that \"when the government offers in evidence a defendant's confession and in confessing the defendant has also made exculpatory statements that the government seeks to omit, the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights may be implicated.\"\n   <em>\n    Marin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1161298\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/669/73/#p84\">\n    669 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   85 n.6. But even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the Fifth Amendment is implicated in such circumstances,\n   <em>\n    Marin\n   </em>\n   itself makes clear that this is only when the statement offered by the government is\n   <em>\n    misleading\n   </em>\n   by virtue of the portion it omits.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1161298\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/669/73/#p84\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"In such circumstances ... the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent is violated when the omission paints a distorted picture ... which the defendant is powerless to remedy without\n   taking the stand.\" (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)). As already noted, the district court did not err in concluding that Williams's confession was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   misleading and that the omitted exculpatory portions of his post-arrest statements did not explain that confession, which was \"simply a reversal of his original position.\" A-244. Thus, Williams's Fifth Amendment claim is also without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The \"Gang\" Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Williams's Post-Arrest Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Williams next argues that the district court erred in admitting his statements to police, made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   he confessed to possessing the gun, that he was a member of the Crips gang and was \"willing to work\" with police to \"get firearms and narcotics.\" GA-105. Before trial, the government moved\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to admit (1) evidence that Williams had previously used the center console of a Nissan to hide fraudulent credit cards; and (2) these post-arrest statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted the motion in part, permitting the post-arrest statements to be admitted but not the evidence about Williams's prior use of the center console. On appeal, Williams argues that the statements constituted impermissible propensity evidence pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) and were unfairly prejudicial under Fed. R. Evid. 403. Appellant Br. 42. For the following reasons, we again disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Rule 404(b) states that \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\" Fed.

At the same time, pursuant to this Circuit's \"inclusionary approach\" to such evidence, other-crimes evidence\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   admissible if offered \"for any purpose\n   <em>\n    other than\n   </em>\n   to show a defendant's criminal propensity.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

More specifically, the defense argued at trial that Williams did not confess, and that his handwritten statement, \"I had the gun,\" was not an admission to knowing possession of the weapon, but simply an acknowledgment by Williams that he was driving the car in which the gun was found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Let's focus on this business about \"I had the gun,\" okay?

Williams's statements to police shortly after\n   executing his handwritten confession rebutted this argument by suggesting, instead, that Williams first admitted to knowing possession of the loaded firearm and then, contemporaneously with this admission, sought to curry favor with police by telling them that he was in a position to cooperate in other cases.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Williams's post-arrest offer to assist police tended to clarify that his written statement \"I had the gun\" was not an admission to haplessly driving a car with a gun in it when he spoke to police, as his counsel contended in summation, but was instead an acknowledgement that Williams\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   possessed the weapon in the Nissan, as he admitted to police orally before offering to assist them in making other cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Evid. 403. As outlined above, the statements were probative for non-propensity purposes. And the district court mitigated any potential prejudice by issuing a limiting instruction restricting the jury's use of the gang-affiliation evidence to proper Rule 404(b) grounds, telling the jury \"not [to] consider it for any other reason whatsoever.\" GA-127;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673030\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/573/138/#p141\">\n    573 F.3d at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to conclude that district court abused its discretion in admitting other-crimes evidence that was \"relevant and highly probative as to knowledge and intent\" and was \"accompanied by a careful and thorough instruction limiting the evidence to relevant Rule 404 grounds\").

The Facebook Images\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Williams argues, finally, that the district court erred in admitting images from his Facebook page. The images depict Williams making hand signs-signs that Detective Fichter testified were gang signs, based on the detective's \"training and experience as a gang squad detective.\" GA-109. Williams contends, as he did with his post-arrest statements, that these images constitute impermissible propensity evidence.

This Court \"ordinarily applies Rule[ ] 103(a) strictly,\" and where a party \"made no objection that clearly stated the specific ground now asserted on appeal,\" a claim of error is \"unavailing.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, when the government moved to admit the Facebook images, Williams made a \"general objection.\" GA-107. The following colloquy was then held at side bar:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   THE COURT: All right. As I understand, your only standing objection that you've made to this was based on the delay that the government exhibited in seeking the search for it. Is there another basis ...? Because you said my general objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   MR. PADDEN: I meant my previous objection, my previous motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   THE COURT: So you don't have a relevance objection or anything like that.

Then [if] that's the only objection, then the objection is overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   GA-107. This exchange demonstrates that Williams did not make an objection clearly stating the impermissible-propensity-evidence grounds now asserted on appeal. The objection was thus not preserved at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Where an objection has not been preserved, this Court has \"discretion to correct errors that were\n   <em>\n    forfeited\n   </em>\n   because not timely raised in the district court, but no such discretion applies when there has been true\n   <em>\n    waiver\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
