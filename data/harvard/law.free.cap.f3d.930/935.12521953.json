The appellees sued several parties and entities, but this appeal concerns their constitutional and tort claims against City of Springdale (\"City\") officials Kathy O'Kelley and Ernest Cate, and Washington County (\"County\") official Rick Hoyt. O'Kelley, Cate, and Hoyt (collectively, \"the officials\") moved to dismiss the appellees' constitutional claims on the basis of qualified immunity and the tort claims on the bases of qualified and statutory immunity. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied their motion. Because we agree that the officials were not entitled to either qualified or statutory immunity, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The appellees are sisters and stars of the popular reality show\n   <em>\n    19 Kids and Counting\n   </em>\n   . The show chronicles the lives of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their 19 children. In 2006, the appellees, as well as their siblings and parents, were interviewed as part of a police investigation into sexual misconduct by the appellees' brother, Josh Duggar. The appellees were under the age of 16 at the time of the alleged misconduct and at the time of the investigation. The police promised the appellees and their family that their statements would remain confidential. The family's statements were documented in reports by both the City Police Department and the County Sheriff's Department. The County prosecutor also filed a Family in Need of Services (FINS) petition pursuant to a request by the City police. No charges were ever filed against Josh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2015, a tabloid publisher submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the City and County to access these reports. On May 19, 2015, the tabloid published an article naming Josh as the target of an \"Underage Sex Probe\" and promised more details to follow.\n   <em>\n    Dillard v. City of Springdale, Ark.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:17-cv-05089,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204392049\">\n    2017 WL 4392049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (W.D. Ark. Sept. 29, 2017). The original article identified Josh as the perpetrator and unnamed sisters-later identified as the appellees-as the victims. On May 20, the City released its report to the tabloid; the next day, the County released its report as well. O'Kelley, the City Police Chief, and Cate, the City Attorney, directed the release of the City's report, while Hoyt, an officer in the County Sheriff's Office, directed the release of the County's report. The appellees describe the released City report, for example, as containing \"graphic descriptions about their molestation.\" Compl. at 17, \u00b6 58,\n   <em>\n    Dillard v. City of Springdale, Ark.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:17-cv-05089,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202215124\">\n    2017 WL 2215124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Ark. May 18, 2017), ECF No. 1. Though the appellees' names were redacted, the reports contained other identifying information-such as the appellees' parents' names and the appellees' address and ages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the district court, the officials claimed FOIA required them to release the reports in the time and manner in which they did. However, the appellees alleged that the officials hastily and wrongfully released the reports. We read the appellees' complaint as alleging that the officials released the reports in response to pressure from the press in an effort to promote the appearance of transparency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the officials' release of the reports, the tabloid published both reports,\n   as well as several salacious articles based on the reports' content. Because of the public's prior knowledge about the Duggar family, the non-redacted details-i.e., the parents' names, the victims' ages and address-allowed readers to ascertain the appellees' exact identities. While the pre-disclosure March 19 article indicated that some of the many Duggar children had been abused, the March 20 and 21 reports confirmed these rumors and enabled the appellees to be specifically identified. A torrent of media attention followed, and the appellees claim they \"were subjected to spiteful and harsh comments and harassment on the Internet and in their daily lives.\" Compl. at 20, \u00b6 68. Joy Duggar subsequently filed a motion in state court to expunge copies of the City report from the public record; the court granted this motion on the basis that Arkansas law had prohibited their release. Nonetheless, copies of the report continued to circulate online.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The appellees then brought this suit in federal court, alleging the officials violated their constitutional and common law rights by directing the reports' release. They sued under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Arkansas Civil Rights Act (ACRA) for violations of their right to privacy and under Arkansas tort law for invasion of privacy-public disclosure of private fact; invasion of privacy-intrusion upon seclusion; and outrage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officials moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, invoking the protection of qualified immunity for the constitutional claims and qualified and statutory immunity for the tort claims. With regard to the constitutional claims, they argued the appellees had not alleged constitutional violations, or, in the alternative, that the constitutional right at issue-i.e., the right to informational privacy-was not \"clearly established.\" The officials renew this argument on appeal, with an emphasis on the \"clearly established\" element. With regard to the state law claims, they argued that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ark.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2021-9-301\">\n    Ark.

The absence of Arkansas cases actually applying the Child Maltreatment Act does not render its plain language ambiguous. None of the officials have denied that the reports were documents; that these documents were created; that they were collected or compiled by their respective law enforcement agencies; or that their agencies were authorized to investigate the allegations against Josh. As FOIA officers, the officials should reasonably have been aware of the law's requirements.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Neither is the officials' attempt to create ambiguity by referencing a change to the Juvenile Code availing. The Juvenile Code is an entirely different section of the Arkansas Code than that containing \u00a7 16-90-1104 and the Child Maltreatment Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Act of Apr. 4, 2017, No. 891,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20Ark.%20Acts%20891\">\n     2017 Ark. Acts 891\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (amending \u00a7 9-27-309(j)). The legislature amended the Juvenile Code to exempt from FOIA records of an investigation conducted when the\n    <em>\n     offender\n    </em>\n    was an adult but relating to juvenile conduct. This change does tangentially relate to the situation at issue, in that Josh Duggar was investigated as an adult for juvenile conduct. However, Josh is not a plaintiff in this suit: his sisters are. The issue here is not whether the appellants acted improperly vis a vis Josh; the issue is whether they acted improperly vis a vis his sisters. Perhaps the Arkansas legislature did amend the code to protect juvenile perpetrators like Josh. But that amendment did nothing to change the language or rationale of \u00a7 16-90-1104 or of the Child Maltreatment Act, which are intended to protect victims rather than perpetrators.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Arkansas law further undercuts the appellants' claim that they lacked fair notice of their alleged conduct's illegality.
