The federal government delayed commencing its criminal proceedings until the state's proceedings had concluded. Myers claims that this delay violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Because the Supreme Court directs courts to take an ad hoc, case-by-case approach to a defendant's claim that the right to a speedy trial has been violated,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barker v.

Because we cannot determine from the district court's orders whether the district court here erroneously applied a bright-line rule, we remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 30, 2015, deputies from the Spokane County Sheriff's Office initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle after it pulled into a gas station. After determining that one of the occupants of the vehicle had an outstanding warrant, the deputies placed that occupant under arrest. The deputies then questioned Christopher Myers, another occupant of the vehicle. Myers attempted to escape, but tripped and fell a short distance away. A deputy and his dog tried to subdue him. During the scuffle, a pistol in Myers's pocket went off, and one of the officers responded by shooting Myers in the stomach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the wake of this incident, the state arraigned Myers and charged him with two counts of first-degree assault and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm. (The state subsequently dismissed the felon-in-possession charge.) A few days later, on May 5, 2015, the federal government issued an indictment charging Myers with unlawfully possessing a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1), based on the same incident. The federal authorities filed a detainer with the state authorities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The state proceedings were substantially delayed. From February 2015 to January 2017, four different attorneys were appointed for Myers. According to Myers, his second attorney asked for five continuances, yet failed to take the steps necessary to prepare for trial. Myers's two\n   subsequent attorneys requested several continuances to familiarize themselves with his case, and then likewise failed to make progress in preparing for trial. After twelve continuances requested by Myers's attorneys, Myers finally entered into a plea agreement with the state in January 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2015, Myers learned that the federal government intended to bring charges against him and had issued a detainer. Myers testified that this made him stressed and worried. In April 2016, Myers wrote the district court to assert his Sixth Amendment speedy trial right under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IADA), 18 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 2. Myers claimed he had not been properly served or notified of the federal charge. In response, the U.S. Attorney's Office informed the district court that it intended to wait until the state charges were resolved before proceeding on the federal charge. Myers then filed his first motion to dismiss. The district court denied the motion; it rejected Myers's speedy trial claim and determined that IADA did not apply to Myers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2017, Myers pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree assault in the state case and was sentenced to 63 months' imprisonment. One month later, Myers made his first appearance in federal court pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosquendum. A few months later, Myers filed a renewed motion for dismissal based on a violation of his speedy trial rights. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court again denied the motion to dismiss. The court held that the government's reason for delay (to allow the state to complete its prosecution) was valid. Turning to Myers's claim that he was prejudiced by the delay, the court held that the record did not show that the federal charges caused any oppressive pretrial incarceration, Myers's condition would not have been any different in state prison without the federal detainer in place, and Myers's \"claimed prejudice of anxiety is not substantive or attributable to the Government.\" Nor did the court find any evidence that Myers's defense had been impaired by the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Myers then pleaded guilty to the federal charge, but preserved his right to appeal the speedy trial issue. He now timely appeals the court's dismissal of his speedy trial claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have not yet considered how the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   balancing test applies to delays caused by concurrent state and federal prosecutions. There is a circuit split on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Three of our sister circuits have adopted a rule that the government has a valid reason to delay federal prosecution when the defendant is subject to concurrent state proceedings. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit held that delay is appropriate to allow the defendant to be prosecuted by the state \"without interference by the federal government\" because \"[t]o do otherwise would be to mire the state and federal systems in innumerable opposing writs, to increase inmate transportation back and forth between the state and federal systems with consequent additional safety risks and administrative costs, and generally to throw parallel federal and state prosecutions into confusion and disarray.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412392\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/55/144/#p150\">\n    55 F.3d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150-51 (4th Cir. 1995). Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has held that \"simply waiting for another sovereign to finish prosecuting a defendant is without question a valid reason for delay.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schreane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9112283\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/548/#p555\">\n    331 F.3d 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 555 (6th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In considering the government's \"desire to complete the state proceedings on unrelated drug charges before continuing with federal charges,\" the Tenth Circuit stated \"that awaiting the completion of another sovereign's prosecution may be a plausible reason for delay in some circumstances, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a justifiable excuse in every case.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As noted above, the Supreme Court has directed us to consider the reasons for a delay in context. \"[A]ny inquiry into a speedy trial claim necessitates a functional analysis of the right in the particular context of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the Court has declined to adopt a clear rule for any category of delay. For example,\n   <em>\n    Loud Hawk\n   </em>\n   considered a delay in federal proceedings due to the government's decision to take an interlocutory appeal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    474 U.S. at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    106 S.Ct. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather than hold that the government has a valid reason to delay federal prosecution whenever it takes an interlocutory appeal, the Court considered the nature and merits of the appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    at 316-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    106 S.Ct. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the government had a \"bad faith or dilatory purpose\" in bringing an interlocutory appeal, the delay caused by the appeal would weigh against the government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    106 S.Ct. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But if the government's position in the interlocutory appeal was strong and supported by reasonable evidence, the delay would not weigh against the government.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, rather than hold that delays caused by the government's negligence always weigh against the government, the Court directed courts to consider the nature and circumstances of the negligence.\n   <em>\n    Doggett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n    505 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[O]ur toleration of such negligence varies inversely with its protractedness, and its consequent threat to the fairness of the accused's trial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480837\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/647/#p651\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In light of this guidance, we hold that where a delay arises due to concurrent state and federal proceedings, a court must consider the nature and circumstances of the delay in order to determine whether (and how much) it weighs against the government. For instance, when the state's charges factually overlap with the federal charges, such that trying the defendant concurrently would present administrative hurdles and safety concerns, a delay may be justified and not weigh against the government.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Loud Hawk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    474 U.S. at 316-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204451\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/302/#p316\">\n    106 S.Ct. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787533\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/784/#p791\">\n    622 F.3d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, when state charges are unrelated to the federal charges, and the government adduces no evidence that concurrent proceedings would present administrative difficulties or safety concerns, a court may weigh the delay against the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, there is no bright-line rule for this category of delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We now consider Myers's arguments that the district court erred in applying the\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   balancing test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Myers first argues that the length of delay in his case favored dismissal, and that the delay in his case was presumptively prejudicial. We agree. Because Myers's trial did not start until 22 months after the date Myers was indicted, the length of the delay was sufficient to raise a presumption of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gregory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9372521\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/322/1157/#p1161\">\n    322 F.3d at 1161-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Myers next argues that there was no reason to delay the commencement of the federal proceedings under the circumstances of his case. According to Myers, the government faced no logistical problems in commencing Myers's trial in federal court; among other things, the pretrial detention center in which he was incarcerated for state proceedings was close to the federal courthouse and was also used to hold federal prisoners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The government asserts that allowing the state to pursue its prosecution without interruptions from a parallel federal prosecution is a justifiable basis for delay, especially where there is no evidence of any intent to hamper the proceeding. In this case, the government asserts, the federal and state charges were factually overlapping, and the same witnesses, potential experts, and evidence would be required in both matters. Therefore, the government claims, moving forward in the federal case while the state case was ongoing would have led to significant procedural difficulties and hampered the administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court did not directly explain its evaluation of the government's reasons for delay. In denying Myers's first motion to dismiss, the court acknowledged the existence of a circuit split on the question whether the presence of concurrent state charges provides \"\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   for delaying a federal case,\" and concluded that in Myers's case, \"the reason for delay does not vindicate the Government, but neither does it weigh strongly against the Government.\" In denying Myers's second motion to dismiss, the court recognized that the government's main reason for the delay was \"to allow the state proceedings to complete before moving forward on the federal charges,\" but concluded that even if this reason was invalid, the delay did not weigh against the government because it did not act in bad faith and Myers had not suffered any prejudice. In both orders, the district court rejected the standard enunciated in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Seltzer\n   </em>\n   , one of the cases adopting an ad hoc approach to delays caused by concurrent proceedings. The district court's failure to consider or weigh the government's reasons for delay and its rejection of the rule in\n   <em>\n    Seltzer\n   </em>\n   raise the concern that it did not fully embrace the approach we adopt today. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court may have erred in balancing the government's reasons for the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, we turn to Myers's argument that the district court erred in determining that he did not suffer prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Myers raises three arguments, none of which have merit. First, Myers claims\n   that he was kept in solitary confinement while being held for state trial. However, the district court found that those conditions are not attributable to the federal government but were related to Myers's state charges. That conclusion is not clearly erroneous; Myers produced no evidence that the state's decision to keep him in solitary confinement was tied to his federal charges. Second, Myers argues that he was deprived of his right to counsel as a result of the delay. But as the district court noted, Myers was represented by counsel in his state proceedings, and Myers has failed to show how his ability to defend against the federal charge was impaired by the delay. Based on the record, the district court's conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Myers also testified that he experienced anxiety and concern due to the delay of the federal indictment. However, the district court found that he had not suffered such symptoms, and again, this finding is not clear error. Indeed, the district court concluded that any anxiety that Myers experienced was more likely tied to the more serious state charges he faced, rather than any delay in the federal proceedings. In short, Myers has failed to establish that his defense was in any way impaired by the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Barker\n   </em>\n   balancing test requires courts to \"approach speedy trial cases on an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   basis,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    407 U.S. at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9139028\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/407/514/#p530\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We conclude that this ad hoc approach also applies to the category of delays resulting from concurrent judicial proceedings. In this case, we cannot tell whether the district court applied a per se rule in concluding that Myers's speedy trial right was not violated by the 22-month delay; in any event, the court has not had an opportunity to consider the government's reason for the delay under the rule we adopt today.
