First, we need guidance in determining whether section 16600 of the California Business and Professions Code applies only to contracts between employers and employees, or also applies to contracts between two businesses. Second, the California Supreme Court has held that a plaintiff must plead an independently wrongful act in order to state a claim for intentional interference with an at-will employment contract. We need guidance, however, in determining whether this requirement applies to contracts outside of the employment context, as two California Courts of Appeal districts have suggested that it does not. Accordingly, we certify the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Does section 16600 of the California Business and Professions Code void a contract by which a business is restrained from engaging in a lawful trade or business with another business?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Is a plaintiff required to plead an independently wrongful act in order to state a claim for intentional interference with a contract that can be terminated by a party at any time, or does that requirement apply only to at-will employment contracts?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Our phrasing of the questions should not restrict the Court's consideration of the issues involved. The Court may rephrase the questions as it sees fit in order to address the contentions of the parties. If the Court agrees to decide these questions, we agree to accept its decision. We recognize that the Court has a substantial caseload, but we submit these questions in the interests of comity and because of their significance for business torts in California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ixchel Pharma is a biotechnology company that develops small-molecule drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial disease. Ixchel has been working on the development of an experimental therapeutic drug to treat Friedreich's ataxia, a rare neurological disease. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ixchel's drug is dimethyl fumarate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To further its efforts to develop and commercialize a new dimethyl fumarate drug, Ixchel entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Forward Pharma in January 2016. Forward is a biotechnology company based in Denmark that is in the business of developing drugs containing dimethyl fumarate for the treatment of neurological disease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Collaboration Agreement included the following terms. Ixchel and Forward would work together to develop the new dimethyl fumarate drug. Forward would assess the feasibility of conducting clinical trials for the new drug. If Forward determined that clinical trials were feasible, Forward would be responsible for carrying out the trials and paying for their costs under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement. Ixchel would provide assistance with the clinical trials. If the clinical trials were successful and resulted in FDA approval for the new drug, the parties agreed that Forward would be responsible for managing the manufacturing and commercialization of the drug with Ixchel's assistance. Ixchel would be entitled to receive a percentage royalty on the sales of the approved product. Forward could terminate the Collaboration Agreement by written notice, which would become effective sixty days after notice was received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In late 2016, Forward began negotiations with Biogen, another pharmaceutical company, in an effort to settle a longstanding intellectual property dispute. Ixchel alleges that Forward gave Biogen a copy of the Collaboration Agreement without Ixchel's consent. According to Ixchel, Biogen determined that Ixchel's development work on the new dimethyl fumarate drug would pose a threat to Biogen's sales of its own dimethyl fumarate drug designed to treat multiple sclerosis. Biogen therefore asked Forward to cut off all ties with Ixchel as part of the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2017, Forward and Biogen executed an agreement (the Forward-Biogen Agreement) in which Biogen agreed to pay Forward $1.25 billion and Forward agreed to stop working with Ixchel to develop a dimethyl fumarate drug. Section 2.13 of the Forward-Biogen Agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Ixchel.\n   </em>\n   Each of the Additional Parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and [Forward] shall, and shall cause each of its respective controlled Affiliates to, terminate any and all existing, and not enter into any new, Contracts\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or obligations to Ixchel Pharma LLC, Dr. Gino Cortopassi [Ixchel's CEO] and/or any other Person, to the extent related to the development by any of the Additional Parties, [Forward] or any of their respective controlled Affiliates of any pharmaceutical product having\n   <em>\n    dimethyl fumarate\n   </em>\n   as an [active pharmaceutical ingredient] for the treatment of a human for any indication, including Friedreich's ataxia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to this provision, Forward notified Ixchel that it was terminating the Collaboration Agreement and ceasing all work with Ixchel on the development of the new dimethyl fumarate drug, including work relating to the planned clinical trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ixchel filed suit in district court against Biogen, asserting (1) tortious interference with contract; (2) intentional and/or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage; and (3) violations of California's unfair competition law (UCL), which prohibits \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code \u00a7 17200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The district court dismissed Ixchel's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It determined that Ixchel had failed to state a claim for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage because Ixchel had failed to plead that Forward engaged in an independently wrongful act. For the same reason, the court held that Ixchel had failed to state a claim for tortious interference with contract. Acknowledging that such a claim does not ordinarily require a showing of an independently wrongful act, the district court concluded that Ixchel's agreement with Forward constituted an at-will contract because Forward could terminate with 60-day notice, and therefore Ixchel was required to plead a wrongful act. Because the court dismissed these claims, the complaint failed to allege an unlawful practice actionable under the UCL, and so the court also dismissed the UCL claim. The district court granted Ixchel leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its amended complaint, Ixchel pleaded that Forward violated section 16600 of the California Business and Professions Code by entering into section 2.13 of the Forward-Biogen Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ixchel claimed that section 2.13 wrongfully restrained Forward from engaging in lawful business with Ixchel and therefore was void. By entering into an agreement that violated section 16600, Ixchel argued, Forward had committed an independently wrongful act. The district court disagreed, and again dismissed the complaint. The court reasoned that section 16600 barred only covenants not to compete between employer and employee, and therefore did not apply to section 2.13 of the Forward-Biogen Agreement. Ixchel timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We require the California Supreme Court's guidance to resolve the parties' dispute about the applicability of section 16600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to the enactment of section 16600, \"contractual restraints on the practice of a profession, business, or trade, were considered valid, as long as they were reasonably imposed.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

As Ixchel points out, nothing in the plain language of the statute limits its applicability to the employment setting. By its terms, it applies to contracts restraining \"anyone\" from engaging in a lawful business of any kind.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016600\">\n    Cal.

Under such a reading, section 2.13 of the Forward-Biogen Agreement would likely violate that provision, Ixchel argues, because it precludes Forward from entering into any new contract with Ixchel to develop new drugs containing dimethyl fumarate. Further, Ixchel claims, entering into a contract that is void pursuant to section 16600 is an unfair business practice, and therefore violates the California UCL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dowell v.

Biogen asserts that applying section 16600 to any restraint of trade between two businesses would be contrary to the rule of reason in the federal antitrust context and invalidate ordinary commercial restrictions and contracts. For instance,\n   Biogen claims, such a broad interpretation of section 16600 would limit California businesses' ability to contract for exclusive-dealing arrangements or a manufacturer's location clause limiting where its dealers can sell.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1092\">\n    782 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1086 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Steven M.

According to Biogen, the California legislature could not have intended such a broad application of this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the applicability of section 16600 determines whether the inclusion of section 2.13 in the Forward-Biogen Agreement constituted an independently wrongful act, and thus whether Ixchel has stated a claim that survives a motion to dismiss, the California Supreme Court's guidance on this issue will decide this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We also require the California Supreme Court's guidance to resolve the parties' dispute about whether a claim for intentional interference with contractual relations requires the plaintiff to plead and prove an intentionally wrongful act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Biogen argues that under California law, the plaintiff must plead such a wrongful act when the contract at issue may be terminated at will by either party.
