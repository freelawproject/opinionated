Section 3-506 provides, inter alia, that the State Board of Elections shall provide copies of the List only to registered Maryland voters, and confines use of the List to purposes related to the electoral process. After Fusaro was denied a copy of the List because he was not a registered Maryland voter, he sued the defendant state officials in the District of Maryland, alleging that \u00a7 3-506 violates the Free\n   Speech Clause of the First Amendment and that the provision's reference to the \"electoral process\" is unconstitutionally vague. Fusaro sought a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of \u00a7 3-506 as to its registered voter requirement and its restrictions on use of the List. The district court dismissed Fusaro's complaint and denied injunctive relief on the ground that Fusaro had no First Amendment right to access the List. As explained below, we are satisfied that, with respect to his free speech challenge, Fusaro has stated a claim under the First Amendment. We therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Dennis Fusaro is a resident of and registered voter in Stephens City, Virginia. Fusaro has worked for a number of regional and national political campaigns, and intends to \"continue his involvement in elections and political advocacy,\" including in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fusaro v. Davitt\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-cv-03582 at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (D. Md. Dec. 4, 2017), ECF No. 1 (the \"Complaint\"). In 2014, Fusaro consulted for a successful campaign for a County Council seat in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. In 2016, Fusaro was charged by the state prosecutor with violating criminal provisions of Maryland's Election Law in connection with his work in the 2014 campaign.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 1 (citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Fusaro\n   </em>\n   , D-07-CR-16-00734 (D. Ct. Anne Arundel Co.));\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fusaro v. Davitt\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-cv-03582 (D. Md.

In August 2017, however, Fusaro obtained a new trial before a jury and was acquitted. Following those events, Fusaro sought to express his displeasure with the state prosecutor by \"shar[ing] his story with Maryland citizens\" and urging them to seek the prosecutor's resignation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 2. Fusaro planned to achieve his goal - that is, the prosecutor's resignation - by mailing copies of a letter criticizing the prosecutor to registered Maryland voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The object of Fusaro's displeasure was defendant Emmett C. Davitt, the Maryland State Prosecutor at all relevant times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State Prosecutor possesses statutory authority to investigate and prosecute violations of Maryland law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Crim. P. \u00a7\u00a7 14-107(a), 14-109(a). The State Prosecutor is appointed by the Governor of Maryland, with the advice and consent of the Maryland Senate.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 14-102(c)(1). It is not an elected office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   To facilitate his letter campaign against Davitt, Fusaro sought a copy of Maryland's list of registered voters. The List is maintained by the Maryland State Board of Elections (the \"State Board\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   State Board,\n   <em>\n    Voter Registration Statistics\n   </em>\n   , https://elections.maryland.gov/voter_registration/stats.html.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the State Board, the List contains the names, addresses, party affiliation, and other personal data of the nearly four million voters registered in Maryland.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   State Board,\n   <em>\n    Eligible Active Voters on the Precinct Register - By County\n   </em>\n   (Oct. 20, 2018), https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/2018_stats/GG18_Eligible_Active_Voters_by_County.pdf; State Board,\n   <em>\n    Application for Voter Registration Data\n   </em>\n   , https://elections.maryland.gov/pdf/SBEAPPL.pdf.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fusaro planned to use the List to circulate his letter criticizing Davitt and urge Maryland voters to seek his resignation, notwithstanding that Davitt holds an appointed (rather than elected) office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuing his plan, Fusaro applied for a copy of the List from the State Board in August 2017. The Board promptly rejected Fusaro's application because he did not satisfy the statutory requirements to obtain a copy of the List. The statutory provisions concerning the maintenance and distribution of the List are codified in Subtitle 5 of Title 3 of Maryland's Election Law. Section 3-506 governs the dissemination of copies of the List and provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a) (1) A copy of a list of registered voters shall be provided to a Maryland registered voter on receipt of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (i) a written application; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (ii) a statement, signed under oath, that the list is not intended to be used for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   1. commercial solicitation; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   2. any other purpose not related to the electoral process. [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (c) A person who knowingly allows a list of registered voters, under the person's control, to be used for any purpose not related to the electoral process is guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction, is subject to the penalties under Title 16 [of the Election Law].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Election Law, \u00a7 3-506(a), (c). Additionally - and relevant here - \u00a7 3-505 of the Election Law makes the voter registration records \"open to public inspection\" at local offices of the State Board.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 3-505(b)(1). Those records may also be removed from the local State Board office \"on order of a court,\" or \"for temporary removal solely for purposes of data processing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 3-505(b)(2)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State Board's rejection of Fusaro's application for the List complied with \u00a7 3-506. Fusaro's application included his home address in Virginia. Thus, as the Board explained in its subsequent correspondence with Fusaro, it rejected his application because, under \u00a7 3-506, \"you must be a Maryland resident and registered voter to request a copy of the voter registration list.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Ex. D. Confirming the State Board's written explanation, Fusaro's rejected application contains a notation from the Board indicating that the rejection was based on the fact that Fusaro was not a registered Maryland voter. Fusaro does not allege or identify any other reason for the Board's rejection of his application. Notably, the Complaint does not indicate that Fusaro has ever sought to obtain Maryland voter registration records from a local office of the State Board. Nor does Fusaro allege that he intends to seek Maryland residency and register as a Maryland voter. Fusaro acknowledges that, pursuant to Maryland law, he is not entitled to register to vote in Maryland as long as he remains a resident\n   of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 4 (citing Md. Code Election Law \u00a7 3-102(a)(1)(iii) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Fusaro sued Davitt and various members of the State Board in the District of Maryland on December 4, 2017. Fusaro's Complaint alleges two challenges against \u00a7 3-506. The Complaint first alleges that providing copies of the List only to registered Maryland voters contravenes the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment because it favors \"some political speakers\" over others, namely, anyone not registered to vote in Maryland (Count I).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 30. Second, the Complaint alleges that the prohibition against using the List for any purpose \"not related to the electoral process\" restricts speech based on content and is unconstitutionally vague, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments (Count II). The Complaint presents each count as both facial and as-applied challenges, and it seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As attachments to the Complaint, Fusaro included his proposed letter urging Maryland voters to seek Davitt's resignation; his rejected application for the List; and his correspondence with the Board regarding that rejection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on December 15, 2017, Fusaro requested a preliminary injunction from the district court. Specifically, Fusaro sought to bar enforcement of the portions of \u00a7 3-506 that limit access to the List to registered Maryland voters only, and that prohibit using the List for purposes unrelated to the electoral process. In response, the defendants filed a consolidated memorandum on January 26, 2018, which included a motion to dismiss the Complaint and their opposition to Fusaro's request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 4, 2018, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss and denied Fusaro's request for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fusaro v. Davitt\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:17-cv-03582 (D. Md. Sept. 4, 2018), ECF No. 26 (the \"Opinion\"). The Opinion rejected Fusaro's challenge to \u00a7 3-506 as a violation of the Free Speech Clause. Instead, the Opinion determined that \u00a7 3-506 merely regulated access to a record created and maintained by the government of Maryland.

The district court determined that Fusaro's claims amounted to nothing more than an alleged First Amendment right to access a government record. The Opinion explained that, as a general matter, no such right exists - at least, not under the circumstances alleged - and the court dismissed the Complaint on that basis. Fusaro maintains, however, that \u00a7 3-506 burdens speech by limiting access to the List and the purposes for which the List may be used, in contravention of the First Amendment. We must assess whether Fusaro's alleged injury is protected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and, if so, the level of scrutiny that applies to the challenged provisions of \u00a7 3-506. We will then address Fusaro's vagueness challenge, as well as his request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment provides that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. amend.

That short but forceful phrase has given rise to a complex array of legal protections for free expression, which the courts have flexibly applied in a variety of circumstances. Those precedents establish that the First Amendment protects speech along a spectrum, so that \"[l]aws that impinge upon speech receive different levels of judicial scrutiny depending on the type of regulation and the justifications and purposes underlying it.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stuart v.

That is, we must determine whether Fusaro's claims fall anywhere on the spectrum of First Amendment speech protections. Our answer to that question turns on the framing of Fusaro's claims. On the one hand, the district court concluded that \u00a7 3-506 merely regulates access to a government record, and such access is not generally protected by the First Amendment. The defendants urge us to affirm that view of Fusaro's claims and dismiss the Complaint on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the other hand, Fusaro contends that the List is a powerful communications tool, closely tied to political speech. Because the List facilitates speech directed to Maryland voters, it impacts the circulation of information and ideas to those voters. According to Fusaro, the limitations on access to and use of the List contained in \u00a7 3-506 constitute a burden on protected speech and must comply with the First Amendment. Fusaro also contends that \u00a7 3-506 should be subject to strict scrutiny - the most exacting test applicable under the Free Speech Clause - because \u00a7 3-506 imposes a \"severe\" burden on speech and discriminates based on its content.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 32, 38. In sum, the parties offer sharply opposing characterizations of Fusaro's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As explained herein, we are satisfied that \u00a7 3-506 must comply with the protections enshrined in the Free Speech Clause. Accordingly, Fusaro's claim that \u00a7 3-506 unconstitutionally restricts speech is cognizable under the First Amendment. That said, the context and nature of \u00a7 3-506 urge judicial deference to the judgment of Maryland's legislature in crafting that statute, and they inform the level of scrutiny that applies thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As the Opinion correctly recognized, there is no general First Amendment right to access a government record.

First, the List is closely tied to political speech, which generally receives the strongest First Amendment protection. Second, \u00a7 3-506 imposes content- and speaker-based conditions on access to and use of the List, and such restrictions are typically subject to heightened scrutiny. Third, Supreme Court precedent indicates that suspect conditions on access to government information may be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. That precedent leads us to conclude that the conditions that \u00a7 3-506 imposes with respect to the List present a sufficient risk of improper government interference with political speech that it is susceptible to being challenged under the Free Speech Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As a threshold matter, the nature of the government records to which \u00a7 3-506 governs access informs our analysis of the First Amendment implications.

That said, access to the List presents a less immediate link to political speech than does campaign spending. And it is important that the List is a government record, so that regulations on its distribution reflect policy judgments to which courts must ordinarily defer. In other words, requesting and obtaining a copy of the List is not purely an act of speech, in that it is not simply a matter of personal expression, nor of the use of private resources to aid such expression.

Specifically, \u00a7 3-506 restricts access to and use of the List based on the identity of the speaker requesting the List and the content of the speaker's message. In other contexts, restrictions of that kind can trigger strict scrutiny.

Fusaro, by contrast, pursues both facial and as-applied challenges, and he alleges that \u00a7 3-506 has burdened his speech, not least because it provides for criminal prosecution of anyone who misuses the List.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sorrell v.

Second, neither\n   <em>\n    United Reporting\n   </em>\n   nor any other precedent has addressed a request for a government document as closely tied to political speech as is the List.

In his concurrence, Justice Scalia (joined by Justice Thomas) expressly reserved the issue of whether a combination of content- and speaker-based conditions on access to government information could constitute a speech restriction subject to First Amendment scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Reporting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    528 U.S. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suggesting that \"a restriction upon access that\n   <em>\n    allows\n   </em>\n   access to the press ... but at the same time\n   <em>\n    denies\n   </em>\n   access to persons who wish to use the information for certain speech purposes\" may constitute a speech restriction). Justice Ginsburg's concurrence (joined by Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Breyer) concluded that selective disclosure of government information was permissible, as long as access was not conditioned on \"an illegitimate criterion such as viewpoint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is, given the spectrum of First Amendment protections applicable to different kinds of speech in varying contexts, what level of scrutiny governs Fusaro's claims? The type of claim that Fusaro pursues - namely, a free speech challenge to conditions that a state has imposed on the release of voter registration data - has apparently never been addressed by any appellate court. In identifying the level of scrutiny that applies to a novel First Amendment claim, we begin by \"examin[ing] the type of regulation at issue\" and the interests at stake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stuart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341416\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/238/#p244\">\n    774 F.3d at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As the foregoing discussion plainly demonstrates, \u00a7 3-506 is not easily categorized. On one hand, as we have stressed, it regulates access to a government record, which is not ordinarily subject to any First Amendment constraints. On the other hand, given the List's entanglement with political speech, the combination of content-and speaker-based restrictions imposed by \u00a7 3-506 implicates the concern at the heart of the Free Speech Clause, namely, that the government should not quash speech with which it disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v.

Again, the release of government information is such an area because a disclosure decision is fundamentally a policy question.

Consequently, strict scrutiny does not apply to Fusaro's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Section 3-506 imposes four conditions on access to a copy of the List. Specifically, the requester must: be a registered Maryland voter; complete an application that requires providing a home address; pay a fee; and refrain from using the List for any purpose not related to the electoral process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Election Law, \u00a7 3-506(a), (c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, \u00a7 3-505 also makes voter registration records available to the public at local State Board offices. Those records can be taken from a local office \"for purposes of data processing,\" that is, to convert them into a more convenient format.\n   <em>\n    See id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00a7 3-505(b)(2)(ii)(2). And \u00a7 3-505 does not place any restrictions on who may obtain voter registration data through the State Board offices, nor does it impose any fees on accessing the data by that means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In assessing the burden imposed by those regulations - that is, by the combined effect of \u00a7 3-506 and \u00a7 3-505 - it is important to our analysis that obtaining a copy of the List is, as we have observed, a \"step removed\" from the communication of political speech.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750274\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/515/#p525\">\n    650 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (declining to apply strict scrutiny to Maryland Election Law provision specifying proper manner of signing referenda). The List itself does not convey any message or idea, and the limits placed on access to it do not directly impede the flow of information, particularly when - as discussed below - other means of communication remain open. That fact distinguishes \u00a7 3-506 from regulations limiting who may circulate, sign, or witness petitions, which have generally been made subject to strict scrutiny. As the Supreme Court observed, regulations that \"limit the number of voices who will convey the initiative proponents' message\" directly reduces speech, as well as \"the size of the audience proponents can reach.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

That concern does not apply to \u00a7 3-506, which only governs access to a particular tool for speech, and does not limit speech itself. Indeed, the petition process is a form of direct political participation and usually represents a unique avenue for public participation in policymaking. Access to the List, by contrast, is\n   <em>\n    several\n   </em>\n   steps removed from any such democratic participation. In short, the List remains a useful tool for communication but not a form of actual speech. A regulation on access to such a tool can merit First Amendment protection, but not necessarily heightened scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750274\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/515/#p525\">\n    650 F.3d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying intermediate scrutiny to regulations on referendum signatures).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Another reason the courts distinguish between means of communication and pure speech is that one tool can often be substituted for another. Here, even absent a copy of the List, nothing prevents Fusaro from criticizing prosecutor Davitt on billboards, in newsletters, on the internet, or simply by mailing his letter to any Marylander in the phone book. By contrast, a petition initiative generally has no meaningful alternative to a boots-on-the-ground approach to gather signatures, particularly where electronic signatures do not satisfy a state's petition requirements. We have heretofore ruled that, when a plaintiff can avoid the restriction imposed by an election regulation, the plaintiff's right has not been burdened.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2923353\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/360/#p364\">\n    503 F.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (4th Cir. 2007) (concluding that, because Virginia permitted multiple types of primary elections, restrictions imposed\n   on one type did not \"burden parties' right of association\"). Moreover, the information provided in the copies of the List available under \u00a7 3-506 is also available to any person who visits one of the twenty-four State Board offices, pursuant to the separate statutory provision in \u00a7 3-505. Thus, Fusaro need not register to vote in Maryland - or convince a registered voter to assist him - to obtain the information he seeks; he need only visit a State Board office during business hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   It is true that the broad access to voter registration records under \u00a7 3-505 imposes the logistical burden of visiting a State Board office, in contrast to the ease with which \u00a7 3-506 provides copies of the List to registered Maryland voters. In context, however, we are satisfied that the burden imposed is not a severe one. First, a state is not constitutionally required to eliminate every logistical barrier in administering its regulatory regime for elections.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/#p433\">\n    504 U.S. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/#p433\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he mere fact that a State's system creates barriers ... tending to limit the field of candidates from which voters might choose ... does not itself compel close scrutiny.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Most importantly, the challenged provisions of \u00a7 3-506 are politically neutral, a principal factor in assessing the burden imposed by an election regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 438,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/#p433\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing the validity of \"reasonable, politically neutral regulations\" in concluding that burden imposed by Hawaii regulation was \"limited\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In the limited available precedents where conditions on access to voter information were deemed improper, the critical flaw in the challenged regulation has been that it was not politically neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Ind.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5871753\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/778/1458/#p1459\">\n    778 F.

Supp. at 996 (same). We agree that such viewpoint discrimination - or other obviously illegitimate classifications, such as race - separates presumptively valid distinctions from presumptively unconstitutional restrictions in securing access to voter information. Indeed, our decision in\n   <em>\n    Alcorn\n   </em>\n   emphasized that political neutrality was important to determining whether a state election provision severely burdened First Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325469\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/708/#p713\">\n    826 F.3d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ruling that Virginia ballot-ordering law imposed only \"modest burdens\" because, importantly, it allowed \"any political organization ... an evenhanded chance\" at \"a first-tier ballot position\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The importance of political (or viewpoint) neutrality to determining the applicable level of scrutiny is bolstered by other relevant precedents. In\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court emphasized that \"it is especially difficult for the State to justify a restriction that limits political participation by an identifiable political group whose members share a particular viewpoint, associational preference, or economic status.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    460 U.S. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, an election regulation that plausibly burdens First Amendment rights on the basis of viewpoint, political affiliation, or class should be subject to strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fulani v. Krivanek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519541\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/973/1539/#p1544\">\n    973 F.2d 1539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1544 (1992) (relying on\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   and emphasizing that statutes that impose an \"unequal burden\" on \"minor\" parties can be \"a significant infringement on First Amendment rights\"). And in\n   <em>\n    United Reporting\n   </em>\n   , a central concern of the various justices writing separately was that, in controlling access to government information, states might impose conditions \"based on an illegitimate criterion such as viewpoint.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    528 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg, J., concurring). Thus, in the context of First Amendment challenges to both election regulations and access\n   to government information - the two central aspects of Fusaro's claims - the crucial line drawn by the Supreme Court was that the government could not use its power against disfavored positions or political groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The conclusion that the states may make certain legitimate, facially neutral distinctions between individuals seeking access to government voting data without triggering strict scrutiny accords with the approach taken by various courts in other contexts where the government is not merely a regulator. That is, where the government confers some affirmative benefit - rather than interfering with private conduct - it usually enjoys greater flexibility and a lower level of judicial scrutiny. This is true, for example, when the government creates a limited forum for speech. In those cases, the state may create \"lawful boundaries,\" including some content-based distinctions, if such limits serve the purpose of the forum and avoid viewpoint discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p829\">\n    515 U.S. 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 829-30,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p829\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p829\">\n    132 L.Ed.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). The same reasoning applies when the government confers a subsidy, such as a tax benefit, where the legislature is free to support \"some speech, but not all speech,\" as long as the subsidy \"is not aimed at the suppression of dangerous ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regan v.

Justice Ginsburg analogized the disclosure of government information to a subsidy in her\n   <em>\n    United Reporting\n   </em>\n   concurrence. She observed that \"the provision of [arrestee] address information is a kind of subsidy,\" so that while some selective disclosure of that data was permissible, the state could not condition access on \"an illegitimate criterion such as viewpoint.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    528 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The common thread of such precedents is the recognition that when the government is not compelled to provide a particular benefit, it may place limits on access to that benefit, as long as those limits do not cross a constitutional red line. Viewpoint discrimination is one such line, as the foregoing discussion makes clear. And it seems obvious that distinctions based on race, religion, or national origin would be similarly \"illegitimate\" criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Reporting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    528 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg, J., concurring). And the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   emphasizes that the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination likewise renders suspect a regulation that places unequal burdens on different political parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    460 U.S. at 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In this situation, however, no illegitimate criteria are implicated by the text, context, or operation of \u00a7 3-506. The distinction between registered voters and non-registered voters may be subject to other types of constitutional challenges in some contexts, but here there is no apparent risk of impermissible government interference with speech. Indeed, we have sustained otherwise politically neutral electoral regulations that limited certain forms of political expression to registered voters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750274\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/515/#p525\">\n    650 F.3d at 525-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying intermediate scrutiny to \"nondiscriminatory\" state petition signature regulation that limited potential signatories to registered voters);\n   <em>\n    Howlette v.

As long as the path to becoming a registered voter is not tainted by discrimination, such distinctions do not generally present a risk of political or viewpoint discrimination that would be presumptively unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, we note that the sole content-based distinction in \u00a7 3-506 is similarly benign. The only reference to content in \u00a7 3-506 is the provision limiting use of the List to purposes \"related to the electoral process.\" Similarly neutral restrictions on the use of arrestee addresses were sustained by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    United Reporting\n   </em>\n   , where it rejected a facial challenge to the California statute barring commercial use of those addresses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    528 U.S. at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476053\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/32/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At bottom, the limit that \u00a7 3-506 imposes on use of the List is politically neutral - that is, it does not distinguish between viewpoints, economic classes, or political affiliations - and thus avoids the critical danger that the government might unduly influence \"competition in the marketplace of ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    460 U.S. at 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/#p788\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alcorn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325469\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/708/#p713\">\n    826 F.3d at 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasizing political neutrality of regulation in assessing burden it imposed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In sum, \u00a7 3-506 does not severely burden speech, nor does it raise any suspicion of improper government action.

Our conclusion that \u00a7 3-506 does not merit strict scrutiny depends on its limited practical effect on the free speech interest asserted by Fusaro, its political neutrality, and its underlying nature as a regulation on access to a government record. As we have emphasized herein, the fact that \u00a7 3-506 is both an election regulation and a means of accessing government information urges some judicial deference to the policy judgments it reflects.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/#p433\">\n    504 U.S. at 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729479\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/428/#p433\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cautioning against applying strict scrutiny to all election laws and thereby \"[tying] the hands of States\" in regulating elections).

The court did not directly address Fusaro's vagueness challenge to the phrase \"electoral process,\" as it is used in \u00a7 3-506. Instead, the court determined that both counts of Fusaro's Complaint were premised on a First Amendment claim that simply did not exist, and it dismissed the entire Complaint on that basis. Similarly, the court rejected Fusaro's request for injunctive relief because he could not succeed on the merits. That is, because the court had concluded that Fusaro failed to state a cognizable First Amendment claim, he could not qualify for the \"extraordinary remedy\" of a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opinion 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Winter v.
