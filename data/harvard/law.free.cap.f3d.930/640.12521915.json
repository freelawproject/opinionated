Turner claims that, pursuant to a stand-down order under which police officers at the rally were instructed not to intervene in violence among protesters, officers watched his attack and did nothing to help. Turner brought suit against Al Thomas Jr., former Chief of the Charlottesville Police Department; W. Stephen Flaherty, Virginia State Police Superintendent; and the City of Charlottesville. The district court concluded that Thomas and Flaherty were entitled\n   to qualified immunity and dismissed Turner's complaint for failure to state a claim. We agree with the district court that the facts alleged in Turner's complaint do not amount to a violation of clearly established law. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because Turner's claim was dismissed on the pleadings, we take as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3506947\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/250/#p253\">\n    591 F.3d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253 (4th Cir. 2009). On August 12, 2017, the \"Unite the Right\" rally was held in Charlottesville's Emancipation Park to protest the City's decision to change the Park's name from \"Lee Park\" and remove a Confederate monument from its grounds. Jason Kessler, leader of the far-right advocacy group \"Unity &amp; Security for America,\" led efforts to organize the rally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City granted Kessler a permit to hold the rally and informed him that heavy police presence and security would be provided. But less than a week before the event, citing traffic and safety concerns, the City revoked the permit. Kessler challenged the revocation in the Western District of Virginia on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, and the district court reinstated the permit. According to Turner, Thomas and Flaherty were \"enraged\" by the decision to reinstate the permit. J.A. 24. In response, they enacted a stand-down order under which officers on duty at the rally would \"refrain from intervening in any violent confrontations between white supremacists and counter-protesters unless given a direct command to do so.\" J.A. 25. Turner alleges that officers told protesters at the rally about the stand-down order. For example, when demonstrators asked if police planned to respond to violent attacks, at least one officer responded by saying \"that's not my job.\" J.A. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Turner attended the rally as a counter-protester. He alleges that while he demonstrated peacefully on the sidewalk adjacent to the Park, \"KKK members/sympathizers\" exited the Park and began to engage with counter-protesters. J.A. 27-28. According to Turner, the \"KKK members/sympathizers\" attacked him for more than thirty seconds, spraying his eyes with mace, beating him with a stick, and throwing bottles of urine at him, all while police looked on and did nothing. J.A. 26. Turner alleges that despite a warning from the Department of Homeland Security that the rally could turn violent, police did not wear riot gear to patrol the rally. Approximately five hours after the rally began, officers changed into riot gear and began to clear the Park, though at that point Turner had already been attacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Turner brought suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In general, a defendant's mere failure to act does not give rise to liability for a due process violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/#p196\">\n    489 U.S. 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/#p196\">\n    109 S.Ct. 998\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12031841\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/189/#p196\">\n    103 L.Ed.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). Turner seeks to avoid that rule by invoking the state-created danger exception, under which state actors may be liable for failing to protect injured parties from dangers which the state actors either created or enhanced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pinder v.

But it was not clearly established at the time of the rally that failing to intervene in violence among the protesters would violate any particular protester's due process rights. Accordingly, we agree with the district court that Thomas and Flaherty are entitled to qualified immunity, and we affirm the dismissal of Turner's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Qualified immunity shields state actors from liability under \u00a7 1983 liability when their \"conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiley v.

To determine whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity, we ask two questions: (1) Has the plaintiff alleged a violation of a federal right? (2) Was the right at issue clearly established at the time of the alleged violation?\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

We may decide, on a case-by-case basis, which question to answer first.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p236\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If the answer to either question is \"no,\" then the defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In this case, we begin by asking whether the right asserted by Turner was clearly established at the time of its alleged violation. To determine whether a right was clearly established, we typically ask whether, when the defendant violated the right, there existed either controlling authority-such as a published opinion of this Court-or a \"robust consensus of persuasive authority,\"\n   <em>\n    Booker v. S.C. Dept of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276854\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/533/#p544\">\n    855 F.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 544 (4th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted), that would have given the defendants \"fair warning that their conduct was wrongful.\"\n   <em>\n    Williamson v.

Thus, we must determine whether, at the time of the rally, there existed legal authority giving Thomas and Flaherty fair warning that ordering officers not to intervene in violence among protesters would implicate the state-created danger doctrine and amount to a violation of protesters' due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As our starting point, we turn to\n   <em>\n    DeShaney v.

We held that the Does' claims did not describe the \"affirmative actions\" necessary to implicate the state-created danger doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 441 (\"No amount of semantics can disguise the fact that the real 'affirmative act' here was committed by [the counselor] not by Rosa.\"). We noted that the Does' claims \"lack[ed] the nexus necessary for any of Rosa's alleged conduct to be 'affirmative acts' \" that created or enhanced the danger to the Does, specifically, because Rosa \"did not meet or speak with the Does, and by all accounts, was not even aware [they] existed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Against this background, we conclude that it was not clearly established at the time of the rally that ordering officers\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to intervene in private violence between protesters was an affirmative act within the meaning of the state-created danger doctrine. Our precedent sets an exactingly high bar for what constitutes affirmative conduct sufficient to invoke the state-created danger doctrine. Turner has put forth no facts suggesting that a stand-down order crosses the line from inaction to action when the state conduct in\n   <em>\n    Pinder\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   did not. Acting under\n   <em>\n    Pinder\n   </em>\n   's teaching that state actors may not be held liable for \"st[anding] by and d[oing] nothing when suspicious circumstances dictated a more active role for them,\" Thomas and Flaherty could have reasonably concluded that a stand-down order violated no constitutional right.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412951\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/54/1169/#p1176\">\n    54 F.3d at 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Turner has not alleged a violation of clearly established\n   law, and Thomas and Flaherty are entitled to qualified immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Additionally, Turner's complaint sought to hold Thomas and Flaherty liable under a theory of supervisory liability and the City of Charlottesville liable under\n    <em>\n     Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     436 U.S. 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     98 S.Ct. 2018\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n     56 L.Ed.2d 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1978). We need not address the supervisory-liability claim separately, because Turner has not argued that the qualified-immunity analysis should proceed any differently for that claim. We also find that Turner has waived his claim against the City of Charlottesville. At a hearing before the district court, Turner said he had \"dropped\" this claim. J.A. 178. Then, in his opening brief on appeal, Turner appeared to focus entirely on the qualified-immunity issue, which does not apply to the City. In response, the City argued that this claim had been waived; Turner declined to address the waiver argument in his reply, which did not even mention his claim against City. It was not until oral argument that Turner sought to preserve this claim. We conclude that Turner's inattention to this claim on appeal, combined with his express statement to the district court, effectively waived it. Therefore, we do not address it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Turner argues that in assessing the merits of his substantive due process claim, we should ask whether Thomas and Flaherty acted with deliberate indifference to Turner's safety. But as we have stated, \"apart from situations involving custody, the Supreme Court has never applied a 'deliberate indifference' standard merely because the State created a danger that resulted in harm.\"\n    <em>\n     Slaughter v.

Because there was no clearly established law imposing liability based on deliberate indifference in this context, qualified immunity shields Thomas and Flaherty from such liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
