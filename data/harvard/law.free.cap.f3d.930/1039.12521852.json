We do not reach the issue of whether there is a separate burden of production in the cancellation of removal context and, if so, who bears it, and remand to the BIA to consider this issue in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Marinelarena, a native and citizen of Mexico, first entered the United States in 1992. After living in the United States for a number of years, she returned to Mexico briefly in 1999, but re-entered the United States in 2000 following inspection and admission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Marinelarena has lived in the United States since and has two children who are United States citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2000, on a plea of nolo contendere, Marinelarena was convicted of a misdemeanor under California Penal Code \u00a7 529 for false personation of another. In 2006, she was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit a felony in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 182(a)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   namely conspiring to sell and transport a controlled substance in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint listed a number of overt acts in support, only one of which referenced a specific controlled substance, heroin. Marinelarena pleaded guilty and was convicted of violating California Penal Code \u00a7 182(a)(1) on March 26, 2007. She was fined, sentenced to three years of probation, and 136 days in county jail. Following her conviction, Marinelarena filed separate petitions in state court under California Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4 to expunge her false personation and conspiracy convictions. In 2009, California courts granted both of Marinelarena's petitions, vacating her \u00a7 529 and \u00a7 182(a)(1) convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Meanwhile, on March 28, 2007, following her conspiracy conviction, the Department of Homeland Security served Marinelarena with a notice to appear for removal proceedings. The notice charged her with removability as an alien who had remained in the United States longer than permitted, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). Marinelarena conceded removability, but applied for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At a removal hearing in 2011, the IJ noted that Marinelarena's conspiracy conviction had been expunged under California Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4, but stated that such an expungement would not eliminate the conviction for immigration purposes, unless the dismissal had been on constitutional grounds. The IJ continued the hearing, instructing Marinelarena to submit any documents or briefing as to why she remained eligible. Accordingly, she submitted a brief arguing that she remained eligible for cancellation of removal despite her \u00a7 182(a)(1) conviction. She argued that, because the conviction documents in the record did not identify that the crime of conviction rested on a specific controlled substance, her conviction did not constitute a controlled substance offense as defined by the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The IJ rendered an oral decision in 2012, holding that Marinelarena had failed to demonstrate eligibility for cancellation of removal and ordering her removed to Mexico. The IJ determined that although her conviction under \u00a7 529 for false personation had been expunged, that expungement did not disqualify it for immigration purposes and the conviction\n   constituted a crime involving moral turpitude under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i). The IJ also found that, \"more importantly,\" her crime \"for conspiracy to distribute heroin\"-as the IJ construed the criminal complaint-would also bar her from relief. Consequently, the IJ denied her relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the BIA also held that Marinelarena had the burden of establishing that her conspiracy conviction was not a disqualifying offense, and that she had not met that burden. The BIA explained that California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352 is broader than the CSA with respect to the substances covered,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but divisible, and that Marinelarena had failed to submit any evidence showing that she was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   convicted of a disqualifying controlled substance offense. Therefore, the BIA ruled, Marinelarena had not established that she was eligible for cancellation of removal. The BIA did not discuss her conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 529, nor did it discuss the expungement of either conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Marinelarena timely petitioned for review. A three-judge panel, in a split decision, denied in part and dismissed in part the petition.\n   <em>\n    Marinelarena v.

Here, the only judicially noticeable document in the record relating to Marinelarena's criminal offense is the criminal complaint, which identifies the target offense of the conspiracy as selling and transporting a controlled substance in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11352. The complaint identifies sixteen overt acts, only one of which references a specific controlled substance, heroin. But a complaint alone is insufficient to prove a conviction related to a particular controlled substance,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lara-Chacon v.

In the removal context, the government bears the burden of \"establishing by clear and convincing evidence\" that a noncitizen\n   is deportable, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A).

Because this new rule is invented out of whole cloth, will give aliens a perverse incentive to withhold and conceal evidence, and is contrary to the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) and Supreme Court decisions, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determined that Aracely Marinelarena was removable as an alien who had remained in the United States longer than permitted, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B). Therefore, the DHS initiated removal proceedings by issuing a Notice to Appear. Marinelarena conceded that she is removable. She then sought relief from removal by submitting an application for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In her application for cancellation of removal, Marinelarena stated: \"Convicted 12/28/2006, Charges, Conspiracy to commit a crime, sale, transportation or offer to sell controlled substances, Sentence, three months in a State prison. This sentence is subject to a Motion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Marinelarena also submitted a two-count criminal complaint filed against her in 2006. Count 1 charged her with conspiracy to sell and transport a controlled substance, in violation of California Penal Code section 182(a)(1) (Conspiracy) and California Health and Safety Code section 11352 (Offense Involving Controlled Substances Formerly Classified as Narcotics). In connection with this conspiracy charge, the indictment alleged sixteen overt acts, one of which referred to transportation of three bags containing heroin. Count 2 charged her with the sale, transport, or offer to sell a controlled substance (heroin), in violation of California Health and Safety Code section 11352. Marinelarena also submitted documents filed\n   with the state trial court in support of her motion for dismissal under California Penal Code section 1203.4, including an affidavit in which she declared that she pleaded guilty only to Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Over the next two years, Marinelarena appeared with counsel before the immigration judge (IJ) at four different hearings. At the first hearing in 2009, Marinelarena's counsel acknowledged that Marinelarena had a conviction relating to transportation of narcotic substances. Given the government's contention that such a conviction would disqualify Marinelarena from cancellation of removal, the IJ asked Marinelarena's counsel for further information and briefing on the issue. At a 2011 hearing, the IJ reiterated his request for briefing and documentation regarding the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the final hearing in 2012, Marinelarena's counsel acknowledged that she still could not produce additional documentation regarding Marinelarena's conviction for conspiracy to distribute narcotics. The IJ pretermitted Marinelarena's application for cancellation of removal, but informed her counsel that if Marinelarena could obtain evidence that the conviction was not a controlled substance violation, she could move to reopen the proceedings and submit that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In his oral ruling, the IJ held that because Marinelarena had failed to produce documents showing that her state conviction was not for a disqualifying controlled substance offense, she failed to prove that she was eligible for cancellation of removal. Among other reasons, the IJ held that a conviction for conspiracy to distribute heroin made her ineligible for cancellation pursuant to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Marinelarena argued that the IJ erred in determining that her prior state conviction was for a disqualifying offense. The BIA affirmed. It stated that Marinelarena had the burden of establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal. According to the BIA, Marinelarena conceded that she had been convicted of conspiracy to violate section 11352 of the California Health and Safety Code and at least some ways of committing that offense were disqualifying controlled substance offenses. Marinelarena had the burden of proving she had not been convicted of a disqualifying controlled substance offense, and had not carried that burden because she \"had not submitted any evidence establishing that her conspiracy conviction was not for a disqualifying controlled substance offense.\" Therefore, the BIA held, Marinelarena was not eligible for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Congress decreed that \"[a]n alien applying for relief or protection from removal has the burden of proof.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(4)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.8\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (providing that the alien \"shall have the burden of establishing that he or she is eligible for any requested benefit or privilege\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To demonstrate eligibility for cancellation of removal (the benefit that Marinelarena seeks) the alien must show that the alien \"has not been convicted of\n   any aggravated felony.\" 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3).

Simply said, we have reached the end of the categorical\n   analysis. Because we don't know the applicable version of the state offense, we cannot compare it with the federal controlled substance offense to determine whether they match. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Marinelarena's prior conviction was for a disqualifying or nondisqualifying offense.

But a reader will search in vain for any such ruling in\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   merely applied the familiar rule that a court may consider only the offense of conviction, not the facts underlying the conviction, in determining whether an alien was convicted of a disqualifying offense for purposes of the immigration statutes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/\">\n    569 U.S. at 205-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697041\" index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/184/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

When a state statute includes many alternative versions of an offense, a court must determine the historical, factual question of what the alien was convicted of based on the evidence in the record. Only then can we ask the legal question: whether that offense is a match for a disqualifying federal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   By confusing the legal and factual issues, the majority creates the new rule that, when an alien is convicted under a state statute that includes multiple, alternative versions of the offense, and there is insufficient evidence in the record to prove what version the alien was convicted of, we must assume as a matter of law that the alien was convicted of a version of the state offense that does not match the federal generic offense. This rule finds no support whatsoever in\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   . The majority opinion's rule is also directly contrary to\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , which was not overruled by\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   because\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Moncrieffe\n   </em>\n   address entirely distinct issues. Moreover, the majority opinion conflicts with the majority of our sister circuits, and instead joins the single circuit that adopted the wrong approach.
