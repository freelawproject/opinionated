We dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2014, Adam Vasseur sued various defendants in Missouri state court alleging injuries sustained in a car accident. Vasseur filed an amended petition naming TEI as an additional defendant on November 17, 2017. TEI removed to the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on January 9, 2018 based on diversity jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vasseur filed a motion to remand on June 13, 2018, arguing that the removal had violated the one-year time limit of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), which provides that \"[a] case may not be removed ... on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 more than 1 year after commencement of the action, unless the district court finds that the plaintiff has acted in bad faith in order to prevent a defendant from removing the action.\" The district court granted Vasseur's motion, holding that \u00a7 1446(c) is jurisdictional, that the failure to remove the case within one year of the commencement of the original action had therefore deprived the district court of subject-matter jurisdiction, and that the case should be remanded to Missouri state court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). TEI appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TEI argues that the remand order was \"erroneous\" because, under Missouri law, an action commences against a particular party when that party is added to the lawsuit, not when the original action was filed against other defendants. But under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), \"[w]hen a district court remands a case based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction under section 1447(c), a court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of the remand order\" and \"the remand order must stand whether erroneous or not and whether review\n   is sought by appeal or by extraordinary writ.\"\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

But such minimal review is \"limited to confirming\" that the district court's \"characterization of its remand as resting upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\" was at least \"colorable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573144\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/224/#p234\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, Vasseur admits that the district court characterized its remand as based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. He also conceded during oral argument that the district court's interpretation of \u00a7 1446(c)'s one-year limitation as jurisdictional was \"colorable.\" After an independent review, we agree. In 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 1446(c) was amended to add a \"bad faith\" exception to the one-year time limit. A reasonable argument can be made that it would only be necessary to add a \"bad faith\" exception to the statute if \u00a7 1446(c)'s one-year limitation is jurisdictional. If the one-year time limit of \u00a7 1446(c) is nonjurisdictional, it would already be \"presumptively subject to equitable tolling,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
