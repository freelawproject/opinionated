He alleged\n   that he suffered from an intellectual disability that rendered his capital sentence violative of the Eighth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    536 U.S. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1255406\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/304/\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). To succeed on his claim, Richardson was required to demonstrate that he had (1) \"\n   <em>\n    significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,\"\n   </em>\n   defined as an IQ \"of 70 or below,\" and (2) \"\n   <em>\n    significant limitations in adaptive functioning\n   </em>\n   ,\" defined as \"[s]ignificant limitations in two or more of [ten] adaptive skill areas.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-2005(a)(1), (2) (2001). \"An intelligence quotient of 70 or below on an individually administered, scientifically recognized standardized intelligence quotient test administered by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist is evidence of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning,\" under the statute, but \"it is not sufficient, without evidence of significant limitations in adaptive functioning and without evidence of manifestation before the age of 18, to establish that the defendant is mentally retarded.\" N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-2005(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2005, the state MAR court held a full evidentiary hearing on Richardson's intellectual disability claim. The MAR court considered four IQ scores, but only two were admissible as qualifying scores-an IQ score of 73 in 1995, and an IQ score of 74 in 2004. The court also considered expert testimony regarding the effect the standard error of measurement (\"SEM\"), Flynn effect and practice effect may have had upon Richardson's IQ scores, as well as lay and expert testimony about his limitations in adaptive functioning. The state MAR court found that Richardson had failed to establish either of the requisite prongs and denied his claim on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In his petition for a writ of certiorari to the North Carolina Supreme Court, Richardson argued that the MAR court, in deciding the first prong of the statutory test, \"employ[ed] an overly restrictive construction of \u00a7 15A-2005, one that is contrary to the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 420. Specifically, Richardson argued that the MAR court \"fail[ed] to take into consideration the Flynn effect, the practice effect or the standard error of measurement,\" J.A. 432, and erred in \"consider[ing] only the numerical value obtained on [the] two [qualifying] IQ tests,\" J.A. 434. With regard to the second prong of the statutory test, Richardson argued that the MAR court improperly assessed his adaptive functioning and rendered factual findings that were contrary to the evidence. The Supreme Court of North Carolina denied review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12642013,12642014,12642015\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/667/272/\">\n    667 S.E.2d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.C. 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Richardson then filed an application for federal habeas relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), challenging the reasonableness of the state court's adjudication of his intellectual disability claim. With regard to the first prong-the state court's assessment of Richardson's general intellectual functioning-Richardson again argued that the state court had \"employ[ed] an overly restrictive construction of \u00a7 15A-2005, one that is contrary to the Eighth Amendment as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Atkins v. Virginia\n   </em>\n   .\" J.A. 777. Richardson argued that the \"state court appear[ed] to have given weight only to the numbers obtained on the [IQ] tests, rather than interpreting all of the data to arrive at [Richardson's] true IQ,\" J.A. 754, and failed to adjust the scores based upon \"the Flynn effect, the practice effect, and the standard error of measurement,\" J.A. at 743. With regard to the second prong-the state court's determination that he had failed to prove significant limitations in two or more of the ten adaptive skill areas-Richardson argued that the state\n   court's findings were based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The district court reviewed the evidence that Richardson presented to the state court, including the expert testimony on the effect of the SEM, Flynn effect and practice effect on IQ scores, and the lay and expert testimony regarding Richardson's adaptive skills. Of particular relevance to this appeal, the district court observed that Dr. Hazelrigg, the mental health expert for the State, had \"found petitioner was impaired in some of the adaptive skills areas, but ultimately concluded [he] was not mentally retarded.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. Branker,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3807945\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/769/896/#p926\">\n    769 F. Supp. 2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 926 (E.D.N.C. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based upon this evidence, the district court held that the state court's determination that Richardson had failed to prove significant subaverage intellectual functioning was not an unreasonable application of the law in\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   or an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. In doing so, the district court considered all of the evidence-including the testimony regarding the SEM, the practice effect, and the Flynn effect on Richardson's IQ scores, and testimony regarding Richardson's adaptive skills and intellectual disability-and held that Richardson:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   has not shown the state court clearly erred or acted unreasonably under the circumstances so as to warrant this court substituting its judgment. While this court does not discount factors such as the standard error of measurement, Flynn effect, or practice effect in assessing I.Q. scores, there is no requirement under N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-2005 for a court to adjust a defendant's IQ scores\n   <em>\n    downward\n   </em>\n   for such factors. The state court heard all of the evidence, including testimony on each of these factors, and\n   <em>\n    was entitled to consider and weigh these factors in assessing whether petitioner carried his burden of showing an I.Q. of 70 or below\n   </em>\n   . Notably, in assessing petitioner's I.Q. score of 73, Dr. John Gorman ... concluded petitioner was not mentally retarded, but was functioning at the borderline level of intellect. Similarly, Dr. Hazelrigg ... concluded petitioner was not mentally retarded and is not now mentally retarded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3807945\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/769/896/#p926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3807945\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/769/896/#p926\">\n    at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). \"Ultimately, in light of all of the evidence presented, including [the IQ test scores] and the expert opinions of Drs.

First, and unlike in Florida, \"[t]he North Carolina Supreme Court has not interpreted North Carolina's statute to preclude consideration of the [SEM] or to limit the introduction of evidence if the threshold showing of an IQ score of 70 or below has not been met.\" J.A. 1234. Accordingly, the court held, North Carolina's statute could be and had been \"interpreted consistently with\n   <em>\n    Atkins.\n   </em>\n   \" J.A. 1234.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, and unlike Hall, Richardson\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   been \"allowed to present evidence of his alleged deficits in adaptive functioning in a full evidentiary hearing without restriction,\" as well as evidence \"on the standard error of measurement,\" J.A. 1234, and the state court had \"considered all of Richardson's IQ test scores, without limitation, as well as evidence of his alleged limitations in adaptive functioning.\" J.A. 1234-35.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   At his evidentiary hearing, Richardson was allowed to present evidence and argument on the standard error of measurement. The State's expert witness also testified regarding the standard error of measurement. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Hall,\n   </em>\n   this Court did not restrict the evidence presented about the application of the standard error of measurement and has already considered that evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Richardson was also not precluded from presenting evidence of his alleged limitations in adaptive functioning. The State argued at the outset of the hearing that Richardson should have to show an IQ score of 70 or below before being granted an opportunity to present evidence at the hearing. After rejecting the State's argument to limit the presentation, this Court proceeded to conduct a full evidentiary hearing wherein Richardson was allowed to present evidence of alleged significant limitations in adaptive functioning,\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   J.A. 1235. Thus, the court held that\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   did not alter the court's prior determination that Richardson was not intellectually disabled and, by allowing Richardson to present evidence on the SEM and his adaptive functioning, it had, in effect, \"already interpreted North Carolina's law consistently with\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\"\n   </em>\n   J.A. 1235.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the state court rejected Richardson's intellectual disability claim again on the merits, and even in light of his proffered new evidence. The court held that \"Richardson has provided no evidence to support this Court finding him intellectually disabled.\" J.A. 1235. In particular, Dr. Hazelrigg's opinion that Richardson is not intellectually disabled \"remains consistent\" with his prior opinion, and \"nothing from\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Florida\n   </em>\n   , or developments in the field of mental health has affected his conclusion that Richardson is not intellectually disabled.\" J.A. 1236 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The North Carolina Supreme Court denied review,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This is the same claim (and essentially the identical argument) that he presented to the district court in 2011. Richardson's new argument was that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   \"must be applied retroactively to [his] case,\" J.A. 1119 n.6, and that the \"change in law wrought by\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   \" was an extraordinary circumstance warranting Rule 60(b)(6) relief from the district court's 2011 final judgment denying his claim on the merits, J.A. 1122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   One can hardly imagine a second or successive habeas application that is so poorly disguised as a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.

In other words, Richardson attempts to shoehorn this purported \"error\" in the district court's rejection of his claim on the merits in 2011 into a plausible argument (under\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ) that the district court failed to\n   <em>\n    resolve\n   </em>\n   the merits of his intellectual disability claim on the first go round. Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Richardson's new ground for Rule 60(b) relief, raised for the first time on appeal, cannot validate the district court's erroneous exercise of jurisdiction over the Rule 60(b) motion as presented.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winestock,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100241\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/200/#p205\">\n    340 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"it would be inappropriate for us to let the decision of the district court stand, because it was entered without jurisdiction\"). Nor is it a legitimate, alternative ground for affirming the district court's grant of Rule 60(b) relief. It does not rely upon the same purported defect in the original habeas proceedings, the same clearly-established Supreme Court precedent, or the same change in substantive law that was relied upon by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Richardson's new ground for Rule 60(b)(6) relief also does not fall within\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez's\n   </em>\n   narrow exception to \u00a7 2244 's limitations. In\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court provided quite clear guidance for distinguishing between a true Rule 60(b) motion and a disguised \u00a7 2254 petition. The Court repeatedly focuses the threshold inquiry on whether the district court denied the habeas petitioner's constitutional claim\n   <em>\n    on the merits\n   </em>\n   under \u00a7 2254(d), or whether the district court's prior dismissal of the habeas claim was based upon a\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   ruling that\n   <em>\n    precluded\n   </em>\n   the court from reaching the merits of the constitutional claim under \u00a7 2254(d). This quite basic, and understandable, merits/nonmerits distinction permeates the\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   opinion, and it does not support Richardson's argument that he can reopen the final judgment denying his federal habeas claim on the merits under \u00a7 2254(d), based upon a clarification of substantive law or a subsequently-discovered error.

It does not affect the finality of the judgment denying the claim on the merits, or change the fact that the habeas petitioner, if he subsequently tries to remedy an error via a Rule 60(b) motion, is still asking for a \"second chance to have the merits determined favorably.\"\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209485\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/524/#p529\">\n    545 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   532 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209485\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/524/#p529\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the district court erred in its interpretation of state law at all in 2011, it was an error that was required to be raised and addressed on direct appeal from the district court's judgment.

But he is not entitled to circumvent the statutory limitations on second or successive habeas petitions under \u00a7 2244(b), and reopen the federal court's final judgment denying his habeas claim on the merits under Rule 60(b),\n   based upon\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   or the 2015 state court decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In the end, \"[n]o matter how much lipstick [Richardson] applies to this particular pig, it is still a pig-that is to say, a [claim] for habeas\" relief,\n   <em>\n    Day v.

Despite Richardson's protestations to the contrary, his Rule 60(b) motion filed in district court asserted that his previous claim of intellectual disability was wrongly decided on the merits based upon\n   <em>\n    Hall,\n   </em>\n   and his new ground for Rule 60(b) relief asserts that his previous claim of intellectual disability was wrongly decided on the merits based upon the state court's 2015 decision. As\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   makes, clear, these are habeas claims not properly brought in a Rule 60(b) motion. If Richardson is to have a second chance to litigate the merits of his intellectual disability claim, he must get it under \u00a7 2244(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court's order granting relief under Rule 60(b) and remand the case with instructions to dismiss the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The underlying facts and procedural history of this case are fully set forth in our prior decisions in\n    <em>\n     Richardson v.

Neither the district court nor this court were tasked with reviewing Richardson's intellectual disability claim\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    under state law or federal law. We were tasked first with deciding whether the state court's determination that Richardson failed to prove significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, based upon the clearly established law in\n    <em>\n     Atkins\n    </em>\n    and the evidence presented, was reasonable. And because that decision was reasonable, in light of all of the evidence, there was no need to address Richardson's\n    <em>\n     separate\n    </em>\n    challenges to the reasonableness of the state court's factual findings that Richardson had failed to prove significant limitations in two or more of ten adaptive skill areas as required by the second prong.
