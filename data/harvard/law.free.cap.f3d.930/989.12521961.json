We conclude that the appeal is moot, because Owen was released from prison while this appeal was pending, and his \u00a7 2255 motion challenged only the length of his now-completed prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2004, Owen pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm as a previously convicted felon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The district court applied a sentencing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), based on six prior convictions for Missouri second-degree burglary. The court sentenced\n   Owen as an armed career criminal to 188 months' imprisonment and three years of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.

He argued that, in light of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , his six Missouri burglary convictions no longer qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA. The district court denied the motion, concluding that three of Owen's burglary convictions still qualified as violent felonies under the enumerated-offenses clause of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Owen filed a notice of appeal on November 13, 2017, and he disputes the court's determination that he was an armed career criminal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Owen does not contend that he suffers any collateral consequence from the expired term of imprisonment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Juvenile Male\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331745,12450506\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/932/\">\n    564 U.S. 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331745,12450506\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/932/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331745,12450506\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/932/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (per curiam), but he asserts that there is still a live case or controversy arising from his continued term of supervised release. He suggests that if he were to prevail on the merits of this appeal, then the district court on remand would have discretion to impose a shorter term of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), 3559(a)(3), 3583(a), (b)(2) ; USSG \u00a7 5D1.2(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We conclude that the appeal is moot because Owen's \u00a7 2255 motion challenged only his term of imprisonment, which has now expired; he did not dispute the term of supervised release. Owen's motion explained that he had \"served in excess of 144 months as of the date of this petition\" and was \"eligible for immediate release if sentenced within his correct statutory maximum.\" R. Doc. 23, at 2. Owen's prayer for relief requested only \"that his sentence be vacated and that he be re-sentenced to a\n   <em>\n    term of months within the applicable statutory maximum of ten years\n   </em>\n   and his corrected Guideline range.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Owen's memorandum in support of his motion likewise requested only \"that his sentence be vacated and that he be re-sentenced to a\n   <em>\n    term of months\n   </em>\n   within the corrected statutory maximum and Guideline range.\" R. Doc. 23-1, at 4 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Owen insists that he did challenge the term of supervised release and points to statements in which he requested generically that the court vacate his \"sentence\" and re-sentence him. Although a term of supervised release is \"a part of the sentence,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), Owen did not seek relief with respect to that aspect of his sentence in this case. He argued exclusively for a reduced term of imprisonment and release from prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Now that Owen has been released from prison, the court cannot grant any effectual remedy, because Owen has obtained all of the relief that he sought. There is thus no ongoing case or controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lane v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307106\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/624/#p631\">\n    455 U.S. 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 631, 633,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307106\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/624/#p631\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11307106\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/624/#p631\">\n    71 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ;\n   <em>\n    Conservation Force, Inc. v.

Cir. 2013). The mere fact that Owen is serving an unexpired,\n   <em>\n    unchallenged\n   </em>\n   term of supervised release does not sustain an actual controversy.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

App'x 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756 (10th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Owen cites authorities holding that an appeal is not moot where a resentencing court would have discretion to reduce a\n   pending term of supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Abu Nahia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3492866\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/230/641/#p641\">\n    230 F.

But none of those decisions addresses a situation where the movant did not seek relief from the term of supervised release. Owen also cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rhone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049936\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/777/\">\n    647 F.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2011), where an appeal continued after the appellant was released from prison but was serving a term of supervised release. The appellant in\n   <em>\n    Rhone\n   </em>\n   challenged an underlying revocation of a previous term of supervised release that resulted in a longer term of supervised release in the new sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049936\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/777/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049936\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/777/\">\n    at 778-79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779 n.2. In that situation, the\n   <em>\n    revocation itself\n   </em>\n   had \"continuing consequences,\" even though the appellant had been released from prison, so the appeal of the revocation decision was not moot.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049936\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/647/777/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 779 n.2. Owen, by contrast, did not challenge his underlying conviction; he challenged only the term of imprisonment that has now expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For these reasons, Owen's appeal is dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The Honorable Ralph R.
