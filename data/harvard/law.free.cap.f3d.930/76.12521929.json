Plantronics executives deleted emails relevant to the litigation and instructed others to do the same. Many of these emails were unrecoverable, prompting GN to move for default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37. The District Court acted within its discretion when it denied the motion for default judgment, instead instructing the jurors that they were permitted to draw an adverse inference against Plantronics because of the missing emails. However, the District Court committed reversible error when it excluded GN's expert testimony on the scope of Plantronics' spoliation. Accordingly, we will affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   GN and Plantronics manufacture telephone audio headsets used by individuals who work in customer service. They have nearly equal market share globally. Plantronics is U.S.-based and \"holds an 80%-83% market share\" in North America, App. 1398, while GN is based in Europe and controls the market outside North America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plantronics began selling its headsets in the United States in the 1960s, the first of their kind on the market. GN began its U.S.-based operations in 1987. In 2000, it acquired Jabra and began selling Jabra's headsets, which serve the same market as Plantronics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties sell their headsets to customers through distributors. Plantronics has a Plantronics-Only Distributor (\"POD\") program, which is a voluntary program designed to foster relationships and create joint marketing efforts with distributors. A distributor that joins the program becomes a \"POD\" and receives incentives such as \"favorable credit terms,\" \"marketing funds in the form of rebates,\" and \"website support.\" App. 1306. In exchange, PODs agree to two terms. First, they may not purchase headsets directly from other manufacturers, but may do so indirectly (such as from other distributors). Second, PODs are not\n   allowed to market competitors' products on resellers' websites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   GN sent Plantronics a demand letter in May 2012 and filed suit in October 2012, alleging that Plantronics' POD program constituted monopolization in \"violation[ ] of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and Delaware common law.\" App. 110. When it received the demand letter, Plantronics \"promptly issued a litigation hold to relevant employees and provided training sessions to ensure compliance.\" App. 7. When the lawsuit was filed, Plantronics updated the hold, held more training sessions, and sent quarterly reminders requiring acknowledgment of compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   GN alleges that Plantronics committed large-scale spoliation after the lawsuit was filed. Despite the litigation hold, Plantronics' Senior Vice President of Sales, Don Houston, instructed Plantronics employees to delete certain emails that referenced Plantronics' competitive practices or its competitors, particularly those concerning GN or its products. As the District Court noted, the evidence reflects at least three instances of such spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, in November 2012, about a month after GN filed its lawsuit, Houston replied to an email chain stating, \"Team, please be careful about competitive statements like what was said below. I would suggest everyone immediately delete this message.\" App. 184. In October 2013, Houston sent an email stating, \"Given the sensitive nature of this issue and the on going legal issues, please delete this entire string of emails for everyone that has been copied ASAP!\" App. 178. Houston admitted that the only legal issue he was aware of was the lawsuit filed by GN. The underlying email chain referenced a distributor who met with a Jabra representative and began selling Jabra headsets to one of its customers, who previously used only Plantronics headsets. One email in the chain stated, \"I was under the impression [redacted distributor] was a POD distributor and could not sell Jabra,\" and another employee stated he \"want[ed] to be absolutely sure of the facts before I confront [redacted distributor].\" App. 178, 180. Houston and two others, Roy Meadows and Jose Gonzalez, deleted the email chain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February or March 2014, Plantronics' Associate General Counsel, Peggy Fawcett, learned of Houston's conduct and took several actions in response, including instituting a litigation hold on Houston's assistant, in case she had duplicate emails, and requesting back-up tapes of Houston's email account. Plantronics engaged BlackStone Discovery, its discovery vendor, and Stroz Friedberg, a leading forensics expert, to try to recover as many of Houston's emails as possible. Stroz recovered some of the emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The spoliation, however, continued. In April 2014, for a third time, Houston instructed employees to delete emails: \"Team this is an inappropriate email, please delete immediately. Bill should call Lou Ann directly for any information relating to competition or a competitive situation!!!\" App. 181.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition to instructing others to delete emails, Houston deleted his own emails. He deleted \"more than 40% of his emails from\" November 2013 to February 2014. App. 9. He took the next step of \"double-delet[ing]\" them by emptying his deleted-files folder so that he would not be able to recover them. App. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Houston did not act alone. Plantronics executives took other actions to hide relevant information from GN. For instance, a senior Plantronics manager asked sales team members to use code words to refer to competitors, including \"zebra\" for GN. At an \"All Hands\" meeting with marketing employees, Plantronics' CEO, Ken Kannappan,\n   stated that he was \"not positive that there were not damning statements in a variety [of] staff emails that [GN's] legal team would dig up that would be 'emotionally relevant' in court.\" App. 325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plantronics' efforts to undo the spoliation fell short. BlackStone Discovery confirmed that Meadows and Gonzalez had deleted at least one email chain, but Plantronics never obtained the backup tapes to determine whether they had deleted any other emails. Stroz, the forensics expert, provided Plantronics with \"preliminary findings\" that were a \"work in progress,\" but stated that it would cost Plantronics two to five thousand more dollars for the firm to complete its analysis. App. 11. Plantronics did not have Stroz complete its analysis; it instead destroyed the back-up tapes of Houston's emails. At an April 2015 hearing, Plantronics told the District Court that \"there is no [Stroz] report,\" App. 246, despite Stroz providing its preliminary findings months before. In addition, the same lawyer who stated that there was no report had previously listed work on the \"Stroz report\" in billing entries. App. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Stroz's preliminary findings included a determination that Houston had deleted between 36,397 and 90,574 unrecoverable emails, 2380 to 5887 of which were likely responsive to GN's discovery requests. While some of those emails were likely produced by other employees, Stroz estimated that 952 to 2354 of those emails were permanently missing and could not be recovered from other Plantronics employees' accounts or backups. GN's expert, Dan Gallivan, concluded that Stroz's estimates were conservative; Gallivan independently determined that ten to fifteen thousand of Houston's deleted emails were relevant to the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During depositions, Plantronics executives, including Houston and Kannappan, were either forgetful or dishonest. In his July 2014 deposition, Houston acknowledged asking others to delete emails, but stated he could not remember deleting his own emails. And though Plantronics had admitted knowing about Houston's deletions at the time of his deposition, its outside counsel emailed GN's outside counsel after the deposition, stating, \"It is incorrect to assume deletion as you suggest,\" because Houston had testified that he did not remember. App. 187.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At a subsequent deposition in September 2015, Houston testified that he thought the IT department saved all emails and that he was not instructing employees to delete emails to hide them, but because he did not \"want the dialogue to continue.\" App. 202. On more than one occasion, Kannappan testified that all of Houston's emails were recovered. The reports from Plantronics' discovery and forensic experts contradicted that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Two months after Houston's second deposition, GN moved for a default liability judgment in light of the spoliation. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing and found that Plantronics acted in \"bad faith\" with an \"intent to deprive GN\" of documents, App. 33, but nevertheless denied the motion. Instead of default judgment, the court opted to issue a permissive adverse inference instruction to the jury at trial, fine Plantronics three million dollars, and order it to pay GN's spoliation-related fees. In choosing a permissive instruction rather than a mandatory one, the court reasoned that \"[a] jury should resolve the genuine disputes of material fact in this case.\" App. 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   GN subsequently sought to present evidence of spoliation at trial, including testimony from its expert, Gallivan. The District Court denied this request, citing a desire to reduce \"the risk of spoliation taking over\" the trial and \"the risk of\n   unfair prejudice given the inflammatory nature of the evidence.\" App. 1044. Instead, the court decided to read \"stipulations\" to the jury and limit parties to referencing only the facts in those stipulations during trial. App. 1043-44. After considering proposals from both parties, the District Court settled on seventeen stipulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At trial, GN proceeded on claims of monopolization, attempted monopolization, and concerted action in restraint of trade under the Sherman and Clayton Acts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial lasted for six days. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plantronics, finding that GN proved a relevant market-a prerequisite for its claims-but did not prove all of the elements for any of its three antitrust claims. GN moved for a new trial, but the District Court denied the motion. GN appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District Court had federal question jurisdiction over GN's antitrust claims under the Sherman and Clayton Acts and supplemental jurisdiction over the related state law tortious interference claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1367.

Houston deliberately deleted an unknown number of emails in response to \"pending litigation\" and urged others to do the same. Plantronics executives, including its CEO, were not truthful during depositions. And the company was not willing to spend a nominal fee for its expert, Stroz, to fully assess the spoliation and create a final report. Each of these actions was an intentional step to interfere with GN's prosecution of its claims against Plantronics. Therefore, the District Court reasonably concluded that Plantronics acted in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Likewise, the District Court reasonably determined that the spoliation prejudiced GN. When a party moving for spoliation sanctions cannot offer \"plausible, concrete suggestions as to what [the lost] evidence might have been,\" there should be no finding of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834632\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/76/#p79\">\n    13 F.3d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the case here. It is undisputed that there is some number of emails that were deleted and will never be recovered. GN has plausibly suggested that those emails might contain, among other things, important information on the number of PODs and evidence of coercion of PODs. Indeed, Plantronics' own CEO stated that there may have been \"damning statements\" in some of the emails. We will never know whether those damning statements exist or if one or more of them would have been integral to GN's case, but GN has provided plausible, concrete suggestions as to what that evidence might have been. Plantronics employees' spoliation, its executives' false testimony, and its failure to pay Stroz to complete its report prejudiced GN.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having found that Plantronics acted in bad faith and GN was prejudiced, the District Court determined that a lesser sanction than default judgment could avoid substantial unfairness while also deterring misconduct by future litigants. The court thoroughly examined alternatives to default judgment and provided due consideration to their fairness and deterrent value, and it committed no error of law or assessment of fact in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   GN argues that the weight of authority from district courts and circuits around the country demands that the District Court enter default judgment in its favor. In support, GN offers a laundry list of cases where district courts granted dispositive sanctions and our sister circuits affirmed the harshest sanction. GN argues that in some of these cases, the spoliation was less extensive than what occurred here, but the result was a dispositive sanction. However, the notion that a list of selected cases mandates default judgment ignores that a district court's inquiry is intensely fact-specific. Several cases that GN cites involve destruction of the most critical evidence, resulting in irreparable prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Flury v. Daimler Chrysler Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241091\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/939/#p943\">\n    427 F.3d 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 943 (11th Cir. 2005) (dismissing crashworthiness action where plaintiff allowed vehicle to be sold for salvage before the defendant could inspect it);\n   <em>\n    Silvestri v.

The destroyed evidence is not so clearly central or critical here. While the emails may have contained information about additional PODs, helping to prove a piece of GN's antitrust suit, any deleted emails are not as central as a vehicle in a crashworthiness case, and are certainly not the \"sole piece of evidence.\" Moreover, while the District Court was free to look to cases from other circuits to inform its analysis, our sister circuits have carved out their own tests for the appropriateness of dispositive sanctions, and those tests are not necessarily identical to the three considerations we laid out in\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   GN points in particular to\n   <em>\n    Telectron, Inc. v.

In this case, Houston is not a lawyer, and the District Court found that his innocuous explanation for his deletion directive was \"somewhat plausible,\" App. 21, suggesting that Houston's conduct was not as culpable as in\n   <em>\n    Telectron\n   </em>\n   . And, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Telectron\n   </em>\n   and other cases where the court ordered dispositive sanctions, Plantronics' counsel took steps to remedy Houston's spoliation the moment she learned of it. GN's proffer of cases where there was \"less\" spoliation and the courts granted dispositive sanctions only serves to highlight that these decisions are extremely fact-dependent and that there can be no bright-line rule regarding what degree or percentage of destroyed documents warrants default judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The District Court appropriately relied on the principle that a dispositive sanction \"is a last resort and should be imposed if no alternative remedy is available.\" App. 35 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Magnetar Techs.

Through that lens, the court devoted four pages of its opinion to considering whether a package of lesser sanctions would avoid substantial unfairness to GN and would deter future misconduct. It determined that, because some of the relevant emails were recovered, a permissive adverse inference instruction would be effective as it would allow the jury to see the types of recovered emails and draw conclusions about what the deleted emails contained. Along with the instruction, the court permitted GN to propose other evidentiary sanctions for the court's consideration. And, both to punish Plantronics and to deter misconduct of this nature by future litigants further, the court levied punitive sanctions and costs on Plantronics to the tune of nearly five million dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   There was no error of fact or law in the District Court's examination of whether lesser sanctions would be appropriate under\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   , nor in its decision to impose a package of sanctions in lieu of default judgment. GN asks for nothing more than a different conclusion based on our consideration of the same facts and law that the District Court examined. That is not the standard.

Under both the abuse of discretion standard and\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard, we conclude that Gallivan's testimony should have been admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As a threshold matter, Gallivan's proposed testimony is undoubtedly relevant under the Rule 401 definition. The District Court's permissive adverse inference instruction made Plantronics' spoliation a material issue for the jury to consider at trial, so any spoliation-related evidence clears the baseline relevance hurdle of Rules 401 and 402. To exclude Gallivan's relevant testimony, then, the evidence must confuse the issues, mislead the jury, cause undue delay, waste time, be unfairly prejudicial, and/or needlessly present cumulative evidence, and the negative impact of any of those conditions must substantially outweigh the evidence's probative value. It does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We must first examine the probative value of the proposed evidence. As proffered, Gallivan's proposed testimony would have tended to show that the scope of Houston's spoliation was more significant than Plantronics had represented, thereby helping the jury decide whether to draw an adverse inference-as it was instructed it could do. The District Court explicitly chose to put certain issues of material fact, such as whether Plantronics engaged in a \"massive cover-up to hide antitrust violations,\" App. 34, in the jury's hands. By withholding evidence regarding the scope of the spoliation, the court deprived the jury of the ability to make an informed decision about the adverse inference, and the instruction was less effective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v. Union Pac. R.R. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297041\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/739/#p750\">\n    354 F.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750 (8th Cir. 2004) (holding that without relevant evidence related to missing information, \"the jury is deprived of sufficient information on which to base a rational decision of whether to apply the adverse inference\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Gallivan could have helped provide the jury with a fuller picture. For instance, GN proffers that Gallivan would have testified that Stroz's analytical techniques resulted in an incorrect estimate on the number of relevant emails Houston deleted-and that, in fact, Houston deleted up to five times more relevant emails than Plantronics reported. GN also argues that Gallivan would have provided the jury with a crucial expert opinion on why his estimates, rather than Stroz's, were correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   That fuller picture could have had an impact on the merits of GN's antitrust claims. For instance, GN was required to prove that Plantronics coerced distributors to enter into POD agreements and to remain PODs. Houston was a key player in the administration of the POD program. He deleted and encouraged others to delete at least one email chain that suggested Plantronics employees confronted PODs that purchased or even talked with competitors. If Plantronics employees made similar statements regularly, or directly pressured distributors via email, it is very likely that Houston would have been included on or forwarded the email. Whether Houston deleted hundreds of emails or thousands may have impacted the jury's conclusion on how many similar email chains were lost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The dissent minimizes the probative value of Gallivan's testimony by listing five stipulations that could have helped the jury draw an inference about the degree of Plantronics' spoliation. However, none of the five proffered stipulations materially address the scope of spoliation or render Gallivan's testimony superfluous. Indeed, the only stipulation on the scope that the District Court read to the jury casts more uncertainty on the number of deleted relevant emails: \"[I]t may be that several hundred or even up to 15,000 potentially responsive relevant emails were deleted or destroyed.\" App. 1315. This vagueness left the jury to consider estimates that were not even in the same ballpark, with no additional information as to which ballpark was more likely and why. Gallivan would have provided that additional information. He would have testified that Stroz's methodology was flawed, leading to a low estimate of 2380 to 5887 unrecoverable relevant emails, and he would have asserted that between 10,000 and 15,000 unrecoverable relevant emails were deleted. The two experts' estimates are not close, and, counter to both experts estimates, the above-referenced stipulation broadens the ranger further yet to state that only \"several hundred\" relevant emails may have been destroyed. The difference from several hundred to 15,000 could easily have been the difference between applying the adverse inference and not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Gallivan's expert testimony would have assisted the jury in narrowing that range, giving it evidence on which it could base an important decision: whether Plantronics engaged in a \"massive cover-up.\" Without Gallivan's testimony, it is possible, if not entirely probable, that jurors concluded that only a few hundred emails were deleted, falling short of a massive cover-up; however, if they had evidence that fifteen, five, or even just one thousand emails had been deleted, they might have taken a very different view on whether to apply the adverse inference. If found credible by the jury, Gallivan's testimony would have made a material fact in dispute-whether Plantronics engaged in a massive cover-up-more likely to be true. And, in fact, Gallivan's testimony could have assisted the jury in making its determination on some of the antitrust claim issues, such as whether Plantronics' POD arrangements were coercive. The \"maximum reasonable probative force\" of his testimony was high; therefore, the District Court could have properly excluded it only if that probative value was substantially outweighed by the evidence's potential prejudice or by other risks outlined in Rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Gallivan's testimony did not carry risks that would substantially outweigh its probative value. First, Gallivan's testimony would not have been likely to confuse the issues or mislead the jury. The jury was presented with significant instruction by the District Court on the permissive adverse inference, along with seventeen spoliation stipulations. Adding the testimony would have provided additional evidence to expound upon the stipulations and increase the jury's understanding of the situation, rather than confuse or mislead. And, if confusion or misdirection was a concern, the court could have provided a limiting instruction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McQueeney v. Wilmington Tr. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1539635\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/779/916/\">\n    779 F.2d 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 n.8 (3d Cir. 1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Likewise, Gallivan's testimony would not have caused undue delay or wasted time. GN estimated that it would only need about a half hour for direct examination of Gallivan at trial. Even if that were overly optimistic, and even if cross took the same amount of time as direct, Gallivan's testimony would have required a couple of hours out of a six-day trial. Given the probative value of the testimony, this would not have constituted \"undue delay\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   or a \"waste\" of the court's or the parties' time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Gallivan's testimony would not have been unnecessarily cumulative. Instead, it would have added to and further explained the seventeen stipulations that the District Court read to the jury. It would not have simply rehashed those stipulations, but provided information to help the jury decide in favor of or against adopting the adverse inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Further, though the testimony could have had some prejudicial effect, that prejudice would not have been unfair. The testimony about Plantronics' employees deleting emails relevant to the litigation might color the jury's opinion of Plantronics and prejudice its view of the company on issues unrelated to spoliation, and additional trial time spent on spoliation dilutes the amount of the trial devoted directly to the merits of GN's antitrust claims.

In excluding that evidence, the District Court stated only that it was concerned that live testimony would be inflammatory and prejudicial without offering specifics. The dissent correctly notes that we are highly deferential to a district court's conclusion on whether to admit evidence under FRE 403.

Moreover, GN seems to suggest that the absence of Don Houston's emails did not prevent it from winning on the merits-a further indication that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by declining to impose default judgment against Plantronics.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmid v.

By asserting that only default judgment was appropriate, GN effectively contends that the Court, not the jury, should have conclusively decided the extent of the prejudice GN suffered from the spoliation. The jury, however, was the factfinder, and therefore it was permissible for the District Court to entrust this assessment to the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blinzler v.

Contrary to GN's suggestion, the weight of authority in fact supports the District Court's choice of a permissive adverse inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834632\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/76/#p79\">\n    13 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   79 ;\n   <em>\n    Beaven v.

And other courts' decisions to impose mandatory adverse inferences hardly means that the District Court abused its discretion here. \"Whether an adverse inference is permissive or mandatory is determined on a case-by-case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Flagg v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047719\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/715/165/#p178\">\n    715 F.3d 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178 (6th Cir. 2013). Finally, GN is wrong to contend that a mandatory adverse inference was necessary because the spoliation evidence in the record was inadequate for the jury to rationally decide whether to adopt the permissive adverse inference. As explained in Part II below, the Court gave the jury a sufficient evidentiary basis to decide whether it should adopt the permissive inference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Without a doubt, Plantronics deserves to be called out for its substantial discovery misconduct in this case. It repeatedly flouted its obligations as a litigant, depriving GN of discovery and failing to take all reasonable steps to preserve responsive electronically stored information. As the District Court found and the majority rightly concludes, Plantronics acted in bad faith. The question for the District Court then became: what to do about it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   I dissent from the majority's conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion in declining to admit Dan Gallivan's testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. In my view, the majority makes two errors. First, it minimizes the information regarding the extent of Plantronics's spoliation that the District Court provided to the jury via the stipulations. These stipulations gave the jury an adequate basis to decide whether to adopt the permissive adverse inference. Second, the majority fails to give the required deference to the District Court's reasonable conclusions that Gallivan's spoliation testimony posed a substantial risk of distracting the jury from the antitrust merits of the case and that such risk eclipsed the testimony's probative value. In sum, not only do I fail to detect error, I commend the District Judge for his innovative and effective exercise of case-management discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Schiff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3919909\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/152/#p176\">\n    602 F.3d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting that district courts have \"broad discretion\" to engage in \"case management both before and during trial\"). By remanding, the majority not only sets the stage for another antitrust trial but probably for a not-so-mini spoliation trial as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The tried and true abuse-of-discretion standard governs our review of the District Court's evidentiary ruling because by implicitly weighing the probative value of Gallivan's proposed testimony and explicitly considering the risks of its admission, the District Court performed a Rule 403 balancing analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ansell v. Green Acres Contracting Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048792\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/347/515/#p525\">\n    347 F.3d 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525 (3d Cir. 2003). When the District Court made its Rule 403 determination, it had Gallivan's report containing the details of his proposed testimony. The Court implicitly considered the probative value of Gallivan's testimony by concluding that the parties should agree to \"stipulations\" regarding the spoliation evidence in place of witness testimony. The Court explained its calculus that the value of spoliation testimony was outweighed by the risk that such testimony would confuse the jury and result in jurors deciding to punish Plantronics for its spoliation instead of deciding this case on its merits. Because the abuse-of-discretion standard governs our review of the Court's decision to exclude Gallivan's testimony, we should not reverse unless we have \"a definite and firm conviction that the court ... committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cendant Corp. Prides Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11173247\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/188/#p192\">\n    233 F.3d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 192 (3d Cir. 2000) (alternation in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In my view, GN has failed to satisfy this highly deferential standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To be sure, Gallivan's testimony would have had non-negligible probative value, but the District Court read five stipulations to the jury that provided a basis for drawing a reasonable inference about the degree of Plantronics's spoliation (whether it was closer to \"several hundred\" or \"15,000\" deleted relevant emails that Plantronics did not recover\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). App. 1315. All five of\n   the following stipulations signaled to the jury that it could find reason to mistrust Plantronics's representations regarding its discovery misconduct and therefore infer that Plantronics's spoliation was at the higher end of the range:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (1) \"At least part of the motivation for the e-mail deletion was to deprive GN of evidence to use in this litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11173247\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/233/188/#p192\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (2) \"By one estimate, 482 of the 487 e-mails containing the term 'GN' or 'Jabra' [the name that GN uses for its headsets] were missing from the initial collection of Mr. Houston's emails.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9297041\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/739/#p750\">\n    354 F.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750 (8th Cir. 2004). Here, the stipulations provided the jury with sufficient evidence to reach an informed judgment about the degree of Plantronics's spoliation and thereby fulfill its fundamental responsibility to draw inferences based on the record.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11942881\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/1061/#p1071\">\n    100 F.3d 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1071-72 (3d Cir. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

I fail to see how this record provides a basis for the majority to form a definite and firm conviction that the jury lacked enough information to draw a reasonable inference concerning the extent of Plantronics's spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In addition, the majority does not accord appropriate deference to the District Court's conclusion that admitting Gallivan's testimony posed a significant risk that the jury's focus would be shifted from the merits of the antitrust case they had been sworn to decide. This is a classic example of the sort of discretionary call that trial judges are far better situated to make than those of us who are confined to reviewing a cold record. In my view, the District Court reasonably concluded that admitting Gallivan's testimony and rebuttal might result in \"spoliation taking over what is going to be an antitrust trial.\" App. 1044. And GN's antitrust claims were far from straightforward-four antitrust claims went to the jury, thereby requiring its members to make multiple findings from record evidence concerning,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , commercial decision-making and economic forces that are hardly a part of the average citizen's daily experience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was reasonable for the District Court to carefully limit the amount of spoliation evidence admitted so that the jury would focus on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While GN's lawyer\n   estimated that Gallivan's testimony would take about 30 minutes, it is highly speculative for the majority to assert that addressing spoliation would require only \"a couple of hours.\" And in any event, it is a usurpation of the trial judge's role for this Court to second guess a determination made immediately before trial regarding the appropriate quantum of evidence on an issue, albeit relevant but collateral to the merits of the antitrust case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Not only do I lack a definite and firm conviction that the District Judge erred, I consider his limitation on the admission of certain spoliation evidence to have been a sound exercise of discretion. The abuse-of-discretion standard demands that we give him the benefit of the doubt on whether to admit Gallivan's testimony. The majority fails to afford him that deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    I acknowledge the majority's statement that, on remand, the District Court may again use stipulations to encapsulate the parties' evidence regarding the extent of Plantronics's spoliation. But given the majority's conclusion that \"no application of the correct law to the facts of this case would warrant exclusion of the expert's testimony,\" it seems unavoidable that the District Court will be required on remand to permit live testimony on spoliation, leading to the mini-trial that the District Court sought to avoid.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The majority faults the District Court for unnecessarily increasing the uncertainty about the number of unrecovered relevant emails by presenting this range, but GN approved of this range in the District Court. GN's lawyer told the Court that he was \"fine\" with it informing the jury that \"it may be that several hundred or even up to 15,000 potentially responsive relevant e-mails were deleted or destroyed.\" App. 1291.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    For example, the jury had to assess whether GN established relevant geographic and product markets, whether Plantronics had market power, whether Plantronics substantially foreclosed GN from competing in the headset market, and whether Plantronics's POD agreements caused GN to lose sales.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Notwithstanding the majority's suggestion, I do not minimize the probative value of Gallivan's testimony. Rather, I conclude that the District Court permissibly determined that the risk of spoliation testimony sidetracking the jury from the case's merits outweighed this testimony's probative value.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
