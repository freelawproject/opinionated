Three years later, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") initiated removal proceedings against him based on his 2017 Virginia conviction under Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 for participation in a criminal street gang. The immigration judge (\"IJ\") determined that this Virginia offense did not categorically constitute a crime involving moral turpitude and thus could not be a basis for removing Cabrera. DHS appealed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") issued a decision holding that a Virginia conviction for participation in a criminal street gang categorically constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude. The BIA reinstated removal proceedings against Cabrera and remanded to the IJ for a determination on the\n   other statutory requirements for removal. After the IJ determined that those other elements were met and ordered Cabrera's removal, he filed a petition for review directly in this Court. We conclude, first, that we have jurisdiction over Cabrera's petition because he has exhausted his administrative remedies, and second, that the Virginia offense of participating in criminal street gang activity is not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude. We therefore grant Cabrera's petition for review, vacate the order of removal, and remand with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Virginia statute prohibiting participation in a criminal street gang states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Any person who actively participates in or is a member of a criminal street gang and who knowingly and willfully participates in any predicate criminal act committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2(A).\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-10(e) (authorizing punishment for a Class 5 felony of \"a term of imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than 10 years\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2017, Cabrera pleaded guilty to a violation of this statute, for which he was sentenced to a suspended term of imprisonment of five years. Thereafter, DHS served Cabrera with a Notice to Appear before an IJ for removal proceedings initiated under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i), which authorizes the removal of an alien who has been convicted for a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years of admission and for which a term of imprisonment of one year or longer could be imposed. DHS asserted that Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 's offense is categorically a crime \"involving moral turpitude,\" which is defined as a crime that \"not only violates a statute but also independently violates a moral norm.\"\n   <em>\n    Jimenez-Cedillo v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516309\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/292/#p294\">\n    885 F.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 (4th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The IJ terminated removal proceedings after concluding that Cabrera's conviction was not for a crime involving moral turpitude. DHS successfully appealed this decision to the BIA, which held that when an offense is committed \"in association with a gang, the reprehensibility of that act can no longer be viewed in isolation; its inherent moral character is changed-and aggravated-by its gang related nature.\" A.R. 21. The BIA further explained that Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 's requirement that the underlying offense be committed \"in association with\" a gang meant, at a minimum, that the act was committed with \"\n   <em>\n    conscious\n   </em>\n   affiliation, not mere accidental correlation\" to a gang, and thus ensured that the act was also committed with the requisite morally reprehensible state of mind to constitute a crime involving moral turpitude. A.R. 21. The BIA reinstated the proceedings against Cabrera and remanded his case to the IJ for a determination of whether Cabrera's conviction satisfied the other requirements for removability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The IJ entered an order of removal after determining that the other statutory requirements were met. That order indicates that Cabrera affirmatively waived his right to appeal the IJ's decision to the BIA, making the IJ's order a final order of removal.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (stating that an IJ's order of removal \"shall become final\" \"[u]pon waiver of appeal by the respondent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cabrera filed a timely petition for review that raised one issue: whether the\n   BIA erred in determining that the gang-related offense prohibited under Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 categorically qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before reaching the merits of Cabrera's petition, we must address our jurisdiction over this case. By statute, we have jurisdiction over final orders of removal \"only if\" \"the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). Because Congress wrote the exhaustion requirement into the jurisdictional grant to the Court for the review of removal orders, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider petitions for review when an alien has not exhausted his administrative remedies.\n   <em>\n    Massis v.

That said, no statute defines what constitutes \"exhaustion\" for purposes of \u00a7 1252(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Our case law informs the analysis of when administrative exhaustion has occurred, but the precise question raised in this case is an issue of first impression in this Circuit: was Cabrera required to appeal the IJ's order of removal to the BIA before filing his petition for review with this Court in order to exhaust his administrative remedies? That question is presented within the additional context that the sole issue raised in Cabrera's petition relates to a legal question the BIA conclusively decided earlier in his removal proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ordinarily, a petitioner exhausts his administrative remedies by raising an argument challenging the IJ's decision in an appeal to the BIA.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kporlor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221129\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/222/#p226\">\n    597 F.3d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is well established that an alien must raise each argument to the BIA before we have jurisdiction to consider it.\"). Consequently, arguments that a petitioner did not raise in the BIA proceedings have not been exhausted and the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider them.\n   <em>\n    Asika v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9264463\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/264/\">\n    362 F.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267 n.3 (4th Cir. 2004) (\"We have no jurisdiction to consider this argument, however, because [the petitioner] failed to make it before the [BIA] and, therefore, failed to exhaust all administrative remedies.\"). Only after the BIA has rendered a decision on an argument or claim is that argument or claim said to have been exhausted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lizama v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079646\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/440/#p448\">\n    629 F.3d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448-49 (4th Cir. 2011) (holding that an alien exhausted remedies by raising a claim in his notice of appeal to the BIA-even if he neglects to brief the issue-if the BIA has nonetheless addressed the issue in its decision). In sum, we have consistently held that when the BIA has never been part of a petitioner's removal proceedings we lack jurisdiction to consider the petition for review and when a petition contains an argument that has never been presented to the BIA for consideration, we lack jurisdiction to consider it even if other arguments in the petition have been exhausted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Relying on these principles, DHS contends that Cabrera did not exhaust his administrative remedies because he had the right to appeal the IJ's removal order to the BIA, but he chose to waive that right. DHS argues that the BIA must first determine whether Cabrera's removal was proper before this Court can consider Cabrera's petition for review and that his decision not to appeal directly to the BIA deprived the BIA of the opportunity to do so. In addition, DHS asserts that the BIA's earlier decision concerning Cabrera's\n   Virginia conviction did not relieve him of his obligation to appeal the removal order to the BIA because there is no futility exception to the exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Relying on the same principles, Cabrera responds that he has exhausted his administrative remedies because the BIA definitively ruled in the earlier appeal that his Virginia conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude and that ruling is the sole issue he raises in his petition for review. He observes that although this Court has not decided whether administrative remedies have been exhausted in these circumstances, three circuit courts of appeals have considered it and have unanimously held in favor of finding exhaustion. Our sister circuits have determined that a petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies when the BIA conclusively determined the issue(s) for which a petitioner seeks review even though the BIA's review occurred before a remand to the IJ and even though the petitioner did not appeal the IJ's removal order to the BIA before filing a petition for review directly with the court of appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shepherd v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3873086\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/678/1171/#p1176\">\n    678 F.3d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1176-78 (10th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Popal v.

This conclusion follows from applying several principles related to the exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the exhaustion requirement \"serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicial efficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Kurfees v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9454344\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/332/#p336\">\n    275 F.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336 (4th Cir. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kporlor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221129\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/222/#p226\">\n    597 F.3d at 226-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both objectives are served when, as is the case before us, the BIA has exercised its authority by issuing a conclusive ruling on a particular issue in the petitioner's agency proceedings and the Court knows the agency's final adjudication of the issue in the petitioner's case. Conversely, none of the traditional principles favoring exhaustion would be served by requiring a second appeal to the BIA after the IJ's final entry of the removal order when the petitioner does not challenge the decisions made in that order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Popal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937408\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/249/#p252\">\n    416 F.3d at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The issues have been fairly presented to, and fully adjudicated by, the BIA. There are no factual allegations or legal arguments before us that were not raised before the BIA. Judicial economy would not be served by requiring [the petitioner] to take a second, essentially frivolous appeal to the BIA raising the same issues that the Board had already rejected in [his] own case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the exhaustion requirement is consistently described in terms of substance rather than timing. The significant inquiry is\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   the BIA has definitively ruled on the petitioner's argument in adjudicating his case, not\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   it has done so.\n   <em>\n    Kporlor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221129\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/222/#p226\">\n    597 F.3d at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is well established that an alien must raise each argument to the BIA\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   we have jurisdiction to consider it.\" (emphasis added));\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telyatitskiy v.

Here, the BIA has definitively addressed the argument Cabrera makes in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Third, the exhaustion requirement is satisfied when the BIA has definitively spoken on a particular issue in the petitioner's case one time. Petitioners need not file a motion to reconsider the same argument the BIA has already rejected in order to exhaust their remedies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Woodford v.

Requiring Cabrera to appeal the IJ's removal order to the BIA as a mandatory prerequisite to challenge in the court of appeals the BIA's prior decision that his conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude \"would [be] the functional equivalent of\" requiring him to move to reconsider before filing a petition for review.\n   <em>\n    Perkovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525606\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/615/#p619\">\n    33 F.3d at 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is therefore just as unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Lastly, exercising jurisdiction under the circumstances presented in this case does not-as DHS contends-amount to allowing a petitioner to avoid the exhaustion requirement based on general futility. Generally speaking, a petitioner must raise his arguments before the BIA even when he is almost assuredly not going to prevail, such as when the BIA has rejected the argument in a different case or binding precedent forecloses it from adopting his position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Popal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8937408\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/416/249/#p252\">\n    416 F.3d at 252-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he exhaustion requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) is jurisdictional, and ... there is no general futility exception. Indeed, the fact that the BIA has considered and rejected the petitioner's argument in\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   case will not normally excuse [his] failure to raise it in his own appeal to the BIA.

Our conclusion in this case is grounded on Cabrera having exhausted his administrative remedies, not on his being excused from this requirement. The record demonstrates that the BIA considered and rejected the argument Cabrera has raised in his petition for review in Cabrera's own administrative proceedings.

Of these two means of satisfying the element, active participation in the gang would be the lesser conduct. Virginia courts have held, for example, that a defendant's choice to wear a red hat and shirt to a party where other Bloods wearing red clothing were also present and where the defendant told a third party dressed in red, \"You're a Blood and you don't even know it,\" was sufficient evidence of \"participation\" to satisfy this element.\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=688%20S.E.2d%20168\">\n    688 S.E.2d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly, the third element-that the predicate criminal act was \"committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the gang\"-can be committed in any one of these three disjunctive ways.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Of the three, \"in association with\" appears to be the lowest threshold for satisfying the element. Virginia courts have held that this component of the statute requires proof only that the defendant shared an intent to commit the predicate criminal act, and it \"does not expressly require that the defendant ha[d] the same, specific objective\" as the gang for committing that act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141. Thus, for example, the Court of Appeals of Virginia held that sufficient evidence existed to show that the defendant committed the predicate act \"in association with\" a gang\n   where he \"associated himself with [gang] members in order to attack innocent individuals\" and \"shared the same general objective as the ... gang members\" by \"join[ing] in the\" predicate criminal act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141-42.

Contrary to the BIA's conclusion, the mere fact that an act was committed \"in association with\" a gang by someone who \"actively participate[d] in\" the gang does not necessarily involve moral turpitude. To hold otherwise would allow a statute to be classified as involving depraved conduct based on a characteristic unrelated to that conduct, whether it be the defendant's identity or that of the individuals with whom he acted.

Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 does not categorically qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude. A predicate criminal act under Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 includes violating Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-128 -trespass upon church or school property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.1 (listing a violation of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-128 among the potential predicate criminal acts for purposes of Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2 ). Virginia law generally classifies that crime as a Class 3 misdemeanor, Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-128(A), meaning that the maximum punishment for its violation is a \"fine of not more than $500,\" Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-11(c). No one contends that a simple trespass upon church property is a crime involving moral turpitude. Yet, under the DHS framework, if two active participants in a criminal street gang (first element: \"actively participates in ... a criminal street gang\") knowingly trespass upon church property (second element: knowingly participate in any predicate criminal act) to attend a gang meeting elsewhere (third element: the predicate criminal act was committed \"for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with the gang\"), then upon conviction for violating Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-46.2, those two individuals have also committed a crime involving moral turpitude under the INA. But no one can seriously contend that two gang participants trespassing on church property to get from Point A to Point B is \"inherently base, vile or depraved and contrary to accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.\"\n   <em>\n    Prudencio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3723131\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/472/#p484\">\n    669 F.3d at 484-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Matter of Olquin-Rufino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20896\">\n    23 I. &amp; N.
