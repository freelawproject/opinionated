On each occasion, he has claimed that TSA's airport screening procedures violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, citing to the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In an earlier lawsuit that wound up before this Court, Corbett sought to reverse a decision of TSA, challenging the Administration's previous policy that gave passengers at airport security checkpoints the option of obtaining security clearances through either advanced imaging technology (AIT) body screeners or alternative screening procedures, like a physical pat down. A panel of this Court dismissed Corbett's petition as being untimely, and, alternatively, held that TSA's use of body scanners and pat-down procedures did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Corbett v.

Nevertheless, we are able to say that based on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Corbett I\n   </em>\n   that TSA's AIT scanning regime as a general matter was not unconstitutional, and more importantly, based on our reading of this record, it's entirely too speculative to assume that Corbett would be subjected to TSA's new policy in an unconstitutional manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As for Corbett's alternative argument that he has standing based on the \"chilling\n   effect\" that the policy has on his travel because he faces an administrative fine of up to $11,000 and the loss of his airfare if he refuses to complete screening at a TSA checkpoint, we remain unpersuaded. The Supreme Court has explained that parties \"cannot manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm that is not certainly impending.\"\n   <em>\n    Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p416\">\n    568 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p416\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407550\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/398/#p416\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). Corbett cannot demonstrate that the possible harm of maybe having to undergo mandatory AIT screening at some indeterminate time is impending, and his subjective fear of this harm is not sufficient to create standing. And, in any event, we cannot ignore Corbett's statement in several filings that he \"has not and has no intention of changing his travel patterns.\" Reply Br. at 2; Pet. Opp. To MTD at 6; Decl. of Jonathan Corbett at 1 (Dec. 24, 2015). This admission severely undermines the claim that TSA's policy has had a chilling effect on his travel plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   His remaining arguments fare no better. He suggests that because he has also brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, we should exercise jurisdiction because he has the \"substantial interest\" required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046110\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) -- the statute that provides for judicial review of TSA orders. But even if Corbett satisfies the statutory requirement that he have a \"substantial interest\" in the challenged screening policy, he must first establish the type of injury in fact that is a prerequisite to maintaining suit under Article III of the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois Dep't of Transp. v.

And to the extent Corbett points to this Court's exercise of jurisdiction in\n   <em>\n    Corbett I\n   </em>\n   , it's also irrelevant because there, he was challenging a different policy that applied to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   passengers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corbett I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4204487\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1171/#p1182\">\n    767 F.3d at 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the challenged policy as \"standard operating procedures\n   for security screening nationwide\"), whereas the policy Corbett now challenges does not affect the \"vast majority\" of passengers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, it may be possible for Corbett to bring a Fourth Amendment challenge to TSA's policy in the future -- if, among other things, he is able to establish, based on a new set of facts, that he has a substantial likelihood of injury that is \"real and immediate,\" \"actual and imminent,\" and not \"conjectural\" or \"hypothetical.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p101\">\n    461 U.S. at 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11298204\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/95/#p101\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).

But because the standing issue before us is straightforward, because standing is paramount among our jurisdictional inquiries, and because the parties have not argued ripeness or finality, we dismiss Corbett's petition on standing grounds alone. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"a federal court has leeway to choose among threshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits.\"\n    <em>\n     Sinochem Int'l Co. v.

But that is a distinction without a difference. In either instance, be it through TSA's random selection process or the steps involved in a police interaction that may result in a chokehold, the resulting probability of a future unconstitutional injury is too small to constitute an injury in fact.
