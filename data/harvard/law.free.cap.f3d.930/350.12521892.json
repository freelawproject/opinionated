Cortez conceded that he was unlawfully present, but argued that his initial removal order was invalid because of an alleged filing defect that deprived the immigration court of \"jurisdiction\" over his case. The district court rejected that argument, and Cortez subsequently pleaded guilty while preserving his right to raise the issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm the district court's order. We first hold that the premise of Cortez's argument - that the purported filing defect in his case deprived the immigration court of authority to enter a removal order, so that he may collaterally challenge that order in subsequent criminal proceedings - is incorrect. And in any event, there in fact was no defect. As the district court explained, the applicable regulations do not require that the information identified by Cortez - a date and time for a subsequent removal hearing - be included in the \"notice to appear\" that is filed with an immigration court to initiate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Juan Cortez is a citizen of Mexico who has been found to be unlawfully present in the United States on two occasions. The first was in 2011. On February 27 of that year, the Department of Homeland Security (\"Department\") served Cortez with a document labeled \"Notice to Appear.\" That notice advised him, among other things, that he was charged with being unlawfully present in the country, and that the Department was initiating removal proceedings against him. The notice provided Cortez with the location of the immigration court where his removal hearing would be held, but did not provide a date and time, stating only that the hearing would occur \"on a date to be set at a time to be set.\" J.A. 10. At the same time it served Cortez with this written notice, however, the Department orally informed him of his hearing date and time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Department filed the notice to appear with the immigration court on March\n   3, 2011. Two weeks later, on March 17, 2011, the immigration court held a removal hearing, which Cortez attended via video conference. The immigration judge confirmed that Cortez was unlawfully present and ordered that he be removed from the country. There is no indication that Cortez challenged the contents of the notice to appear or the immigration judge's authority to order his removal, and Cortez neither administratively nor judicially appealed the removal order on any ground. Cortez was removed from the United States in April 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At some point following his removal, Cortez entered the United States a second time, again without applying for legal admission. In September 2018, the government located Cortez in the vicinity of Lynchburg, Virginia. This time, the government criminally charged Cortez with illegal reentry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), which is violated when an individual who previously was \"deported\" or \"removed\" from the country \"enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States\" without legal authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before the district court, Cortez moved to dismiss the indictment against him. He conceded that he had entered the United States without legal authority, so that the second element of his criminal charge - unlawful presence - was satisfied. But the first element - a previous removal from the country - was not satisfied, Cortez argued, because even though he attended his 2011 immigration hearing, \"the immigration judge lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter an order of removal against him.\" J.A. 6. It followed, Cortez contended, that his 2011 removal order was void, and could not be the basis for a charge under \u00a7 1326(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a general rule, Cortez recognized, a criminal defendant may collaterally attack a removal order in a prosecution for illegal reentry only if three conditions are met: \"(1) [he] exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived [him] of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). But according to Cortez, that framework did not apply because he was challenging the \"subject matter jurisdiction\" of the immigration court, \"an issue that cannot be waived or forfeited.\" And even if it did apply, Cortez argued, a lack of \"subject matter jurisdiction\" by itself satisfied all three prerequisites for a collateral attack under \u00a7 1326(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The purported error at the heart of Cortez's claim was the failure of the notice to appear filed in connection with his 2011 removal proceeding to specify a date and time for his hearing. Under the regulations governing removal proceedings, Cortez explained, proceedings commence and \"[j]urisdiction vests\" with the immigration judge when a \"charging document\" is filed with the immigration court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The regulations list three documents that may qualify as \"charging document[s],\" including a \"[n]otice to [a]ppear.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1003.13. And a \"notice to appear,\" Cortez finished, is defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") itself, which requires that a \"notice to appear\" include the \"time and place at which the proceedings will be held,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(G)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/#p2114\">\n    138 S. Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2114,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/#p2114\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (confirming that notice to appear under \u00a7 1229(a) \"include[s] ... the time and place of the removal proceedings\"). Putting all of that together, Cortez argued that because the\n   notice filed in his case omitted a hearing time, it did not vest the immigration court with \"jurisdiction,\" rendering his removal order a legal nullity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court disagreed. The court did not dispute the premise of Cortez's argument: that a defect in the notice to appear would implicate the immigration court's jurisdiction and allow for a collateral attack on the removal order. But, the court held, the notice to appear was not defective, because the regulatory definition of the \"notice to appear\" that vests a court with \"jurisdiction\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"list the time and date of the removal proceedings as required criteria.\" J.A. 18 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c) ). Cortez, the court reasoned, was pointing to the wrong definition of \"notice to appear\": The statutory provision in \u00a7 1229(a) does not address \"the immigration court's ... jurisdiction over the proceeding,\" but is instead concerned with the separate issue of providing notice to a noncitizen in a removal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.15\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Because Cortez had shown no defect affecting the immigration court's \"jurisdiction,\" the court concluded, he could attack his removal order collaterally only if he could satisfy the standard \u00a7 1326(d) requirements. Jumping directly to the third requirement, the court held that Cortez's removal order was not \"fundamentally unfair,\" J.A. 20, in part because Cortez - who attended his hearing after being provided with oral notice of the date and time - suffered no \"actual prejudice,\" J.A. 21. Accordingly, the district court denied Cortez's motion to dismiss the indictment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Cortez pleaded guilty less than two weeks later, and the district court sentenced him to time served. Cortez's plea agreement reserved his right to appeal the district court's ruling on his motion to dismiss the indictment, and he timely noticed this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Cortez makes the same argument on appeal as he did before the district court: Because no proper notice to appear was filed in his removal proceedings, the immigration court lacked \"jurisdiction,\" and as a result, there is no valid removal order on which to base a prosecution for illegal reentry. We review this claim, which turns on purely legal questions, de novo,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hatcher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3430057\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/222/#p224\">\n    560 F.3d 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (4th Cir. 2009), and find that the district court correctly denied Cortez's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before we even reach Cortez's argument - that the immigration court lacked \"subject matter jurisdiction\" to enter his 2011 removal order because of a defect in the notice to appear filed with the court - we are confronted with a threshold issue. Both parties assume that a successful challenge to the \"subject matter jurisdiction\" of an immigration court would by itself be grounds for a collateral attack on a removal order, relieving Cortez of the obligation to satisfy the \u00a7 1326(d) requirements that ordinarily apply to collateral challenges. We have questions about that assumption, which we outline below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We need not resolve the issue, however, because for two independent reasons, Cortez cannot succeed in his challenge to the immigration court's \"jurisdiction.\" First, the regulation on which Cortez relies,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), is a docketing rule that does not implicate the immigration court's adjudicatory authority, referred to as \"subject matter jurisdiction\" by the parties. And in any event, we agree with the district court that Cortez has failed to show any defect in his notice to appear under that regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At bottom, this case is about a collateral challenge to a removal order in a criminal proceeding for illegal reentry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The threshold question presented is whether Cortez may advance his argument - that the immigration court lacked \"jurisdiction\" to issue a removal order in his case - in this posture. The parties and the district court assumed that Cortez's challenge to the \"subject matter jurisdiction\" of the immigration court, if successful, necessarily would allow for a collateral attack on his removal order, relieving him of the obligation to satisfy the \u00a7 1326(d) requirements that ordinarily apply. But we have doubts about that assumption. And given the breadth of its implications - opening to collateral attack every removal order in proceedings commenced by an incomplete notice, regardless of the significance of the error or the possibility of prejudice - we do not wish to leave it unaddressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a criminal proceeding for illegal reentry, the existence of a removal order usually is enough to meet the government's burden of establishing the defendant's prior removal or deportation.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Moreno-Tapia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277304\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/162/#p165\">\n    848 F.3d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165 (4th Cir. 2017). But there is an exception, allowing a defendant to collaterally attack a removal order - so that it no longer serves as a predicate for a criminal reentry charge - when there was a \"procedural flaw in the immigration proceeding\" that prevented the noncitizen from seeking review when the order was issued, thus violating his due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277304\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/162/#p165\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 169 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    481 U.S. 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6223231\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/828/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), a noncitizen must make each of three showings to come within that exception and mount a collateral attack: that (1) he \"exhausted any administrative remedies\" available to seek relief against the removal order; (2) the removal proceedings \"improperly deprived [him] of the opportunity for judicial review\"; and (3) entry of the order was \"fundamentally unfair.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   It is readily apparent that Cortez cannot make any of those showings. First, Cortez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies: He neither administratively appealed the immigration judge's decision nor provided any explanation for why he could not do so. Second, Cortez failed to show that the alleged defect in his proceeding - the absence of a hearing date on the notice filed with the immigration court - somehow deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review of a removal proceeding of which he had actual notice and in which he actively participated. Finally, Cortez cannot establish \"fundamental unfairness,\" which requires that \"but for the errors complained of, there was a reasonable probability that he would not have been deported,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p665\">\n    434 F.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 665 (4th Cir. 2005). Cortez was promptly provided with oral notice of the date and time of his hearing, which, again, he attended, and there is no reason to believe that the hearing would have proceeded any differently, much less resulted in a different outcome, had the notice docketed with the immigration court also provided the same date and time information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, Cortez may proceed with his collateral attack only if there is some exception-to-the-exception that would allow him to bypass these normal requirements. Cortez argues that there is just such an exception: If he is correct that a defect in the notice to appear filed with the immigration court to commence his proceedings deprived the immigration court of \"jurisdiction\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), then his removal order was void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   and necessarily subject to collateral challenge. But\n   Cortez provides scant authority for that theory, and we question whether he has framed the issue correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   First, contrary to what seems to be Cortez's assumption, there is no freestanding rule allowing for collateral attacks based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, the opposite is true: \"Even subject-matter jurisdiction ... may not be attacked collaterally.\"\n   <em>\n    Kontrick v. Ryan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897340\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/443/\">\n    540 U.S. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 455 n.9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897340,9066734\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/124/906/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8897340\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/540/443/\">\n    157 L.Ed.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (explaining that a lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage within the same civil proceeding, but generally is not grounds for collateral challenge). As we have explained, the interest in the finality of judgments is sufficiently strong that only in exceptional circumstances will a collateral challenge based on the lack of subject matter jurisdiction be permitted.\n   <em>\n    Cooper v. Productive Transp. Servs., Inc. (In re Bulldog Trucking, Inc.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356205,1358894\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/347/\">\n    147 F.3d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352-53 (4th Cir. 1998). \"Mere error in the exercise of jurisdiction\" is not enough.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356205,1358894\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356205,1358894\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/347/\">\n    at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cortez does not allege exceptional circumstances under this standard, so any entitlement he has to raise a \"jurisdictional\" objection to his removal order in this collateral criminal proceeding must come, if at all, by way of \u00a7 1326(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, there is good reason to question Cortez's supposition that a claim characterized as \"jurisdictional\" should be exempt from \u00a7 1326(d) 's limits, including the statutory exhaustion requirement. Cortez proceeds by analogy to federal court subject matter jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution: Challenges to that jurisdiction cannot be waived or forfeited,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. Datanet Eng'g, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246153\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/369/385/#p390\">\n    369 F.3d 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 390 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc), and so, Cortez contends, he did not forfeit his challenge to the immigration court's authority over his removal proceeding by attending his hearing without objecting, nor by failing to raise the issue on administrative or judicial review as required under \u00a7 1326(d)(1)-(2). But an immigration court is not an Article III court, and a removal proceeding is an agency process, not an Article III adjudication. And as the Supreme Court has instructed, we should not \"reflexive[ly] exten[d] to agencies ... the very real division between the jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional that is applicable to courts.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington v.

Cortez's claim that the immigration court lacked the authority to hear his case, in other words, is not meaningfully distinct from a more routine claim that an immigration court has misconstrued the INA: \"[T]he question - whether framed as an incorrect application of agency authority or an assertion of authority not conferred - is always whether the agency has gone beyond what Congress has permitted it to do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   involved the degree of deference owed to an agency interpretation of a statute bearing on its own \"jurisdiction,\" or statutory authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n    at 296-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697048\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/290/#p297\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several courts, however, have applied\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   to agency adjudications - precisely the context we face here - and concluded that purported \"jurisdictional\" claims are subject to the same statutory limits, including exhaustion requirements and forfeiture rules, as other claims that an agency has acted improperly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PGS Geophysical AS v.

Indeed, the Ninth Circuit held as much in the immigration context years before\n   <em>\n    City of Arlington\n   </em>\n   , finding that a claim that the immigration court \"lacked jurisdiction\" over a certain group of noncitizens \"turn[s] on a question of statutory interpretation,\" so that normal rules of exhaustion and forfeiture apply.\n   <em>\n    Xiao v.

In short, we have significant doubts about Cortez's assumption that the \"jurisdictional\" nature of his challenge to his administrative removal order puts him in a different and special category when it comes to judicial review, exempting him from \u00a7 1326(d) 's exhaustion requirements and other limits on collateral attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The government, however, has not raised this objection. Instead, it accepts Cortez's premise that a proceeding conducted outside the scope of an immigration court's adjudicatory authority must be deemed void on collateral review. Moreover, other courts addressing similar challenges to the \"jurisdiction\" of immigration courts have made the same assumption.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hernandez-Perez v. Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519546\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/305/#p310\">\n    911 F.3d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310 (6th Cir. 2018) (finding that propriety of notice to appear commencing removal proceedings \"can never be forfeited or waived\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). For purposes of this appeal, we need not decide conclusively whether that assumption is well-founded. As we now explain, Cortez in any event cannot establish that his 2011 removal proceeding was conducted without adjudicatory authority, and that is enough to resolve this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even accepting Cortez's threshold presumption - that a \"jurisdictional\" defect in the notice to appear that commenced his removal proceedings would entitle him to collaterally challenge his removal order - we find his argument lacking in two independent respects. First, the purported defect Cortez has identified - the failure of the notice to appear filed with the immigration court to include a date and time for his removal hearing - does not implicate the immigration court's adjudicatory authority or \"jurisdiction.\" And second, there is in any event no defect, because the regulations that govern the filing of a notice to appear do not require inclusion of a hearing date and time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We start with Cortez's contention that any defect in the notice that commenced his removal proceedings would deprive the immigration court of \"subject matter jurisdiction\" to issue a removal order. At the outset, we clarify some terminology: When it comes to administrative agencies, the question of subject matter jurisdiction \"is more appropriately framed\" as \"whether the agency actor, such as the [immigration judge] here, lacked statutory authority to act\" or acted outside its \"authority to adjudicate.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But as described above, the definition in fact does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   include that requirement; instead, the regulations expressly reject it, providing that date and time information is to be provided in a notice to appear filed under \u00a7 1003.14(a) only \"where practicable.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.18\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

According to Cortez, a regulatory definition for a \"notice to appear\" that does not incorporate \u00a7 1229(a) 's date and time requirement conflicts with the INA and is therefore void. But there is no conflict because, as we have explained, the regulations in question and \u00a7 1229(a) speak to different issues - filings in the immigration court to initiate proceedings, on the one hand, and notice to noncitizens of removal hearings, on the other - and the INA \"says nothing about\" how a case is to be docketed with the immigration court.\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/#p1159\">\n    913 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1160 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Banegas Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520870\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/922/101/#p111\">\n    922 F.3d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the INA \"does not ... explain when or how jurisdiction vests\" in immigration courts (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because \u00a7 1003.14(a) 's docketing procedures are a product of regulation, not dictated by statute, the agency is free to define qualifying charging documents differently than the document described in \u00a7 1229(a) and used for other purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, we hold that it is the regulatory definition of a \"notice to appear\" - not the definition at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - that controls whether the government properly initiated an immigration proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The notice to appear filed with the immigration court in Cortez's case conformed to that regulatory definition.
