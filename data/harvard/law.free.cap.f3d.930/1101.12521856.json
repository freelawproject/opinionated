Together, two California ballot access laws require independent candidates to collect signatures from one percent of California's registered voters-over 170,000 signatures-to appear on a statewide ballot. Independent presidential candidate Roque De La Fuente challenges these requirements as unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After losing the 2016 Democratic presidential primary in California, De La Fuente wanted to continue his candidacy in the general election as an independent candidate. But he faced what he argues is a \"cost prohibitive\" obstacle: sections 8400 and 8403 of California's ballot access laws (collectively, \"Ballot Access Laws\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208400\">\n    Cal. Elec. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8403. Under section 8400, independent candidates running for statewide office must collect signatures from one percent of all registered voters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8400 (requiring independent candidates to collect signatures from \"voters of the state equal to not less in number than 1 percent of the entire number of registered voters of the state at the time of the close of registration prior to the preceding general election\"). Section 8403 requires independent candidates to collect the signatures at least 88, but no more than 193, days before the election.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%208400\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8403(a). So, in 2016, De La Fuente had to collect 178,039 valid signatures in 105 days to appear on the general election ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Assuming he needed paid canvassers and twice as many signatures to ensure a comfortable margin of error, De La Fuente estimated the cost of ballot access to be three to four million dollars. He argues that such an expense makes running statewide \"cost prohibitive,\" unconstitutionally burdening rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. De La Fuente points out that the next highest state signature requirement is about 60,000 fewer (in Florida) and that no independent candidate has appeared on California's general election ballot since 1992. De La Fuente self-funds his campaigns, and has officially declared his 2020 presidential run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   California's Secretary of State (the \"Secretary\") contends that the Ballot Access Laws are reasonably related to California's regulatory interests-streamlining the ballot, avoiding ballot overcrowding, and reducing voter confusion. Following a hearing, the district court granted the Secretary's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We review de novo De La Fuente's constitutional challenge.\n   <em>\n    Nader v.

De La Fuente's declaration confirms that he is running for President of the United States in 2020. Whether he will run as an independent or in a major political party's primary, as the Secretary argues, does not affect his injury. Either path is all but certain to lead to De La Fuente running as an independent in the general election. As\n   many well-known and not so well-known candidates know, running in a party's presidential primary is no guarantee of running as that party's general election candidate. De La Fuente's experience in 2016 reflects this reality. After De La Fuente ran (and lost) in the Democratic primary election, the only way he could appear on California's presidential general election ballot was to run as an independent. It is likely that if De La Fuente runs in the 2020 Democratic primary, history will repeat itself. Whichever path De La Fuente chooses, he will suffer an \"injury in fact.\" He therefore has standing.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz. Green Party v.

Non-major party candidates can access California's ballot in three ways: as minor party candidates, write-in candidates, or independent candidates.

De La Fuente's own expert suggested that \"there's almost nobody left [for independent candidates] to petition\" because voters have their choice among major and minor party candidates.
