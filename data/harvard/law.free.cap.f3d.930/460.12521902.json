Rodney Class pleaded guilty to violating this law after parking a car containing three guns on a street near the Capitol.

He parked his car in one of the many angled parking spots that line the 200 block of Maryland Avenue SW (the \"Maryland Avenue lot\"). That parking spot sits just north of the United States Botanic Gardens and approximately 1,000 feet from the entrance to the Capitol itself. The street is accessible to the general public, but the parking spot Class used is reserved on weekdays (like the Thursday he parked there) for employees of the House of Representatives. The parking lot is marked by a sign indicating a permit is required. Class locked his car and walked inside the Capitol. Upon his return, several police officers were peering into his car. One asked Class if he had any weapons inside, and he answered that he did. The officer told Class that it was illegal to have weapons on Capitol Grounds and took Class to Capitol Police headquarters. When the car was searched, three firearms were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Class was indicted for possession of a firearm while on the grounds of the Capitol, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205104\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 5104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (the \"Capitol Grounds ban\"). He filed several motions seeking to dismiss the indictment, arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Capitol Grounds ban violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The district court denied these motions from the bench, holding that the Capitol Grounds ban \"does not burden conduct protected by the Second Amendment,\" because \"laws prohibiting individuals from carrying firearms in sensitive places, such as government buildings, are presumptively lawful.\" Tr. of Mot.

He argues that\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   refers only to bans on possession \"\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   sensitive places like government buildings,\" and the \"Maryland Avenue outdoor parking lot, like most of the Capitol Grounds, is certainly not 'in a government building.' \" Suppl. Class Br. 22. As a result, he claims, the ban is \"outside of any presumption of constitutionality that applies only 'in' sensitive places.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This argument\n   slices\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   too thin. The Supreme Court was careful to note that\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   's list of \"presumptively lawful\" regulations was not exhaustive,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   627 n.26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we have little trouble concluding that the same security interests which permit regulation of firearms \"in\" government buildings permit regulation of firearms on the property surrounding those buildings as well. Indeed, Class appears to concede this point elsewhere in his brief, agreeing with the government that the White House lawn, for instance, is \"sensitive\" for purposes of the Second Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Class Br. 25 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As for the Maryland Avenue parking lot, although it is not a government building, we conclude that it is sufficiently integrated with the Capitol for\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   's sensitive places exception to apply. Accordingly, we conclude that the Second Amendment does not give Class the right to bear arms in the Maryland Avenue lot. Several facts lead us to this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, though it is open to the public, the Maryland Avenue parking lot may be used during working hours only by Capitol employees with a permit. This makes the area a potential stalking ground for anyone wishing to attack congressional staff and disrupt the operations of Congress. The operation of the national legislature depends not only on the ability of members of Congress and their staff to conduct business inside the Capitol, but also on their ability to freely and safely travel to and from work. The same special security concerns that apply to the employees while in the Capitol apply when they walk to and from their cars on Capitol property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, the lot is close to the Capitol and legislative office buildings. Class possessed a firearm less than 1,000 feet away from the entrance to the Capitol, and a block away from the Rayburn House Office Building. Although there is surely some outer bound on the distance Congress could extend the area of protection around the Capitol without raising Second Amendment concerns, Congress has not exceeded it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, as the owner of the Maryland Avenue lot, the government-like private property owners-has the power to regulate conduct on its property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adderley v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334139\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/39/#p47\">\n    385 U.S. 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334139\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/39/#p47\">\n    87 S.Ct. 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11334139\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/385/39/#p47\">\n    17 L.Ed.2d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1966) (observing in the free-speech context that the government, \"no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonidy v.

App'x 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 875 (5th Cir. 2009) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Class raises two counterarguments. First, he tries to distinguish the Maryland Avenue lot from other outdoor government property that is protected by security or not accessible to the public. In support, he points to language from\n   <em>\n    Wrenn\n   </em>\n   , where we concluded that the Second Amendment \"enables self-defense at least against the level of threat\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   faced by those\n   covered by the Amendment: responsible and law-abiding citizens.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275844\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/650/#p657\">\n    864 F.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Class argues that the need to have a gun for self-defense is lessened in places that are off-limits to the public (like the White House lawn) or protected by metal detectors and security guards (like the Capitol building). Because neither is true of the Maryland Avenue parking lot, Class contends that law-abiding citizens need to be able to carry firearms for self-defense. Suppl. Class Reply 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Class reads too much into\n   <em>\n    Wrenn\n   </em>\n   . That case raised the question of whether the right to bear arms extended outside the home and who could exercise that right; this case raises the question of where outside the home a person authorized to carry a firearm may do so. For this inquiry, we do not look to the \"level of threat\" posed in a sensitive place. Many \"schools\" and \"government buildings\"-the paradigmatic \"sensitive places\" identified in\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   -are open to the public, without any form of special security or screening. In an unsecured government building like a post office or school, the risk of crime may be no different than in any other publicly accessible building, yet the\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   opinion leaves intact bans on firearm possession in those places. As one court put it, those places are \"sensitive\" for purposes of the Second Amendment because of \"the people found there\" or the \"activities that take place there.\"\n   <em>\n    GeorgiaCarry.Org, Inc. v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189142\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/764/1306/#p1319\">\n    764 F.

Class Br. 25-26. It is true, as we explained in\n   <em>\n    Heller II\n   </em>\n   , that \"[a] requirement of newer vintage is not ... presumed to be valid.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769810,5712319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1244/\">\n    670 F.3d at 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Class's argument, however, misinterprets what it means for a regulation to be \"longstanding.\" Under Class's reading, the ban\n   <em>\n    in that location\n   </em>\n   must have been longstanding. But this makes little sense when viewed through the language of\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   , which spoke generally of \"schools\" and \"government buildings.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    554 U.S. at 626-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relevant inquiry is whether a particular\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of regulation has been a \"longstanding\" exception to the right to bear arms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769810,5712319\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1244/\">\n    670 F.3d at 1253-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A new post office is no less a government building than one built in 1789, just as a new wing of the Capitol is still part of that building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the Maryland Avenue parking lot is a sensitive place, the ban on carrying firearms there is \"presumptively lawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   627 n.26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Class Reply 8. We see no such problem. While this portion of Maryland Avenue\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be used to travel from one part of the District to another, nothing about the ban prevents a person who wishes to carry a firearm for self-defense from taking an alternate route that avoids the Capitol Grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Class counters by arguing that the boundaries of the Capitol Grounds are not publicly posted and are therefore \"indistinguishable from nearby areas where firearms are permitted.\" Suppl. Class Br. 14. As a result, he claims that the fear of violating the ban by accident impinges on his ability to carry a firearm for self-defense even in areas of the District that are not technically covered by the ban. To the extent that he complains about lack of notice, we address that issue in our discussion of his due process claim. For purposes of his Second Amendment claim, the Maryland Avenue lot is \"distinguishable\" from other nearby areas because Congress has set apart the Capitol Grounds from the rest of the district for the use of the national legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Class next argues that he lacked notice his conduct was criminal because of how difficult it is to determine the boundaries of the Capitol Grounds.

Indeed, Class does not-and could not-argue that any of these terms are \"indeterminate\" or \"shapeless.\" An ordinary citizen would readily understand from the text of the statute that he may not carry a firearm on the Capitol Grounds or inside the Capitol. Nor does Class argue that the boundaries of the Capitol Grounds are \"shapeless.\" The metes and bounds of the Capitol Grounds are precisely defined: with a map of the city and the appropriate legal references, it can be determined with certainty that the 200 block of Maryland Avenue SW is subject to the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Confronted with a clear statute, Class takes a different approach. He argues that, regardless of the precision of the text, the structure of the statute and lack of signage identifying the Maryland Avenue lot as a restricted area makes it \"exceedingly difficult\" for an ordinary citizen to actually figure out that the parking lot is part of the Capitol Grounds. Suppl. Class Br. 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   So difficult, according to Class, that an armed person in the lot lacks fair notice that his conduct is prohibited. In support of his position, Class relies on the circuitous route an individual must take to determine whether the lot is part of the Capitol Grounds. First, a person must look to the U.S. Code, which defines the grounds by reference to a 1946 map on file in the Office of the Surveyor of the District of Columbia.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205102\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 5102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The map does not contain the Maryland Avenue lot. However, the statute goes on to say that the boundaries of the Grounds \"includ[e] all additions added by law\" after the map was recorded.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . So the second step a person must take is to find Public Law 96-432, which in 1980 expanded the Grounds to include \"that portion of Maryland Avenue Southwest from the west curb of First Street Southwest to the east curb of Third Street Southwest.\" Act to Amend the Act of July 31, 1946, as amended, Relating to the United States Capitol Grounds, and for Other Purposes, Pub.

The Maryland Avenue lot falls squarely within this area, but Class argues that the combination of these steps and lack of other identifying features puts determining the boundaries of the Capitol Grounds \"beyond the ken of someone of ordinary intelligence and diligence.\" Suppl.

We are of course not bound by the reasoning of that district court, but in any event,\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable. The Capitol Grounds are defined by a map and a specific list of intersections and streets that are part of the public law.

That is,\n   <em>\n    Staples\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rehaif\n   </em>\n   both concluded that Congress had not\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   to impose criminal penalties for possession of a gun without proof of scienter; neither case addressed whether or not Congress\n   <em>\n    lacks the power\n   </em>\n   to impose such penalties. And here, the Supreme Court held only that the claims which survived Class's guilty plea were those that \"challenge the Government's power to\n   criminalize\" his conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Class\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616876\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/798/#p805\">\n    138 S.

And to succeed on his constitutional challenge, it is not enough for Class to show that the\n   <em>\n    best\n   </em>\n   reading of the law requires proof of scienter. Instead, Class must show that the law is so difficult for the average person to understand that the Constitution\n   <em>\n    forbids\n   </em>\n   his conviction without such proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   He cannot meet that heavy burden. As we discuss above, determining that the ban applies to the Maryland Avenue lot is not a perfectly straightforward exercise, but citizens are presumed to know the law, and the task of ascertaining the boundaries of the Capitol Grounds is not so difficult that Class's conviction violates the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The government argued during Class's first appeal that we should review his due process claim for plain error because he had not raised it in the district court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gov't.
