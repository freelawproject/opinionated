At sentencing, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   overruled Smith's objection that two prior convictions for fleeing an officer in a vehicle were not violent felonies and crimes of violence under the \"residual clauses\" of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") and the career offender advisory guidelines. Therefore, the court sentenced Smith as an armed career criminal on Count 3,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and USSG \u00a7 4B1.4, and as a career offender under the advisory guidelines on Counts 1 and 2,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2. This resulted in a guidelines sentencing range of 420 months to life in prison. Varying downward, the court imposed concurrent 220-month sentences on Counts 1 and 3 and a consecutive 60-month sentence on\n   Count 2. The court stated that \"it would have imposed the same sentence had it sustained defendant's ... objections\" to the armed career criminal and career offender determinations. On direct appeal, Smith raised no sentencing issues; we affirmed.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In June 2016, Smith filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion to vacate his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , arguing, as relevant here, that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to note that a Supreme Court decision was pending in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ; and that his sentence should be vacated because, after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , his fleeing convictions no longer qualified as violent felonies under the ACCA\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   crimes of violence under the career offender guidelines.

After\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   , the government opposed Smith's \u00a7 2255 motion, conceding that his Count 3 ACCA sentence was no longer valid under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   but arguing that he was not entitled to \u00a7 2255 relief because appellate counsel did not provide ineffective assistance and because Smith was not entitled to sentencing relief under the concurrent sentence doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Agreeing with the government, the district court denied Smith's \u00a7 2255 motion. Smith did not establish ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the court concluded, because counsel's failure to anticipate\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's change in the law did not constitute deficient performance. Although Smith's ACCA sentence on Count 3 was no longer valid after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , the concurrent sentence doctrine applied, the court concluded, because\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   had foreclosed Smith's challenge to his concurrent career offender sentence on Count 1. Therefore, \"even if the court ... granted Smith relief on count 3, his imprisonment term would remain the same because his conviction on count 1, which is still valid, is the same as his sentence for count 3.\" We granted a certificate of appealability on these issues.

The Concurrent Sentence Doctrine Issue.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Smith's \u00a7 2255 motion argued that both his Count 1 career offender sentence and his Count 3 ACCA sentence must be vacated under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   established that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   provides no basis for \u00a7 2255 relief from the Count 1 career offender sentence under the advisory guidelines. The district court therefore invoked the discretionary concurrent sentence doctrine to deny sentencing relief. That doctrine \"allows courts to decline to review the validity of a concurrent conviction or sentence when a ruling in the defendant's favor 'would not reduce the time he is required to serve' or otherwise 'prejudice him in any way.' \"\n   <em>\n    Eason v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519632\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1122/#p1123\">\n    912 F.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1123 (8th Cir. 2019), quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Eason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519632\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/912/1122/#p1123\">\n    912 F.3d at 1123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Smith did not challenge the validity of his Count 3 conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm, and reducing his ACCA sentence on Count 3 would not affect his total sentence because the concurrent 220-month sentence on Count 1 and consecutive 60-month sentence on Count 2 are still valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, Smith argues that he is entitled to have his entire sentence vacated because the concurrent sentences on Counts 1 and 3 are \"interdependent.\" Smith repeatedly asserts that his sentence on Count 1 \"was impacted by the unlawful ACCA enhancement\" on Count 3. But repeating this assertion does not make it true. Under the Guidelines in effect when he was sentenced, Smith's total offense level on Count 1 standing alone, with the career offender enhancement, was 37; on Count 3 standing alone, with the ACCA enhancement, it was 34.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 4B1.4(a)(3). The enhancements put Smith in criminal history category VI on both counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1(b), 4B1.4(c)(2). The Count 1 enhanced offense level of 37 resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 360 months to life under \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3) ; \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(2) added the mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence for Count 2, making the advisory guidelines range for Count 1\n   <em>\n    alone\n   </em>\n   420 months to life. Counts 1 and 3 were grouped under \u00a7 3D1.2(c), resulting in concurrent ranges of 420 months to life for each Count. Thus, Count 3 did not increase the guidelines sentence for Count 1; if anything, the opposite was true. Moreover, the typical impact of an ACCA enhancement -- its mandatory minimum fifteen-year sentence -- had no impact in this case because Smith's total sentence was far above fifteen years, before and after the district court granted a 200-month downward variance. Indeed, at sentencing, defense counsel urged the court to impose a fifteen-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Smith further argues the district court abused its discretion in applying the concurrent sentence doctrine because, with his Count 3 sentence vacated under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , he is entitled to a full resentencing under the sentencing package doctrine. At that resentencing, Smith asserts, the current career offender guidelines would apply. Therefore, because the Sentencing Commission eliminated the career offender residual clause after\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , his Count 1 sentence would not be subject to the career offender enhancement. This establishes prejudice, Smith argues, so the concurrent sentence doctrine does not apply. He urges us to vacate his sentence and remand for\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under the sentencing package doctrine, when a defendant successfully attacks one but not all counts of conviction on appeal, we \"may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to ensure that it remains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677168\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/237/#p253\">\n    554 U.S. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677168\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/237/#p253\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677168\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/237/#p253\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Here, Smith's\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   on Count 3 was not vacated, and the district court properly held that the Count 1 sentence was not open to challenge under\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   . At the initial sentencing, the district court emphasized that the concurrent 220-month sentences on Counts 1 and 3 were based on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, not on the ACCA and career offender determinations. The court explicitly stated \"that it would have imposed the same sentence had it sustained defendant's ... objections.\" Thus, the record gives us no basis to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in not ordering a complete resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v.

The district court ruled that Smith failed to establish that appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance, relying on our prior decisions holding that \"[t]he failure of counsel to anticipate a rule of law that has yet to be articulated does not render counsel's performance professionally unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

Smith argues that appellate counsel knew or should have known that the Supreme Court had granted certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and that its decision could potentially impact whether the district court erred in overruling Smith's objection to counting his fleeing convictions as violent felonies and crimes of violence.
