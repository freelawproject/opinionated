Kayla Butts (\"Butts\"), A.F.'s mother, brought this action claiming A.F.'s brain damage was caused by the medical malpractice of Dr. Sarah Hardy. More specifically, Butts contends that Dr. Hardy should have transferred A.F. from the hospital where A.F. was born to a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit (\"NICU\") that could have provided the care A.F. needed in the hours after her birth. After a bench trial, the district court agreed and awarded Butts over seven million dollars in damages. On appeal, we consider whether Butts presented sufficient evidence to establish that Dr. Hardy violated the applicable standard of care. Because the district court's finding on this issue was clearly erroneous, we reverse the district court's order and vacate the judgment against Dr. Hardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Butts delivered A.F. at Berkeley Medical Center (\"Berkeley\") in Martinsburg, West Virginia. Berkeley did not have a NICU, so infants who required additional support were cared for in Berkeley's \"Max Care Nursery.\" The Max Care Nursery offered specialized care to newborn infants, including an oxygen-delivery system and equipment to provide intubation. However, the Max Care Nursery did not have all the equipment found in a NICU, including a breathing device known as a continuous positive airway pressure (\"CPAP\") machine. Infants delivered at Berkeley who needed specialized care Berkeley could not provide were often transported to the NICU at Winchester Medical Center (\"Winchester\") in Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of these events, Berkeley was working to establish a NICU of its own. To that end, Berkeley hired Dr. Avinash Purohit, a board-certified neonatologist,\n   to establish and manage a NICU. But Dr. Purohit arrived at Berkeley only a few days before A.F.'s birth and had not yet established a NICU.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.F. was born at Berkeley around 9:00 a.m. and immediately exhibited signs of respiratory distress. In the minutes following delivery, A.F.'s Apgar score-a diagnostic tool that allows a physician to evaluate a child's physical health by measuring breathing effort, heart rate, muscle tone, reflexes and skin color-was low. Nurses provided immediate treatment to aid A.F.'s breathing, including suctioning A.F.'s airway. Ten minutes after birth, A.F.'s Apgar score had improved, but, because of these initial complications, she was transferred to Berkeley's Max Care Nursery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dr. Hardy, a pediatrician, was on call the morning of A.F.'s birth. Soon after A.F. was delivered, the hospital paged Dr. Hardy, and she arrived around 9:15 a.m. Dr. Hardy noticed A.F.'s respiratory distress and low glucose levels. She prescribed antibiotics to prevent infection and ordered a range of tests and diagnostics to assess A.F.'s breathing problems. Dr. Hardy also placed A.F. under an oxyhood, a device that provides supplemental oxygen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Hardy then returned to her office for a few hours, while maintaining telephone contact with the attending nurse. While she was away, A.F., with the aid of the oxyhood, maintained acceptable oxygen-saturation levels, but continued to experience breathing difficulty. Dr. Hardy came back to Berkeley around noon. At that time, A.F. was not improving. For that reason, Dr. Hardy initially decided to transfer A.F. to the Winchester NICU. However, a nurse manager at Berkeley suggested that Dr. Hardy consult Dr. Purohit prior to transfer. Dr. Hardy consulted with Dr. Purohit around 1:30 p.m. that afternoon. Dr. Purohit assured Dr. Hardy that Berkeley had the necessary equipment and staffing for him to provide care to A.F., and he specifically told Dr. Hardy that a transfer to the Winchester NICU was unnecessary. After that discussion, Dr. Purohit agreed to take A.F. on as his patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After taking over A.F.'s care, Dr. Purohit ordered tests and altered A.F.'s treatments. While there is some dispute as to whether Dr. Hardy complied with Berkeley's internal procedures for completing a formal transfer of responsibility for A.F.'s care to Dr. Purohit, the district court assumed that Dr. Hardy's responsibility for A.F. terminated at 2:45 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the next twenty-four hours, A.F.'s condition continued to deteriorate. Ultimately, on the afternoon of the day following A.F.'s birth, Dr. Purohit ordered her to be transferred to the NICU at Winchester. A.F. remained there for nearly a month. While the parties dispute the timing and cause, there is no dispute A.F. suffered irreversible brain injury from the insufficient flow of oxygenated blood to her brain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a result of A.F.'s injuries, Butts sued multiple defendants including Berkeley, Dr. Purohit and Dr. Hardy alleging medical malpractice. Because Dr. Hardy was employed by a federally-funded hospital, the United States substituted itself on behalf of Dr. Hardy under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201346\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), 2671 - 2680. Prior to trial, all defendants except the United States settled with Butts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Butts's claim against the United States proceeded to a bench trial. After the trial, the district court issued findings in favor of Butts. The district court concluded \"the standard of care required that A.F. be transferred to a NICU and receive the level of care that is only available in a NICU, such as the one at [Winchester].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   J.A. 281. The court found \"Dr. Hardy should have transferred A.F. to [Winchester] the same afternoon A.F. was born ....\" J.A. 281. The court further found Dr. Hardy was not absolved by her transfer of care to Dr. Purohit because, even though he was a board-certified neonatologist, he \"was without a NICU. Thus, at a minimum, he lacked the appropriate equipment, specialized staff or necessary protocols to adequately assess and treat a baby who needed intensive care.\" J.A. 281. The district court concluded that Dr. Hardy's failure to follow the applicable standard of care caused A.F.'s injuries and awarded Butts over seven million dollars in damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The United States filed a timely appeal.

Partridge, a physician who is board-certified in pediatrics and neonatal perinatal medicine. Dr. Partridge, the expert the district court found to be the most credible, testified to a reasonable degree of medical probability that by noon \"the child, I think would have been better served, far better served in a different hospital.\" J.A. 500. Dr. Partridge further opined that, because of A.F.'s continuing symptoms and deteriorating condition, \"that child should have been transferred.\" J.A. 501. But Dr. Partridge significantly qualified his opinion on cross-examination when he acknowledged that transfer to a NICU was not required. Rather, Dr. Partridge opined \"the child should have been transferred either to a higher level of care within Berkeley Medical Center or to a NICU.\" J.A. 525. Dr. Partridge then acknowledged that Dr. Hardy did in fact transfer A.F. to Dr. Purohit, a board-certified neonatologist who had been hired to start a NICU at Berkeley. Dr. Partridge also opined on cross that the first time Dr. Purohit was required to transfer A.F. under the applicable standard of care was at 11:15 p.m. that night. Critically, this was almost nine hours after Dr. Hardy transferred care to Dr. Purohit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on Dr. Partridge's testimony, Dr. Hardy did not violate any generally applicable standard of care. As discussed, a physician is not required to provide a patient with \"the highest degree of care possible.\"\n   <em>\n    Bellomy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"574204\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/888/760/#p765\">\n    888 F. Supp. at 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, where there is more than one acceptable method of treatment, the physician\n   need not choose the best method.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 766. Here, Dr. Partridge testified that Dr. Hardy could satisfy the standard of care by either transferring A.F. to a higher level of care within Berkeley Medical Center or to a NICU. The facts show, and Dr. Partridge acknowledges, that Dr. Hardy chose to transfer A.F. to a higher level of care within Berkeley by transferring care to Dr. Purohit. Based on Dr. Partridge's own testimony this was an acceptable method of treatment for Dr. Hardy to pursue, whether or not it was the best method of treatment. Therefore, Dr. Partridge's testimony fails to establish that Dr. Hardy breached the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Butts next presented the testimony of Dr. Carol Miller, a board-certified pediatrician. Dr. Miller testified that Dr. Hardy breached the applicable standard of care by not transferring A.F. to a NICU. While she testified generally about other benefits of a NICU, Dr. Miller explained that A.F. needed to be transferred to a NICU to receive treatment with a CPAP machine or intubation. More specifically, when asked about the care A.F. would have received at a NICU that she did not receive at Berkeley, Dr. Miller responded \"[m]ost importantly is enhanced respiratory support .... That could be in the way of CPAP, which is a method of giving increased pressure, or it could be intubating, which is what this baby needed ....\" J.A. 755-76. Dr. Miller did not testify that a CPAP machine was medically necessary or preferable to intubation. Rather, she indicated that either a CPAP machine or intubation could be used under the circumstances. Dr. Partridge agreed, testifying that the choice between using a CPAP machine and intubation is \"a management style choice.\" J.A. 481-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Whether Dr. Miller realized it or not, intubation was available at Berkeley. Indeed, Dr. Purohit testified that he intubated a baby the first day he arrived at Berkeley, and the district court identified only one specific NICU-level intervention, a CPAP machine, that was not available at Berkeley. Because Dr. Hardy transferred A.F. to Dr. Purohit, who had the expertise and equipment to perform the treatment Dr. Miller said A.F. needed, Dr. Hardy's conduct did not fall below the standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We are mindful of our responsibility to consider the district court's findings on breach in light of the entire record. With that in mind, when the complete testimony of Dr. Partridge and Dr. Miller is considered together, Butts presented evidence that Dr. Hardy was required to transfer A.F. to a higher level of care to receive enhanced respiratory intervention. But that is what Dr. Hardy did. Dr. Hardy transferred A.F. to a board-certified neonatologist, Dr. Purohit, who assured Dr. Hardy that he had the equipment and ability to care for A.F. at Berkeley. Dr. Purohit had the ability to provide more aggressive respiratory intervention, including intubation. Intubation is the exact procedure that Dr. Miller said was required. And Dr. Partridge opined that once Dr. Hardy transferred care to Dr. Purohit, Dr. Purohit was not required to transfer A.F. to a NICU until 11:15 p.m. that evening. If Dr. Purohit was not required to transfer A.F. to a NICU until 11:15 p.m., it cannot have been malpractice for Dr. Hardy to transfer A.F. to Dr. Purohit to receive an elevated level of care at 1:45 p.m. earlier that afternoon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After reviewing the whole record, we are firmly convinced the district court's finding that Dr. Hardy breached the standard of care was a mistake. The district court's finding as to breach was not supported by substantial evidence in the record and was thus clearly erroneous. Specifically, the district court's finding on breach was not supported by Butts's own expert testimony. Therefore, despite the sympathy we feel for A.F., the district court's order finding Dr. Hardy liable for medical malpractice must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because we hold the district court erred in finding Dr. Hardy liable for malpractice, we need not address the remaining issues raised by the United States.
