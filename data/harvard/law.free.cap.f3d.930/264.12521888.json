The scheme authorizes Virginia to obtain, in absentia, a civil interdiction order against persons it deems \"habitual drunkards,\" and then permits Virginia to rely on the interdiction order to criminally prosecute conduct permitted for all others of legal drinking age. Plaintiffs allege that this scheme, which has resulted in their repeated arrest and imprisonment, violates the Constitution. The district court dismissed their complaint, holding that they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. After a panel of this Court affirmed, we agreed to rehear the case en banc. For the reasons that follow, we now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), we accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Virginia Code \u00a7 4.1-333(A) permits a Virginia circuit court to enter a civil interdiction order \"prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages ... until further ordered\" to a person who \"has been convicted of driving ... while intoxicated or has shown himself to be an habitual drunkard.\" The Virginia statutory scheme does not include a definition of the term \"habitual drunkard,\" nor does it set forth any elements or standards governing the determination whether a defendant qualifies as an \"habitual drunkard.\" Va. Code \u00a7 4.1-333. Instead, it relegates those matters \"to the satisfaction of the circuit court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And although Virginia Code \u00a7 4.1-333 requires that any individual potentially\n   subject to interdiction be permitted a \"hearing upon due notice,\" the record shows that such hearings often are conducted without the defendant being present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once declared an \"habitual drunkard,\" an interdicted person is subject to incarceration for the mere possession of or attempt to possess alcohol, or for being drunk in public. Virginia Code \u00a7 4.1-322 establishes a Class 1 misdemeanor for an interdicted person to \"possess any alcoholic beverages,\" or to be \"drunk in public\" in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-388. Similarly, Virginia Code \u00a7 4.1-305 establishes a Class 1 misdemeanor prohibiting an interdicted person from \"consum[ing], purchas[ing], or possess[ing], or attempt[ing] to consume, purchase or possess, any alcoholic beverage,\" except in certain statutorily exempt circumstances, such as the use of medicines containing alcohol.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The punishment for these crimes is \"confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both.\" Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-11(a). Individuals who have not been interdicted are subject only to a \"fine of not more than $250\" for public intoxication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-388, 18.2-11(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Each of the named Plaintiffs in this case, Bryan Manning, Ryan Williams, Richard Deckerhoff, and Richard Eugene Walls, alleges that he has been interdicted as an \"habitual drunkard\" pursuant to this statutory scheme. Each alleges that he suffers from alcohol use disorder, commonly called alcoholism, which causes him a \"profound drive or craving to use alcohol\" that is \"compulsive or non-volitional.\" Each further alleges that he is homeless and that his homelessness exacerbates his addiction, \"mak[ing] it nearly impossible ... to cease or mitigate alcohol consumption.\" Notably, however, nothing in the complaint or elsewhere in the record indicates that any Plaintiff was convicted of any alcohol-related offenses before being interdicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that, although by its terms the challenged scheme is not limited to the homeless, in practice it functions as a tool to rid the streets of particularly vulnerable, unwanted alcoholics like themselves. In support of this claim, they allege that although there were 4,743 prosecutions for the crime of \"possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages by interdicted persons\" during the decade preceding 2015, only 1,220 distinct individuals were interdicted between 2007 and 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Each of the named Plaintiffs asserts that he has been repeatedly criminally prosecuted after interdiction, often on dubious grounds. Some say they have been prosecuted as many as 25 to 30 times. In each instance, Plaintiffs faced (and allege they will again face) arrest, prosecution, and incarceration for up to a year in prison, all for conduct permitted for all others of legal drinking age. They allege that the\n   \"habitual drunkard\" label also has adversely affected their ability to maintain employment and secure long-term housing, and has subjected them to continual harassment and embarrassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In March 2016, the named Plaintiffs filed this putative class action alleging that the Virginia scheme (1) constituted cruel and unusual punishment outlawed by the Eighth Amendment, (2) deprived them of due process of the law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, (3) denied them the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment, and (4) was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The district court considered and rejected all four claims and so dismissed the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In rejecting Plaintiffs' vagueness and Eighth Amendment claims, the district court relied largely on a 1979 district court opinion, which this Court summarily affirmed.\n   <em>\n    Fisher v.

Although the question of vagueness was fully litigated and decided in the district court, Plaintiffs expressly declined to \"press this claim\" before the original three-judge panel. Thus, the Commonwealth now contends that the issue has been waived before the en banc Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Mindful of our role as a neutral arbiter, this Court typically does not \"ventur[e] beyond the confines of the case on appeal to address arguments the parties have deemed unworthy of orderly mention.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dissent at 301 (Wilkinson, J.). In doing so, however, he inverts Virginia's statutory scheme. Once labelled an \"habitual drunkard,\" a person may be on notice about the conduct prohibited, but it does not follow that the person was also on notice that he or she could be interdicted.

To begin, the word \"habitual\" is itself susceptible to numerous interpretations. \"Habitual\" means \"of the nature of a habit ... customarily doing a certain thing.\"\n    <em>\n     Habitual\n    </em>\n    , Webster's International Dictionary (3d ed. 2002).

For example, must a person engage in a pattern of drinking over time that establishes a \"normal manner of procedure,\" or is it enough that the person drinks many alcoholic beverages over an extended period? Or is a \"habit\" established if the person drinks numerous alcoholic beverages only every Friday and Saturday night? The language of the challenged scheme does not provide any guidance to answer these or a myriad of other questions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Likewise, the term \"drunkard\" does not provide any meaningful guidance regarding proscribed conduct. In\n    <em>\n     Hancock v. Cox\n    </em>\n    , the Supreme Court of Virginia held that a civil statute providing for the commitment of \"alcoholics\" was unconstitutionally vague, because the statute lacked any definition to determine \"when a person is an alcoholic.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2115352\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/212/215/\">\n     212 Va. 215\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20S.E.2d%20149\">\n     183 S.E.2d 149\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 151-52 (1971). Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Booth v. Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    , the court held an earlier version of this scheme, which provided for the interdiction of any person who has \"shown himself to be an\n    <em>\n     improper person\n    </em>\n    to be allowed to purchase alcoholic beverages,\" to be impermissibly vague, because the term \"improper person\" allowed \"arbitrary interpretation\" and enforcement.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2061395\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/197/177/\">\n     197 Va. 177\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20S.E.2d%20916\">\n     88 S.E.2d 916\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 917-18 (1955) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The same is true here. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"drunkard\" as \"[s]omeone who habitually consumes intoxicating substances excessively\" or \"[an] alcoholic.\"\n    <em>\n     Drunkard\n    </em>\n    , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). To our dissenting colleagues, this type of general definition is the end of the matter. Dissent at 302 (Wilkinson, J.); Dissent at 306 (Diaz, J.). But such a conclusion relies entirely on a tautology: a person who drinks alcoholic beverages excessively is a drunkard and, therefore, a person would easily understand that a person is an \"habitual drunkard\" if they regularly drink alcohol to excess. This definition entirely fails to answer the question of what the Virginia's interdiction scheme meant by \"drunkard.\" General definitions of the term \"drunkard\" do not identify how much alcohol a person must consume before such consumption is considered \"excessive\" or, as noted above, what frequency of behavior constitutes a \"habit.\" Thus, such definitions fail to impart any standards for determining whether a given individual is a \"drunkard.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    This absence of meaningful guidance is further illustrated when the term \"habitual drunkard\" is compared with the word \"intoxicated\" as used in Virginia's public intoxication statute. A conviction for public intoxication requires proof that a person is \"intoxicated.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-388. \"Intoxication\" in turn is expressly defined as \"a condition in which a person has drunk enough alcoholic beverages to observably affect his manner, disposition, speech,\n    muscular movement, general appearance or behavior.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20S.E.2d%20916\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4.1-100. Thus, a person in a public place who has consumed enough alcohol to impair his physical movement or speech is notified by the language and definitions in Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-388 of the conditions under which he may be charged with public intoxication.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In contrast, this scheme lacks any substantive guidance regarding what is required to establish that a person is an \"habitual drunkard.\" Indeed, the fact that Virginia's Alcoholic Beverage Control Act specified what behavior constitutes being \"intoxicated\" with respect to the state's public intoxication offense, Va. Code \u00a7 4.1-100, but left undefined the term \"habitual drunkard\" in its interdiction scheme,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174064\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/588/#p597\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4-1.333, demonstrates that the legislature intended each term to target different behavior,\n    <em>\n     Forst v.

The first problem with this argument is that the record lacks any indication of the conduct that led to Plaintiffs' interdictions. Each of the named Plaintiffs were interdicted in absentia, and so have no knowledge of the evidence that was relied upon by the court in determining that they are \"habitual drunkards.\" Although the interdiction orders for Manning and Williams state that the court considered \"abstract[s] of conviction\" as part of the evidence submitted in those plaintiffs' respective hearings, the interdiction orders consist entirely of boilerplate language that does not identify any offense on which\n    those convictions were based, or the number of such convictions. And, as counsel for the Commonwealth admitted during oral argument, there is no requirement that a person be convicted of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    offense to be interdicted as an \"habitual drunkard.\" Thus, the interdiction orders, without more, do not establish that Plaintiffs' conduct clearly was encompassed by Virginia's scheme.\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Moreover, Plaintiffs' acknowledgement that they have difficulty maintaining sobriety due to alcoholism does not establish that they are \"habitual drunkards.\" Plaintiffs are not charged with the responsibility of defining statutory terms, and their acknowledgement of illness says nothing about the sweep of the statutory scheme.

Recall that Virginia law first permits a court to enter a civil interdiction order \"prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages ... until further ordered\" to a person who \"has shown himself to be an habitual drunkard.\" Va. Code \u00a7 4.1-333(A). Then state law makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor - punishable by up to a year in jail,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Va.

If the statute challenged in\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    had instead allowed California to \"interdict\" prescription drug addicts and then arrest interdicted addicts for filling those prescriptions, the statute\n    <em>\n     effectively\n    </em>\n    would also have criminalized \"being addicted to narcotics\" even if it\n    <em>\n     nominally\n    </em>\n    punished only filling prescriptions. Such a statute would surely be just as unconstitutional as the statute in\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    , and for precisely the same reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Similarly, although Virginia's statutory scheme may nominally penalize \"possession\" or \"consumption,\" even a sufficiently definite construction limited to alcoholics effectively targets and punishes Plaintiffs based on their illness, which\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    holds violates the Eighth Amendment.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    As Justice White explained, the thin distinction between \"hav[ing] an irresistible compulsion\" and \"yield[ing] to such a compulsion\" is not one of constitutional magnitude under\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172531\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/514/\">\n     392 U.S. at 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175648,6172531\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/88/2145/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 2145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (White, J., concurring in the result). That the Commonwealth civilly brands alcoholics as \"habitual drunkards\" before prosecuting them for involuntary manifestations of their illness does nothing to cure the unconstitutionality of this statutory scheme.\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    We therefore conclude that, even if the term \"habitual drunkard\" could be construed to apply only to those who suffer from alcoholism, Plaintiffs have stated an independent claim that the challenged statute violates the Eighth Amendment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Our Eighth Amendment holding is narrow. Consistent with\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs have limited their Eighth Amendment challenge to what they allege is targeted criminalization, in the first instance, of conduct that is an involuntary manifestation of their illness, and that is otherwise legal for the general population. Put differently, Plaintiffs allege that, as applied to them, the challenged statutory scheme threatens them with arrest and incarceration for conduct that is not proscribed as a consequence of a prior criminal conviction, does not rest on even a single volitional element, and is lawful for all others of legal drinking age.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Plaintiffs do not challenge the constitutionality of any restrictions imposed after conviction of a crime, and our holding does not prevent the government from utilizing such prophylactic measures to thwart criminal misconduct. Unquestionably, courts may restrict an individual's liberty pursuant to a criminal sentence, and (in some cases) may continue to do so after his formal sentence has concluded. Courts are thus entitled in appropriate cases to impose and enforce targeted restrictions as conditions of supervised release, probation, parole, or release from criminal custody, even on persons who suffer from certain illnesses.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d) (permitting district courts to order conditions of supervised release that, among other things, \"involve[ ] no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203553\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(B)-(D) );\n    <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n     34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (establishing sex offender registry);\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    . \u00a7 20911(1) (defining \"sex offender\" as \"an individual who was convicted of a sex offense\"). Plaintiffs' limited challenge does not implicate such post-conviction restrictions, nor does our holding cast any doubt on their continued viability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Plaintiffs also wisely confine their Eighth Amendment challenge to conduct that is an involuntary manifestation of the very illness that triggers the Commonwealth's scheme.\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    , and our holding here are so cabined. Thus, our analysis does not call into question substantive criminal laws, like penalties for underage drinking and prohibitions against driving while intoxicated, that do not involve conduct that is an\n    <em>\n     involuntary manifestation\n    </em>\n    of an illness.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Moreover, Plaintiffs do not seek an exemption from generally applicable criminal laws, and our reasoning does not offer them one. A state undoubtedly has the power to prosecute individuals, even those suffering from illnesses, for breaking laws that apply to the general population. That is so because such laws - even when enforced against sick people - reflect a state's considered judgment that some actions\n    are\n    <em>\n     so dangerous\n    </em>\n    or contrary to the public welfare that they should lead to criminal liability\n    <em>\n     for everyone\n    </em>\n    who commits them. Faithfully following\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    , as we do, does not provide an alcoholic escape from prosecution for such behavior.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172531\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/514/\">\n     392 U.S. at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    552 n.4,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175648,6172531\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/88/2145/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 2145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (White, J., concurring) (emphasizing that the Eighth Amendment does not bar a state from convicting \"the heavily intoxicated, compulsive alcoholic ... for committing crimes involving much greater risk to society\").

And what message do we send to trial judges and lawyers who know that such assertions are false? Will they view these broadsides as evidence of institutional disharmony? Such attacks are not part of a \"vigorous exchange of views,\" but instead detract from any substantive analysis.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    As judges, we all take our duty to faithfully interpret the law as a solemn obligation. That we reach different conclusions in applying the law to a given case should be of no moment. What is truly important is that we have a legal system that allows for good-faith disagreements and provides for further review by a higher court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-102\">\n    Our Court has a cherished tradition of civility. In that spirit, I express hope that we will turn away from the use of inflammatory language, which diminishes the value of our work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    WILKINSON, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges NIEMEYER, AGEE, RICHARDSON, QUATTLEBAUM, and Senior Judge DUNCAN join, dissenting:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    This ought to be a straightforward case. But the majority asks this court to take two unprecedented steps. First, it asks that we find-as no court previously has-that addiction gives rise to an Eighth Amendment right to abuse dangerous substances without the imposition of any criminal sanctions. Second, it insists that we expand vagueness doctrine to invalidate a civil statute that clearly delineates the conduct within its ambit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    The Eighth Amendment leaves to the states the decision as to which acts are worthy of the community's opprobrium. And so long as the state's proscriptions give sufficient notice of what acts are culpable, the vagueness doctrine does not stand in the way. The Virginia statutes at issue here prohibit specific acts regarding alcohol and do so for a variety of legitimate reasons. That should be all that is required.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Instead of simply applying the law as it is, my colleagues strive for something new; thrusting our court into not one, but two, jurisprudential quagmires. First, the majority has found-in the Eighth Amendment's\n    prohibition on \"cruel and unusual\" punishments, of all places-constitutional protection for any act that is alleged to be \"non-volitional,\" i.e. the result of some compulsion. Maj. Op. at 269. In doing so, it has discarded any pretense of a workable limiting principle, expanded the Eighth Amendment beyond any discernible limits, and overturned sixty years of controlling Supreme Court precedent (Part I).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    Unfortunately, Supreme Court precedent will not be the only victim of this decision. The majority's new theory of the Eighth Amendment will foreclose a state's ability to take reasonable steps to protect its citizens from serious and long recognized harms. The consequences will fall on the most vulnerable, especially the victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault. How ironic that the majority would stand on the cusp of the centennial of women's suffrage and deal a setback not only to the physical safety of women, but to their basic right to peace of mind (Part II). Its decision will also interject the federal courts into areas traditionally and wisely reserved for the states, subverting both the democratic process and dual sovereignty (Part III.A). The majority, moreover, has converted the Eighth Amendment into a constitutional provision for all seasons, designed to do what other constitutional provisions manifestly cannot (Part III.B).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    It is hard to believe a single decision could inflict more damage, but this one proceeds to do just that. The majority, in an alternative holding, invokes the Due Process Clause to contort vagueness doctrine beyond recognition. It takes what has heretofore been a limited principle and extends it to a civil statute that is not only clear on its face, but exists solely for the purpose of giving fair notice of what the law requires. The majority's notion of civil vagueness imperils a whole range of previously uncontroversial statutes (Part IV).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    My colleagues in the majority strain to present this case as \"narrow\" and inconsequential; a judicial ticket good for one train only. Maj. Op. at 283-84. I am not comforted. There is nothing \"narrow\" about the majority's holding or its reasoning. This case is an assault upon the constitutional, democratic, and common law foundations of American civil and criminal law, and most importantly, to the judge's place within it. I cannot join journeys whose destinations are so shrouded in uncertainty. One day the last dolorous rays of sun will set upon the majority's approach. Sooner rather than later, I hope. But in all events, eventually, at the United States Supreme Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    I.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    I begin with the Eighth Amendment question, for which we granted en banc review in the first place.\n    <footnotemark>\n     *\n    </footnotemark>\n    The majority professes to believe that states have \"broad authority to define and prosecute criminal offenses,\" Maj. Op. at 279, but proceeds to hold that the Eighth Amendment nonetheless imposes a limit on a state's ability to proscribe\n    <em>\n     specific conduct\n    </em>\n    in its criminal law.

Maj. Op. at 280-85. By venturing so far from the Supreme Court's guidance, the majority has adopted a view of the Eighth Amendment that has never been necessary to the Supreme Court's resolution of any single case. The\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    decision, as earlier noted, was a 4-1-4 decision. Faced with a such a decision, which lacks a clear majority rationale for the judgment, federal courts are instructed that the \"holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest ground.\"\n    <em>\n     Marks v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122537\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/188/\">\n     430 U.S. 188\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 193,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122537\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/188/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 990\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12122537\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/188/\">\n     51 L.Ed.2d 260\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1977) (quotations omitted). There may well be difficult cases concerning how best to apply\n    <em>\n     Marks\n    </em>\n    , but this is not one of them. As mentioned above, Justice Marshall's decision for four justices in\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    upheld the statute on the basis of the status-act distinction. Justice White concurred in this judgment because the statute in question involved an act that was clearly volitional, forestalling the need to examine whether and under what conditions nonvolitional conduct might be constitutionally shielded from criminal sanctions. The majority improperly pulls from this concurrence, which took pains not to decide a constitutional question, a new constitutional rule: that states may not criminalize conduct \"compelled by [a person's] illness.\" Maj. Op. at 281. The problem, of course, is that this new rule is found nowhere in the Court's holding. The majority's quotation of selected sentences from the concurring opinion fails to recognize the ultimate point that Justice White never purported to reach the central question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Because Justice White took a narrow view of the case, leaving the broader issues to the side, the\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    decision does not overturn or in any way disrupt\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    . There has never been any holding that\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    's status-act distinction has yielded to a new test focused on compulsion. As Judge Wilkey noted shortly after\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    , \"the interpretation that\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    held that it was not criminal to give in to the irresistible compulsion of a 'disease[ ]' weaves in and out of the\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    opinions, but there [was] definitely no Supreme Court holding to this effect.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. Moore\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"222873,3592366\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/486/1139/\">\n     486 F.2d 1139\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1150 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (en banc) (plurality opinion). The absence of such a holding, as well as the Supreme Court's repeated references to the status-act distinction as the law, means that we are bound to respect\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    until some clearer and more definitive guidance emerges. Those who see in the\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    decision a repudiation of\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    are mistaking themselves for occupants of a higher bench.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    What we are left with, then, is simply a matter of fact. And as a matter of fact, for nearly sixty years courts at all levels have consistently affirmed\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    's basic holding: although states may not criminalize status, they may criminalize actual behavior even when the individual alleges\n    that addiction created a strong urge to engage in a particular act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The status-act distinction has endured because it works. States are given a clear constitutional line to respect in crafting their criminal laws. Lower courts are given a simple and principled directive to apply when assessing those laws in subsequent proceedings. By contrast, the majority's alternative \"afford[s] substantial, if not controlling deference to dicta.\" Maj. Op. at 281. But the majority's approach utterly fails to provide a workable test for defining compulsion, which is the predictable result of relying on guidance divorced from what was necessary to resolve a concrete dispute. Nor does the majority explain why such a test, whatever it is, applies to alcohol consumption, but is not equally applicable to narcotics use, sexual molestations, or other allegedly compelled acts. If the Supreme Court had ever rested an Eighth Amendment decision on the compelled nature of an act, there would likely be an answer to these questions. But because the majority has ventured far beyond the Court's actual judgments, it strands the doctrine at sea. Much better for us, in assessing an Eighth Amendment challenge, to limit our review to whether the law at issue has proscribed specific conduct, or in common law terms, an\n    <em>\n     actus reus\n    </em>\n    . If yes, our task comes to an end.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    So yet again, the question for us is whether we should permit a 4-1-4 opinion that is at most ambiguous to overturn or greatly extend a longstanding and widely recognized Supreme Court opinion that the Court itself has repeatedly referenced and has never once seen fit to repudiate or otherwise disavow. It is in the end a matter of respecting both the Supreme Court's authority to overturn its own decisions, and the limits of a circuit court's authority to find circuitous routes around higher controlling precedent. The principle embodied in that precedent is plain. The vitality of\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    is simply not an open question.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    Under the status-act distinction, which must govern our consideration of this case, the Virginia statutes pose no defect whatsoever. Virginia has been careful to draft a statutory scheme that falls on the constitutional side of the line drawn in\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    . This scheme is comprised of two parts: one civil and one criminal. The interdiction provision set forth in \u00a7 4.1-333 is a civil enactment. Under that provision, a person can be interdicted, and therefore subject to specific alcohol-related prohibitions, on the basis of either a drunk driving conviction or designation as a \"habitual drunkard.\" An interdiction order is not accompanied by imprisonment or a punitive fine. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on \"cruel and unusual punishment\" has obvious criminal purposes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ingraham v. Wright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126861\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/651/#p667\">\n     430 U.S. 651\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 664,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126861\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/651/#p667\">\n     97 S.Ct. 1401\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12126861\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/651/#p667\">\n     51 L.Ed.2d 711\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1977). A provision that puts a person on notice that\n    <em>\n     future acts\n    </em>\n    may result in criminal sanctions does not criminalize status for the simple reason that it does not criminalize anything. It is the\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    Virginia provisions, not \u00a7 4.1-333, that impose criminal sanctions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    While criminal prohibitions do come into play in \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-322 and 4.1-305, those prohibitions apply only to affirmative acts: to \"possess any alcoholic beverages\" or to \"be drunk in public,\" and to \"consume, purchase or possess, or attempt to consume, purchase or possess, any alcoholic beverage.\" The whole world, apart from the majority, knows these things are acts. Appellants were arrested on the basis of committing these acts. That stands in stark contrast to the statute at issue in\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    , under which a defendant could be charged even if the state never showed\n    that he \"used or possessed any narcotics.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     370 U.S. at 666\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     82 S.Ct. 1417\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The defendant's alleged compulsion simply does not enter into this analysis. The majority implausibly claims that the plaintiffs' \"drinking is not 'voluntary,' \" and so, somehow, \"\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    would require the same result.\" Maj. Op. at 282. But the problem in\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    , as the Court explained, was not that the criminal sanction applied to \"compelled,\" \"involuntary,\" or \"nonvolitional\" acts; the problem was that the law applied to no act at all. The Virginia statutes do not \"criminaliz[e] Plaintiffs' illness,\" Maj. Op. at 282; they criminalize specific acts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Va. Code Ann., \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-322, 4.1-305. They therefore lack the core defect of the law in\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    I emphasize what I hope would be obvious: it would be unlawful for the state to simply round up \"undesirable\" persons based on their perceived status as addicts or drunkards.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p160\">\n     405 U.S. 156\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p160\">\n     92 S.Ct. 839\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p160\">\n     31 L.Ed.2d 110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1972). It is inimical to personal dignity and liberty to bring criminal charges on the basis of who someone is. To allow any sort of roundup exercise would not only grossly augment the power of the state, but put that power to the most pernicious use. For that reason, there must be some behavioral link set forth in the law. But Virginia has been careful to observe that line. It has prohibited individuals deemed at a higher risk of alcohol abuse from possessing or consuming alcohol. This category includes not only habitual drunkards, but also people who have been convicted of drunk driving offenses and those under twenty-one.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4.1-305.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Perhaps aware that the status-act distinction is still operative, the majority strains to fit within the test, arguing that Virginia law \"\n    <em>\n     effectively\n    </em>\n    criminalizes an illness.\" Maj. Op. at 283 (emphasis added). That argument, however, again ignores the fact that the Virginia scheme\n    <em>\n     actually\n    </em>\n    bases criminal liability on specific acts.\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     370 U.S. at 662\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     82 S.Ct. 1417\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Those acts can be done by any person subject to interdiction, regardless of their status as \"homeless\" or \"alcoholic.\" The majority's claim that Virginia \"nominally penalize[s] 'possession' or 'consumption,' ... [but] effectively targets and punishes Plaintiffs based on their illness,\" Maj. Op. at 283, not only mischaracterizes Virginia law, but threatens to change the character of criminal law as we have known it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Which laws criminalize illness and which do not? In trying to cabin its new constitutional theory, the majority emphasizes time and again that its holding will only reach statutes that criminalize \"otherwise legal behavior.\" Maj. Op. at 285. My colleagues are silent, however, on just where this limit comes from. Surely not\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    or\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    , both of which dealt with generally applicable criminal laws. Even Justice White's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    noted that a constitutional test based on volition would collapse into factual squabbles about what constitutes addiction, what constitutes compulsion, and what crimes are serious enough to, in the court's view, overcome the nonvolitional claims of the accused.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172531\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/514/\">\n     392 U.S. at 552, n.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175648,6172531\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/88/2145/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 2145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As the Justices themselves understood, such a position has no plain limiting principle.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    I do not state this lightly. It is wise not to accept casually every \"slippery slope\" or \"open-the-floodgates\" argument that comes along. But in this case the potential breadth of the principle espoused by the appellants and the majority is staggering. Many criminal acts can be alleged to \"effectively\" be the result of some compulsion. Many statutes can be alleged to punish someone's illness. If human behavior is viewed as something over which human beings lack control, and for which they are\n    not responsible, the implications are boundless. The examples extend beyond the discrete context of substance addiction. For instance, child molesters could challenge their convictions on the basis that their criminal acts were the product of uncontrollable pedophilic urges and therefore beyond the purview of criminal law.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kansas v.

The same could be said not only of sex offenders, but of stalkers, domestic abusers, and others driven by impulses they were allegedly powerless to check. The Eighth Amendment has not, before today, been thought to absolve them of their wrongs.

We all know the familiar story: a man pockets his Friday paycheck, heads off to the nearest bar, and stumbles home to commit what are too often unconscionable acts. The women's groups who led the Temperance Movement understood this menace all too well, and made violence in the home a rallying cry for their cause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Note, Bernadette Dunn Sewell, History of Abuse: Societal, Judicial, and Legislative Responses to the Problem of Wife Beating, 23 Suffolk L.

Am. Med. Ass'n 1369 (1997). While Virginia's regulatory scheme applies to rich and poor alike, many crimes, fueled by alcohol, fall hardest\n    on the most vulnerable. Women of limited means often lack the resources to engage counsel in cases of domestic abuse or to escape brutal treatment in what should be inviolate sanctuaries in their lives. Similarly, the sexual violence on American campuses is largely driven by \"[m]en who reported heavy drinking.\" Christopher P. Krebs et al.,\n    <em>\n     The Campus Sexual\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Assault (CSA) Study\n    </em>\n    , Nat'l Inst. of Just., at 2-11 (October 2007).

Virginia has developed a comprehensive policy to confront the pervasive problem of alcohol abuse. But the majority, despite its protests to the contrary, would use \"the Eighth Amendment [to] tie the hands of state officials.\" Maj. Op. at 285. The interdiction statute at issue here is one part of Virginia's larger scheme. The law sanctions relatively minor acts, like using and possessing alcohol, in order to forestall more serious criminal misconduct. The statute achieves this result through a two-step approach: first, a civil determination identifies people who are more likely to commit serial and grave offenses.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204.1-333\">\n     Va. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 4.1-334. Second, these individuals are then subject to milder criminal sanctions on relatively small acts to head off more heinous criminal misconduct.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204.1-333\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-322, 4.1-305. Any person who satisfies the criteria for the first step, whether because of drunk driving or habitual drinking, is subject to the criminal prohibitions of the second step. By establishing this framework, Virginia has made the judgment that the purchase or consumption of alcohol by persons with a history of heavy drinking could lead them to commit more dangerous acts, like drunk driving, domestic abuse, or sexual assault.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    States have always been entrusted with regulating addictive substances, most especially alcohol.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Cal.

In exercising its broad powers in this area, Virginia has chosen a prophylactic approach, focusing its resources on those who are most likely to present a heightened future risk. This includes those convicted of drunk driving offenses or prior alcohol-related offenses, as well as those who are designated \"habitual drunkards,\" which can follow from repeated misconduct while intoxicated.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204.1-333\">\n     Va.

In adopting this policy, the state legislature has applied its restrictions to those who have repeatedly failed to comply with alcohol laws in the past, concluding that they are more likely than others to do so in the future. Given that irresponsible alcohol consumption increases the likelihood of more grave offenses, the Commonwealth surely had good reason to think that the population of prior abusers posed a greater risk to the community than others who lack such a history.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The use of such a prophylactic scheme is hardly uncommon. Many laws, state and federal, share the two-step structure adopted by Virginia, which imposes minor sanctions on those who present a heightened danger in order to lessen the risk that the danger will actually come to pass. For example, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) requires federal sex offenders to notify the states where they live and work of their prior conviction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n     34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012). Once the prior conviction has established that a person poses a social risk, his mere failure to register can give rise to criminal liability.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . In that way, SORNA uses criminal law to ensure that past sexual offenders cannot in the future fly under the radar.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-145\">\n    The majority casts SORNA aside by claiming that \"post-conviction restrictions\" are not implicated here. Maj. Op. at 284. The majority distinguishes post-conviction restrictions, such as supervised release, noting that those remain acceptable. That distinction is, to say the least, awkward. The majority purports to hold that schemes such as Virginia's constitute cruel and unusual punishments. Since when are cruel and unusual punishments on nonvolitional conduct suddenly permissible post-conviction? Post-conviction limits are based on the same calibration of restriction to risk as are the Virginia statutes here. The fact that Virginia has elected to fire a warning shot before imposing criminal sanctions is to its credit, not otherwise.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-146\">\n    Other analogies to Virginia's prophylactic approach abound. Federal criminal law, for example, prohibits otherwise routine firearms purchases by individuals who have been found by a court in a civil proceeding to be mentally incompetent. Such restrictions reduce the risk those people pose to themselves and to others.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"286\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (g)(4) ; 924(a)(2). By the same token, a domestic abuser who violates a civil Temporary Restraining Order can be subject to criminal contempt proceedings.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.2-152.10\">\n     Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 19.2-152.10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , et seq. Once someone is found to pose a risk to his spouse or child, the simple act of coming within a certain distance of the protected persons or their home can give rise to criminal liability for \"contempt of court.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2019.2-152.10\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-147\">\n    All of these laws have one thing in common: they apply milder sanctions to less serious infractions, such as the possession, use, or purchase of dangerous items and addictive substances or the failure to register, in order to reduce the risk of grave\n    misconduct involving gun violence, sexual predation, or fatal accidents on the road. Virginia's alcohol laws adopt precisely this approach and similarly present no constitutional infirmity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-148\">\n    The majority renders this approach unconstitutional when the criminal acts are \"both compelled by [the defendant's] illness and [are] otherwise lawful.\" Maj. Op. at 281. The \"otherwise lawful\" limitation is both wholly lacking in authority and ignores the valid reasons\n    <em>\n     why\n    </em>\n    prohibitions apply to some population cohorts and not to others. The reason is simply this: past actions give rise to present and future risks. To say that a state acts impermissibly on this basis is an astonishing proposition, and one that prohibits legislative bodies from making the altogether practical assessments of risky behaviors that are entirely within the legislative prerogative.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    Legislatures, whether state or federal, commonly calibrate restrictions to risk in order to protect the public. The federal Bail Reform Act, for example, authorizes a judge to require pre-trial detention if he finds that \"no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure ... the safety of any other person and the community.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(1).

Contrary to the majority's position that a selective statute is inherently problematic,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Maj.

Virginia's regulatory risk assessment here, like so many state laws that limit the use of automobiles, firearms, and alcohol, reflects the same approach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The majority tries to frame its holding as \"narrow,\" Maj. Op. at 283, affecting only Virginia's purportedly unique scheme.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 283-84, n.20. To repeat, I cannot see how Virginia's prophylactic structure differs from the many others that share its two-step approach. I am therefore left to conclude that the only distinctive feature of what Virginia has done lies in the nature of the offense. As my colleagues apparently see it, consuming alcohol, even by those with a documented history of alcohol abuse, is just not the sort of conduct that warrants criminal sanctions. Given the comprehensive body of research pointing to the harms of alcohol abuse, I cannot agree. More importantly though, I do not feel empowered to weigh in on such a question in the first place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    There are many considerations that can and do inform legislative judgments regarding alcohol and addiction. There are many policy tools available to enforce these judgments once they have been made. Criminal law is but one of them, as are prophylactic laws that focus public resources on those most likely to cause harm. I would hope that settled law was enough to prevent the majority from second-guessing the Commonwealth's judgment. But I find it particularly distressing that at a time when we are beginning to make some modest progress on often alcohol-related offenses such as domestic violence and sexual assault that the majority feels itself empowered to hinder that progress. In doing so, it thwarts the efforts of Virginia to assure that the future of its citizens, and particularly the future of women in the Commonwealth, is measurably\n    more secure than it has been in times past.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    III.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-153\">\n    It is well to take a brief, broader look. The majority decision aspires to rework our constitutional system. It erodes the states' role as separate sovereigns entrusted to define the criminal law within their own borders. And it pushes the Eighth Amendment as a catch-all corrective for perceived ills that other constitutional provisions have left unredressed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    The majority upends our system of dual sovereignty. It puts judges in policymaking roles reserved largely for legislatures and states. The reason for legislative responsibility over criminal law is fundamental: the criminal law exists to protect the safety of citizens, and ensuring the safety of the people is one of those things that popular government exists to do. State legislatures thus have considerable latitude to address social ills. What behavior to criminalize is not an exclusive state responsibility, but it is a core one: \"Under our federal system, the 'states possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law.' \"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The majority overlooks the clear language of the Virginia law-which on its face applies to rich or poor, homeless or homeowner-and instead speculates and invalidates the interdiction statute for falling too harshly on homeless alcoholics. Maj. Op. at 283 (noting that \"Virginia's statutory scheme may nominally penalize 'possession' or 'consumption,' ... [but] effectively targets and punishes Plaintiffs based on their illness\"). This whole \"targeting\" concept is, to understate the matter, breathtaking. All laws have disparate impacts, falling more heavily on some groups than on others. Those impacts do not constitute unconstitutional targeting. The reality of uneven impact is inevitable in law, which, after all, is enacted to address specific social problems. Disparate impacts normally present no defect under the Equal Protection Clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Washington v.

But after today's holding, many laws, both civil and criminal, will be vulnerable on an Eighth Amendment disparate impact theory.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-166\">\n    This case is about a group, interdicted persons, that is not a protected class under the Equal Protection Clause. It is about an activity, consuming alcohol, that is not a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause. It is about police interactions, but no claim was brought under the Fourth Amendment. It seems that the Eighth Amendment is coming into fashion as a means for striking down both civil and criminal laws that display no constitutional defect but merely fail to comport with the majority's sense of optimal public policy. I cannot see how a claim that fails on multiple other grounds, all of which are arguably more applicable to the case at hand, can prevail on this one. The result is that constitutional doctrine will become ever more sprawling, ever more confusing, and judges will seize upon that same confusion to further work their personal will.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    IV.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    I now turn to the majority's vagueness theory. The majority has adopted an alternative rationale for striking down duly-enacted law, holding that the term \"habitual drunkard\" in the civil interdiction statute is unconstitutionally vague. It is difficult to know where to begin with such an unprecedented position. First, as a matter of this court's settled procedures, the question should be unreviewable. Second, even if we could reach it, there is no basis whatsoever for invalidating Virginia's law. The interdiction statute is a civil enactment, which exists solely to provide notice of what acts will trigger criminal sanctions. Vagueness doctrine simply has no place in this case, as the appellants themselves recognized before the panel. By nonetheless pushing forward, the majority has launched a new theory of civil vagueness, a doctrine that will most assuredly become a favorite of litigants seeking to invalidate state laws.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    As an initial matter, the majority has no basis for reaching the vagueness challenge. The appellants, who were ably represented throughout this litigation, stated twice before the panel that they were not raising the issue. Accordingly, the panel did not consider it, and neither should the en banc court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    We do not have here a simple failure to press a claim. The appellants instead expressly waived any appeal on their vagueness challenge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opening Br. at 12, n.8 (\"Count Five alleges that the Interdiction Statute as applied to Plaintiffs is unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

As such, the panel did not\n    <em>\n     sua sponte\n    </em>\n    resurrect it. The majority's decision to nonetheless take up the vagueness claim en banc significantly degrades the place of panel process in federal appellate review. Of course en banc proceedings have their necessary place, but a panel of three remains our basic unit of decision, three being a more efficient and more collaborative number than a conclave of fifteen.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The majority has provided no standard under which an en banc court can resolve a claim affirmatively waived before a panel, other than \"whenever it suits us.\" This open-endedness is said to be needed \"to promote the ends of justice,\" Maj.

But the orderly progression of litigation provided by process and the ends of justice are not dichotomous, but complementary, as the neutrality of procedure protects litigants of all persuasions against arbitrary courts and ambush by adversaries. The Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure rightly and properly contemplate en banc proceedings for cases of \"exceptional\" importance. Fed. R. App. P. 35. They do not contemplate them as the setting for \"exceptional\" procedural departures. It is not unfair to ask the majority to estimate the costs of allowing procedure to turn this flabby, but the majority has not so much as acknowledged the damage to panel deliberations it has wrought.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The majority contends that our recent decision in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The differences between that case and the decision reached today ought to be obvious. In\n    <em>\n     Simms\n    </em>\n    , the government changed its views in response to intervening Supreme Court precedent and both parties argued the issue\n    fully to the en banc court. In this case, the plaintiffs chose to abandon a weak claim on appeal and deliberately refrained from pressing that claim when seeking en banc review. When the issue did emerge during en banc argument, the state was afforded a limited opportunity through supplemental briefing to respond, without the benefit of any panel decision or adequate airing.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    By reviving the vagueness claim now, we are inviting litigants to take this court for a ride. We should not, for want of a better word, be such chumps.

Fair notice both informs the public and constrains law enforcement. Vagueness doctrine protects a person's right to be convicted only under laws that speak with some clarity.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    It ought to be obvious that a statute whose sole purpose is to provide notice does not transgress this constitutional limit. Once again, Virginia's interdiction law has two parts: one civil and one criminal. Under the scheme, a person can be convicted of a crime only after an interdiction hearing, which itself requires \"due notice\" and a determination by a neutral magistrate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204.1-333\">\n     Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 4.1-333\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The interdiction itself does not carry criminal consequences. There is no question that the subsequent prohibitions on consuming and possessing alcohol are not vague, and the majority has not argued that they are. Moreover, an interdicted person may never face criminal punishment at all, either because he refrains from drinking or has his interdiction cancelled.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%204.1-333\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    At bottom then, Virginia's statute works to address the very concerns that motivate vagueness doctrine in the first place. The two-step structure puts high-risk persons\n    <em>\n     on notice\n    </em>\n    of precisely what sort of acts will subject them to criminal sanctions and places the initial interdiction decision in the hands of a court, rather than law enforcement. The majority collapses these two steps into one for much of its analysis, but somehow still fails to appreciate that it is the statute's prophylactic structure that provides notice before imposing criminal consequences. Put simply, this statute presents no problem that vagueness doctrine could possibly solve.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    The majority, however, is undeterred. According to my colleagues, the term \"habitual drunkard,\" which appears only in the civil interdiction statute, is unconstitutionally vague. This position suffers from two infirmities.

The majority finds fault with Virginia's statute on the grounds that Webster's International Dictionary (3d ed. 2002) provides multiple definitions for the word \"habit.\" Maj. Op. at 274. If multiple dictionary definitions of a word are the new standard for toppling state statutes, few such civil enactments will be left standing. The majority prefers to treat \"habit\" as a noun in isolation, rather than a modifier for the noun that follows. But whatever form of the word is used, discerning its common meaning is really not all that hard. As the majority well knows, \"habit\" means doing something over and over, in this case consuming alcohol to excess. Habits are something that all of us have as we go about our personal lives; none of us can fail to miss a habit's meaning.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    By identifying specific and repeated conduct, the statute is nothing like those laws that have been found unconstitutionally vague in the past, such as those that proscribed passive acts like \"loitering,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Papachristou\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p160\">\n     405 U.S. at 160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/#p160\">\n     92 S.Ct. 839\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , or targeted \"improper persons,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Booth v.

While other courts have used slight variations on this definition, each of them has been driving at the same basic conduct: a repeated course of consuming alcohol to excess, excess being the impairment of judgment, the loss of motor function, the lessening of impulse control, and other commonly recognized effects. These interpretations, just like the statute's plain text, clearly put citizens and officers on notice of the statute's limited reach.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-184\">\n    In sum, the majority would outlaw \"general definition[s]\" and terms from many state enactments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Maj. Op. at 275. It apparently believes that its semantic hair-splitting of the terms \"habitual\" and \"drunkard\" passes for some sort of textualism. It is the very opposite of textualism. Properly understood, textualism seeks to apply the lawmaker's words to a particular case, thereby respecting the lawmaker's intent. The whole point of the majority's faux textualism is not to respect the lawmaker's intent but to undermine it, and in doing so to aggrandize the power of the judiciary vis-\u00e0-vis the legislative branch by picking critically and ceaselessly at enacted words. Only an approach as ad hoc and pliable as the majority's could lead to the\n    conclusion that \"drunkard\" is vague while \"intoxicated\" is not. Maj. Op. at 275-76. Yet that is where we are.

Op. at 273. My colleagues cannot have it both ways. Either what matters here are the civil consequences of an interdiction order, in which case the strict standard is inapplicable, or what matters are the criminal consequences that can befall interdicted persons for subsequent acts, in which case prior notice and a determination by a neutral magistrate are an integral part of the scheme. The inconsistency of the majority's view is the inevitable result of stretching vagueness doctrine to meet its preferences, without any regard to the vital purpose that doctrine serves in our constitutional law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    As if this novel view of civil vagueness were not enough, the majority takes it one step further by tearing up state law, striking yet another blow to the state's rightful place in our federal system. On the majority's theory, states would be prevented from using a civil designation to ward off future criminal acts, lest the entire scheme be attacked as \"quasi-criminal.\" Maj. Op. at 273. There is no doubt that Virginia, as part of its efforts to prevent alcohol-related violence, could impose increasingly severe sentences for each act of public intoxication or disorderly conduct. Instead, Virginia has opted for a less draconian approach, which uses a pattern of violations to put someone on notice, by civil means, of future acts that will lead to criminal punishment. Faced with the majority's vagueness theory, however, it is easy to imagine the Commonwealth looking to other familiar means of deterring repeat offenders that would cause far more heartburn than its present scheme.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    The majority's civil vagueness holding shares with its Eighth Amendment holding the same disregard for Supreme Court precedent, the same unwillingness to confront obvious implications, and the same failure to provide any workable limits. In the end, the only thing that ought to be void for vagueness here is the majority opinion, which gives the district court no guidance on remand. It tells everyone what is wrong, and no one what might be right. What it has created is a confusion which promotes judicial ascendency by inviting litigants to trek again to Delphi for yet another inscrutable judicial decree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-191\">\n    V.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    It is hard to imagine a decision so infused with ruinous consequences or so insensitive to a judge's inability to rework society from the bench. First, the desire to remove unspecified acts from the purview of criminal law flies in the face of the distinct and emphatic language of the\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    opinion, which indicates that individual actions, as opposed to personal status, remain fair subjects for the legislative contemplation of criminal sanctions. Not only are the words of the Supreme Court disregarded, but so too is the settled legal landscape that for more than half a century has reinforced their relevance. The clear and principled status-act distinction is now replaced with a nebulous \"nonvolitional conduct\" defense, a phrase that will surely metastasize and absolve individuals from personal responsibility for all forms and manners of criminal acts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    This decision is an affront to our legal traditions. It leaves states less able to\n    enact prophylactic civil laws and sanctions in order to forestall more serious crimes. It usurps the American Constitution in order to cement the states as subordinate entities in our federal structure, a result profoundly at odds with the vibrant federalism that was intended to define not only our young but our maturing Republic. What's more, the majority adopts the Eighth Amendment as its amendment du jour, pushing it into a supervisory role over substantive criminal law and into territory heretofore inhabited by other constitutional provisions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    Finally, the majority has, without even bothering to follow this court's basic procedures, adopted a novel theory of civil vagueness, one that calls into question countless expressions in numerous civil laws. The effects of this position will long be felt, as all manner of words and phrases will be impugned for their alleged imprecision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    It is not often that a decision operates to visit structural and institutional damage in so many respects. Any one of these flaws would be serious. Altogether, they are more than severe. I only wish that my colleagues, in their rush to condemn Virginia for a policy they don't prefer, stopped to consider that perhaps this law has endured for the benefit of the many victims of alcohol-fueled violence; victims who cannot easily make their voices heard, and who are all too often neglected in decisions like the one reached here. One may always hope, however. All pretensions to restraint have been abandoned. But may the first rays of sunrise light the return of the many clear principles that have so eluded the majority along the way.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    WILKINSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting specially:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    I thank Judge Keenan for her concurring opinion.

To my mind, mutual respect and collegiality are enhanced, not compromised, by a vigorous exchange of views over basic and fundamental principles of law. A robust exchange reveals judges who care, not out of self-interest, but about the lives of the litigants before them and, in a larger sense, about the capacity of law to bring great benefit to society or to inflict significant harm. That we discharge our oath of office with conviction and at times with passion is something I believe the public and the profession will respect.

I write separately, however, because I think it well within this court's discretion to consider Plaintiffs' vagueness challenge, even as I would reject the challenge on its merits. With respect to Plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claim, the majority ventures too far in extending the holding announced in\n    <em>\n     Robinson v. California\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     370 U.S. 660\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     82 S.Ct. 1417\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"440\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/#p660\">\n     8 L.Ed.2d 758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1962), so as to apply to criminal conduct compelled by addiction. Respectfully, that decision is not for us to make.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    A.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    When a party expressly waives an argument before a panel of this court, we usually decline, as a matter of discretion, to consider the argument on rehearing en banc. But as the majority explains, we may consider an abandoned argument in the rare case where the record enables us to do so, where doing so would not prejudice either party, and where the argument implicates an issue of great importance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    This is such a case, for the reasons described by the majority. The basis for Plaintiffs' vagueness challenge was adequately developed in the district court. We do not prejudice the Commonwealth by considering the challenge now, because it had a full opportunity to address the issue at en banc oral argument and through supplemental briefing. And although I cannot join in the majority's analysis of the vagueness issue, I agree that we should consider it to ensure that we correctly decide a matter of public importance. Enforcement of Virginia's interdiction statute impacts the basic liberty interests of the Plaintiffs and many similarly situated persons throughout the Commonwealth. Whether it does so within constitutional bounds is a question that touches on Eighth Amendment and vagueness concerns, which are closely related and have been applied in tandem in cases addressing similar types of statutes.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Joel v.

As Judge Wilkinson notes, the law is rife with open-ended terms, from \"reasonable doubt\" to \"moral turpitude.\" These terms generally don't present constitutional vagueness issues, except where they invite arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement or fail to fairly notify those who are subject to a law of what conduct will constitute a violation. The term \"habitual drunkard\" used in the interdiction statute does neither.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The distinction between occasional and \"habitual\" drunkards is a question of degree, and it's true that the line may sometimes blur. It is also true that Virginia's courts haven't provided much guidance beyond that contained in the statutory text.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jackson v. Commonwealth\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"432995\" index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/218/\">\n     44 Va.App. 218\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"432995\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va-app/44/218/\">\n     604 S.E.2d 122\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 125 (2004) (defining a habitual drunkard as one who \"is admittedly in the continual habit of being intoxicated from alcohol\" (quoting\n    <em>\n     Fisher v. Coleman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4135315\" index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/486/311/\">\n     486 F. Supp. 311\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 315 (W.D. Va. 1979) )). But there can be little doubt as to the basic conduct that would qualify one as a habitual drunkard: repeatedly consuming alcohol to excess. This is enough to satisfy the constitutional vagueness standard.\n    <em>\n     Accord\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Ledezma-Cosino v. Sessions\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276751\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/1042/#p1046\">\n     857 F.3d 1042\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1047 (9th Cir. 2017) (en banc).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    B.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    Nor does Virginia's interdiction statute run afoul of the Eighth Amendment's bar against cruel and unusual punishment. The core dispute in this case is whether\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    prohibits only the criminalization of status, or also of conduct compelled by status. I am satisfied that\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    is better understood as distinguishing status from conduct, which is the interpretation that most courts have adopted in the decades since\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    was decided.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    And despite the majority's suggestion to the contrary,\n    <em>\n     Powell v. Texas\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172531\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/514/\">\n     392 U.S. 514\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175648,6172531\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/88/2145/\">\n     88 S.Ct. 2145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172531\" index=\"458\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/514/\">\n     20 L.Ed.2d 1254\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1968), did not alter\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    's distinction between status and conduct. Rather, Judge Wilkinson is I think correct in concluding that \"the judgment in\n    <em>\n     Powell\n    </em>\n    neither extended or contracted\n    <em>\n     Robinson,\n    </em>\n    which was left undisturbed.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    Plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claim therefore turns on whether\n    <em>\n     Robinson\n    </em>\n    can and should be extended to prohibit statutes that criminalize conduct compelled by addiction. In my view, this question is one to be answered in the first instance by the Supreme Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    Because the majority holds otherwise, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
