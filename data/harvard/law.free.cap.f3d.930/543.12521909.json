Through the Amendment, Congress directed the Health Resources and Services Administration (\"HRSA\"), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"), to issue guidelines setting forth the preventive health care services that women should be provided. Among the services HRSA identified was contraceptive care. Nowhere in the enabling statute did Congress grant the agency the authority to exempt entities from providing insurance coverage for such services nor did Congress allow federal agencies to issue regulations concerning this coverage without complying with the Administrative Procedure Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Notwithstanding Congress's directives, in 2017, HHS and the Departments of Labor and Treasury (collectively, \"the Agencies\") promulgated regulations that expanded the entities that could invoke an exemption to the requirement that group health insurance plans cover contraceptive services as a form of women's preventive health care. Because the state plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that the Agencies did not follow the APA and that the regulations are not authorized under the ACA or required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), we will affirm the District Court's order preliminarily enjoining the rules' enforcement nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Enacted as a part of the ACA, Pub.

HRSA commissioned an expert panel from the Institute of Medicine to recommend covered services. In 2011, HRSA adopted the Institute's recommendations and issued guidelines defining preventive care to include all \"Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity,\" \"as prescribed\" by a woman's health care provider.

Reg. at 39,874, is entitled to an accommodation to avoid \"contracting, arranging, paying, or referring for contraceptive coverage,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39,875. This accommodation process (the \"Accommodation\") permits an employer to send a self-certification form to its insurance issuer, which then excludes contraceptive coverage, either in full or in part, from the group health plan and in turn \"provide[s] payments for contraceptive services for plan participants and beneficiaries, separate from the group health plan, without the imposition of cost sharing, premium, fee, or other charge on plan participants or beneficiaries or on the eligible organization or its plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39,876.

The evidence addressed the relationship between costs and contraceptive use and the impact the Rules would have on state-funded healthcare services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Cost is a significant barrier to contraceptive use and access. The most effective forms of contraceptives are the most expensive. After the ACA removed cost barriers, women switched to the more effective and expensive methods of contraception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Rules allow employers to opt out of providing coverage for contraceptive services, some women may no longer have insurance to help offset the cost for these and other contraceptives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Pennsylvania and New Jersey have state-funded programs that provide family planning and contraceptive services for eligible individuals.

Pennsylvania's Family Planning Services Program also covers all family planning-related services, including contraceptives, for individuals with incomes up to 215% of the federal poverty level even if they have private insurance, and New Jersey's Plan First program offers the same for individuals with incomes up to 205% of the federal poverty level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Women who lack contraceptive coverage and who meet certain income levels may also turn to Title X family planning clinics which \"provide access to contraceptive services, supplies, and information to all who want and need them\" with priority to low-income persons.

The States have provided evidence showing that the Exemption will result in the expenditure of state funds because some women who lose coverage will inevitably seek out state-sponsored programs providing contraceptive services; and some women will forego contraceptive use, causing the States to shoulder the costs of unintended pregnancies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   With the ACA, many patients \"switch[ed] from a cheaper, less effective [contraceptive] method to a more effective, expensive method that was better for their medical health and personal needs.\" App. 272. Contraceptives are not only used for pregnancy prevention. They are the \"standard first-line of care for a number of hormonal, and other, disorders, including poly-cystic ovarian syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency /premature ovarian failure, amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea /chronic pelvic pain, and abnormal uterine bleeding.\" App. 292. A \"vast majority\" of women use inter-uterine devices (\"IUDs\")-a treatment religious objectors are particularly focused on, App. 350-83-\"for purposes other than birth control.\" App. 293 (describing 90-95% of patients using IUDs for non-birth control purposes). Contraceptive use \"carries long-term health benefits for women[,]\" including reducing the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer. App. 294. \"Contraception also helps protect the health of those women for whom pregnancy can be hazardous, or even life-threatening.\" Amici Curiae Health Prof'l Orgs. Br. at 16. Thus, removing cost free contraceptive coverage can have ramifications on women's health beyond birth control and unplanned pregnancies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Without insurance to defray or eliminate the cost for the more-effective contraceptive methods, women will use \"less expensive and less effective methods,\" App. 245, and both Pennsylvania and New Jersey \"anticipate[ ] that women who lose contraceptive coverage through employer plans-whether the plan of their own employer or that of another family member-may seek contraception from other sources, including state-funded programs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   App. 299; App. 317. Thus, the State-funded programs will be tapped to provide coverage for financially eligible women whose employers invoke the Exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Furthermore, some women who lose contraceptive coverage may either fail to qualify for state services or elect to forego the use of contraceptives altogether. \"Women who stop using contraception are more likely to have unplanned pregnancies and to require additional medical attention.\" App. 312. The costs of such unintended pregnancies are often shouldered by states, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Therefore, the evidence supports the conclusion that the loss of contraceptive coverage may also result in unintended pregnancies for which the States will bear associated health care costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For these reasons, \"[t]he expanded exemptions are expected to result in greater financial expenditures\" by the States on contraceptive services.

This language does not eliminate the need for notice and comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   First, the APA only allows a subsequent statute to modify or supersede its procedural requirements \"to the extent [the statute] does so expressly.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20559\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Regulation Provision contains no express language supplanting APA procedures, and the sole reference to \"interim final rules\" does not confer a license to ignore APA requirements. Indeed, in contrast to statutory authorizations to forego APA procedures, the Regulation Provision is \"permissive ('The Secretary may promulgate any interim final rules as the Secretary determines are appropriate ...'), wide-ranging (applying to any regulatory proceeding relating to group health insurance plans), and do[es] not contain any specific deadlines for agency action.\"\n   <em>\n    Coal. for Parity, Inc. v.

In short, because the Regulation Provision \"neither contain[s] express language exempting agencies from the APA nor provide[s] alternative procedures that could reasonably be understood as departing from the APA,\" it does not authorize the Agencies to disregard the notice-and-comment requirements.\n   <em>\n    California II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/#p572\">\n    911 F.3d at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Second, the statutory reference within the Regulation Provision sheds light on the scope and purpose of its IFR sentence. As the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit points out, \u00a7 104 of HIPAA aims to assure regulatory coordination between the Agencies' Secretaries for matters over which they share responsibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/#p572\">\n    911 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   579-80 (citing Pub.

The first sentence of the Regulation Provision authorizes each Secretary to promulgate regulations \"consistent with\" the HIPAA section on coordination. The second sentence is identical but for two differences: it discusses IFRs instead of final regulations, and it omits any mention of HIPAA's coordination section. Read in light of the first sentence, the second ensures that each Agency can proceed by IFR where a Secretary \"need[s] to regulate within his or her own domain temporarily while sorting out ... inter-agency conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 579. Thus, \"we need not give the second sentence the [A]gencies' expansive interpretation in order for the second sentence to retain independent effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 579-80. In sum, the Regulation Provision does not expressly excuse the Agencies from complying with APA procedures and therefore does not provide a basis for issuing the IFRs without notice and comment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Agencies also lacked good cause for dispensing with notice of and comment to the IFRs.

Uncertainty precedes every\n   regulation, and to allow uncertainty to excuse compliance with notice-and-comment procedures \"would have the effect of writing [those] requirements out of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551241\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/498/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551241\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/498/#p512\">\n    at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If the APA permitted agencies to forego notice-and-comment concerning a proposed regulation simply because they already regulated similar matters, then the good cause exception could largely obviate the notice-and-comment requirement. Furthermore, the IFRs did not make a minor change. The IFRs create exemptions from the Contraceptive Mandate with unprecedented scope and make the Accommodation wholly voluntary. Such a dramatic overhaul of the Contraceptive Mandate regulations required notice-and-comment under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   For these reasons, the Agencies did not have good cause to ignore the APA's notice and comment requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Government also contends that, even if the IFRs were procedurally deficient, the Agencies' subsequent use of notice-and-comment rulemaking to finalize the Rules cured any procedural defects.

This reasoning applies with equal force here. By first promulgating the IFRs that granted the expanded exemptions without notice and comment, the Agencies changed the question presented concerning the Final Rules from whether they should create the exemptions to whether they should depart from them. This starting position is impermissible under the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharon Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"386026\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/597/377/#p381\">\n    597 F.2d at 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Provision of prior notice and comment allows effective participation in the rulemaking process while the decisionmaker is still receptive to information and argument.

More specifically, neither of the statutes upon which the Agencies rely, the ACA and RFRA, authorize or require the Final Rules. Thus, they were enacted \"in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right,\" making them \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A), (C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Agencies argue that their authority under the ACA to issue preventive care guidelines includes the power to promulgate the Exemptions. This assertion is without textual support. The Women's Health Amendment to the ACA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4), provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum provide coverage for and shall not impose any cost sharing requirements for- ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (3) with respect to infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines supported by the [HRSA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (4) with respect to women, such additional preventive care and screenings not described in paragraph (1)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   ] as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the [HRSA] for purposes of this paragraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a). The authority to issue \"comprehensive guidelines\" concerns the type of services that are to be provided and does not provide authority to undermine Congress's directive concerning who must provide coverage for these services. Section 300gg-13(a) unambiguously dictates that group health plans and health insurance issuers \"shall provide\" the preventive care services set forth in the HRSA-supported comprehensive guidelines, and \"shall\" not impose cost sharing. The term \"shall\" denotes a requirement,\n   <em>\n    Prometheus Radio Proj. v.

Nothing from \u00a7 300gg-13(a) gives HRSA the discretion to wholly exempt actors of its choosing from providing the guidelines services. On the contrary, the mandate articulated in \u00a7 300gg-13(a) forecloses such exemptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Agencies' reliance on the language that directed HRSA to create the guidelines concerning women's preventive health care and the use of the phrase \"as provided for in\" such guidelines does not advance their position. The Agencies contrast \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4)'s use of the phrase \"as provided for in\" comprehensive guidelines with a neighboring sub-section's provision addressing preventive care for infants,\n   children, and adolescents, which is \"provided for in the\" comprehensive guidelines for those services.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3) (describing \"preventive care and screenings provided for in the comprehensive guidelines\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503127\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/26/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) (describing \"preventive care and screenings as provided for in comprehensive guidelines\"). They assert that the use of the word \"as\" in \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4) gives HRSA authority to dictate the preventive services to be provided and who must provide them. This argument overlooks the clear explanation for the different language. When the ACA was passed, the comprehensive guidelines for children's preventive care already existed, but guidelines for women's preventive care were not yet written. Congress used the definite article \"the\" in \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(3) to refer to those existing children's preventive care guidelines. In \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4), Congress addressed the women's preventive care guidelines that were yet to be promulgated by stating \"as provided for in comprehensive guidelines.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Agencies' interpretation of \"comprehensive\" as authorizing them to issue guidelines that exempt entities from complying with the Mandate likewise fails. Put simply, the discretion the statute grants HRSA to issue comprehensive guidelines concerning services to be provided does not include the power to exempt actors from the statute itself. This is borne out by the fact that the word \"comprehensive\" is also used to describe the children's preventive care guidelines, and those guidelines do not exempt any statutorily required party from providing services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS,\n   <em>\n    Preventive Care Benefits for Children\n   </em>\n   , https://www.healthcare.gov/preventive-care-children (last visited May 8, 2019). Congress was obviously aware of the existing children's guidelines when it drafted the Women's Health Amendment, and Congress's use of \"comprehensive\" to describe both sets of guidelines conveys that it intended them to cover the same type of subject matter, namely health care services for the identified groups.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.A.A. v.

An injunction geographically limited to the States alone will not protect them from financial harm, as some share of their residents who work out-of-state will lose contraceptive coverage originally provided through employers in non-enjoined states who will exempt themselves.
