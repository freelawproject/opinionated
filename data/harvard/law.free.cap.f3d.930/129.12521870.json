We hold that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nkomo also seeks review of the denials of her application for withholding of removal and her request for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We are unpersuaded by the merits of her withholding claim and we lack jurisdiction over her CAT claim.

This conviction is for an \"aggravated felony,\" which makes Nkomo removable and ineligible for most relief. About a month after she was sentenced to time served for that offense, the Government initiated these removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Adopting much of the Immigration Judge's analysis, the Board of Immigration Appeals found Nkomo ineligible for withholding because her wire fraud conviction was for a \"particularly serious crime\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B)(ii).

Eschewing\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference in favor of the text of the statute, the Court held that the notice to appear served on Pereira did not trigger the stop-time rule because \u00a7 1229(a) requires that the notice to appear specify,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he time and place at which the [removal] proceedings will be held.\"\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.

The Court reasoned: \"By expressly referencing \u00a7 1229(a), the statute specifies where to look to find out what 'notice to appear' means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    at 2114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And looking to \u00a7 1229(a), one finds a requirement that time and place be specified. The Court explained that \"[i]f the three words 'notice to appear' mean anything in this context, they must mean that, at a minimum, the Government has to provide noncitizens 'notice'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   of the information,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the 'time' and 'place,' that would enable them 'to appear' at the removal hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    at 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the notice to appear served on Pereira failed to include that information, he was not ineligible for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In this case, Nkomo appeared at, and participated in, her removal hearing. She nevertheless argues that the IJ, the BIA, and this Court all lack jurisdiction because her notice to appear was deficient under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   . Her argument boils down to the following logical sequence: (1)\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   defined \"notice to appear\" for all purposes; (2)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) provides that \"[j]urisdiction vests, and proceedings before an Immigration Judge commence, when a charging document is filed with the Immigration Court\"; (3)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   defines \"charging document\" as \"the written instrument which initiates a proceeding before an Immigration Judge .... includ[ing] a Notice to Appear\"; (4) because a notice to appear lacking time and place information is not actually a notice to appear under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , it's not a charging document; so (5) jurisdiction never vested when that document was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The argument Nkomo makes here has been made to seven of our sister courts in the past two years and it has been rejected each time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortiz-Santiago v.

There is no 'glue' to bind \u00a7 1229(a) and the jurisdictional regulations: the regulations do not reference \u00a7 1229(a), which itself makes no mention of the IJ's jurisdiction.\"). A critical piece of\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's reasoning is thus inapplicable here. And not only is the word \"jurisdiction\" nowhere to be found in \u00a7 1229(a), but it also would be an odd place to find a jurisdictional limitation. Congress would have placed \u00a7 1229(a)(1) 's requirements in \u00a7 1229a-the section establishing the IJ's authority-if it meant them to limit the IJ's subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   did not purport to resolve issues beyond the \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A) stop-time rule context, and the Supreme Court repeatedly emphasized the narrowness of its holding,\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.

That limitation makes sense, and we should hesitate to extend\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's reach, because the cancellation of removal context at issue in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   and the reopening/remand context at issue in Nkomo's case are quite different. Filing a notice to appear commences removal proceedings-and serving it stops the accrual of time for an alien's \"ten years of continuous presence\" if it complies with \u00a7 1229(a). By contrast, reopening and remand are available only when proceedings before the IJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   have been completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mauricio-Benitez v.

So while\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   's holding expands the class of those eligible for discretionary relief in removal proceedings, Nkomo's argument would invalidate scores of removal orders (and, presumably, grants of relief).

She cites statutory language that might suggest such a requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B)(ii) (barring withholding eligibility if the Attorney General determines \"the alien, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime is a danger to the community of the United States\").

Her level of participation, she argues, led to a non-custodial sentence that should have been taken into account. We have jurisdiction to review claims that the Board misapplied its precedents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kaplun v.

But we see no legal error in the Board's analysis on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Board acknowledged Nkomo had been adjudged a minimal participant in a much broader fraudulent scheme, but agreed with the IJ that the gravity of the offense outweighed her lower culpability as compared to her co-conspirators.

Because financial crimes may be \"particularly serious,\"\n   <em>\n    Kaplun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920287\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/260/#p267\">\n    602 F.3d at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and in light of the substantial deference due the Board in this area, we perceive no error. Nor does Nkomo point to any Board precedent supporting a different result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Matter of Frentescu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20244\">\n    18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 1982), Nkomo argues that the Board failed to account for the non-custodial sentence she received. It bears noting the Board\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   cite her sentence in its analysis. AR 4. What Nkomo seems to suggest is that Board precedent requires consideration of a non-custodial sentence as a mitigating factor. But the Board lists the sentence imposed as a factor that \"may\" be used in its determination-and sometimes the Board relies exclusively on the elements of the offense.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090045\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/201/#p214\">\n    633 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   215 ;\n   <em>\n    N-A-M-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20336\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This approach necessarily gives\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   weight to the sentence imposed. As the Board explained in\n   <em>\n    N-A-M-\n   </em>\n   , its \"approach to determining whether a crime is particularly serious has evolved since ...\n   <em>\n    Matter of Frentescu\n   </em>\n   \" and \"the sentence imposed is not a dominant factor in determining whether a conviction is for a particularly serious crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In any event, the \"particularly serious crime\" determination lacks \"textual or contextual indicators in the INA\" and is not amenable to bright line rules like the one Nkomo seems to propose.\n   <em>\n    Denis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4090045\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/201/#p214\">\n    633 F.3d at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nkomo's father was deeply involved with the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) party, a onetime rival of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) party. She argues the Board erred in relying on the merger of these parties (into the ZANU-PF party) in finding she would not likely be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government of Zimbabwe. The merger, she contends,\n   was \"only symbolic in nature,\" and she would still be in danger as an outsider to Zimbabwe's dominant political party. Nkomo Br. 21. In essence, she takes issue with the IJ's finding that she is unlikely to suffer harm upon return because the party that once posed a threat has merged with her own. This presents a factual challenge over which we have no jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pierre v. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581494\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/180/#p184\">\n    528 F.3d 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (3d Cir. 2008) (en banc) (\"Because the basis for removal is [the alien's] conviction for an aggravated felony, our jurisdiction is limited under the REAL ID Act to 'constitutional claims or questions of law.' \" (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C)-(D) )).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nkomo also rehashes evidence that she might suffer harm upon her return to Zimbabwe, without addressing evidence to the contrary relied on by the IJ and the Board. Here again, what is likely to happen on Nkomo's return to Zimbabwe (as opposed to whether those predicted events meet the legal definitions of \"torture\" or \"acquiescence\") is a factual question over which we lack jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Myrie v. Att'y Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276846\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/855/509/#p516\">\n    855 F.3d 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 516-17 (3d Cir. 2017). So we cannot review, much less disturb, the Board's determination that if Nkomo is returned to Zimbabwe, she is not likely to suffer harm because her party merged with the party in power, the government has not targeted her for three decades, and she has previously traveled there without being questioned by the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For these reasons, we will deny Nkomo's petition for review as to withholding of removal and otherwise dismiss it for lack of jurisdiction over her claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
