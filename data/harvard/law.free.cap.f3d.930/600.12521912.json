The issue arises in the context of a tax refund action filed by appellant Paul M. Retfalvi, M.D., the taxpayer. He filed suit against the United States, seeking a refund of approximately $125,000 in taxes collected from him by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), pursuant to the treaty, for income taxes that he owed to Canada for 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dr. Retfalvi advances several grounds in support of his challenge to the constitutionality of the treaty. According to Dr. Retfalvi, the treaty constitutes a \"bill for raising revenue\" that did not originate in the House of Representatives, in violation of the Origination Clause, Article 1, \u00a7 7, cl. 1. In addition, he argues that the treaty violates the Taxing Clause, Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1, which, in his view, confers on Congress the exclusive right to enact taxing legislation. Further, Dr. Retfalvi contends that the treaty is not self-executing and is therefore unenforceable, because it has not been validated by the requisite implementing legislation. Dr. Retfalvi also challenges the IRS's legal authority to collect a foreign assessment on behalf of Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina rejected these contentions. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1980, the United States and Canada executed the Convention Between the United States of America and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, U.S.-Can., Sept. 26, 1980, 1986-\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.B.%20258\">\n    2 C.B. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Treaty\").

Article 26A, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 9. To apply for collection assistance, the applicant State submits a revenue claim to the requested State.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. The applicant State must certify that the revenue claim has been \"finally determined\" under its laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Of relevance here, \"a revenue claim is finally determined when the applicant State has the right under its internal law to collect the revenue claim and all administrative and judicial rights of the taxpayer to restrain collection in the applicant State have lapsed or been exhausted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The requested State decides whether to accept the revenue claim. Article 26A, \u00b6 3. If it accepts the revenue claim, it must collect the claim as though it were its own finally determined tax debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, a Canadian revenue claim accepted by the United States is \"treated by the United States as an assessment under United States laws against the taxpayer as of the time the application is received.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4(a).

Retfalvi, is a medical doctor who was born in Hungary. He moved to Canada in 1988 under a restricted work permit, and he became a Canadian citizen in 1993. That same year, Dr. Retfalvi came to the United States on a J-1 visa to participate in a medical residency program. After Dr. Retfalvi completed his residency in 1997, he returned to Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following year, Dr. Retfalvi returned to the United States under an H1-B visa. To ensure that he would have a place to live if his H1-B visa was not renewed, Dr. Retfalvi purchased a small condominium in Vancouver, Canada and signed a pre-construction contract to purchase a larger one. Through extensions of his H1-B visa, Dr. Retfalvi continued to reside in the United States. In 2005, he was granted permanent resident status from the United States. As Dr. Retfalvi was no longer planning to reside in Canada, he sold both condominiums in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2007, Dr. Retfalvi and his wife filed separate Canadian income tax returns for 2006. Each return included one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the condominiums. Dr. Retfalvi and his wife also reported the sales on their joint federal income tax return, filed with the IRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Canada Revenue Agency (\"CRA\"), which administers Canada's tax laws, audited Dr. Retfalvi's tax return in 2007. In 2008, the CRA sent Dr. Retfalvi a summary of the audit adjustments, finding that he had improperly reported the sale of the condominiums. The next year, the CRA sent him a Notice of Assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, Dr. Retfalvi filed an untimely objection in February 2010. Thereafter, in March 2010, he filed a timely administrative appeal. Then, on June 23, 2010, Dr. Retfalvi became a United States citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The CRA sent Dr. Retfalvi a Notice of Confirmation on July 4, 2011, denying his appeal and providing him 90 days to file an appeal with the Canadian Tax Court. However, Dr. Retfalvi did not challenge the proposed deficiency by the deadline of October 3, 2011. As a result, the Canadian tax liability became final on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On October 27, 2015, the CRA referred the assessment to the United States for collection, pursuant to Article 26A. In turn, on November 16, 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") issued a \"Final Notice - Notice of Intent to Levy and of Your Right to a Hearing,\" instructing Dr. Retfalvi to pay $124,286.83 in U.S. currency to satisfy the Canadian revenue claim. In the Notice, the IRS advised that it intended to use its collection procedures if Dr. Retfalvi did not pay the assessment within the allotted period. Further, the Notice indicated that the taxpayer had 30 days to seek a hearing before the IRS Office of Appeals regarding the proposed levy. However, the Notice stated that the IRS had no authority to adjust the underlying Canadian tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Dr. Retfalvi objected to the Notice on January 13, 2016, and requested a hearing. On February 23, 2016, he sought a hearing before the IRS Office of Appeals under the Collection Due Process Program, pursuant to\n   Section 6330 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"I.R.C.\" or the \"Tax Code\"). In response, Dr. Retfalvi was informed that he was not entitled to a hearing under that program, but he was entitled to a limited hearing under the Collection Appeals Program. Dr. Retfalvi then filed for that hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On March 24, 2016, the IRS denied Dr. Retfalvi's \"Collection Appeal Request,\" because the \"Appeals Office does not have the authority to adjust a foreign tax liability.\" And, as noted, Dr. Retfalvi never challenged the existence or the amount of the Canadian tax claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thereafter, in the Eastern District of North Carolina, Dr. Retfalvi filed suit for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to enjoin the collection of the tax.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Retfalvi v.

Rather, he paid the tax assessment and then filed a refund claim with the IRS, which was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Retfalvi's refund suit followed on September 14, 2017. It contains nine counts, of which five are relevant on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count I, Dr. Retfalvi claims that Article 26A violates the Constitution's Origination Clause, as a revenue raising measure that did not originate in the House of Representatives. In Count II, he maintains that Article 26A does not have the force of law because it is not a self-executing treaty provision. Counts III and V pertain to the Taxing Clause. In Count VI, Dr. Retfalvi asserts that the IRS is not authorized to collect taxes because Article 26A has no legal force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The government moved to dismiss the suit under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In a well-reasoned decision issued on August 15, 2018, the district court rejected all of the taxpayer's claims and concluded that the IRS had the authority to collect the assessment on behalf of Canada, pursuant to Article 26A. Therefore, the court dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Retfalvi maintains that the district court erred in granting the government's Rule 12(b)(6) motion.

The Origination Clause provides that \"All Bills for raising revenue\" shall originate in the House of Representatives. In Dr. Retfalvi's view, Article 26A qualifies as a bill that raises revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The taxpayer also contends that Article 26A violates the Taxing Clause of the Constitution, art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 1. Under Dr. Retfalvi's reading of that Clause, Congress has the exclusive power to \"lay and collect taxes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In addition, Dr. Retfalvi maintains that Article 26A is not a self-executing treaty, and thus requires implementing language to validate it. As Dr. Retfalvi sees it, giving Article 26A legal effect absent implementing legislation unconstitutionally encroaches on congressional authority. And, Dr. Retfalvi contends that the IRS lacks statutory authority to use its domestic enforcement authorities to collect a foreign assessment on behalf of Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We first consider whether Article 26A violates the Origination Clause, which provides: \"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.\" U.S. Const. art.

In that case, the Ninth Circuit considered whether a \"bill for raising revenue\" must originate from a House bill that increases taxes, or whether it may instead originate from a House bill that decreases taxes. Armstrong, a taxpayer, challenged the constitutionality of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97-248,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Stat.%20324\">\n    96 Stat. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , under the Origination Clause. The challenged statute was first introduced in the House where it would have reduced revenue by one billion dollars over a five-year period. However, the Senate replaced the entire bill, except its enacting clause. The Senate's amended bill was estimated to increase taxes by about $100 billion over a three-year period. Armstrong maintained that because the House bill did not increase revenue, TEFRA only became a revenue\n   <em>\n    raising\n   </em>\n   bill after the Senate amended it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1381. Therefore, in Armstrong's view, TEFRA did not originate in the House and was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   But, the Ninth Circuit rejected this argument. It reasoned that the \"term 'Bills for raising Revenue' does not refer only to laws\n   <em>\n    increasing\n   </em>\n   taxes, but instead refers in general to all laws\n   <em>\n    relating to\n   </em>\n   taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1381 (emphases in original).

Further, because the House of Representatives was viewed as more accountable to the people, it would \"be more watchful and cautious\n   <em>\n    in the imposition of taxes\n   </em>\n   , than a body, which emanates exclusively from the states in their sovereign political capacity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Similarly, the Founders relied on the Origination Clause to ensure that the taxes imposed on small and large states were balanced. At the Constitutional Convention, during debates on an earlier version of the Origination Clause, Benjamin Franklin claimed that the Clause would ensure that Congress did not impose a disproportionate tax burden on the large states. He argued: \"[I]n all laws for supplying [the] Treasury, the Delegates of the several States shall have suffrage in proportion to the Sums which their respective States do actually contribute to the Treasury.\" Zotti &amp; Schmitz,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 93 (quoting Madison,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 226-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Many years later, Justice Story echoed this sentiment while discussing the right of the Senate to amend revenue bills. He explained that the small states need protection \"from the overwhelming representation of some of the large states,\" which might impose taxes that \"would bear with peculiar severity upon the interests, either agricultural, commercial, or manufacturing\" of the small states. Story,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 873.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plainly put, the phrase \"bills for raising Revenue\" refers to bills that impose taxes for the general support of the federal government and not the administration of taxes. Article 26A does not levy taxes. Nor does it impose a new tax or increase, decrease, or modify an existing one. It simply allows the United States and Canada \"to assist each other in the collection of unpaid and overdue tax debts that have already been finally determined under their respective laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We agree with the government that Article 26A merely facilitates collection of an already existing debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, to the extent that the law generates additional revenue, it does so through the collection of unpaid taxes owed pursuant to laws that originated in the House as bills for revenue raising.

Article 26A authorizes that IRS to employ the procedures created under I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6201, 6301 to pursue and collect Canadian revenue claims. Article 26A states that a revenue claim \"shall be collected by the requested State as though such revenue claim were the requested State's own revenue claim finally determined in accordance with the laws applicable to the collection of\n   the requested State's own taxes.\" That is, if the United States accepts a request from Canada to collect a revenue claim, the United States must collect the revenue claim as if it were its own revenue claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Other circuits have recognized the IRS's authority under other tax treaties to use domestic enforcement mechanisms to pursue foreign tax liabilities. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Lidas, Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11146973\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1076/#p1081\">\n    238 F.3d 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1081 (9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit considered a tax treaty between the United States and France, by which the United States was required to \"obtain the information to which the [French] request relates in the same manner and to the same extent as if its own taxation were involved.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11146973\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1076/#p1081\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11146973\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1076/#p1081\">\n    at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting Article 27-4(a) of Article 27 of the Convention for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, Aug. 31, 1994, U.S.-Fr., S. Treaty Doc. No. 103-32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   When the IRS subpoenaed a taxpayer in pursuit of a French tax liability, the taxpayer challenged the subpoena, arguing that the Tax Code did not authorize the issuance of subpoenas to obtain information pertaining to foreign tax liabilities. Rejecting the argument, the court concluded that, \"[u]pon its ratification, the Treaty became part of the law of the United States\" and thereby bound the IRS to \"employ the same procedures to obtain information requested by France pursuant to the Treaty as it would employ in the investigation of a domestic tax liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Lidas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11146973\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/238/1076/#p1081\">\n    238 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1081 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The district court appears to have disagreed, holding that treaties, because they are not \"bills,\" do not implicate the Origination Clause at all. We need not resolve that issue here. In any event, and as discussed above, Article 26A falls outside the Origination Clause because it is not a provision for \"raising revenue.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
