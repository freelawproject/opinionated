We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Proceedings before the board of registration\n   </em>\n   . In October 2014, the board initiated adjudicatory proceedings against Thomann, alleging that he had engaged in the business of real estate brokering through an unlicensed limited liability company, in violation of 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00(11) (2013) and 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(14)(e) (2005) ; and had failed to provide a certain notice of agency disclosure to the seller of real property, in violation of\n   254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(13)(a) (2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The board asserted, on the basis of those violations, that discipline was warranted pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61. Thomann denied the allegations against him; asserted that he had conducted his real estate brokering activities through a properly registered business or trade name; and alleged that it was his routine business practice to provide his clients with a specific form of agency disclosure. Over Thomann's opposition, an administrative hearing officer eventually granted the board's motion for a summary decision, concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact in dispute and that the alleged violations had been established. See 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(7)(h) (1998). The parties, through counsel, then submitted memoranda in lieu of a sanctions hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The hearing officer's tentative decision, which referenced her summary ruling, determined that the violations had been proved and concluded that a sanction against the respondent's license was therefore warranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See 801 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.01(11)(c) (1998). Thomann, both individually and through his attorney, filed\n   written objections. The board's final decision, dated September 15, 2016, considered Thomann's objections and adopted the tentative decision with certain modifications. It ordered suspension of Thomann's license for ten days, beginning on October 3, 2016, with reinstatement conditioned on his written certification that he did not practice during the period of suspension; payment of a $1,200 civil administrative penalty; and submission of an application for an appropriate license for Thomann's limited liability company or a certification that the company had been dissolved. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 65A. The board's decision notified Thomann that he could appeal from the decision either by filing a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court within twenty days of his receipt of the decision, pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87BBB, or by filing a petition for review in the county court within thirty days, pursuant to G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 19, 2016, Thomann filed a motion in the county court seeking an extension of time to file a petition there, and representing that he received the board's final order on September 30, 2016. The clerk of the county court treated this motion as a petition for review under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, and docketed it as such. After the board filed the administrative record and both parties filed their briefs, the single justice affirmed the board's final decision and denied all other requests for relief. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Procedure for judicial review\n   </em>\n   . Judicial review of the final decisions of many boards of registration is properly sought by filing a petition in the county court within thirty days of the receipt of notice of the decision. This procedure is established by G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, and by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hamel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration of Funeral Directors &amp; Embalmers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817172\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/1008/#p1009\">\n    449 Mass. 1008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1009,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=867%20N.E.2d%20319\">\n    867 N.E.2d 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    Friedman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration in Med\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903398\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/663/\">\n    414 Mass. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 664 &amp; n.1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20N.E.2d%201223\">\n    609 N.E.2d 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). The board in this case, at the end of its written decision, informed Thomann that he could proceed in that fashion, and that is essentially what he did. The single justice also decided the matter under those statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the case of this particular board, however, another statute applies. General Laws c. 112, \u00a7 87BBB (C), states, with respect to decisions of this board, that any person aggrieved by the decision \"may appeal\n   <em>\n    to the superior court\n   </em>\n   sitting in equity for the county wherein he resides or has his principal place of business, or to said court sitting in equity for the county of Suffolk\" (emphasis added). The statute requires the appeal to be filed in the Superior Court within twenty days of receipt of notification of the board's decision; authorizes the Superior Court to hear all the pertinent evidence and to determine the facts; and authorizes the Superior Court to annul the board's decision if it exceeded the board's authority or to grant other relief as justice and equity may require.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20N.E.2d%201223\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20N.E.2d%201223\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Significantly, \u00a7 87BBB (C) then also states that \"\n   <em>\n    [t]he foregoing remedy shall be exclusive\n   </em>\n   ,\" and further provides that, from the decision of the Superior Court, \"the parties shall have all rights of appeal and exception as in other equity cases\" (emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20N.E.2d%201223\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=609%20N.E.2d%201223\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Thus, the statute specific to this particular board, \u00a7 87BBB, unlike the more generic statute applicable to boards of registration generally, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, identifies the Superior Court, not this court, as the forum for judicial review, and states that this remedy \"shall be exclusive.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The notice given by the board at the end of its written decision in this case appeared to give the parties two options for obtaining judicial review of the decision. It informed them that they could proceed\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   in the county court, pursuant to \u00a7 64,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   in the Superior Court, pursuant to \u00a7 87BBB. That appears to us to be at odds with the plain language of \u00a7 87BBB (C), which states that the remedy provided therein shall be exclusive. We encourage parties in future cases to pursue their appeals from this particular board in the Superior Court, pursuant to \u00a7 87BBB (C) (see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Rao\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration of Real Estate Brokers &amp; Salesmen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3971403\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/13/922/#p922\">\n    13 Mass.

The single justice clearly had the\n   authority to transfer the matter that was commenced in this court to the Superior Court; and, vice versa, had it been commenced in the Superior Court, as we believe it should have been, she clearly would have had the authority to transfer it here.

Its certificate of organization represented publicly that it would engage in business including \"commercial real estate.\" It does not have its own real estate broker's license. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87UU ; 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00(11) (2013). The board found that, \"[o]n or about January 3, 2013, Boston International Group, LLC, [doing business as] Boston International Group, entered into a Marketing Agreement for Exclusive Right to Sell (the 'Marketing Agreement') real property located at 167 Revere Beach Parkway in Chelsea, Massachusetts (the 'Property').\" Although the marketing agreement identified only \"Boston International Group\" and not \"Boston International Group, LLC,\" as the \"Broker,\" substantial evidence supports the board's finding that the LLC was both a party to the agreement and the entity that was actively engaged in the real estate brokering activities for the property. See\n   <em>\n    Duggan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration in Nursing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667838\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/666/#p674\">\n    456 Mass. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=925%20N.E.2d%20812\">\n    925 N.E.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). In addition, in August 2013, the LLC (identifying itself in its complaint as \"Boston International Group, LLC[, doing business as] The Boston International Group, Ltd\") commenced an action in the Superior Court against the other parties to the marketing agreement, alleging breach of the agreement and seeking payment of a brokerage commission\n   <em>\n    to the LLC\n   </em>\n   . The complaint averred:\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The board, so named, is established by G. L. c. 13, \u00a7 54. The board refers to itself as the \"Board of Registration of Real Estate Brokers and Salespersons.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The board additionally alleged that Thomann assumed duties and responsibilities of a business entity engaged in the real estate brokering business without adequate preparation or competency, in violation of 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(14)(e), by failing to comply with certain liability insurance requirements. See 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.00(12) (2013). Although the hearing officer determined that the violation had been established, the board did not consider it a separate violation for purposes of sanction. The violation was not challenged on appeal, and we do not address it further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The tentative decision did not repeat all of the facts and conclusions of law on which the summary ruling was based. It did, however, expressly provide that \"the Ruling on Summary Decision established liability in this forum.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Contrast G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 84A, which governs decisions of the Board of Registration in Embalming and Funeral Directing. That statute, like \u00a7 87BBB, also identifies a procedure other than a petition in the county court under G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, as a means of obtaining judicial review. It states that judicial review may be obtained by filing a petition in the District Court within ten days of the board's decision. Unlike \u00a7 87BBB, however, \u00a7 84A states that the District Court procedure provided therein \"is\n    <em>\n     in the alternative to\n    </em>\n    that provided by [\u00a7 64 ], and a decision of the court upon a petition brought under [\u00a7 84A ] shall be final and conclusive\" (emphasis added). A party aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Registration in Embalming and Funeral Directing thus can proceed in one of two ways: either in the county court pursuant to \u00a7 64, or in the District Court pursuant to \u00a7 84A.

Further, when the dispute later arose, the lawsuit was commenced against the client\n    <em>\n     in the LLC's name\n    </em>\n    demanding payment of a real estate brokerage fee; in the same action, the LLC acknowledged that it was not licensed to engage in the real estate business.

Although Thomann asserted -- without a supporting affidavit or other evidence -- that he had in fact provided notice, the sample agency disclosure form he claimed to have provided to his real estate clients differed in material respects from the form approved by the board. The hearing officer also found that Thomann failed to provide the form to the client at the appropriate time, i.e., in 2013, at the time the LLC entered into the marketing agreement and undertook to provide broker services, and that he failed to retain a copy of the form for the time period required by the regulations. See\n    254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(13)(a)(1) (three years from date of notice).

He also claims that he was denied the assistance of legal counsel. While we do not address each of his claims specifically, we have reviewed each of them and find them without merit. With respect to the right to counsel, the record indicates that Thomann was in fact represented by multiple attorneys during the course of the administrative proceedings, and that he discharged his attorney after objections to the tentative decision had been filed. The record also demonstrates that Thomann was given multiple extensions of time to file materials at various stages of the proceedings. With respect to his claim of disability, there is nothing in the administrative record to suggest that Thomann requested or was denied any reasonable accommodation by the board, or that he substantiated any such claim. In sum, the record amply supports the conclusion that the proceedings before the board comported with due process requirements. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Langlitz\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Board of Registration of Chiropractors\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898049\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/374/#p377\">\n     396 Mass. 374\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 377,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=486%20N.E.2d%2048\">\n     486 N.E.2d 48\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1985).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Sanction\n    </em>\n    . Once statutory or regulatory violations have been established, the administrative agency has discretion in determining the appropriate sanction. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7\u00a7 61, 65A. On appeal, we consider only whether the sanction\n    imposed was a reasonable exercise of that discretion. See\n    <em>\n     Sugarman\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Board of Registration in Med\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"890115\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/422/338/#p347\">\n     422 Mass. 338\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 347-348,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=662%20N.E.2d%201020\">\n     662 N.E.2d 1020\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1996). See also\n    <em>\n     Vaspourakan, Ltd\n    </em>\n    . v.\n    <em>\n     Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877254\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/401/347/#p355\">\n     401 Mass. 347\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 355,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=516%20N.E.2d%201153\">\n     516 N.E.2d 1153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1987). A reviewing court will not interfere with the agency's imposition of a penalty except in the most extraordinary circumstances.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=516%20N.E.2d%201153\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=516%20N.E.2d%201153\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    No such circumstances are present here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In this case, we conclude that the board reasonably exercised its discretion when it sanctioned Thomann. The $1,200 civil administrative penalty was within the range permitted by statute. See G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61 ; G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 65A. \"Given that the range of penalties is for the agency, the fact that the [board] imposed more lenient penalties for similar violations in the past does not render the sanctions against [Thomann] arbitrary or capricious.\"\n    <em>\n     BAA Mass., Inc\n    </em>\n    . v.\n    <em>\n     Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm'n\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"95050\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/49/839/#p849\">\n     49 Mass.

The ten-day suspension given to Thomann is actually less than the period imposed by the board for similar violations in other cases, and is reasonable in the circumstances of this case. With respect to the requirement that Thomann either obtain a real estate brokering license for the LLC or certify that the LLC has been dissolved, we conclude that that requirement is also reasonable, particularly in light of the business purposes articulated in the LLC's certificate of organization.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n    . For all of these reasons, we agree with the single justice that the board's decision suspending Thomann's license for ten days, imposing a $1,200 civil penalty, and imposing certain conditions on the reinstatement of his license was\n    supported by substantial evidence and free from any errors of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     Judgment affirmed\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-43\">\n     The LLC subsequently amended its complaint to substitute \"Michael Thomann [doing business as] The Boston International Group\" for the LLC as the plaintiff in the action. Nonetheless, the board was entitled to find, and did so find, based on all the evidence in the record, including the representations made in the original complaint, that the LLC was both a party to the marketing agreement and the entity that served as the broker.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-44\">\n     A real estate broker may \"operat[e] under a business or trade name (doing business as),\" provided notice is given to the board. 254 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(3) (1998). Thomann had in fact earlier provided notice to the board that he was doing business as \"Boston International Group.\" The board apparently never was told, however, and would have had no reason to know, that Thomann was actually operating through a limited liability company.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-45\">\n     In addition, Thomann stated to the board's investigator that \"Boston International Group LLC is registered with MA RE Board.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"11\">\n    <p id=\"p-46\">\n     On appeal from the single justice's judgment, Thomann asserts for the first time that he used the board-approved disclosure form, and appended a blank copy of the form to his brief. We decline to reach claims and assertions like this that were not raised during the administrative proceedings or before the single justice.
