GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 1} T.W. appeals a delinquency adjudication for acts constituting: (1) kidnapping by force, threat, or deception under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) ; (2) gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), as the lesser included offense of statutory rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) ; and (3) forcible rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2). That adjudication is not sustained by sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This case presents a particularly difficult review in light of the fact that it involves a minor child as the named victim. Despite our concern for this child, or any child victim, we nevertheless must apply the law to the facts of the case, and accept the end result of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The only evidence in support of the delinquency adjudication is the child's disclosure made to her mother and father (who disagreed as to the extent and nature of that disclosure) and the child's statements to an emergency, pediatric social worker employed by the hospital where treatment was sought. The child's statements describing the alleged sexual acts were introduced under Evid.R. 807(A). The child disclosed to her mother and the social worker that T.W., the child's brother, asked her to perform fellatio on him and the victim placed her mouth on T.W.'s genitals. Both the mother and the social worker clarified that the child spoke of no force or compulsion. Father offered a more benign version of the disclosure, essentially claiming that the child was tattling on T.W. for saying \"suck\" and that any sexual connotation was injected through mother's questioning. There is no medical evidence or other physical evidence confirming the sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In addition, the child's mother testified that she observed a behavioral change in the four-year-old toward the end of 2014 - the child exhibited disruptive and \"clingy\" behavior and began wetting her bed. The state claimed that the trier of fact could infer from the behavioral changes that a sexual assault occurred, but concedes that the mother could not explain the possible causes of the behavioral change or whether the behavioral characteristics were indicative of sexual abuse. T.W. presented an expert who testified\n   that the behavioral characteristics observed by the mother were not unique to abuse victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} We acknowledge that additional evidence was presented at an interlocutory evidentiary hearing conducted under Evid.R. 807, such as the testimony of Shannon Sneed from the Cuyahoga County Department of Child and Family Services (who did not testify at the adjudicatory hearing) and the investigating police officer Gregory Patterson (who did testify in a limited capacity, limited by Confrontation Clause issues). The trial court expressly precluded either of those witnesses from substantively testifying to the sexual misconduct or the child's statements during the final adjudicatory hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} We cannot consider the evidentiary hearing evidence for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient evidence in support of the adjudication of delinquency. The state could have appealed that interlocutory decision to suppress the evidence under R.C. 2945.67(A) in advance of the hearing if such evidence was necessary to a successful prosecution.\n   <em>\n    In re M.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5771803\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/135/375/\">\n    135 Ohio St.3d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-1495\">\n    2013-Ohio-1495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=987%20N.E.2d%20652\">\n    987 N.E.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 48. As a result, there are two pieces of evidence used to adjudicate T.W. delinquent - the child's statements admitted under Evid.R. 807(A) through the mother's, father's, and a hospital social worker's testimony, and mother's statement that the victim exhibited behavioral changes at the end of 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In Ohio, Evid.R. 807 provides an exception to the general inadmissibility of hearsay uttered by a child under the age of 12 that describes any sexual act performed by, with, or on the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This exception applies if (1) the court finds that the totality of the circumstances around the making of the statement provides a particularized guaranty of trustworthiness comparable at least to Evid.R. 803 and 804 ; (2) the child's testimony is not reasonably obtainable by the proponent of the statement; (3) there is \"independent proof\" of the sexual act; and (4) the proponent of the statement has notified all other parties of the content of the statement at least ten days before the trial or hearing. Evid.R. 807(A)(1)-(4). The rule is stated in the conjunctive. In order for the out-of-court statements to be admitted under the rule, the proponent must demonstrate all of the above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In this case, there is no independent proof of the sexual act as a foundation for the evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing. The only substantive evidence of a sexual act not derived from the child's out-of-court statements, according to the state, is the mother's observation that the child exhibited a behavioral change toward the end of 2014, approximately a year before she disclosed the alleged misconduct to the adults. Sneed and Officer Patterson were precluded from testifying about their conversations with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Without expert testimony, the mother's observations of the child's behavioral changes are not independent proof as contemplated under Evid.R. 807(A)(3).

That expert testimony is permitted because a lay person lacks any specialized knowledge about behavioral characteristics of child abuse victims and is unaware of how sexually abused children respond to sexual or other physical abuse.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=690%20N.E.2d%20881\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the state's argument was true, however,\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   would not have permitted the use of expert testimony to explain the significance of the behavioral observations. Expert testimony is permitted only if the testimony \"relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or it dispels a misconception common among lay persons.\" Evid.R. 702(A). If a lay person were capable of inferring the causal connection between sexual abuse and observed behavioral traits, no expert testimony would be permitted because the lay person was capable of formulating a conclusion based on the evidence presented without the assistance of expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The foundation of the\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   decision precludes us from accepting the state's argument, and tellingly, the state has not cited a case in which any court has held that a lay person may infer sexual or physical abuse from a victim's behavior without an expert opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On this point, the state cites\n   <em>\n    State v.

Traditionally, the \"bootstrapping rule\" from Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) precludes the state from presenting evidence of a conspiracy by admitting statements of a coconspirator that established the conspiracy in the first place.\n   <em>\n    Bourjaily v.

Likewise, the state cannot offer \"independent proof\" of a sexual assault having occurred that is solely based on an inference that exists through consideration of the child's statements describing the sexual act, statements that would otherwise be inadmissible without the independent proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The mother's behavioral observations standing alone cannot be considered independent proof of a sexual assault having occurred, especially considering the state's argument that the mother only testified as to her observations but could not explain what caused the change or the significance of the characteristics noted. On this point, expert testimony was required to establish the causal connection because a lay person would ordinarily be unaware of how sexually abused children might respond to sexual or other physical abuse and because a lay person does not possess the specialized knowledge or training to determine which behavioral characteristics would be indicative of an assault.\n   <em>\n    Stowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"111798\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/81/260/#p262\">\n    81 Ohio St.3d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=690%20N.E.2d%20881\">\n    690 N.E.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, by using the child's statements as the context within which to consider the behavioral observation testimony, the state is bootstrapping - relying on the child's statements as the foundation of independent proof of the sexual act before determining the admissibility of those statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state failed to demonstrate the admissibility of the child's out-of-court\n   statements describing the sexual act, and those statements should have been excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The emphasis and detail the dissent places on the veracity of the child suggests that the child should have been deemed competent to testify in this case. The child's \"detailed account\" proffered through hearsay, is not relevant to the issues preserved for this appeal, which focuses on the admissibility of the child's statements under Evid.R. 807. \"A hearsay statement of a child declarant can be admitted under Evid.R. 807 without a determination of the child's competence to testify.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the child's ability to truly relate her impressions of the facts and transactions is irrelevant to the admissibility of the hearsay.

The record nevertheless contains independent proof of sexual abuse beyond the alleged changes in J.W.'s behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 34} J.W.'s knowledge of the appearance and functioning of male sexual organs is enough to satisfy the independent proof requirement of Evid.R. 807. Shannon Sneed (\"Sneed\"), a social worker with CCDCFS, testified at the Evid.R. 807 evidentiary hearing that she interviewed J.W. approximately two weeks after J.W. disclosed the abuse to her parents. Sneed questioned J.W. by herself in the kitchen of her home while her parents waited in the basement. Regarding the interview, Sneed testified, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Then I said, why did she go to the hospital? And she said that [T.W.] makes her suck him. And at that point I got a forensic drawing of a male and asked her where she sucked and she said - she pointed to the penis and said she put her mouth on that part of the body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   She said that they go in the basement and he pulls his pants down and she sucks him. She said this happened five to seven times, but she couldn't remember exactly how many. And she said that it always happens in the basement. And she also said that he told her not tell anyone, but she wanted - but she told her family anyway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Sept. 21, 2016 tr. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Sneed explained there are five factors she considers in making a disposition on allegations of sexual abuse and that there are three possible dispositions. A disposition is \"unsubstantiated\" if there is no evidence that the abuse or neglect occurred. A disposition is \"substantiated\" if there is medical evidence, such as DNA evidence, to substantiate the allegations. In this case, Sneed determined that J.W.'s allegations were \"indicated,\" meaning that although there was no medical evidence corroborating the claims, the allegations were reported consistently, and the victim was credible. (Sept. 21, 2016 tr. 109-110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 36} With respect to the factors considered in making a disposition, Sneed explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   There are five key factors that we base our disposition on. There is access, the access that the alleged perpetrator has to the victim. Number two is strategy for enticement or force, does it match up with what the victim is saying. Three, secrecy. Whether or not the alleged perpetrator told the victim not to tell anyone or threatened him or her in any way. Number four is the detail of the disclosure that the victim is able to provide. And five is the social context of what the child is describing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Sept. 21, 2016 tr. 108-109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Applying these factors, Sneed explained that T.W. had access to J.W. because\n   they were unsupervised in the basement of their home. T.W.'s strategy was to take advantage of the unsupervised access in the basement. Sneed found the secrecy factor was met because T.W. instructed J.W. not to tell anyone. Although J.W. was only five years old, she provided a detailed account of the abuse. And finally, Sneed found it plausible that the abuse occurred in the basement because they were left unsupervised in the basement for periods of time. (Sept. 21, 2016 tr. 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} In addition to Sneed's testimony, Officer Patterson testified that during his investigation, he asked J.W. if anything came out of [T.W.] while she was sucking, and she told him that \"[T.W.] peed.\" (Sept. 21, 2016 tr. 81.) Thus, although J.W. was only five years old, she demonstrated an awareness of the appearance and sexual function of male genitalia that was not appropriate for her age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Furthermore, there was no evidence that J.W. had a motive to lie or to fabricate accusations against T.W., and J.W. spontaneously reported the abuse to her parents. A five-year-old child could not spontaneously tell her parents that her brother made her suck his penis, describe the act with detail, and know the sexual function of the penis unless she had a sexual experience with it. Therefore, I believe this evidence was sufficient independent proof of a sexual act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 40} I also disagree with the majority's conclusion that the adjudications finding T.W. delinquent of rape and kidnapping were not sustained by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 41} The test for sufficiency requires a determination of whether the prosecution met its burden of production at trial.\n   <em>\n    State v.
