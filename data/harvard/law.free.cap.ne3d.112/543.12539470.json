Grant Gatschet, II appeals from the December 28, 2017 Judgment Entry of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas granting the Motion for Summary Judgment filed by defendant-appellee Central Commons Condominium Homeowners Association (\"Central Commons\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant G. Grant Gatschet, II moved into his mother's condominium known as Central Commons in 2011. He and his mother usually exited and entered the condo through the garage, but appellant occasionally used the sidewalk leading to the front door of the condo. On April 3, 2015, appellant was using the front sidewalk\n   to either take something to his car or retrieve something from his car when he tripped and fell. He used the same route when he went out to his car initially as when he was going back to the unit. When asked what happened, he testified that \"I think my foot just got caught on the concrete.\" Appellant's Deposition at 93. According to him, the sidewalk was not level, which caused him to trip and fall. At the time of his fall, it was raining. Appellant testified that he was walking at a normal pace, that he was not carrying anything, and that he was not distracted as he was going back to the condo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to his fall, appellant had not personally talked to anyone connected with the homeowner's association about the condition of the sidewalk outside his mother's condo unit and did not notice \"much of anything\" about the front sidewalk other than it was aging. Appellant's Deposition at 87. He was unaware of any problems with the sidewalk prior to his fall. He had never tripped on the sidewalk before and did not know if anyone else had. The following is an excerpt from appellant's deposition testimony:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Q: All right. You did tell me previously, unless I misinterpreted something you said, that if you had things you were carrying directly up to your bedroom, you would go up and down the sidewalk?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} A: That's correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Q: Okay. And in any of the previous times when you carried things from the driveway up to your bedroom, had you noticed any problems with the sidewalks? Did you see any cracks, any deviation in height, or anything like that?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} A: I did not notice anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant's Deposition at 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After his fall, appellant took pictures of the sidewalk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In November of 2014, Central Common had had sent a newsletter to condo unit owners, stating, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The Board is repairing the sidewalks that are uneven at the present time. This work will be done within the next week or two. Unit's getting repaired at this time will be 1311, 1313, 1315, 1321, 1323, 1325, 1406 and 1420. This work will help with getting the sidewalks leveled and being safe.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's unit was listed as one of the units to receive the repairs. Appellant testified that, to his knowledge, he had not seen the newsletter before, but acknowledged that he and his mother previously had received copies of the newsletters from appellee Central Commons at their unit. In the affidavit attached to his memorandum in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, he stated that he had never seen the newsletter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On March 29, 2017, appellant filed a complaint against appellee Central Commons Condominium Homeowners Association and West Manor Development, the owner, manager and/or operator of the condominium development. Appellant filed an amended complaint adding Harry W. Giltz, II, Harry W. Giltz, III and Grant Giltz as defendants on April 20, 2017. He alleged that the three new defendants were owners /operators of appellee Central Commons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} West Manor Development Group LLC filed an answer to the complaint on April 27, 2017. West Manor Development Group LLC and Harry W. Giltz II, Harry W. Giltz III and Grant Giltz filed an answer to the amended complaint on May 17, 2017. Appellee Central Commons Condominium Homeowners Association filed an answer to the amended complaint on May 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On July 11, 2017, appellant filed a voluntary dismissal with prejudice of West Manor Development Group LLC and, on July 17, 2017, filed a voluntary dismissal with prejudice of Harry W. Giltz, II, Harry W. Giltz, III and Grant Giltz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Thereafter, on November 21, 2017, appellee Central Commons filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. Appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion on November 21, 2017 and appellee Central Commons filed a reply on December 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The trial court, as memorialized in a Judgment Entry filed on December 28, 2017, granted the Motion for Summary Judgment. The trial court found that the condition of the sidewalk was \"an open and obvious condition that was readily observable\" by appellant and also that appellant's claim was barred by the two-inch rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant now appeals, raising the following assignment of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \"I.

No evidence or stipulation may be considered except as stated in this rule. A summary judgment shall not be rendered unless it appears from the evidence or stipulation, and only from the evidence or stipulation, that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence or stipulation construed mostly strongly in the party's favor.
