(\"Partners\") and Peter Butler (\"Butler\") (collectively referred to as \"defendants\"), appeal from the trial court's decision awarding plaintiff-appellee, Rockside-77 Properties, L.L.C. (\"Rockside\"), $35, 574.44 in damages and finding Butler's personal guaranty is capped at $49,000. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for the trial court to enter judgment that Butler's personal guaranty is capped at $6,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Rockside is a commercial landlord who owns property located at 5005 Rockside Road in Independence, Ohio (\"the property\"). Partners was one of its tenants. In March 2010, Rockside and Partners entered into a commercial lease agreement wherein Rockside leased a portion of the property to Partners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   With regard to the payment of rent, paragraph 4, the lease provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   A. RENT: Lessee [ (Partners) ] covenants and agrees to pay to Lessor [ (Rockside) ], at such place as [Rockside] may designate, as rent for said\n   Premises for and during the term of this Lease, the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (a) base rent for the first two months of the term of this Lease shall be fully abated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (b) for months 3-14, base rent in the amount of Fifty Thousand Two Hundred Forty-two and 50/100 Dollars ($50,242.50) per year, in equal monthly installments of Four Thousand One Hundred Eighty-six and 88/100 Dollars ($4,186.88) per month;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (c) for months 15-50, base rent in the amount of Sixty-three Thousand One Hundred Sixty-two Dollars ($63,162.00) per year, in equal monthly installments of Five Thousand Two Hundred Sixty-three and 50/100 Dollars ($5,263.50) per month; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (d) for months 51-62, base rent in the amount of Sixty-six Thousand Thirty-three Dollars ($66,033.00) per year, in equal monthly installments of Five Thousand Five Hundred Two and 75/100 Dollars ($5,502.75) per month;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   each due in advance, on the first day of each calendar month during said term without deduction or setoff. * * * If an installment of rent is not paid within ten (10) days of when due, or if any other payment required herein is not paid when due, then the [Partners] shall immediately pay to [Rockside] a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the amount of the late payment as liquidated damages, such amount being stipulated to by [Partners] as the amount necessary to compensate [Rockside] for [Rockside's] reasonable damages. If [Partners] shall fail to pay any rent or other charges within ten (10) days of when due, such unpaid amounts shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum from the due date until paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Paragraph 5 of the lease, titled \"Rent Adjustment,\" provided for rental obligations by Partners in addition to the annual base rent stipulated in paragraph 4. These additional rental adjustments include common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes, electricity, storage, and work orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The lease also contained a personal guaranty, which Butler signed. At that time, Butler was the president and general manager of Partners. By signing the personal guaranty, Butler agreed to guarantee the payment of rent to be paid by Partners and the performance by Partners of all the obligations required under the lease. Butler also guaranteed to pay all of Rockside's expenses, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by Rockside in enforcing all obligations of Partners under the lease or in enforcing the guaranty. The personal guaranty was limited to $60,000, but would be \"decrease[d] by $1,000 for every month\" that Partners paid rent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The guaranty provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   PERSONAL GUARANTY\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In consideration of the making of this Lease by [Rockside] with [Partners] at the request of the undersigned and in reliance on this Guaranty, the undersigned hereby guarantees the payment of the rent to be paid by [Partners] and the performance by [Partners] of all the terms, conditions, covenants and agreements of the Lease the same as if the undersigned had executed this Lease as [Partners]. This personal guaranty shall be limited to payment of $60,000, which amount shall decrease by $1,000 for every month that [Partners] makes payment of rent under this Lease (by way of illustration, once 12 months of rent payments have been made the amount remaining on the guaranty shall be\n   $48,000). The undersigned promises to pay all [Rockside's] expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by [Rockside] in enforcing all obligations of [Partners] under the Lease or incurred by [Rockside] in enforcing this Guaranty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In June 2013, Partners fell behind in its rental obligations to Rockside. Unable to resolve their dispute over the outstanding amount of rental charges, Rockside commenced the instant action seeking collection from defendants on the amount owed under the lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rockside brought a breach of contract cause of action against Partners, a breach of guaranty action against Butler, and unjust enrichment and promissory causes of action against both Partners and Butler. The matter proceeded to a bench trial, at which the following evidence was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Prestige Management (\"Prestige\"), the property manager for the property, was responsible for handling all leasing related issues pertaining to the property, including billing, lease negotiations, and maintenance. Jeffrey Hullet, vice-president of Prestige, testified that Partners was routinely late on payments and failed to make the full payments due under the lease. Nancy Mitchell (\"Mitchell\"), controller of Prestige, handled billing, invoices, and accounting relating to the property. She issued invoices, calculated rent adjustments, late fees, and interest, and communicated with Partners regarding any issues or concerns relating to its lease invoices and payments. Mitchell testified that she recorded all payments made and all rental charges incurred by Partners throughout the duration of the lease in a computer-generated tenant ledger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In May 2015, Rockside met with Butler in order to discuss Partners' outstanding balance and arrange payments. During this meeting, Butler did not dispute the amount due on principal rent payments, but questioned the calculation of interest after October 2013. Mitchell created different spreadsheets after this meeting to show Partners the amount of outstanding rental payments with adjusted late fees and without late fees and interest. Without including late fees and interest, Partners owed $18,998.20 as of May 31, 2015. With adjusted late fees, Partners owed Rockside $29,050.28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Thereafter, Partners remitted a check for $10,419.36 with the memo notation \"final rent.\" Rockside, however, did not deposit the check. Partners then vacated the property at the end of the lease term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Partners paid Rockside $312,051.11 throughout the duration of the lease. At the time of trial, Mitchell recalculated interest and late fees to reflect the amount owed by Partners as $35,574.44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Mitchell further testified that of the 60 months that Partners was required to remit rental payments to Rockside, Partners failed to make timely or full payments 49 times and only made rent payments \"pursuant to the lease terms\" for 11 months. Mitchell testified that Butler is entitled to $11,000 of \"burn off\" from the $60,000 original cap on the personal guaranty for each month that full and timely payments were made. She testified that his personal guaranty was capped at $49,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After the conclusion of trial, the court issued findings of fact and conclusions\n   of law, finding in favor of Rockside. The trial court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   34. Pursuant to Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Lease, [Partners] was obligated to make full rental payments by the first of each calendar month. Full rental payments include all charges listed on each invoice including payment of base rent, late fees, interest, common area and maintenance charges, electric, storage, non-sufficient check fees, and work orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   35. Thus, failure to pay the full amount due on each invoice by the first of each calendar month constitutes failure to pay rent pursuant to the Lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   37. [Partners] failed to make timely and/or full payments as required by the Lease for forty-nine months. [Partners] provided no evidence to dispute [Rockside's] calculation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   39. [Partners] failed to remit the $18,998.20 owed to [Rockside] as of May 31, 2015, for outstanding rent excluding late fees and interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   40. Nor did [Partners] remit $29,050.28 which was the full amount due as of May 31, 2015, for all rent inclusive of late fees and interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   41. Therefore, [Partners] failed to pay monthly obligation amount in full as it came due for forty-nine months of the Lease, and accumulated arrears as result of its non-payment in violation the Lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   42. Pursuant to the Lease, [Butler's] $60,000 personal guaranty is diminished by $1,000 for each month that payment is made pursuant to the Lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   43. By way of explanation, the personal guaranty is capped at $60,000 and $1,000 of this cap is \"burned off\" for each month in which [Partners] remits all rental charges, including payment of base rent, late fees, interest, common area and maintenance charges, electric, storage, non-sufficient check fees, and work orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   44. The personal guaranty cap does not reduce by $1,000 for months in which these payments were made after the ten-day grace period or when an outstanding balance remained due and owed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   45. Accordingly, there is sufficient credible evidence in the record which supports [Rockside's] calculation that [Butler's] personal guaranty cap is only \"burned off\" by $11,000 because there were only 11 months of full and timely payments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   46. Thus, * * * the Court finds that [Butler's] personal guaranty is capped at $49,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   47. [Rockside] satisfied its obligations under the Lease, and was therefore entitled to all rental charges, including base rent, late fees, interest, common area and maintenance charges, electric, storage, non-sufficient check fees, and work orders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   48. [Partners'] failure to make those payments as said payments came due at the first of the month was material breach of the Lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   52. [Partners] presented no evidence to dispute the amount calculated by [Rockside] of the outstanding rent owed nor did [Partners] present evidence to dispute that its past payments were untimely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   53. In light of the foregoing, the total damages arising from [Partners'] breach of the Lease is $35,574.44 through June 20, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   54. Accordingly, joint and several liability is rendered against [Partners] and [Butler] on [Rockside's] Complaint, in\n   the amount of $35,574.44 plus interest from June 20, 2015 until paid in full, reasonable attorney fees to be determined, and court costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Defendants now appeal, raising the following two assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The trial court committed reversible error by ruling in favor of [Rockside] and against [Partners and Butler] regarding Butler's obligations under the \"personal guaranty\" in the commercial lease between Rockside and Partners, holding that, as a matter of law, Butler's \"personal guaranty\" exceeded $6,000, and that Butler was therefore jointly and severally liable for unpaid rent, other costs, and attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The trial court committed reversible error by holding that [Rockside] proved its alleged damages with specificity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Personal Guaranty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In the first assignment of error, defendants argue the trial court erred as a matter of law when it found that, under the lease, Butler's personal obligation was reduced by only $11,000 to $49,000, and the personal guaranty cap was not reduced by $1,000 for months in which the payments were made after the ten-day grace period or when an outstanding balance remained due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The construction of a written contract is a matter of law that is reviewed de novo.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

In the event that rent is not paid within ten days of the due date, the lease provides a remedy for late payments - Partners is obligated to pay Rockside a 5 percent late fee, which Rockside describes as liquidated damages, and 12 percent interest per annum on the unpaid amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Paragraph 5(a), titled \"Rent Adjustment,\" provides that in addition to the\n   annual base rent stipulated in paragraph 4, Partners could be charged fees, equal to 1.14 percent of the annual rent payments, for real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and other maintenance expenses. Paragraph 5(d) describes these items as \"additional rent\" and Paragraph 5(e) sets forth separate timing requirements for the payment of any additional rent, stating that it shall be made \"on the first day of the payment of rent by [Partners] under this Lease Agreement[.]\" This additional rent is further distinguished from the rent defined in paragraph 4(A) by providing that if the additional rent (the real estate taxes and common area maintenance expenses) decreases, Partners is entitled to a credit against the rent next becoming due. Paragraph 5(f) provides a separate mechanism for any disputes included by Rockside in determining the real estate taxes and common area maintenance expenses by referring the matter to an independent, reputable firm of certified public accountants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 20} With regard to the guaranty, the lease provides that Butler\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   hereby guarantees the payment of the rent to be paid by [Partners] and the performance by [Partners] of all the terms, conditions, covenants and agreements of the Lease the same as if the undersigned had executed this Lease as [Partners]. This personal guaranty shall be limited to payment of $60,000, which amount shall decrease by $1,000 for every month that [Partners] makes payment of rent under this Lease (by way of illustration, once 12 months of rent payments have been made the amount remaining on the guaranty shall be $48,000).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 21} A plain reading of the guaranty reveals that Butler guaranteed the payment of rent and the performance of all the terms and conditions of the lease. The guaranty limited Butler's personal financial obligation to $60,000. The guaranty also established a mechanism to reduce the amount of Butler's financial obligation by providing that it \"shall decrease by $1,000 for every month that [Partners] makes payment of rent.\" The guaranty even provides an illustration describing how the deduction shall be applied. It states, \"by way of illustration, once 12 months of rent payments have been made the amount remaining on the personal guaranty shall be $48,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The guaranty, however, does not define \"rent,\" and the guaranty's reduction mechanism does not explicitly include timing requirements with respect to the rent payments. Furthermore, the guaranty does not make reference to the payment of \"additional rent,\" and does not explicitly state that its reduction mechanism is dependent on the payment of both \"rent\" and \"additional rent.\" Thus, a plain reading of the guaranty's reduction mechanism requires only the payment of \"rent.\" The guaranty's reduction mechanism also does not require the payment of late fees, which are defined by the lease as \"liquidated damages,\" or collateral charges, which are defined by the lease as \"additional rent.\" The lease provides a separate remedy for untimely payments of rent and additional rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Here, Rockside's own accounting confirms that Partners paid a total of $312,015.11. Of that amount, Rockside made at least 54 allocations to \"Office Rent Payment\" in the amounts set forth in the Lease. By Rockside's own accounting, Butler's personal financial obligation under the guaranty should be reduced to $6,000. The trial court erred as a matter of law when it determined that Partners's rent payments were ineffective in reducing Butler's financial obligation if they were not timely, or if the rent payments did not also\n   include late fees, interest payments, real estate tax payments, and common area maintenance fees because the guaranty's reduction mechanism does not expressly include those other obligations, which are beyond the stated definition of \"rent.\" Therefore, the trial court erred in interpreting the guaranty to find that Partners made only 11 qualifying \"rent\" payments, and that Butler's personal obligation under the guaranty was reduced only to $49,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Accordingly, the first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In the second assignment of error, defendants argue that Rockside did not prove its damages award of $35,574.44 with reasonable certainty. Specifically, they argue that Rockside failed because it presented differing damages calculations at trial ($33,554.49 and $29,050.28), and insisted that these calculations were accurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In reviewing the trial court's decision to award $35,574.44 in damages, we apply the standard that judgments supported by competent, credible evidence in the record must not be reversed unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Povroznik v.

Mitchell testified that after the May 2015 meeting, she created two charts to summarize the information presented on the tenant ledger and to demonstrate the amount of outstanding rental payments with and without late fees and interest. Mitchell further testified that there were varying calculations because in an attempt to resolve the dispute, Rockside recalculated interest and late fees in a method more favorable to Partners. Mitchell testified that the amount of $29,050.28 included the adjusted late fees. The amount of $33,554.49 reflects the amount of all payments that were due at the end of the lease, including late fees and interest up to the start of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 29} While the defendants argue that Rockside failed to meet its burden in proving\n   damages, defendants have not offered any evidence demonstrating that Rockside's calculations are incorrect.
