The trial court found Nathan Simmons, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of five fifth-degree felony drug-possession offenses. Appellant assigns the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR FINDING OF IMMUNITY FROM PROSECUTION.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"APPELLANT'S SENTENCE WAS CONTRARY TO LAW.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On July 29, 2016, a Washington County grand jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with five drug-possession offenses, each a fifth-degree felony. In September 2016, the General Assembly amended the drug-possession statute, R.C. 2925.11. The amendment generally grants immunity to a \"qualified individual\" who otherwise could be charged with a misdemeanor- or fifth-degree felony drug-possession offense. For immunity to attach, the individual must satisfy the statutory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant filed a motion to request the court to find him immune from prosecution under the amended statute. Appellant argued that he is a \"qualified individual\" under the statute and that he meets all of the requirements outlined in the statute. Appellant asserted that on July 5, 2015, he\n   was found unresponsive due to a suspected heroin overdose and emergency medical personnel revived him with Narcan. Appellant further claimed that he returned to his drug treatment program less than three weeks later, and remained in treatment until September 19, 2016. Appellant thus contended that he is a \"qualified individual\" and is therefore immune from prosecution under the amended statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In support of his motion, appellant attached a letter from his drug-treatment counselor that stated: \"[Appellant] entered treatment in 2004 [sic] and had left treatment for 30 days in June 2015 due to non-compliance and then returned for treatment on July 23, 2015. He was then discharged from treatment on September 19, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant thus alleged that the evidence shows that: (1) he was charged after a drug overdose and was treated by emergency medical personnel; (2) he \"returned to counseling for his addiction within thirty (30) days of his overdose\"; and (3) he remained in treatment until September 19, 2016. Appellant further asserted that he \"is ready, willing and able to provide the prosecuting attorney any necessary documentation required under the statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The state, however, opposed appellant's motion for immunity under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b). The state first asserted that appellant is not a \"qualified individual\" under 2925.11(B)(2)(b)(ii). That provision specifies that to be entitled to immunity, the \"qualified individual\" must seek or obtain a screening and receive a referral for treatment within thirty days of obtaining medical treatment. The state argued that appellant did not present evidence that he sought a screening and received a referral for treatment within thirty days of his overdose, but instead, he showed only that he returned to his previous counseling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The state also claimed that even if appellant is a \"qualified individual,\" the amended statute does not apply to individuals, like appellant, who committed a drug possession offense before the amendment's effective date. The state asserted that the General Assembly did not explicitly indicate that the statute applies retroactively, and thus, the statute applies prospectively only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The state also asserted that R.C. 1.58(B) does not apply. The state noted that R.C. 1.58(B) provides that if a statutory amendment reduces the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment for any offense, then \"the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the statute as amended.\" The state claimed, however, that R.C. 2929.11(B)(2)(b) did not reduce the penalty or punishment for a drug possession offense. The state maintained that R.C. 2929.11(B)(2)(b) immunity is not the same as a reduction in penalty or punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In response, appellant asserted that he had received a screening and a referral for treatment within thirty days of his overdose. Appellant included a second letter from his drug-treatment provider. This letter stated that when appellant \"entered treatment [on] July 27, 2015[,] he had to provide a drug screen analysis along with having a bio-psychosocial assessment. After assessment, patient met criteria to be referred into treatment. Patient stated he needed to be in treatment due to an overdose. [Appellant] continued to be compliant in treatment until 9/9/2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Appellant further disputed the state's assertion that R.C. 1.58(B) is inapplicable to R.C. 2929.11(B)(2)(b). Appellant argued that immunity, by definition, prevents a person from being prosecuted or\n   penalized, and as such, immunity constitutes a reduction in penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 9, 2017, the trial court overruled appellant's motion. The court determined that the amendment is more in the nature of a repeal of criminal conduct, rather than a reduction in penalty. The court found that under R.C. 1.58(A), \"if a criminal statute is repealed and no longer defines a crime, a person can be prosecuted and convicted of the violation of the former statute. However, under R.C. 1.58(B), if the penalty is reduced under the amendment, then the reduced penalty shall be imposed if the penalty has not yet been imposed.\" The court reasoned: \"If immunity were to apply to the Defendant, then the Court would not have the ability to follow R.C. 1.58(B) and impose a reduced penalty upon the Defendant since the Defendant would not be subject to criminal prosecution at all. Therefore, the Court finds that immunity is more in the nature of a repeal of criminal conduct and that R.C. 1.58(A) applies. The General Assembly did not explicitly state that the amendment to R.C. 2925.11(B) is to be applied retroactively.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant subsequently entered no contest pleas to the five counts of the indictment. The court found appellant guilty and sentenced him in accordance with the parties' agreement. This appeal followed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling his motion for immunity under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b). He contends that the trial court incorrectly determined that the amendment is more in the nature of a repeal of criminal conduct subject to R.C. 1.58(A), rather than a reduction in penalty subject to R.C. 1.58(B). Appellant argues that the amendment does not repeal the offense of drug possession, but instead, the amendment reduces the penalty for qualified individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state argues that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) does not apply to appellant. The state points out that appellant's offenses occurred before the effective date of R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) and that the statute does not contain any indication that it applies retroactively. The state further asserts that even if the statute did apply retroactively, appellant failed to satisfy all of the requirements specified in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We initially note that both parties advocate that we apply an abuse-of-discretion standard to the trial court's decision regarding the statute's applicability to appellant's situation. The state cites two cases to support its assertion that an abuse-of-discretion applies:\n   <em>\n    Urbana ex rel. Newlin v. Downing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1418292\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/43/109/#p113\">\n    43 Ohio St.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=539%20N.E.2d%20140\">\n    539 N.E.2d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), and\n   <em>\n    State v.

Both cases indicate that appellate courts review trial court decisions regarding evidence-admissibility for an abuse of discretion. Neither case, however, addresses the standard of review that applies when reviewing a trial court's decision concerning the applicability of a statute. Appellant simply asserts that appellate courts \"review[ ] the denial of a motion for an abuse of discretion.\" We do not believe that the abuse-of-discretion standard applies in the case sub judice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} \"When a court's judgment is based on an erroneous interpretation of the law, an abuse-of-discretion standard is not appropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Med.

The trial court examined R.C. 1.58 and determined that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) operated as a repeal of an existing statute, rather than a reduction in penalty. The court thus concluded that under R.C. 1.58(A), the recently-amended 2925.11(B)(2)(b) did not apply to an individual who, like appellant, committed the offense and was arrested or charged before the statute's effective date. Appellant's first assignment of error thus, in essence, questions whether the trial court correctly interpreted R.C. 1.58 and R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The abuse-of-discretion standard does not apply to a trial court's interpretation of a statute. Rather, the correct interpretation of a statute is a question of law subject to de-novo review.\n   <em>\n    State v.

After appellant's indictment but before his conviction, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2925.11. The amendment added R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b), which grants immunity to \"a qualified individual.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(f) (describing R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) as granting immunity). More specifically, the statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [A] qualified individual shall not be arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, or penalized pursuant to this chapter for a minor drug possession offense if all of the following apply:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (I) The evidence of the obtaining, possession, or use of the controlled substance or controlled substance analog that would be the basis of the offense was obtained as a result of the qualified individual seeking the medical assistance or experiencing an overdose and needing medical assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (ii) Subject to division (B)(2)(g) of this section, within thirty days after seeking or obtaining the medical assistance, the qualified individual seeks and obtains a screening and receives a referral for treatment from a community addiction services provider or a properly credentialed addiction treatment professional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (iii) Subject to division (B)(2)(g) of this section, the qualified individual who obtains a screening and receives a referral for treatment under division (B)(2)(b)(ii) of this section, upon the request of any prosecuting attorney, submits documentation to the prosecuting attorney that verifies that the qualified individual satisfied the requirements of that division.

The court noted that before the trial court convicted and sentenced appellant, the General Assembly amended the felony sentencing statutes so as to reduce the length of a prison term for first-degree-felony offenders, such as Thomas. The court observed that the uncodified law indicated that the \"penalty-reduction provisions apply to those offenders to whom R.C. 1.58 applies.\" 2011 Am.Sub.H.B. 86, Sections 3-4.

In reaching its decision, the court rejected the state's assertion that a statutory amendment that decreases the classification of an offense does not constitute an amendment to the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment within the meaning of R.C. 1.58(B). The court explained \"[t]he flaw\" in the state's position \"is that implicit in a decrease in the classification of an offense from a felony of the fifth degree to a misdemeanor of the first degree is a corresponding reduction in the penalty or punishment for that conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.

In\n   <em>\n    Limoli\n   </em>\n   , the state charged the defendant with third-degree felony crack-cocaine-possession, which carried a mandatory prison term. Before the defendant's sentencing, the General Assembly amended the statute to eliminate any reference to crack-cocaine. As amended, possession of cocaine-crack or otherwise-constituted a fourth-degree felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The state argued that R.C. 1.58(B) did not apply to the General Assembly's amendment to the cocaine-possession statute. The state claimed that the amendment did not reduce the penalty for crack cocaine, but rather, the amendment eliminated any reference to crack cocaine and thus changed the nature of offense. The supreme court disagreed. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [U]nder the logic employed by the state, it would no longer be a crime to possess crack cocaine. We disagree. Crack cocaine is simply another form of cocaine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2925.01(X). To conclude otherwise would be absurd. Crack cocaine still\n   exists, and under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4) \u00a9, it is still illegal to possess it. There is no reason to believe that the legislature intended to legalize its possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. The court therefore determined that R.C. 1.58(B) entitled the defendant to receive the reduced penalty provided in the amended statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In the case sub judice, we agree with appellant that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) operates to reduce the penalty/punishment for a minor drug possession offense. Before the General Assembly amended R.C. 2925.11, appellant's offense was classified as a fifth-degree felony, and the trial court could have sentenced appellant to community control or prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2925.11(B)(6)(a) ; 2929.13(B); 2929.14(A)(5). After the amendment, possession of the amount of heroin charged in appellant's indictment still constitutes a crime. Under the amendment, however, appellant cannot be prosecuted, convicted, or penalized at all for fifth-degree felony drug-possession, provided he meets the definition of a \"qualified individual\" and satisfies the statutory requirements. The amendment thus reduces the penalty/punishment for a \"qualified individual\" who meets the statutory requirements from a prison sentence-at worst-to no penalty/punishment whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 42} R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) thus grants immunity to a qualified individual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(f) (describing R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) as granting immunity); 2016 Ohio Laws File 87 (Sub. H.B. 110) (stating that purpose of amendment is \"to provide immunity from arrest, prosecution, or conviction * * * for a minor drug possession offense for a person who seeks or obtains medical assistance for self\"). \"Immunity\" means \"[f]reedom or exemption from penalty * * *.\" Black's at 751. Immunity, therefore, not only reduces the penalty, but it completely removes the penalty. We hence believe that the immunity contemplated in R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) not only reduces, but completely eliminates, \"the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment\" a qualified individual would otherwise face for a minor drug possession offense. Consequently, because R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) reduces by elimination \"the penalty, forfeiture, or punishment\" a qualified individual would otherwise face for a minor drug possession offense, R.C. 1.58(B) applies and requires the trial court to ascertain whether appellant is entitled to immunity under R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 43} We do not agree with the trial court that the amendment is more in the nature of a repeal of a statute subject to R.C. 1.58(A)(3). R.C. 2925.11 continues to define drug-possession as a crime, and R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) does not state that drug-possession no longer is a crime. Instead, the amendment defines the types of individuals not subject to arrest, prosecution, conviction, or punishment for committing a minor drug-possession offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 44} We observe that the Ninth and the Twelfth District Courts of Appeal also have considered whether R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) applies to defendants whose offenses occurred before the effective date of the amendment, but who were not prosecuted, convicted, or sentenced until after the amendment became effective.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court did not consider R.C. 1.58(B) at all, but instead, limited its analysis\n   to whether the General Assembly expressed an intent to apply the statute retroactively. The court determined that R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) did not apply retroactively so as to preclude the prosecution of a defendant who committed the offense before the statute's enactment. The court stated: \" '[t]he General Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis, and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12, quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court concluded that the defendant was entitled to R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) immunity, even though the defendant overdosed, received emergency medical assistance, and subsequently completed drug addiction treatment before the effective date of the amendment. The court determined that \"[t]he date of an overdose is not relevant in order for a person to seek treatment and comply with all the requirements of R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b). Rather, the question is: has the person seeking protection of R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) been prosecuted, convicted, or penalized yet?\" The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   According to the plain language of [ R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b) ], \"a qualified individual shall not be\" charged, tried, or punished for petty drug offenses when certain requirements are met. There is nothing in the plain language of the statute that makes the prohibitions of being tried, convicted, or punished applicable only to those who overdosed after a specific date, nor does the plain language of the statute disqualify one who overdosed before the statute's effective date. Even if charged prior to the statute's enactment, the statute specifically dictates that trial courts shall not convict, or penalize one who overdoses if the treatment conditions have been met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 47} The\n   <em>\n    Vineyard\n   </em>\n   court did not believe that applying the statute to the defendant's circumstances resulted in a retroactive application of the statute. Instead, the court concluded that the statute's plain terms applied to the defendant's situation. The court stated: \"The statute, as written, instructs trial courts that a person who overdosed from drugs but sought medical treatment should not be prosecuted, convicted, or penalized if that person meets all the requirements set forth in the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.

Instead, on remand the trial court may determine, in the first instance, whether appellant notified all of the statutory requirements for immunity to attach.
