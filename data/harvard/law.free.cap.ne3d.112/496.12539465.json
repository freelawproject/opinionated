For the reasons that follow, we affirm and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural and Substantive History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal stems from a wrongful death action instituted against the city of East Cleveland. The following factual summary is based on the Ohio State Highway Patrol Reconstruction Report. Both parties relied on this report in their filings before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On October 3, 2015, at approximately 9:30 p.m., 22-year-old Christopher Kimble (\"Kimble\") was in a crosswalk when Pettus struck and killed him. Pettus was driving a police cruiser with one nonfunctioning headlight. Additionally, the cruiser's lights and sirens were not activated. The speed limit for the area of the incident, the intersection of Superior Avenue and Emily Street in East Cleveland, was 25 miles per hour. At the time of the accident, Pettus was traveling eastbound on Superior Avenue at a speed of approximately 35 to 40 miles per hour. At the time of the accident, the painted crosswalks at the intersection were worn out and not visible. Further, the crosswalk signs were inoperable. Superior Avenue had flashing yellow lights, and Emily Street had flashing red lights. The roadway was dark, and the nearby overhead street lights were inoperable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On February 12, 2016, plaintiff-appellee Latoya Ceasor (\"Ceasor\") filed a complaint against the city and Pettus in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Ceasor is the decedent Kimble's mother and the duly appointed administrator of his estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The complaint alleged that Pettus's operation of the police cruiser that struck Kimble constituted negligent, reckless, willful, and/or wanton misconduct. These allegations were based on Pettus's driving at an excessive rate of speed through an intersection known to be heavily populated by pedestrians, traveling at an excessive rate of speed without implementing his sirens or emergency lights, operating the vehicle with only one working headlight at night, and failing to keep proper lookout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The complaint further alleged that the city was negligent in failing to properly maintain or design the intersection, failing to properly maintain its police motor vehicles and property, and failing to properly train its officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The complaint also specifically alleged that the city was vicariously liable for Pettus's actions and that Pettus was liable pursuant to the exception to political subdivision immunity codified in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b). Finally, Ceasor alleged that the city and/or Pettus were liable for spoliation for intentionally and/or negligently destroying or failing to record and preserve body camera evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On February 26, 2016, the city and Pettus (collectively, \"defendants\") filed a joint answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On August 28, 2017, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 56, arguing that none of the exceptions to sovereign immunity in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply to this case, and that Ceasor failed to present evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On September 26, 2017, Ceasor filed a memorandum in opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On October 4, 2017, defendants filed a motion to strike the expert report attached to Ceasor's September 26 memorandum in opposition to summary judgment. The report in question was a crash reconstruction report prepared by Ohio State Highway Patrol Lieutenant John C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thorne and was attached to defendants' motion for summary judgment. On October 6, 2017, defendants filed a reply brief in support of their motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The city appeals from the trial court's denial of its motion for summary judgment, presenting the following four assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I.

This assertion was accompanied by a recitation of several of the relevant exceptions but was unsupported by law or facts from the case. According to the city, because none of the exceptions to immunity apply, it is unnecessary to engage in the third tier of the analysis. In response, Ceasor argues that R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) provides an exception to the city's general grant of immunity. That section states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [P]olitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent operation of any motor vehicle by their employees when the employees are engaged within the scope of their employment and authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a) provides that where \"[a] member of a municipal corporation police department or any other police agency was operating a motor vehicle while responding to an emergency call and the operation of the vehicle did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct,\" that constitutes a full defense to liability. A further exception to immunity can be found in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b), which provides that an employee will not be immune from liability where \"the employee's acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\" Ceasor argues that defendants are not entitled to immunity because of Pettus's negligent operation of a motor vehicle, pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(1). The city asserts that Pettus was responding to an emergency call when the fatal accident occurred. We note that the city\n   implicitly asserts that Pettus was not negligent, and therefore it does not expressly argue that his responding to an emergency call operates as a full defense to liability pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(1)(a). Even if it did, though, Ceasor argues that this cannot operate as a full defense because Pettus acted in a \"wanton or reckless manner\" pursuant to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} We find the city's unsupported assertions insufficient for summary judgment purposes. A party moving for summary judgment must affirmatively establish that the nonmoving party's claims lack support by pointing to evidence in the form of pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, or affidavits. Civ.R. 56(C). While the city appended several documents to its motion for summary judgment, at no point has it pointed to any evidence that support its entitlement to immunity. We agree with the trial court that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Pettus was engaged in \"willful or wanton misconduct\" or acted in a \"wanton or reckless manner.\" Because the issue of whether an employee acted in a wanton or reckless manner under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b) is typically a question of fact for the jury, a trial court may not grant summary judgment on the basis of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) immunity unless reasonable minds could only conclude that the employee did not act in a wanton or reckless manner.\n   <em>\n    Chavalia v.

An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    Blakemore v. Blakemore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1812704\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/5/217/#p219\">\n    5 Ohio St.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 219,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=450%20N.E.2d%201140\">\n    450 N.E.2d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). Here, the city filed a motion to strike the crash reconstruction report that Ceasor attached to her opposition to the city's motion for summary judgment. This report had previously been attached to the city's motion for summary judgment. The city does not argue that the report is not proper Civ.R. 56 evidence. Instead, in support\n   of this motion, the city argued that it was untimely filed and therefore failed to comply with Loc.R. 21.1(B) of the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County, General Division. Because the motion was properly before the trial court as Civ.R. 56 evidence for summary judgment purposes, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the city's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 24} For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ANITA LASTER MAYS, J., and LARRY A.
