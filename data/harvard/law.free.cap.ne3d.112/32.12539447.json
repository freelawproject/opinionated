Following a bench trial, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas convicted him of all counts and imposed an aggregate sentence of 16 years in prison. On appeal, Dean argues that his convictions were not supported by legally sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. He also argues that the two rape convictions should merge with one another, and that the rape and kidnapping convictions should also merge. Finally, Dean challenges the costs imposed by the trial court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The victim in this case, referred to as \"I.M.R.,\" offered the following testimony at trial. I.M.R. is a married, mother of three. Between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. on April 20, 2016, I.M.R. was walking on Lagrange Street in downtown Toledo, near the Gold Star liquor store, talking on her cell phone with a friend. A person, whom she identified in court as Dean, approached her from behind. When I.M.R. turned to face him, Dean said, \"if you don't come with me, I'm going to shoot you out here.\" Dean showed her a black gun from within his coat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} I.M.R. hung up on her friend and followed Dean, walking behind him and \"hoping he wouldn't shoot\" her. Dean led I.M.R. for a block or two down Lagrange, then to an alley which led to the back porch of an abandoned duplex. Dean sat on a chair and ordered I.M.R. to her knees. I.M.R. testified that, \"[Dean] told me if I didn't give him oral he's going to shoot me in the head. So I got down and I gave him oral.\" Dean had an erection and ejaculated into her mouth, which she spat out. Dean then pulled the trigger of the gun, but it did not fire. Dean said, \"[o]ops, you almost got killed. * * * [I]f you don't do it again, you going to get killed * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} I.M.R. then \"went down there\" and performed oral sex on Dean again. While she did, Dean put the gun back into his coat pocket. I.M.R. testified, \"I had a lot of thoughts going through my head\" including that \"he was going to kill me\" and \"I wasn't leaving that night.\" I.M.R. decided to fight back and bit down on Dean's penis. She testified, \"I tried to bite it off, but my whole body wouldn't let me * * * because I was too weak.\" Dean screamed and \"socked\" I.M.R. in the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The two began to fight. As described by I.M.R., she \"head butted\" and \"kneed [Dean] in his stuff.\" Dean pulled the gun back out of his pocket. I.M.R. reached for the gun and managed to pull the trigger. I.M.R. heard the gun \"click\" a couple of times. She testified, \"I was like, 'damn, you ain't even got no bullets.' He said, '[epithet], your ass is gone' and I tried to run.\" Dean yanked the gun away from I.M.R., but her finger was stuck in the trigger, causing her skin to rip off. The gun fell. Dean then pulled I.M.R. by the hair and began \"socking\" her in the head and face with a closed fist. I.M.R. returned Dean's punches with her own and pulled out a 4-inch bread knife from within her pocket. The knife fell to the ground. I.M.R. and Dean each screamed and fled. Dean ran toward the front of the house, and I.M.R. ran toward the back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} I.M.R. got herself to St. Vincent Medical Center in downtown Toledo. The earliest medical record created that night indicates a time of 10:50 p.m. At that time, I.M.R. reported that she had been raped, that she thought she may have bitten the genitals off of her attacker, and that she thought she had a broken nose. The hospital\n   records confirm a nasal fracture. While at the hospital that night, I.M.R. reported the incident multiple times, to nurses, physicians, and the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Registered Nurse Courtney Whited examined I.M.R. that evening. Whited is a sexual assault nurse examiner (\"SANE\") who is trained to administer care to sexual assault victims and to collect and secure evidence. Whited described I.M.R. as upset and not very talkative. She observed that I.M.R.'s face was swollen with dried blood below her nose and on her cheeks. Whited testified that \"something had definitely happened [to her] at some point during the night.\" According to Whited's report, I.M.R. told her that an unknown man had forced her at gunpoint to \"walk with him * * * for a few streets\" and then demanded that she \"suck his dick or 'I'll shoot you.' \" I.M.R. estimated that the assault lasted about 30 minutes. Whited collected swab samples from inside I.M.R.'s mouth and from around her face. She also took photographs. Whited turned the evidence over to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The hospital reported the rape to the Toledo Police. Officer Bradley Knapp was dispatched to the hospital and interviewed I.M.R. He described I.M.R. as \"very frantic\" and \"panicky.\" Because potential felonies were involved, Officer Knapp contacted the police department's investigative services division, which dispatched Detective Diane Trevino. Detective Trevino works in the special victims unit and investigates sexual assault cases. She interviewed I.M.R. and based on I.M.R.'s description of the location, Detective Trevino and Officer Knapp left the hospital in search of the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The officers were able to locate the abandoned duplex and alley off Palmer Street, which intersects with Lagrange. On the cement patio, the officers observed a gun (later identified as a \"Ruger air pistol\"), an overturned chair, a cell phone (which was later identified as I.M.R.'s phone), a few drops of blood, and a black stocking hat. Detective Trevino called Detective Terry Cousino, who arrived at the scene around 2:00 a.m. Detective Cousino photographed and collected the evidence, including two blood swabs from the porch. I.M.R.'s knife was not among the evidence collected at the scene. The police turned over the evidence to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations (\"BCI\") for forensic testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Julie Cox is a forensic scientist with the BCI. Cox is trained to perform examinations for the presence of biological fluids such as semen, saliva, and blood. Cox tested the items in I.M.R.'s rape kit. She identified the presence of seminal fluid and blood on I.M.R.'s oral samples. She also identified blood on the air pistol and more blood from the two samples taken from the porch floor. Logan Schepeler, also with the BCI, is a deoxyribonucleic acid (\"DNA\") analyst. Schepeler analyzed samples taken from I.M.R.'s right hand, the swab sample from the air gun, the nylon cap, the oral samples taken from I.M.R., and fingernail scrapings. The BCI analyzed that evidence and, based on the agency's findings, it identified Dean as a possible suspect. Specifically, Schepeler concluded that Dean's DNA matched DNA found on the nylon cap and was a significant match to the DNA found on the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On May 13, 2016, the BCI provided Dean's name as a possible suspect to the Toledo Police. Detective Trevino, in turn, prepared a photo array. The array shows six individuals, and Dean was shown in photograph No. 5. Three days later, Toledo Police Officer Kevin Konz administered I.M.R.'s viewing of the photo array. Konz had no knowledge of the facts of the case, which is standard operating procedure when presenting a photo array to a\n   witness. According to Officer Konz, I.M.R. identified Dean as her attacker \"immediately.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Detective Trevino obtained a search warrant for Dean's DNA as a \"confirmatory\" measure. At the time, Dean was being held in the Lucas County Jail on an unrelated assault charge. Detective Trevino collected two DNA swabs from Dean and sent those to the BCI for testing. The BCI reported back that Dean's DNA matched the evidence that had been sent there. That evidence was then presented to the Lucas County Grand Jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On June 24, 2016, the Grand Jury indicted Dean on two counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2) and (B), felonies of the first degree; felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and (D), a felony of the second degree; and kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) and (C), a felony of the first degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On July 6, 2016, Detective Trevino interviewed Dean in jail. The recorded interview was played at trial. Detective Trevino advised Dean of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights, showed him a picture of I.M.R., and the following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q. Do you know that female?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A. No ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. You don't think you've ever seen her before?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. No ma'am.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Never had a sexual relationship with that female?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Never had a sexual relationship with that female at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. * * * Do you know her at all for any reason * * *?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A. She could be a prostitute. She looks like a prostitute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Dean admitted that he occasionally had relations with prostitutes, but he was adamant that he was with his girlfriend on April 20, 2016 and that he \"ain't never seen\" I.M.R. He claimed that he stayed at the home of his girlfriend's mom between April 20 and May 26, 2016, when he was arrested for domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} At trial, Dean repeated his claim that he was with his then-girlfriend, N.W., on the evening of April 20, 2016. Dean testified that the two of them attended a family birthday party on Elm Street, along with N.W.'s mother, Barbara. Dean estimated that they were at the party between 8:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., when the three of them returned to Barbara's home on Locust Street. Dean spent the night there, and stayed there until he was arrested for assaulting N.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} At trial, Dean changed part of his story. Although he previously told Detective Trevino that he did not know I.M.R., he testified at trial that he had a sexual encounter with I.M.R. a \"couple of days before\" April 20, 2016. Dean claims that he gave I.M.R. fake drugs in exchange for sex, and that the encounter was consensual. According to Dean, he ground up a white candle to look like crack, which he intended to use \"to get sex from a drug addict.\" Dean walked down Lagrange \"intending to go have sex with a prostitute if [he saw] one walking down the street.\" Dean claims he saw I.M.R., and he assumed she was a prostitute because she was standing on the corner of Lagrange which he knew to be frequented by \"prostitutes, drug dealers and johns.\" Dean asked if I.M.R. would \"like to exchange oral sex for some dope.\" Dean testified that the two of them walked down the street for a couple of blocks, then down an alley; that he put on a condom to protect himself from a sexually transmitted disease ; and that I.M.R. performed oral sex on him. Afterward, Dean removed his condom and gave I.M.R. the \"dummy dope.\" According to Dean, it was I.M.R. who was\n   carrying the gun, which she offered to Dean in exchange for \"another dope piece.\" Dean declined the offer and left \"quickly before she could find out that the dope was fake.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Dean admits that his DNA was found inside and outside of I.M.R.'s mouth and that his and I.M.R.'s DNA were on the trigger of the gun. Dean denied any type of physical altercation between himself and I.M.R., and specifically denied that I.M.R. bit his penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 19} N.W. and her mother Barbara testified by subpoena. N.W. testified that Dean came over around 5:30 or 6:00 p.m. on April 20, 2016; that they went to her nephew's birthday party on Elm Street; that they stayed at the party about four and one-half to five hours; and that they returned to her mother's home around 10:30 or 11:00 p.m. N.W. asserted that Dean \"stayed with us the whole time.\" Barbara offered similar testimony, but thought that the three of them left the birthday party a little earlier, around 9:30 or 10:00 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The trial court took the matter under advisement. On December 5, 2016, the court found Dean guilty of two counts of rape (fellatio), one count of felonious assault, and one count of kidnapping. In its order, the trial court commented,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [T]he state has proven all of the essential elements of each of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt [and Dean's] version of events does not survive scrutiny. He denies ever having seen [I.M.R.] to Detective Trevino, and denies having any sexual relations with her. Then his DNA is found in her mouth and around her face. He denies any physical altercation, but his DNA is found on the gun. He claims a prostitute, two days earlier, tried to sell him the gun for drugs, but it was all messed up and had no handle. The gun found at the scene obviously has a handle, and although it is some form of air pistol, it looks passably like a handgun. He is a trained boxer, and [I.M.R.'s] face looks like it was treated as a punching bag.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} A sentencing hearing was held on December 12, 2016. The court sentenced Dean to eight years in prison as to Count 1 (rape); eight years as to Count 2 (rape); eight years as to Count 3 (felonious assault), and six years as to Count 4 (kidnapping). It ordered that Counts 1, 2, and 4 be served concurrently, but consecutive to Count 3, for a total prison term of 16 years. The court specifically found that none of the charges were allied offenses of similar import and therefore none of them merged. Through his appointed appellate counsel, Dean appealed. He asserts three assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </strong>\n   : Appellant's convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </strong>\n   : The trial court erred in failing to merge the two counts of rape, and erred in failing to merge the rape counts with the kidnapping count, thereby violating the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </strong>\n   : The trial court erred in imposing the cost of appointed counsel fees and costs of confinement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In his first assignment of error, Dean argues that his convictions were not supported by legally sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence introduced at trial is legally sufficient to support a verdict.\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the completion of the first rape, Dean ejaculated into I.M.R.'s mouth and withdrew his penis. I.M.R. spat out the ejaculate. A second rape then occurred when Dean, once again, forced his penis into her mouth after threatening to kill her if she did not \"do it again.\" During the second rape, I.M.R. fought back by biting Dean, and a physical fight ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Dean complains that the state misstated the sequence of events when urging the court to deny his motion to acquit. According to Dean, I.M.R. testified that Dean pulled the trigger of the gun (which did not fire), ejaculated, and then ordered her to perform fellatio again. Dean claims the state incorrectly argued that Dean ejaculated and\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   pulled the trigger. We find that I.M.R.'s testimony does not support Dean's version of events and, regardless, the order of those specific events is irrelevant. What matters is that I.M.R. testified that Dean penetrated her two separate times after threatening to kill her if she did not comply with his demands. In fact, the second rape occurred after Dean renewed his threat to kill her if she did not \"do it again.\" We reject Dean's argument that the two oral rapes were actually one continuous act without any substantial intervening event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 35} We find that I.M.R.'s testimony that she was forced to perform fellatio on Dean two times, \"if believed, is sufficient to support each element of rape.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, although I.M.R.'s testimony need not be supported by physical evidence or other corroborating testimony, there is DNA evidence linking Dean to the crime. For all of these reasons, we find that each count of rape is supported by legally sufficient evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Dean also argues that the rape convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. He claims that several pieces of evidence demonstrate that Dean and I.M.R. engaged in consensual sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 37} First, Dean argues that Detective Trevino's testimony regarding a \"SkyCop\" video from outside the liquor store demonstrates that Dean did not kidnap I.M.R. and, therefore, the sex must have been consensual as well. Although the video was not entered into evidence, Detective Trevino testified that I.M.R. is shown talking on her cell phone while crossing the street, but Dean is not visible. Dean argues that his absence from the video proves that I.M.R. followed him voluntarily to engage in sex. We disagree. Assuming that the video shows I.M.R. crossing the street alone, the footage may have been captured before Dean approached her. Regardless, given that the SkyCop video is not in the record, we cannot view it and must presume regularity in the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Knapp v.

We certainly cannot find that the rape convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence based on evidence that is not in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Dean also complains that the rape convictions should be overturned because I.M.R. is not credible. He claims that I.M.R. \"was in fact a prostitute who was upset that the drugs were fake,\" relying upon his own testimony that I.M.R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   performed fellatio on him for \"fake crack\" a few days before she was attacked. Dean also claims that I.M.R. \"changed her version of facts,\" and offers one example: a medical report that was prepared by Gordon Bee, R.N., on the night of the rapes. According to that report, I.M.R. said that her attacker \"forced her into a car and threatened her with a gun [and stated] 'if she didn't suck his dick he would piss on her.' \" The report contradicts three other reports prepared that evening, as well as I.M.R.'s trial testimony and the testimony of two police officers, who testified that I.M.R. was forced\n   <em>\n    to walk\n   </em>\n   to the location of the rapes. I.M.R. testified that she did not remember making the statements attributed to her in Bee's report, and she specifically denied making them to Detective Trevino in a subsequent interview with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Although we consider the credibility of witnesses under a manifest-weight standard, we must, nonetheless, extend special deference to the fact finder's credibility determinations, given that it is the fact finder who has the benefit of seeing the witnesses testify, observing their facial expressions and body language, hearing their voice inflections, and discerning qualities such as hesitancy, equivocation, and candor.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although we acknowledge, as the trial court did, that the state's case is not free of inconsistencies, we find that none of the purported evidence cited by Dean undermines the trial court's conclusions that (1) the state proved the elements of its rape case beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) Dean's \"version of events does not survive scrutiny.\" As the court noted, Dean is an admitted liar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Upon review of the entire record, we find that the trial court could reasonably conclude from the evidence presented that the state proved the offenses of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. We further find that the court, as trier of fact, did not clearly lose its way or create a manifest miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Kidnapping\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Dean was also found guilty of kidnapping pursuant to R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) which provides that, \"(A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * * shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, * * * [t]o engage in sexual activity, as defined in section 2907.01 of the Revised Code, with the victim against the victim's will.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In support of its kidnapping case, the state relied upon I.M.R.'s testimony that Dean removed I.M.R. from the location where he found her, on Lagrange Street outside of the liquor store, under threat of force, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity against I.M.R.'s will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Dean makes no argument to support his conclusion that the kidnapping conviction is not supported by legally sufficient evidence. Instead, Dean simply restates his own version of events and argues that I.M.R. was not credible. In analyzing whether a conviction is based upon sufficient evidence, however, we do not assess whether the evidence is to be believed, but instead, whether the evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. Here, the testimony of I.M.R., if believed, is sufficient to find Dean guilty of kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 44} As for the weight of the evidence, Dean argues that he is more credible than I.M.R. due to her \"conflicting statements.\" But \"[a] conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because the jury believed the prosecution testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Felonious Assault\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Dean was also convicted of felonious assault. R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) provides that \"no person shall knowingly * * * [c]ause serious physical harm to another * * *.\" \"Serious physical harm\" is defined as \"[a]ny physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Dean put forth no argument to challenge his felonious assault conviction except to say that \"if his convictions for rape and kidnapping were against the manifest weight of the evidence, or were unsupported by sufficient evidence, [then] the conviction for felonious assault would logically also have to be vacated and reversed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Upon review of the evidence submitted at the trial below, we find that there was sufficient evidence to find that Dean caused serious physical harm to I.M.R., and the conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. At trial, I.M.R. testified that Dean gave her a fractured nose, lacerations to her face and hands, and a spinal cord injury. I.M.R.'s testimony was corroborated with pictures and medical reports, and the trial court found the state's evidence persuasive, commenting that \"[Dean] is a trained boxer, and [I.M.R.'s] face looks like it was treated as a punching bag.\" In determining whether the state proved the \"serious physical harm\" element, Ohio appellate courts have held that \"[w]here injuries are serious enough to cause [the victim] to seek medical treatment, the finder of fact may reasonably infer that the force exerted on the victim caused serious physical harm as defined by R.C. 2901.01(A)(5).\" (Citations omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

At the sentencing hearing, one week later, Dean acknowledged the court's ruling on merger but did not object to it. Dean did, however, urge the court to impose\n   concurrent sentences. The court sentenced Dean to serve eight years for each rape conviction and six years for the kidnapping conviction, to be served concurrently to one another (but consecutively to the eight-year sentence for the felonious assault conviction).

The Rape Convictions Do Not Merge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 55} In support of merging his rape convictions, Dean relies on the same basic argument that he raised in his first assignment of error, i.e. that his actions amount to a continuing course of conduct with no significant break in time or intervening act. We have already rejected this argument as it relates to whether each rape conviction was supported by legally sufficient evidence. Here, Dean argues in the alternative that, even if he could be found guilty of two counts of rape, the convictions must merge because his \"conduct constituting the two counts of rape occurred at the same time, were the same act, and were allegedly done to the same victim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Turning to the first question posed in\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   , because the offenses were perpetrated against the same victim, we must consider whether the two rapes caused I.M.R. to suffer \"separate and identifiable\" harm. We find that they did. Each oral rape caused independent physical injury and exposed I.M.R. to an increased risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease. Indeed, I.M.R. repeatedly expressed her fear, at the hospital and at trial, that she had been exposed to warts or human immunodeficiency virus (\"HIV\") from Dean. It may also be said, as a matter of law and common sense, that each rape caused I.M.R. to suffer separate and additional psychological trauma.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We therefore find that each rape caused I.M.R. to suffer separate and identifiable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 57} We also find that the two rapes were committed separately and with a separate animus, the second and third prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Ruff\n   </em>\n   analysis, which we consider together.

He argues that his rape convictions should merge because his alleged conduct involves \"the same act,\" i.e., fellatio, and was \"part of a continuing course of conduct.\" This same argument was made by the defendant in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court merged all four convictions into one, finding that the offenses were based on one act with the same animus. The court of appeals found multiple errors, one for merging the anal rapes with the vaginal rapes because the rapes were \"committed to a different body part.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209595417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Of particular relevance to this case, the court also found that the two counts of anal rape did not merge with one another and the two counts of vaginal rape did not merge with one another. The court found that the offenses did not merge because the record demonstrated that intervening acts separated the instances of penetration. In the court's words, \"[w]here [the defendant] was made aware of the hurt he was causing and where there was a period of cessation, each renewed penetration was committed separately.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 61} We similarly reject Dean's claim that the \"only event of time separating the two counts was [his] ejaculation and the victim's spitting out the ejaculate.\" Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that those events are insufficient to demonstrate a \"period of cessation\" between the two rapes, in this case there is additional evidence indicating a bright line of distinction\n   separating two rape offenses, i.e. his threat to I.M.R. that she \"do it again\" or \"get killed.\" We find that the trial court had a reasonable basis to conclude that separate and distinct crimes were committed and that Dean acted with a separate animus as to each.

I.M.R. eventually escaped and arrived at the hospital for treatment around 10:50 p.m. I.M.R. testified about the panic she experienced as she was forced to follow Dean down the street (\"I just knew I was going to die\") and her fear during the second assault (\"I just knew I was going to end up in this abandoned house.

The court of appeals found that the two convictions merged as to one victim, but not the other. The defendant attacked one victim by jumping out from behind a tree, held a knife to her throat, and moved her from the sidewalk to behind the tree where he raped her. The court found the \"movement was done in conjunction with the rape, and was not separated by any significant length of time or distance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.

At sentencing, the trial court specifically stated that it had considered the record and based its conclusion on Dean's \"youth and employability.\" The record supports the court's judgment. While Dean may argue that he lacks employment skills, a \"Public Safety Assessment,\" indicates that Dean was employed as a painter at the time of his arrest, earning $500 per week. And although Dean also complains that his age at the time of his release, 39, will preclude him from finding much gainful employment, we find that he will nonetheless have many employable years ahead of him. While we agree that his convictions and incarceration may present a challenge to finding employment at that time, his relative young age and his work experience as a painter \"render him employable and reasonably likely to be able to pay the costs imposed by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
