Barnes, Jr. (\"Barnes\"), appeals from the Cleveland Municipal Court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff-appellee, the city of Cleveland (\"the city\"). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In October 2005, Barnes registered the trade name Embassy Realty Investments (\"Embassy\") and purchased a vacant commercial building located at 3902 Lee Road in Cleveland, Ohio (\"the property\"). Barnes purchased the property from the Southeast Cleveland Church of Christ (\"Southeast\") for $15,000. Seven years before Barnes purchased the property from Southeast, the city's director of building and housing determined the property was a public nuisance and issued notices of condemnation and demolition to Southeast. The city sent these same notices to Barnes at his tax mailing address after he acquired the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Less than six months after Barnes purchased the property from Southeast, he entered into a 12-year lease agreement with Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. (\"Clear Channel\"), which allowed Clear Channel to maintain a billboard on the property. The lease provided for an initial one-time advance payment of $45,000 upon execution of the lease agreement and annual rent of $1,250, paid in monthly installments of $104.17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In January 2007, the city issued notice to Barnes of various building code violations existing on the property and for conducting work without the necessary permits. The city subsequently issued a notice of condemnation to Barnes and posted the notice at the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In December 2008, Barnes incorporated Embassy and transferred the property to Embassy by quitclaim deed. The deed recorded with the Cuyahoga County Auditor reflects that Embassy paid no consideration for the property. Barnes claims, however, that Embassy issued a cognovit note to him in the amount of $150,000 as consideration. The cognovit note identifies Barnes as president, secretary, and treasurer of Embassy; it further lists Barnes and his father, John Barnes, Sr., as the only two members of Embassy's board of directors. Barnes acknowledges he is Embassy's sole shareholder. After transferring his interest in the property to Embassy, Barnes remained lessor to Clear Channel and continued to personally receive monthly lease payments from Clear Channel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In August 2009, the city's contractor began demolition of the building on the property. Demolition was temporarily halted when the common pleas court issued a temporary restraining order to Barnes in a separate matter. A few days after issuing the restraining order, the common pleas court granted the city's request to dissolve the restraining order, and the city's contractor completed demolition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In July 2011, Barnes and Embassy filed a complaint against the city in federal district court, alleging various constitutional violations related to demolition of the property.\n   <em>\n    Embassy Realty Invests., Inc. v. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238152\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/976/931/\">\n    976 F.Supp.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.Ohio 2013). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on Barnes and Embassy's claims, but declined to exercise jurisdiction over the city's counterclaim for demolition costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238152\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/976/931/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4238152\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/976/931/\">\n    at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In July 2014, the city filed its initial complaint in the present matter, seeking its costs for demolition of the property from both Embassy and Barnes. In December 2015, the municipal court granted the city's motion for partial summary judgment as to Embassy, entering judgment against it in the amount of $14,036, plus collection costs and $3,509 in attorney fees, with statutory interest from the date of demolition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In April 2016, the trial court granted the city's request to amend its complaint against Barnes. In the amended complaint, the city alleges that Barnes had complete control over Embassy and used its corporate form to \"commit fraudulent and/or unlawful acts against [the city].\" The city's amended complaint sought to pierce the corporate veil of Embassy to hold Barnes liable for the city's judgment against Embassy for the cost of demolition. Barnes subsequently moved to dismiss the city's amended complaint. In May 2016, the trial court denied Barnes's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Later in May 2016, the city filed partial summary judgment as to Barnes. In September 2016, the municipal court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment against Barnes identical to that it previously rendered against Embassy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} It is from this order that Barnes appeals, raising the following five assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court erred when it denied [Barnes's] motion to dismiss on the ground that [the city] failed to commence its causes of action within the [four-year statute of limitations] as mandated by [R.C.] 1336.09.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court erred when it denied [Barnes's] motion to dismiss on the ground that sections 3103.09(k) and 367.08(b) of the [Cleveland Codified Ordinances] only authorized [the city] to collect demolition costs from the named property owner on the date of the demolition of August 7, 2009[,] and thus, [the city] cannot collect demolition costs from [Barnes] and this matter should have been dismissed against him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court erred when it denied [Barnes's] motion to dismiss on the ground that [the city] failed to join a necessary party to the action herein, [Southeast], which is jointly and severally liable for demolition costs pursuant to sections 3103.09(k) and 367.08(b) of the [Cleveland Codified Ordinances] only authorized [the city] in that it was an owner in the chain of title of the subject realty after the service of the notice of condemnation, and thus, this case should be dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Four\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court erred when it granted summary judgment against [Barnes] on the ground that [Barnes] committed fraud by transferring his interest in the subject premises to [Embassy] pursuant to the doctrine established in\n   <em>\n    Belvedere Condominium Owners' Assn. v.

He presents numerous arguments in support of this contention, including the expiration of the statute of limitations under R.C. 1336.09. Barnes also asserts that the city's codified ordinances do not authorize it to collect demolition costs from him because he did not own the property at the time of demolition. He further argues that the trial court should have dismissed the matter for the city's failure to join Southeast as an indispensable party under Civ.R. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} This court's review of a motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is de novo.\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In resolving a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, a trial court is confined to the allegations contained in the complaint and, as an appellate court, we must independently review the complaint to determine if dismissal is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=814%20N.E.2d%2044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In the first assignment of error, Barnes argues that the trial court should have dismissed the present matter because it was not commenced within the four-year statute of limitations prescribed under R.C. 1336.09. In the fourth assignment of error, Barnes makes the same argument and asserts that the trial court should have denied the city's motion for summary judgment because the four-year statute of limitations had expired. The city disagrees, contending that the six-year statute of limitations under R.C. 2305.07 applies. We agree with the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 15} We determine the applicable statute of limitations \"not from the form of pleading or procedure, but from the gist of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Hibbett v. Cincinnati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711934\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/4/128/#p131\">\n    4 Ohio App.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20N.E.2d%20832\">\n    446 N.E.2d 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Dist.1982). Barnes, focusing on the city's argument that the 2008 property transfer was a \"sham,\" contends the applicable statute of limitations is for fraudulent transfer claims under R.C. 1336.09. A review of the amended complaint demonstrates that the city does not rely on a theory of fraudulent transfer in arguing Barnes should be held liable, but rather alleges that Embassy was Barnes's alter ego and that Barnes should be held liable for the city's judgment against Embassy under a theory of piercing the corporate veil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The city, relying on the Cleveland Municipal Court Housing Division's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v. Bumpers\n   </em>\n   , Cleveland M.C. No. 2014 CVH010024 (Sept. 25,\n   2014), argues that because liability for demolition costs is created by state statute and city ordinance, the applicable statute of limitations is six years as provided in R.C. 2305.07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} R.C. 2305.07 provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [A]n action * * * upon a liability created by statute other than a forfeiture or penalty, shall be brought within six years after the cause thereof accrued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    Bumpers\n   </em>\n   , the municipal court determined that the six-year statute of limitations under R.C. 2305.07 applies to collection actions for nuisance abatement under R.C. 715.261(B) and Cleveland Codified Ordinance (\"C.C.O.\") 3103.09, and that a cause of action under those provisions does not accrue until the municipality incurs the cost, e.g., when a property is demolished and the nuisance abated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20N.E.2d%20832\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Zion Nursing Home, Inc. v. Creasy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1813110\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/6/221/#p224\">\n    6 Ohio St.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20N.E.2d%201272\">\n    452 N.E.2d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (\"[A] cause of action arising from a statute accrues and the period specified in the statute of limitations begins to run when the violation giving rise to the liability occurs.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Here, the property was demolished in August 2009, and the city brought the present action to recover its demolition costs under C.C.O. 3103.09 in July 2014. Thus, the city brought this action within the six-year statute of limitations under R.C. 2305.07, and the trial court did not err in denying Barnes's motion to dismiss on the basis of the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Accordingly, the first and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    C.C.O. 3103.09\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Barnes's second and third assignments of error focus on a 2011 amendment to C.C.O. 3103.09, the ordinance under which the city is authorized to collect its costs for nuisance abatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 22} As an initial matter, we note that the former version of C.C.O. 3103.09, in effect in August 2009 when the building on the property was demolished, controls. Former C.C.O. 3103.09 provided, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (j) Costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) Any and all expenses or costs incurred under this section for the removal * * * of a building or structure shall be paid by the owner of such building or structure[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (4) Notwithstanding the method of collection set forth in this division, the Director of Law may take any action necessary to collect the costs of demolition or boarding from the owner or other responsible party.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Former C.C.O. 3103.09, effective May 20, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Although the city instituted the present action in 2014, after the effective date of the current version of C.C.O. 3103.09, the city asserts that it brings this action under the former version of the statute, in effect at the time of the demolition. Notably, the city's initial complaint pled that Embassy and Barnes were both directly, jointly, and severally liable for demolition costs, whereas the amended complaint seeks to pierce the corporate veil of Embassy to attach liability to Barnes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Barnes asserts that former C.C.O. 3103.09 only authorized the city to bring suit to collect demolition costs against the named property owner. Therefore, he argues that because he was not the record title owner at the time of demolition, he cannot be held responsible for demolition costs under the new, amended law as an owner \"in the chain of title from\n   the time of receipt of a notice of condemnation until demolition.\" C.C.O. 3103.09(k)(2). He argues to hold otherwise would constitute an ex post facto violation of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We find this argument unpersuasive. In asserting this argument, Barnes ignores language of former C.C.O. 3103.09 providing that the city's law director \"may take any action necessary to collect the costs of demolition or boarding from the owner\n   <em>\n    or other responsible party\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Former C.C.O. 3103.09(j)(4). The city argues that Barnes was the \"alter ego\" of Embassy and is responsible for Embassy's failure to remedy the housing code violations that ultimately resulted in demolition of the property. Additionally, as discussed above, the city's amended complaint seeks to pierce the corporate veil of Embassy to hold Barnes liable, rather than asserting a direct theory of liability against Barnes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Barnes further contends that, under the current version of the statute, Southeast is jointly and severally liable and an indispensable party to this action under Civ.R. 19(A). He argues that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 19 for the city's failure to join Southeast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 27} As discussed above, Barnes purchased the property from Southeast, the owner of the property at the time the city first issued a notice of condemnation in 1998. Barnes relies on language of the current version of C.C.O. 3103.09(k)(2), which provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [a]ny and all owners of a building or structure, who appear in the chain of title from the time of receipt of a notice of condemnation until demolition of the building or structure, shall be jointly and severally responsible for all costs and expenses incurred relating to the demolition and all costs and expenses of prosecution or collection related thereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 28} He argues that under the current version of the ordinance, Southeast is a necessary party under Civ.R. 19 that should have been joined. We find this argument unpersuasive. As discussed above, the city brings this action under the former version of C.C.O. 3103.09 that was in effect at the time of the demolition. Under the former version of the ordinance, Southeast, and Barnes himself, are not jointly and severally liable as owners in the chain of title after condemnation of the building on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In support of this argument, Barnes cites to Civ.R. 19(A)(1), which provides that \"[a] person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a party in the action if * * * in his absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 30} This court has held that an obligor who is jointly and severally liable is not necessarily a party who is needed for just adjudication under Civ.R. 19(A).\n   <em>\n    W. 11th St. Partnership v.

We do not find that the absence of Southeast prevented complete relief from being accorded to the existing parties to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not err in denying Barnes's motion to dismiss the city's amended complaint for failure to join\n   Southeast.

He asserts that his conduct did not amount to fraud, and therefore, the trial court erred in piercing the corporate veil of Embassy to hold him liable for the city's judgment against Embassy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 34} We review an appeal from a grant of summary judgment under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Barnes's deposition testimony indicates that Embassy was undercapitalized - he explained that he put his own money into the property and received a personal loan for improvements to the property prior to transferring the property to Embassy. The evidence presented by the city demonstrates that,\n   apart from Barnes's filing articles of incorporation for Embassy with the Ohio Secretary of State, no other corporate formalities were observed. Barnes admits that Embassy kept minimal corporate records and had no separate bank account - he acknowledged the lease payments from Clear Channel continued to be paid to him personally after Embassy purchased the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Additionally, Barnes stipulated that Embassy never filed a federal or state tax return, and that Embassy generated no income from its inception through the time of demolition. Thus, it is clear that Embassy was insolvent at the time of the demolition. Barnes also testified that after he sold the property to Embassy, he continued to pay the property taxes and property maintenance, including snow removal and having the grass cut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Despite the presence of these factors, Barnes denies any fraud related to his transfer of his interest in the property to Embassy. He further argues that he did not commit any fraud in conducting Embassy's affairs, and that he did not incorporate Embassy to defraud the city or any other potential creditor. The city contends, however, that the citations for building code violations and the violation notices issued to both Barnes and Embassy \"are clear evidence of illegal and unlawful acts\" that satisfy the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Belvedere\n   </em>\n   test.

The Second District held that \"[m]aintaining a nuisance is a tort for which an officer may be held liable,\" but found that the city of Springfield had not presented sufficient evidence demonstrating that Long himself personally maintained the alleged nuisance.
