Plaintiff-appellee is the State of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On August 26, 2016, the Delaware County Grand Jury indicated appellant on two counts of trafficking in drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), one (Count One) a felony of the second degree and one (Count Three) a felony of the fourth degree, and two counts of possession of drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), one (Count Two) a felony of the second degree and one (Count Four) a felony of the fourth degree. The indictment covered the period from January 1, 2015 through September 9, 2015. At his arraignment on November 18, 2016, appellant entered a plea of not guilty to the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} A jury trial commenced on February 28, 2017. The following testimony was adduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Keven Liston, along with Wade Kirk, founded and is the co-owner of Supzilla Sport Nutrition, a health and wellness business which sells supplements, vitamins, protein powders and other health and wellness items. Supzilla has eleven retail stores throughout central Ohio and Indiana. In late 2013/early 2014, appellant, who was a personal trainer, purchased the Powell, Ohio location and operated that location in partnership with Liston and other Supzilla owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Liston testified that on September 3, 2015, he was contacted by Austin Pagani, who was working at the Powell store. Pagani sent Liston a picture stating that he did not feel comfortable selling what was in the picture. Liston then went immediately to the Powell store and inspected and photographed the item. He testified that the item \"was a two pound UMP [Ultimate Muscle Provider] container, which is a protein container, and it had packing material in there along with vials of steroids.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. I at 145. Typically, UMP containers contain powder protein. Liston testified that based upon his own experience using steroids in the past, he believed that the vials found in the UMP container contained illegal anabolic steroids. At the time, appellant was in Nebraska.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Because he was concerned with how appellant's sale of the illegal steroids out of a Supzilla storefront would negatively impact the Supzilla brand and with the potential damage to customers, Liston contacted appellant by phone on September 4, 2015 and told him that Austin Pagani had informed him about the anabolic steroids. Liston testified that he told appellant that they could no longer do business with him and that when appellant returned, appellant should meet Liston at the Powell location, grab his belongings and they could discuss buy-out options. According to Liston, appellant, who appeared agreeable to a buy-out, initially denied ownership of the steroids, but then admitted that the steroids were his. Appellant also denied selling the steroids, but, according to Liston, apologized for having the steroids at the store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Liston testified that he never called the police and that he also found two boxes with syringes and vials of liquid steroids and oral steroids in the back room behind the retail store and photographed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} When appellant was out of town from September 4, 2015 through September 8, 2015, Liston and Austin Pagani continued operating the Powell Supzilla store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 8, 2015, the Powell Police Department was contacted by Ryan McFann, appellant's friend, regarding a civil matter at the Powell Supzilla. After McFann told Officer Scott Sanford of the Powell Police Department that the business should be closed and that there should not be anyone in the store, the police left a message for appellant to get in touch with them. When the police spoke with appellant, he indicated to them that Liston and Wade Kirk were at the store and had changed out his account routing numbers for the store and that no one was supposed to be on the premises. Appellant also told the police that he was the only one on the lease. After determining that appellant was the only one on the lease, the police escorted Liston, Kirk and Austin Pagani off the premises. Based on information received from Liston about what was inside the store, Powell police obtained a search warrant and searched the Powell Supzilla location. They seized the UMP container, vials with pink and orange caps, and a number of syringes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} At trial, Austin Pagani testified that he was hired in August of 2015 to work at the Powell Supzilla store. He testified that he knew that appellant was using steroids during this period because he was shown the box in the back of the store and observed appellant inject himself with steroids in the back of the store \"at least a minimum of two times a week.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. II at 214. According to Pagani, the vials of anabolic steroids that appellant used had either pink or orange caps and appellant told him that one contained testosterone cypionate and the other testosterone propionate. When asked if he was using steroids during this time period, Pagani stated that he was because he was preparing for the world championships in 2015. Appellant, he testified, showed him how to inject them into his buttocks and thighs. While Pagani initially obtained his personal supply of anabolic steroids from someone else, he testified that he asked appellant to supply him with DBOL (methandrostenolone) and Anavar, which is another anabolic steroid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When asked if he had ever seen appellant selling steroids out of the Powell Supzilla, Pagani testified that he had and that people would walk into the back of the store and leave with a container that he knew was empty. He testified that appellant was \"very open\" about the sale of steroids and told Pagani what he was selling, who was buying it and what they were buying it for. Trial Transcript, Vol. II at 218. Appellant asked him to give pre-packaged containers to specific individuals. On two or three occasions, the people came in and the container was exchanged without any money collected. The third time, in September of 2015, when appellant was leaving Ohio to visit family, he asked Pagani to hand the customer the UMP container, collect the money and then put the money into a blue money bag that was near the store's iPad-based cash register. The $200.00 to $300.00 that Pagani collected from the customer was not registered on the iPad in accordance with appellant's instructions. When he looked into the UMP container, Pagani observed the same orange and pink capped vials that he had seen appellant use to inject himself with anabolic steroids along with silver packages of DBOL and Anavar, anabolic steroids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Pagani testified that he saw appellant purchase various items from Ryan McFann, who he thought was appellant's supplier. He further testified that he observed appellant open packages from McFann and split the items in the packages up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Because he had never exchanged a package containing what he thought\n   were illegal steroids for cash before and thought that he could get in trouble, Pagani testified that he contacted Keven Liston and photographs were taken of the UMP container. According to Pagani, between September 4, 2015 and September 8, 2015, attempts were made to remove the UMP container from the store. He testified that Cody Martin, who he believed had purchased anabolic steroids from appellant, came to the store on September 4, 2015 and asked to use the bathroom at the back of the store. Pagani testified that he saw Martin take the vials that were in the UMP container and put them into a different container in an attempt to remove them from the store. Martin, after being confronted by Pagani, left the store without the steroids. On September 8, 2015, Ryan McFann arrived shortly after the store opened to look for the steroids in the back of the store and took Pagani's store key.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Jessica Kaiser, who is a forensic scientist with the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, testified that 20 glass vials with orange caps that had been seized by the police tested positive for testosterone enanthate, a Schedule III controlled substance. The total weight was 170.20 grams. She further testified that 69 glass vials with pink caps that were seized contained testosterone propionate, also a Schedule III controlled substance. The weight was 624.36 grams. She testified that three glass vials with pink caps contained 27.33 grams of testosterone propionate. Testing revealed that another vial seized contained 9.17 grams of testosterone enanthate although the label said testosterone cypionate. Kaiser testified that capsules that were seized during the search were found to contain 29.73 grams of methandrostenolone, a Schedule III controlled substance. A total of 831.50 grams of testosterone was seized during the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Over appellant's objection on the basis of Evid.R. 404(B), the trial court permitted Powell Detective Ryan Pentz to testify about over 26,000 text messages appellant participated in between January 1, 2015 through September 8, 2015. As part of his investigation, Detective Pentz obtained a search warrant for appellant's phone and had a forensic download performed on the phone generating a roughly 2,500 page report. Detective Pentz testified that as he was reviewing the messages, he would write down certain terms and then search for them in the report. The following testimony was adduced when he was asked what those terms were:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} A: You know, one of the very first terms I did a search for, because it's a term I saw was steroids. And then, you know, I learned a new term, cypionate. I would learn a new term of CYP. I would learn a new test, testosterone. I would learn a term of SARMS. And I noticed how they would reference certain terms. Sometimes it might be-testosterone might be referenced test. And so I just started doing research for all these different terms that I was learning through this report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Q: Was one of those terms gear?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} A: I learned the word gear, and learned through the report that gear was being referenced as steroids. So then I would do a search for gear and come up-every time I could find the word gear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Q: And after you did the search, you mentioned something about seeing the context of how that was used?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} A: Correct. So once I found these terms and where they were at within the report, I would read the context of what's going on, who is saying what, who is sending what, who is replying, what are they\n   saying, and look at the context of that terminology, and how it's being referenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Trial Transcript, Vol. II at 403-404.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Detective Pentz testified that State's Exhibit 16 was a message between appellant and Hailey Clark, who had worked for appellant at the Powell Supzilla from 2014 until May of 2015 and who testified at trial, in which appellant talked about having legal troubles involving \"roids and Supzilla.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. III at 413. Appellant, in one of the messages to Clark that was admitted as Exhibit 16, stated when asked why he was being accused of selling steroids that it was \"Probably cuz I have it. And I've gave some to friends out of my personal stash.\" He further told Clark in a message dated September 4, 2015 that he had \"gear\" at the store that Liston had found. In conversations with Cody Martin dated between January 22, 2015 and August 23, 2015 (Exhibit 74), appellant was asked by Martin how much it would cost to be hooked up with steroids and was asked if \"tren and test for starters\" would be okay. Appellant indicated to Martin that the cost would be $220.00 for tren and $200.00 for \"test\" and in later messages instructed Martin on how to inject the substances. Appellant also informed Martin that there were side effects from steroid use and, in one exchange dated April 21, 2015, sent Martin a photograph of what appears to be four vials of anabolic steroids in a row and indicated that they were for sale. The vials appear to contain \"Trenbolene Enanthate,\" \"Testosterone Cypionate,\" \"Tri Test\" and \"Masteron.\" Detective Pentz testified that he researched the name of the company on the vials, which was Boehringer Ingelheim, and that it was a pharmaceutical company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Detective Pentz also testified about the contents of conversations between appellant and Jake Coyler, which were admitted as Exhibit 76. On April 23, 2015, the two talked about \"tren\" and \"test\" in their messages and a reference was made to \"Boehringer test\". One of the vials that was in the photograph that appellant sent to Cody Martin contained \"Tri Test.\" In messages dated starting on January 14, 2015 between appellant and Jeff Yates that were admitted as Exhibit 77, appellant suggested that Yates get \"on some gear\" and recommended that Yates use \"Tren, test, mast.\" When asked where he can get some mast, appellant responded that he might have some in his personal stash and that the cost was $85.00. On February 2, 2015, Yates sent a message to appellant stating that he needed \"test cyp x 2 Mast and tren\" and appellant indicated that he will let Yates know.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Appellant's conversations with Josh Rodrigez were testified to by the Detective and admitted as Exhibit 78. In a message to appellant dated June 23, 2015, Rodrigez told appellant that he needed his \"gear\" and appellant indicated that he should have it by Friday and that the cost was $300.00 for the gear, which included tren. Detective Pentz, when asked the significance of the term \"gear\" used in this context, testified that the term was being used \"as a slang word for steroids.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. III at 453. Detective Pentz also was questioned about conversations between appellant and Tim Cronin, a friend of appellant's who was a police officer in Nebraska, which were admitted as Exhibit 81. During the conversations, which started on June 12, 2015 and continued until August 14, 2015, Cronin asked appellant about Anavar and appellant referred him to a website named Roidsource.biz. In a message to Cronin dated August 14, 2015, appellant asked him how much \"var\" he wants and Cronin indicated that he wants 200 tabs. Appellant then sent a message to Ryan McFann, asking\n   how much the 200 tabs would cost and after receiving a reply, sent a message to Cronin stating that the cost was $300.00. In another message, appellant informed Cronin that \"var\" was a light steroid. Appellant, in a message to Cronin dated August 14, 2015, tells Cronin that \"[i]f you run your gear correctly you won't get gyno\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Detective Pentz testified that he discovered text message exchanges between appellant and Ryan McFann that led him to believe that appellant was buying drugs from McFann. The messages were admitted as Exhibit 83. On June 16, 2015, McFann sent appellant a detailed list of the prices for various drugs including \"Enanthate\", \"test\", \"Prop\", \"Cyp\", \"Tren\" and \"Mast\", among other items, and indicated that there was a $200.00 minimum order. In a message to appellant dated June 20, 2015, McFann told appellant that he had \"a bunch of prop I over ordered\" and asked appellant if he wanted \"to work a bulk buy on em.\" Throughout the messages, which date from May 4, 2015 to August 28, 2015, appellant indicated that he needed \"cyp\", \"tren\", \"test\" and \"var\" and was quoted prices by McFann.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Detective Pentz also examined appellant's chronological messages from September 4, 2015 through September 8, 2015 (Exhibits 85-88). In a message to appellant from Cody Martin dated September 4, 2015, Martin indicated that he could not get \"it\" because \"Austin said he wasn't' aloud (sic).\" Detective Pentz testified that this confirmed with what Austin Pagani had said about Cody Martin coming into the store to try to remove items. In another message from Ryan McFann to appellant dated September 4, 2015, McFann told appellant to say that they were trying to blackmail him. On the same date, McFann sent a message to appellant advising him to say that the UMP container with the \"gear\" in it was not his. In a September 7, 2015 message to appellant, McFann advised him to contact the police and act like the \"gear\" found in his Supzilla store was a \"complete setup.\" On September 8, 2015, appellant and McFann agreed, as evidenced by messages, that appellant would call the police and tell them that Kevin Liston and his associates had been in control of the store for a week and \"anything in there illegal was put thwre (sic) by them in an attempt to blackmail you.\" Tim Cronin, in a September 8, 2015 message to appellant, instructed him to tell the police that he had not been at the store for over a week and that he had found the steroids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On cross-examination, after testifying at length about the messages, Detective Pentz testified that prior to this case, his involvement in drug cases was pretty minimal and that he did not consult with an expert on steroids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 27} After the State rested, appellant called Kyle Brammer as a witness. Brammer testified that he worked for a sports supplement distributor and was familiar with the ban on pro-hormones in late 2014 or early 2015. He testified that some pro-hormones had not been banned and were still on the market. According to him, manufacturers of pro-hormones used the names of commonly known steroids for their products as a marketing tactic to attract more purchasers who would be intrigued that they might get the same result as from an illegal substance. He testified that Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals produced and marketed pro-hormones under the brand names Anavar, Sustanon 250 and Anabol which were \"basically illegal precursor names, but they are not the actual product.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. III at 585.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellant testified on his own behalf at trial. He testified that he was a\n   personal trainer and body builder and that, as a body builder, he had used steroids and pro-hormones. Appellant testified that some common names of steroids were \"ren, cyp, sus, EQ, Anavar,...mast.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. IV at 618. When asked if they were associated with anything other than steroids, appellant testified that they also were associated with pro-hormones. According to appellant, pro-hormones were legal to sell prior to their ban in 2014 and mirrored the effects of steroids. He testified that not all pro-hormones were banned, but that \"[i]t was the compound that was banned.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. IV at 625. Following the ban, pro-hormones which did not contain the prohibited compounds remained to be legal to sell. Appellant testified that after the ban, the same names were used for the pro-hormones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Prior to the ban, appellant had been selling pro-hormones. He testified that he had purchased pro-hormones from Ryan McFann and that, after the ban, there were still pro-hormones available. He testified that in early 2015, he started selling new supplements being developed by a company owned by McFann which were a mixture of legal pro-hormones and SARMS (selective androgen receptor modulators). When asked if he put these products on his shelf, appellant said that he did not because they did not have labels \"and came under the shady gray area.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. IV at 635. Appellant testified that he did not sell steroids, but sold pro-hormones. He testified that the vials of steroids recovered during the search of the store were not his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 30} On cross-examination, appellant admitted that he possessed small amount of illegal steroids or \"gear\" in the Powell Supzilla store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The jury, at the conclusion of the evidence and the end of deliberations, found appellant guilty of a lesser included offense of trafficking in drugs as charged in Count One and possession of drugs as charged in Count Two. The jury found appellant not guilty of the other two counts. The parties agreed that Count One and Two were allied offenses and the State elected to proceed at sentencing on Count Two due to merger. As memorialized in a Judgment Entry filed on April 18, 2017, appellant was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $10,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellant now raises the following assignments of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 33} I. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT ALLOWED THE STATE TO INTRODUCE INADMISSIBLE AND HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL EVIDENCE OF PRIOR BAD ACTS OF THE APPELLANT, IN VIOLATION OF RULE 404(B) OF THE OHIO RULES OF EVIDENCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 34} II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT PERMITTED LAY WITNESS OPINION TESTIMONY OF THE MEANING OF APPELLANT'S COMMUNICATIONS, IN VIOLATION OF RULE 701 OF THE OHIO RULES OF EVIDENCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 35} III. THE VERDICTS RETURNED BY THE JURY WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AND COULD NOT SUPPORT THE FINDINGS OF GUILTY ON COUNTS ONE AND TWO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 36} IV. THE VERDICTS WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellant, in his first assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in allowing Detective Pentz to testify about the more than 26,000 text communications between appellant and various other individuals between January 1, 2015 and\n   September 8, 2015 because this was inadmissible and highly prejudicial evidence of other bad acts in violation of Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Evid.

Appellant specifically argues that the trial court erred in permitting Detective Pentz to testify regarding his conclusions as to the meaning of terms used in appellant's over 26,000 text messages and in permitting him to testify regarding the believability of one witness' testimony over appellant's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Initially, we note that appellee argues that appellant did not properly preserve for appeal his argument relating to Detective Pentz's opinion testimony regarding the meaning of terminology used in the text messages. Appellee concedes that at trial, appellant's defense counsel objected twice to such testimony, but his objections were overruled. The trial court, in overruling the second objection, stated that Detective Pentz was entitled to give his opinion under Evid.R. 701.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Evid.R 103(A) states, in relevant part, as follows: \"Effect of Erroneous Ruling.

Detective Pentz's testimony was rationally based on his perceptions and helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. At trial, Detective Pentz testified that he reviewed a 2,500 page PDF report that contained 26,000 text messages taken from appellant's phone. He testified that he did not review every text message, but reviewed the report, starting at the beginning. He further testified that he kept a note pad next to him and would write down certain terms and then search the report for words and phrases that matched that context. According to him, as he located the terms and where they were within the report, \"I would read the context of what's going on, who is saying what, who is sending what, who is replying, what are they saying, and look at the context of that terminology, and how it's being referenced.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. II at 404. We further note that a binder of the text messages was marked as more than one Exhibit and admitted at trial. The jury thus had the chance to independently review\n   the text messages including, for example, Exhibit 74, which specifically discussed the sale of \"steroids\". Furthermore, the jury also heard testimony from Kevin Liston and others as to the meaning of the terms used in the messages. Liston, for example, testified that the term \"gear\" was \"just a short-term for steroids where if you're talking in public, you don't want people to,...understand what you're talking about with steroids, so you say gear.\" Trial Transcript, Vol. I at 142. Austin Pagani also testified that \"gear\" referred to steroids and not pro-hormones. Trial Transcript, Vol. II at 225.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Appellant, as is stated above, also maintains that the trial court erred in permitting Detective Pentz to give an opinion as to the credibility of Austin Pagani. Pagani testified that Cody Martin, on September 4, 2015, had attempted to remove vials of steroids from the back room of the Powell Supzilla store but was not successful. During his testimony, Detective Pentz later testified about text messages found on appellant's phone. The following is an excerpt from his testimony at trial:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Then text messaging, 3:18 to Cody Martin: Call me when you get a chance. 3:19, phone call from Cody. 3:58: You get it?

However, Detective Pentz did not state that he believed the witness was telling the truth or give an explicit opinion as to Pagani's credibility. See, for example,\n   <em>\n    State v. Myers\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Richland No. 03-CA-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-3052\">\n    2004-Ohio-3052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201327929\">\n    2004 WL 1327929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at paragraph 64 (June 9, 2004) (\"The detective conducted an initial interview with Ms. Adkins that was not tape recorded. Over a week later he interviewed her and this time made a recording of the interview. The testimony objected to by appellant was that the second statement was consistent with the first statement (T. at 910). The officer was testifying to a fact, not expressing an opinion about the credibility or veracity of the complainant.\"). We find, therefore, that the trial court did not\n   err in allowing his testimony since it was not impermissible credibility testimony. Detective Pentz was testifying as to a fact, not expressing an opinion at to Pangani's credibility or veracity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Appellant's second assignment of error is, therefore, overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Appellant, in his third assignment of error, argues that the jury verdicts were inconsistent with the physical evidence and could not support a finding of guilty on Counts One and Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Appellant, in the case sub judice, was indicted on one count (Count One) of trafficking in drugs (testosterone), one count (Count Two) of possession of drugs (testosterone), one count (Count Three) of trafficking in drugs (methandrostenolone), and one count (Count 4) of possession of drugs (methandrostenolone). While appellant was found not guilty of the two counts related to methandrostenolone, he was found guilty of the two counts involving testosterone. Appellant notes that there was testimony at trial that all of the drugs were located in the same UMP container in the Powell Supzilla back room and argues that his convictions, therefore, were inconsistent with the physical evidence. According to appellant, \"[t]he jury could not reasonably come to the conclusion that Appellant owned or possessed only part of the contents of the UMP container.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 73} An inconsistent verdict may be a result of leniency and compromise by the jurors, rather than being caused by jury confusion.\n   <em>\n    State v.
