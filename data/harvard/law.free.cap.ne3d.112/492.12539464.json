On that date, Gordon was placed under a one-year Administrative License Suspension (\"ALS\") due to a \"refusal.\" On December 7, 2016, Gordon pleaded guilty to a violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a). The Mount Vernon Municipal Court terminated the ALS and suspended her license for 365 days.

She was stopped and cited for operating a motor vehicle while under an OVI suspension. On May 10, 2017, Gordon entered a plea of not guilty in the Delaware Municipal Court. The case was set for a pre-trial conference on June 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On May 16, 2017 upon Gordon's motion, the Mount Vernon Municipal Court filed the following Journal Entry,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   This matter came before the Court on Defendant, Tiffany Gordon's motion to reduce the length of her Class 5 driver's license suspension from 365 days to 180 days.

At the bench trial, the parties stipulated to all relevant facts. The parties also agreed on the following legal issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   16. The parties agree that on the date of offense. May 9th, 2017, Ms. Gordon was suspended out of Mount Vernon Municipal Court Case No. 16TRCO2490. The parties further agree that the Mount Vernon Municipal Court retroactively lifted her suspension on May 16th, 2017, eliminating the date of offense from the period of suspension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   17. In the view of the parties, the sole issue presented to the Court is the import of the May 16th, 2017, judgment entry as it relates to the criminal offense that allegedly occurred on May 9th, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court found Gordon guilty after consideration of the stipulated facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Gordon raises one assignment of error,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"1.
