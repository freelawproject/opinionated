The Court of Claims held that Eschborn could not meet her burden of proof of her prima facie case of discrimination. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Eschborn began working at ODOT as an unclassified, seasonal Highway Tech 1 employee on January 12, 2015. ODOT terminated her employment on February 12, 2015. During her one-month tenure with ODOT, Eschborn's work was assigned by ODOT staff at the Gustavus post and in her role as a Highway Tech 1 she worked alongside three male employees. Eschborn operated a truck that plowed snow and spread salt on the roads within ODOT's jurisdiction, patched potholes, \"flagged,\" washed trucks, and swept the\n   truck bays. (Eschborn Dep. at 7.) While she worked for ODOT, she was the only female employee at the Gustavus post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Eschborn contends that ODOT gave multiple reasons for her termination. Initially, she was told it was due to lack of work. After her termination, however, Eschborn received a letter from ODOT's director stating she had been terminated for not performing up to the standards expected of the position. Additionally, she was told she was terminated for her alleged use of foul language and sexual harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Eschborn admits that she was \"making a joke\" when she said to her coworkers that her former boss did not listen to her, \"because I have tits and a pussy.\" (Eschborn Dep. at 43.) She also admits that she told one of her coworkers to \"bite me\" after he was repeatedly \"badgering\" her regarding her performance of her job duties. (Eschborn Dep. at 48-49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 7, 2016, Eschborn filed a complaint in the Court of Claims alleging that ODOT terminated her employment because of her gender, in violation of R.C. 4112.01, et seq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court of Claims determined that Eschborn could satisfy the first three elements of her prima facie case but could not satisfy the last element because the evidence was insufficient to support the conclusion that a person outside the protected class replaced her or that other comparable, non-protected persons were treated more favorably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In her deposition, Eschborn testified that, to her knowledge, another ODOT employee, \"Tiny,\" was sent to Gustavus after she left. Eschborn did not know Tiny's real name, only his nickname. He worked from ODOT's Cortland location. Eschborn stated that she had worked one day filling potholes with Tiny, but he was driving the truck and she was flagging so she did not speak to him much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Court of Claims weighed the evidence and made credibility determinations on summary judgment concerning the circumstances of Eschborn's replacement. The Court of Claims characterized Eschborn's testimony about Tiny as evidence of a redistribution of work, rather\n   than evidence that he replaced her. This fact must be established at a trial (trials in the Court of Claims are limited to trials by the court and not by a jury), since reasonable minds could differ on this testimony before it is taken in context with a fully developed record through pretrial discovery, and the determination of this fact is material to Eschborn's claim for discrimination. Civ.R. 56. Also, there is evidence in the record to support a showing that Eschborn was treated differently than similarly situated male employees, all of whom commonly used foul language in the workplace. And Eschborn testified that initially she was told that there was no work to do because there was no snow. But approximately two days later, when she called her supervisor to ask if she would be called back, he told her she was being terminated for using foul language and sexual harassment. Subsequently, she received a letter from ODOT's director explaining she was terminated because she had \"not been performing up to the standards expected for [the] position.\" (Def.'s Ex. A, attached to Eschborn Dep.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The Court of Claims also weighed the evidence regarding dissimilar treatment when it focused on Eschborn's testimony that she was not aware of any time someone was offended by the use of foul language in the workplace, especially when ODOT did not terminate the employment of any of the male employees for using foul language. The Court of Claims appears to have disregarded Eschborn's testimony that a reason she was given at one point for termination of her employment was her use of foul language even though foul language was regularly used by all the employees and she was the only female. The Court of Claims appears to not have considered all the evidence or to have determined credibility or weighed some evidence as more important and disregarded other evidence as less or not important in reaching summary judgment for ODOT. This would be permissible at trial, but it is not permissible on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Am. Elec. Power\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.

Eschborn testified that she was replaced by \"Tiny,\" a male and a person not in her protected class (female). And Eschborn testified that the male employees were treated more favorably than she was because their employment was not terminated for using foul language. ODOT cannot show that no evidence exists in the record, taken in a light most favorable to Eschborn, to support a prima facie case for her discrimination claim. And ODOT has not offered evidence that would sustain its burden on summary judgment that it terminated Eschborn's position for a nondiscriminatory reason, so as to require Eschborn to offer evidence of pretense such that \"the proffered reason was not the true reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Texas Dept.\n   </em>\n   at 256,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p256\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
