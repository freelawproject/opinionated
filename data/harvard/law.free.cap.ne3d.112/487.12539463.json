For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellants set forth the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. The Court erred in granting Summary Judgment to Defendant United Airlines, Inc. when Plaintiffs have pointed to evidence showing United violated Federal Aviation Regulations and it is axiomatic that violations of those regulations that lead to injury are actionable under state law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. The Court erred in granting Summary Judgment to Defendant United Airlines, Inc. when significant questions of fact remain, particularly considering that Plaintiffs can point to evidence indicating United did not verify the incident bin was secure, as federal regulations require.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. The Court erred in accepting Defendant United Airlines, Inc.'s unsupported restatement of the facts and in drawing conclusions in United's favor in granting summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellants were aboard appellee's flight from Honolulu, Hawaii to Chicago, Illinois on October 26, 2013. Appellants were returning home to Toledo, Ohio. At some point after push-back from the gate or taxi onto the runway, but before landing in Chicago, appellant Marc Meyer was struck by luggage that had fallen from an overhead bin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Marc suffered injuries and sought medical treatment upon returning to Toledo. He was in pain and lost use of his shoulder. It was eventually determined Marc had a full-thickness rotator cuff injury, and he underwent surgery to repair the injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 20, 2015, appellants filed a complaint claiming appellee breached a duty of care by not securing the overhead bin, there proximately causing Marc's injuries. Paula claimed loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During discovery, appellants Marc and Paula, a passenger-witness Reatta Barnfield, and flight attendant David Carney were deposed as fact witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On January 23, 2017, appellee moved the court for summary judgment claiming that, based on facts produced at the depositions, no dispute of material fact existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellants opposed summary judgment on April 24, 2017, contending that disputes of material fact existed and that resolution was necessary to determine whether appellee breached a standard of care imposed by federal aviation regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment, there disposing of appellants' claims on June 14, 2017. The judgment was journalized that day, and appellants now timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When reviewing a trial court's summary judgment decision, the appellate court conducts a de novo review.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

With respect to 14 C.F.R. 121.589(b) through (d), appellee is\n   to verify carry-on baggage aboard its flight is safely stowed and restrained prior to takeoff. Additionally, 14 C.F.R. 121.285(d)(1) and (6) explain that it is appellee's duty to restrain and properly stow away carry-on baggage \"so as to prevent movement[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Accordingly, we review the record to find whether appellee breached this standard of care on October 26, 2013, and we will address this with the second assigned error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellants argue that questions of material fact remain as to whether appellee verified that the incident bin was secure or that the bags therein were properly stowed before takeoff.

Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1815647\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/11/75/#p79\">\n    11 Ohio St.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20N.E.2d%201246\">\n    463 N.E.2d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Here, appellants argue a de novo review of the record demonstrates that appellee breached the duty imposed by the above federal regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14 C.F.R. 121.589(b) - (d) ; 14 C.F.R. 121.285(d)(1) and (6),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 20} More specifically, appellants point to deposition testimony in the record to support that appellee failed to verify the incident bin was secure, or alternatively, it failed to properly stow the baggage away safely, before takeoff of the flight on which appellant Marc Meyer was injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Appellants first point to Marc's deposition, where he testified about boarding the plane and the events leading to the bag falling on him from the overhead bin during the flight's takeoff and ascent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Marc stated that after he and his wife boarded the plane, an unidentified passenger opened the bin above his seat and inserted the incident bag. Marc testified the bin did not appear to be entirely closed after the passenger loaded the bag, but that he took no action and did not inform the flight attendants about the opened bin. Marc said he did not take action because he expected the flight attendants to check the bin before takeoff, but that he did not notice any attendants check or close the bin. Appellee's counsel questioned why he did not insist on a flight attendant closing the bin, and Marc explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Marc]: They normally are checking those things as we're taxiing to the runway, okay? And by the time I realized that nobody had done anything, we were on the runway getting ready to take off. So there was no way of getting anyone at that point because even if you ring for a flight attendant at that point, they're strapped in their seats. They don't normally want to get out of their seat for something until the plane has taken off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Marc also testified that he specifically recalled that the incident bag fell on him as the plane ascended during takeoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellants rely on Marc's deposition to support their claim that appellee failed to verify the baggage was secure in the overhead bin, arguing that had the flight attendants done so Marc would have seen them. Appellants further rely on Marc's deposition to show that appellee failed to properly stow away the incident bag prior to takeoff, arguing that had it done so then no bag would have fallen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellants also point to Paula's deposition testimony in support of their timeline and rendition of the events. Paula recalled the visible gap in the overhead bin prior to takeoff, and that she did not see any flight attendant shut the incident bin or verify that it was secure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellee counters arguing appellants' testimony, when viewed in conjunction with passenger-witness Reatta Barnfield and lead flight attendant David Carney's testimony, leaves no genuine question of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Appellee contends Barnfield's testimony provides the sequence of events, and shows that a flight attendant closed the incident bin and verified it was secure before the unknown passenger reopened it. Appellee contends Carney's testimony supports that the bins were checked and found to be securely closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellants counter, urging this court to find that Barnfield's testimony shows genuine disputes of material fact because Barnfield stated that the incident did not occur until closer to when the plane was arriving in Chicago, and stated that a flight attendant was the last to touch the bin before takeoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In terms of the timing of the incident, appellants and Carney testified the incident happened during takeoff, and Carney actually said that Marc was provided with the option of returning to Honolulu after the injury occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 30} With respect to the last person to touch the bin before the bag fell, all deposition testimony reveals it was an unidentified passenger. More specifically, appellants said the unidentified passenger touched the bin and that no flight attendants did so afterward, and Barnfield said that the passenger was the last person to touch the bin before the bag fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Consequently, appellee argues that despite there being conflicts with the witnesses' \"immaterial differences\" in the timing of the events, there is yet no dispute with regard to the sequence of events. In other words, appellee asserts there remains no question that appellee closed the incident bin and verified it was secure before takeoff and before the unidentified passenger placed his or her bag in the bin. Appellee notes specifically that the requirement that it verify the bins are secure can be satisfied by a visual inspection, and that the verification in this case was completed visually. And by natural extension, appellee argues there is no evidence in the record to show appellee violated any duty or regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The trial court addressed this issue, stating as follows: \"Plaintiff offers neither evidence nor authority to dispute Purser Carney's testimony that the required verification may be completed visually and that a manual verification is not required.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 33} We agree and find appellants offer no evidence to place in dispute Carney's claim that a visual inspection occurred. Further, we find no legal authority offered by appellants to convincingly support the contention that a manual, as opposed to a visual, inspection or verification is required under 14 C.F.R. 121.589(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Accordingly, the first and second assigned errors are not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Third and lastly, appellants argue the trial court erred by accepting appellee's facts and drawing conclusions favorable to appellee. Appellee contends no genuine issue of material fact exists because all evidence in the record shows an unidentified passenger was last to touch the bin after appellee checked and verified the bins were securely closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 36} \"A 'material' fact is one which would affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable substantive law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Advantage Renovations, Inc. v.
