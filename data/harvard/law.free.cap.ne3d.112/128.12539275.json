For reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 On April 10, 2015, GBX filed an application with the Commission seeking a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction of a new high voltage transmission line under the expedited procedure set forth in section 8-406.1 of the Public Utilities Act (Act) ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406.1 (West 2012) ). GBX sought a certificate of public convenience and necessity to conduct a transmission public utility business to construct, operate, and maintain a 202.7-milelong electric transmission line to traverse central Illinois from Pike County to a converter station in Clark County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 According to the application filed with the Commission, GBX planned to construct and manage a high voltage direct current (DC) electric transmission line that would run from an alternating current (AC)-to-DC current converter station in Ford County, Kansas, across Kansas and Missouri. The transmission line would then continue as a double AC line for approximately 5.2 miles from the converter station to an interconnection with the PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) transmission network at the Sullivan/Breed substation of American Electric Power Company in Indiana and a DC-to-AC converter station and delivery point into the Midcontinent Independent Systems Operator (MISO) transmission network in northeast Missouri. From western Kansas and through Missouri, the transmission line would enter Illinois west of New Canton in Pike County, Illinois. The Illinois portion of the transmission line would travel 202.7 miles in a general southeasterly direction through Pike, Scott, Greene, Macoupin, Montgomery, Christian, Shelby, Cumberland, and Clark Counties to a DC-to-AC converter station to be located near West Union, Clark County, Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 GBX included in its April 10, 2015, application that it \"will own, control, operate, and manage within the State of Illinois, for public use, facilities for the transmission of electricity and therefore will be a 'public utility,' \" but it did not state that it was a public utility. GBX had an option to purchase property that would serve as the site to place equipment for the proposed project. The purpose of the project was to transport clean, low-cost electricity\n   from wind generation plants in western Kansas to electricity markets in Illinois and other PJM and MISO states. The proposed project was to \"deliver approximately 2.6 million megawatt-hours ('MWh') of clean energy per year into the MISO market, and up to 18 million MWh of clean energy per year into the PJM market.\" The project was expected to produce additional wind generation accessible to the Illinois market to meet demands for clean energy and electricity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 On May 18, 2015, the appellants, a group of various landowners and residents owning property in the geographical area subject to this proceeding, filed a motion to dismiss (motion), which questioned the Commission's authority to grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a nonpublic utility. The appellant's motion was based on the premise that only a public utility may file an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406.1 of the Act. Subsequently, several additional motions to dismiss were filed by the following intervening parties: Illinois Agricultural Association, Landowners Alliance of Central Illinois, NFP, Rex Encore, and Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC. Shortly thereafter, the staff of the Commission filed a response to the appellant's motion agreeing that the motion should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 On June 12, 2015, the assigned administrative law judge submitted a memorandum to the Commission recommending that the motions be granted in favor of the appellants. On June 16, 2015, however, the Commission voted 3-2 to deny the motions. The Commission entered its final order in favor of GBX on November 12, 2015. The majority opinion stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The question of whether an entity which is not yet a public utility may file for a CPCN for a new high voltage electric transmission line under Section 8-406.1 has been extensively addressed, in the motions to dismiss and in this Order. The Commission notes that the process is available only for CPCNs for the purpose of constructing a new high voltage electric service line and related facilities. It notes the numerous additional requirements for applicants under Section 8-406.1. These requirements include significant pre-filing activities, public notice provisions, substantial, specifically identified engineering data, and fees, which are not required under Section 8-406. The Commission finds that these considerable prerequisites are consistent with the expedited schedule under Section 8-406.1.\"\n   <em>\n    Grain Belt Express Clean Line LLC\n   </em>\n   , Ill.

GBX was granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the construction of two transmission lines pursuant to sections 8-503 and 8-406.1 of the Act. See 220 ILCS 5/8503, 8-406.1 (West 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 In response, the two Commission members who voted to grant the appellant's motion filed a dissent in opposition to the majority opinion, stating the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"Alternative paths exist for the development of transmission lines, including high voltage lines transporting electricity produced by renewable sources, through Section 8406 or through a properly filed application under Section 8-406.1. Section 8-406.1 requires applicants to be public utilities. The Commission must enforce the rules set by the\n   General Assembly and cannot change those rules where it possesses no authority to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The majority opinion erroneously concludes that Section 8-406.1 does not require an applicant to be a public utility. The majority opinion arrives at this conclusion without the required analysis to support it. This conclusion leads the majority opinion to then omit a required finding. The majority opinion fails to appropriately apply Illinois statute, ignores Supreme Court and other precedent, and is inconsistent with Commission practice without explanation. GBX's Application should have been dismissed without prejudice. We respectfully dissent.\"\n   <em>\n    Grain Belt Express Clean Line LLC\n   </em>\n   , Ill. Comm.

Following the Commission's denial of all applications, the appellants filed a timely petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 9 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 10 On appeal, the appellants argue that the Commission's decision to grant GBX's application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity was erroneous and should be set aside because GBX was not a public utility at the time of the application, a necessary prerequisite under the Act. Without status as a public utility, the appellants assert that GBX was ineligible to receive, and the Commission had no authority to grant, a certificate of public convenience and necessity under the expedited process set forth in section 8-406.1 of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 In response, GBX and the Commission argue that \"the definition of 'public utility' clearly applies to new entrants.\" To read otherwise, the Commission argues, would have the effect that \"no new entity c[ould] ever become a public utility of any type\" where no such entity would be able to satisfy the statutory definition under section 3-105 of the Act (220 ILCS 5/3105 (West 2012) ). In particular, GBX also asserts that no basis exists to conclude that the legislature intended to preclude new entrants from requesting and obtaining a certificate under section 8-406.1, given that new entrants can obtain status as a public utility during the application process under section 8-406 of the Act (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-406). Moreover, GBX asserts that the determinative question for the Commission, and now this court, is not whether GBX was a public utility at the time of the application but whether the applicant is able to demonstrate that its proposed electric transmission line satisfies the substantive criteria for issuance of a certificate. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 Appellate review of final decisions of the Commission, an administrative agency, involves the exercise of special statutory jurisdiction and is constrained by the provisions of the Act.\n   <em>\n    People ex rel.

As a result, the court determined that courts must read the statute as \"evincing an intention by the legislature to limit the definition of 'public utility' to situations where the subject entity meets the ownership test at the present time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548596\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/90/448/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 The supreme court noted, however, that the Act does not prohibit new entrants from commencing development as a purely private project before applying to become a public utility in Illinois:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Once their projects are further underway and they have obtained the ownership, management, or control of utility-related property or equipment required to qualify as public utilities, they may then seek certification to operate as public utilities if they wish to conduct their business in a way that would make them subject to the Public Utilities Act's regulatory framework.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a result, applicants may seek recognition as a public utility while, at the same time, applying for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406(a) as long as they have obtained the\n   ownership, management, or control of utility-related property or equipment at the time of the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 19 Here, GBX similarly fails to establish that it was a public utility at the time it filed its application with the Commission. It is undisputed that GBX does not presently, or at the time it filed its disputed application with the Commission, own, control, manage, or operate any plant, equipment, or property in Illinois used or to be used for or in connection with the production, transmission, sale, etc. of one of the specified commodities or services. Accordingly, GBX did not meet the definition of a \"public utility\" under section 3-105 of the Act at the time it filed its application with the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 20 Nevertheless, GBX argues that when a company applies for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406.1 of the Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406.1 (West 2012) ), as opposed to section 8-406 of the Act (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-406), the determinative question is, instead, whether the applicant is able to demonstrate that its proposed electric transmission line satisfies the substantive criteria for issuance of a certificate under the expedited process. This substantive criterion includes \"the applicant's capability to manage and supervise construction and to finance the construction without significant adverse financial consequences.\" See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-406.1(f)(2), (3). For further support, GBX argues that the legislature's only intent underlying section 8-406.1 was to provide an \"alternative, more expeditious process for obtaining a Certificate,\" as compared to the no-deadline process under section 8-406. As such, GBX contends that there is no preexisting need to own other utility assets to be approved for a certificate under section 8-406.1 of the Act. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 21 In 2010 the legislature enacted the expedited procedure set forth in section 8-406.1 to provide a process by which \"[a]\n   <em>\n    public utility\n   </em>\n   may apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to this Section for the construction of any new high voltage electric service line and related facilities (Project).\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-406.1(a).

The Commission's conclusion that any nonpublic utility may apply to be a public utility under section 8-406.1 ignores the express language set out in section 8-406.1(a). Significantly, section 8-406.1 of the Act clearly and unambiguously reads that \"[a]\n   <em>\n    public utility\n   </em>\n   may apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to this Section.\" (Emphasis added.) 220 ILCS 5/8-406.1(a) (West 2012). As such, our interpretation of section 8-406.1 requires that the applicant must meet the definition of a public utility. In order to obtain status as a public utility, the applicant must meet the ownership test at the time of application, the same prerequisite in section 8-406, and the Commission must make this finding before issuance of a certificate. Here, GBX holds an option to purchase property that would serve as the site to place equipment for the proposed project. \"[H]aving an option to buy something is not the same as owning or even controlling it,\" and an option agreement \"does not involve the transfer or [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] property or an interest therein.\"\n   <em>\n    Illinois Landowners Alliance, NFP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548596\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/90/448/\">\n    2017 IL 121302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=418%20Ill.%20Dec.%20290\">\n    418 Ill.Dec. 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548596\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/90/448/\">\n    90 N.E.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 24 Moreover, we cannot reason that the legislature intended to give unlimited discretion through an expedited review process to nonpublic entities, which would ultimately provide the Commission with no jurisdiction to enforce their projects. As a result, the Commission must find that an entity is a public utility at the time of application in order to utilize the expedited review process in section 8-406.1 of the Act. Unable to meet the requisite ownership test, GBX is not a public utility under section 3-105 of the Act, but rather an entity with a purely private project that does not require the Commission's authority to proceed. Without finding that GBX was a public utility, we hold that the Commission was without authority to grant GBX a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406.1 of the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 25 CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 26 The order of the Commission is hereby reversed and remanded where it granted a nonpublic utility company the authority to construct and manage an electrical transmission line project under the Act's expedited review process without the requisite finding that the applicant was a public utility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 27 Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Justices Goldenhersh and Chapman concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
