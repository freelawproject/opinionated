For the reasons that follow, we find no merit to the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In April 2017, Oliver was named in a six-count indictment charging him with aggravated burglary, abduction, drug possession, resisting arrest, and two counts of assault. The case was tried before a jury, and the following evidence was presented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In the early morning hours of March 25, 2017, Officers Alex Rekhter and Josh Bayer of the Mayfield Heights police department responded to the Staybridge Suites to assist with a drunken male asleep outside his hotel room. The officers helped the male into his hotel room and left the premises. Approximately two and one-half hours later, they received another call that two men were fighting in the Staybridge Suites lobby. The events that precipitated this second call started at the side entrance to the hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The jury viewed surveillance video from the Staybridge Suites that showed a woman, identified as Susan Connors (\"Susan\"), with her two dogs opening the door for a male, later identified as Oliver, who was standing outside a side-entrance to the hotel. The video shows Susan abruptly backing away and retreating as Oliver approached her. According to Susan, Oliver chased her down the hallway and she screamed for her sister-in-law, Sandra McLaughlin-Tablers (\"Sandra\"), to let her into their hotel room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sandra testified that she and her husband, James Tabler (\"James\") (collectively \"the Tablers\"), were getting ready for breakfast when she heard Susan screaming. Sandra looked outside into the hallway and saw a large man chasing Susan down the hall. Susan and her dogs were able to get inside the room, but the women could not shut the door because Oliver was forcing his way into their room. According to Sandra, Oliver grabbed hold of Susan and then grabbed her, pushing\n   them both through the kitchen area and toward the bedroom. Sandra stated she tried to prevent Oliver from going near the bedroom where her husband James was because he was in frail health following a liver transplant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} However, James exited the bedroom, and he and Oliver started to struggle. According to Sandra, she and Susan were trying to push Oliver out of their hotel room, but also trying to free James from Oliver's grip. She stated that when they reached the main hallway, she began screaming for \"help,\" telling Oliver to \"let go,\" and asking people to \"help us; he's on drugs.\" According to Sandra, no one helped them until they reached the main lobby, where an employee assisted them. Sandra testified that she and James both received bruising to their arms, and her arm was bleeding. She stated that she was \"scared to death\" for her safety; she thought \"they were all going to die\" when Oliver forced himself into their hotel room. Susan's testimony was similar to and corroborated Sandra's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Ivan Mitchell, an employee at Staybridge Suites, testified that he intervened and assisted the Tablers because they were calling for help. He stated that he saw Oliver had a \"tight hold\" on James's arm and would not let go of him. Ivan testified that he tried to get Oliver off of James for a few minutes before he was able to help break James loose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The jury also viewed surveillance video from the main lobby area that captured Oliver holding onto James's arm and sweatshirt. Sandra and Ivan could be seen pulling at Oliver and hitting his arm, trying to get him to release James. Susan was on her cell phone, calling the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Officer Robert Lord was the first to respond to the call and found Oliver in the hotel lobby. Oliver refused to comply with commands to place his hands on the wall; instead he turned and took steps toward the officer. According to Officer Lord, Oliver was \"likely on drugs\" because he was frothing at the mouth, and his eyes were not \"normal\" - \"he looked at me, but past me.\" After Oliver failed to comply with several warnings, Officer Lord deployed his taser twice. Officers Rekhter and Bayer arrived following the taser deployment and assisted Officer Lord with Oliver, who they discovered was the male they previously encountered that morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The officers testified that they were able to secure one handcuff on Oliver's wrist, but when the taser cycle ended, Oliver grabbed the other loose handcuff and would not let it go. According to the officers, he became increasingly aggressive and repeatedly refused requests to place his hands behind his back. The officers had to initiate the taser seven times in total to finally secure Oliver. The jury watched video and listened to audio taken from several body cameras of the responding officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Once secured, Oliver was transported to the hospital for removal of the taser barbs and for other medical attention. Officer Lord rode along in the ambulance and said that during transport, Oliver was not coherent and was unresponsive to medical assistance. Officer Rekhter testified that when he took Oliver into custody after he was released from the hospital, Oliver was in disbelief upon learning what had transpired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Oliver testified in his own defense. He testified that he was staying at the Staybridge Suites to \"cool off\" from a disagreement between him and his wife. He stated that he was drinking alcohol and called a friend to have a drink with him. When his friend arrived, Oliver went to the friend's car and smoked PCP. He stated that he does not do drugs often, but did so on this occasion. Oliver stated that he did not remember much of what happened after he smoked PCP. He recalled wanting to get back to his hotel room and vaguely remembered the police officers helping him. He did not recall the interaction and altercation with the Tablers and Susan. When Oliver was shown the surveillance video, he admitted that he was the person with Susan in the hallway, and the one holding onto James in the lobby. He stated that his actions were out of character, but admitted he should be held responsible for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The jury found Oliver not guilty of aggravated burglary, but guilty of the lesser included offense of burglary; not guilty of abduction, but guilty of the lesser included offense of unlawful restraint; and not guilty of both counts of assault, but guilty of drug possession and resisting arrest as charged in the indictment. The trial court imposed a total jail sentence of six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Oliver now appeals, raising four assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Confrontation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Prior to trial, the state filed a motion requesting that the Tablers be permitted to testify via Skype, a live video broadcasting link, because they lived out of state and James was still recovering from his liver transplant and receiving dialysis. The state requested that Sandra also be allowed to testify via Skype because she was caring for James. Oliver objected, contending that allowing the victims to testify remotely violated his right to confrontation, and that the state failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances existed to allow for video testimony. Following a hearing, the trial court issued a written decision, finding that allowing the alleged victims to testify via video was justified because they lived out of state, and one of the witnesses was on dialysis, making travel difficult. The court also concluded that the other elements of confrontation would be satisfied based on its intention to swear in the witnesses, who would be subject to cross-examination, and the jury and defendant would have the ability to observe the witnesses' demeanor. Ultimately, however, only Sandra testified at trial; James did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Days before trial was scheduled to commence, the state filed another motion requesting that Susan be permitted to testify via live broadcast because she lived out of state and had been in Ohio previously for six months caring for James. The prosecutor also maintained that Susan had a job, suggesting an added difficulty. The court did not conduct a hearing or rule on this motion prior to trial. On the day of trial and immediately prior to Susan testifying, the trial court considered the motion and Oliver's objection. Oliver argued that a witness's inconvenience is not an exceptional circumstance to justify witness testimony by Skype. Additionally, Oliver stated that the quality of the Skype link used earlier for Sandra's testimony was not of the same quality of someone was testifying in the courtroom - there were times the testimony was unable to be heard and the signal broke up. The court disagreed that the quality was low and found that the state had remedied any interruption in the video feed by asking the witness to repeat her answer. The court allowed Susan to testify by Skype.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In his first assignment of error, Oliver contends that the trial court erred by allowing these two witnesses to testify via live video link, thus depriving him of a meaningful chance to confront the witnesses against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment is made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Issa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"248253\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/93/49/#p59\">\n    93 Ohio St.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=752%20N.E.2d%20904\">\n    752 N.E.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), fn. 4. Consequently, this constitutional right applies to both federal and state prosecutions, but the right of confrontation in Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution provides no greater right of confrontation than the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    State v. Arnold\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4102760\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/126/290/\">\n    126 Ohio St.3d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-2742\">\n    2010-Ohio-2742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20N.E.2d%20775\">\n    933 N.E.2d 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} However, the United States Supreme Court has held that although \"the Confrontation Clause reflects a preference for face-to-face confrontation at trial,\" that \"preference must occasionally give way to considerations of public policy and the necessities of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

This court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   To qualify as an exception, the procedure must (1) be justified, on a case-specific finding, based on important state interests, public policies, or necessities of the case and (2) must satisfy the other three elements of confrontation - oath, cross-examination, and observation of the witness's demeanor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Marcinick\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18, citing\n   <em>\n    Harrell v.

Applying the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   analysis, this court found in\n   <em>\n    Marcinick\n   </em>\n   that the teleconferencing testimony of the social worker witness who was out of the country, did not violate the defendant's right to confrontation because the state demonstrated that the witness was unavailable, established the admissibility of the testimony, and the two-way video link preserved the reliability elements of confrontation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Applying the two-part analysis to the facts in this case, we find that the trial court did not err in granting the state's motion to allow Sandra to testify via Skype, but erred in permitting the video-link testimony of Susan. Nevertheless, the trial court's error pertaining to Susan was harmless because her testimony was merely cumulative to Sandra's testimony and the surveillance video shown during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Regarding Sandra's testimony, the trial court conducted a hearing prior to trial. The record demonstrates that Sandra lived in Louisville, Kentucky and was caring for James, who was currently undergoing dialysis following a liver transplant. James was unable to travel to Ohio to testify. Therefore, under the fact-specific circumstances, Sandra was unavailable to testify in person. Moreover, the testimony of Sandra was admissible and relevant because she was an eyewitness and a named victim in one of the assault charges. Further, the Skype procedure satisfied the other elements of confrontation. The record demonstrates that Sandra was under oath when she testified, subject to cross-examination, and the jury and Oliver were able to observe her demeanor. Accordingly, the circumstances in this case satisfy the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   elements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Oliver contends, however, that the video-link system often interrupted, negating the reliability elements of confrontation. The trial transcript reveals that on three occasions, the video-link-system \"broke up.\" During those instances, Oliver did not object or note any issues during the testimony. In fact, Oliver did not conduct any cross-examination of Sandra despite these video-link disruptions. Moreover, during these moments of disruption, the prosecutor acknowledged that the video-link broadcast interrupted, and asked Sandra to repeat her answer or slow down when giving her testimony. Finally, during these interruptions, Sandra was testifying about the physical harm she and James suffered, and that she was fearful. The jury ultimately acquitted Oliver of both counts of assault, where James and Sandra were the victims, and found him guilty of lesser included offenses that did not include elements of harm or fear. Therefore, any interruption in the video-linking system was not prejudicial to Oliver. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in allowing Sandra to testify via Skype.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The trial court erred, however, in allowing Susan to testify via Skype because, unlike Sandra, Susan was not unavailable. Although the state filed a pretrial motion for Susan to testify, the trial court did not conduct a hearing or rule on the motion prior to trial. The basis for the request to testify remotely was because Susan lived in Jacksonville, Florida and had previously been in Ohio for six months caring for her brother, James. Prior to Susan testifying, the state also stated that Susan had a job; suggesting that she was unavailable. However, during her testimony, Susan testified that she was not employed and had been in Cleveland previously for only five months. Based on the case-specific circumstances, Susan was not unavailable to testify in person but rather inconvenienced. We find that this reasoning is an insufficient justification. Although the reliability elements of confrontation were satisfied - she was under oath, subject to cross-examination, and observable - the unavailability threshold was not met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Nevertheless, the trial court's error is harmless because allowing Susan to testify via Skype was not prejudicial. Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(A), \"any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\" To find an error harmless, a reviewing court must be able to declare a belief that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v. Lytle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6706455\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/48/391/#p403\">\n    48 Ohio St.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=358%20N.E.2d%20623\">\n    358 N.E.2d 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976).

Both Sandra and Susan testified about the circumstances surrounding Oliver's actions in gaining access to their hotel room and the physical altercation that ensued inside the hotel room. Moreover, the jury viewed surveillance video showing the initial interactions between Oliver and Susan. Based on the testimony given by Sandra, the trial court's error in allowing Susan to testify remotely was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Sandra's testimony alone overwhelmingly supported Oliver's convictions for burglary and unlawful restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Accordingly, Oliver's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Wright was arrested in the hotel lobby after police were called because he was disrupting other hotel guests and vandalizing property in the common area of the hotel. When the police arrived, they discovered Wright naked, sweating, and foaming at the mouth; Wright admitted that had taken the drug PCP. Following Wright's removal from the hotel, the hotel staff asked police to check Wright's room for damages, and an employee opened the room for the officer. Once inside, an officer discovered drugs in an open dresser drawer. Wright moved to suppress the drugs because the officers conducted a warrantless search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 36} This court held that absent evidence of any affirmative acts by the hotel staff to divest the defendant of his status as an occupant and guest of the hotel, the defendant maintained a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hotel room.\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11-12.

(Tr. 423.) Counsel indicated that she was unaware prior to trial of the circumstances surrounding the search because there was no indication in Officer Bayer's report regarding how the police gained access to the room. However, after Officer Bayer testified that he entered Oliver's room at the request of the hotel manager to remove any other occupants from the room, counsel then realized that the search may have been unlawful, thus precipitating her mid-trial motion to suppress. After hearing arguments from both sides, including the state's objection that the motion was untimely, the trial court denied the motion to suppress as untimely, but also because \"the testimony has been given on the subject.\" (Tr. 426.) Arguably, trial counsel did in fact move to suppress the evidence and the trial court considered the merits of the motion when it denied the oral motion. If that were true, Oliver's challenge on appeal would be moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In this case, the record is undeveloped to determine if a suppression motion would have likely been granted. The issue at trial was whether the state presented sufficient evidence to prove that Oliver committed the offenses as indicted; not whether the search of Oliver's hotel room was lawful. Therefore, the state did not need to set forth any testimony or evidence from the hotel manager regarding Oliver's status as a hotel guest to satisfy its burden of proving its case again Oliver. Accordingly, we cannot say that the motion, if filed, would have likely been granted because the state presumably would have elicited testimony from the hotel manager about Oliver's status as a hotel guest to justify the warrantless search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Nevertheless, based on the record before us, we also find that no reasonable probability exists that a motion to suppress would likely have been granted. Officer Bayer testified that he was asked to check Oliver's hotel room \"and if there was anyone else in the room [the hotel manager] wanted them removed.\" (Tr. 410.) Officer Bayer also testified that he wanted to check the room to see if \"there were potentially any more victims.\" (Tr. at\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20343328\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) According to Officer Bayer, the on-duty manager opened Oliver's room and allowed him inside. It is reasonable to infer that because the hotel manager had asked that \"any other occupants be removed,\" Oliver, after allegedly assaulting other hotel guests, was also evicted and his guest-status was revoked. Officer Bayer testified that in performing a protective sweep of the hotel room, the drugs were in plain view on the bathroom sink. Accordingly, the trial testimony does not support a reasonable possibility that a motion to suppress would have been successful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Finally, even if the court granted the motion, sufficient evidence was presented to support Oliver's drug possession charge. As discussed later in our analysis of the third assignment of error, Oliver admitted to using PCP. This admission alone is sufficient to prove drug possession pursuant to R.C. 2925.11(A) ; the actual discovery of the drugs in Oliver's hotel room becomes unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Accordingly, we cannot say that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress. The assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Accordingly, we will review the sufficiency of the evidence for Oliver's convictions on the lesser included offenses of burglary and unlawful restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 47} Oliver was convicted of burglary, commonly referred to as \"trespass in a habitation,\" in violation of R.C. 2911.12 (B), which provides that \"[n]o person by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in a permanent or temporary habitation of any person when any person * * * is present or likely to be present.\" Sandra testified that they had been living at the Staybridge Suites since December 2016 while James received and recovered from a liver transplant. She further stated that Oliver chased Susan down the hall, causing her to retreat inside their hotel room. However, they could not get the door closed before Oliver forced himself inside their room. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for trespass in a habitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Pursuant to R.C. 2905.03(A), regarding unlawful restraint, \"[n]o person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly restrain another of the other person's liberty.\" The named victim for this count was James. Sandra testified that Oliver grabbed James's arm and began pushing him. Oliver continued holding James's arm despite Sandra and Susan's attempts to pry him off James. He continued holding onto James from the hotel room, into the hallway, and then into the common area and lobby of the hotel. Sandra and Susan were only able to break James free from Oliver's grasp after the police were called, and Ivan intervened and assisted. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support Oliver's conviction for unlawful restraint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Oliver was also convicted of drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which prohibits a person from knowingly obtaining, possessing, or using a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog. Oliver admitted that his friend offered him drugs in the parking lot of the Staybridge Suites, and that although he was not familiar with the drug, he smoked PCP with his friend in the car. Accordingly, Oliver's admission that he was using drugs with his friend is sufficient to support his conviction for drug possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 50} Additionally, when questioned about the drugs in his hotel room, Oliver stated that he did not recall bringing the drugs into his room but that they were not there when he initially arrived at the hotel and he did not remember anyone else bringing the drugs into his room. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence that the drugs discovered in his hotel room belonged to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Pursuant to R.C. 2921.33(A), regarding resisting arrest, \"[n]o person, recklessly or by force, shall resist or interfere with a lawful arrest of the person.\" Officers Lord, Rekhter, and Bayer each testified that Oliver repeatedly refused to comply with their commands. The officers attempted to place handcuffs on Oliver, but he resisted by grabbing at the loose end of the handcuff and became increasingly aggressive.

A reviewing court \"weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

A conviction should be reversed as against the manifest weight of the evidence only in the most \"exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 54} In this case, the jury's verdict demonstrates that it rendered a decision based on the evidence presented. The jury was able to view the video surveillance and compare that to the testimony given at trial. They were able to witness the initial interaction between Oliver and Susan, and then observe Oliver holding onto James in the hotel lobby. Oliver admitted that he used PCP with his friend. Additionally, the body camera videos showed the interaction between Oliver and the officers, including the officers' repeated commands to stop resisting. This case is not the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the convictions. Accordingly, Oliver's final assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   MELODY J.
