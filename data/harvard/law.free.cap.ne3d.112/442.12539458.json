For the reasons set forth below, this Court vacates and remands for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Four days before Substitute Senate Bill 331 (\"S.B. 331\") went into effect, the Municipalities filed an action for declaratory judgment asserting various constitutional challenges to S.B. 331, and injunctive relief to enjoin the operation of all provisions of S.B. 331. Upon the close of the pleadings, the parties agreed to bifurcate the claims and proceed with cross motions for summary judgment on only two of the constitutional arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and against the Municipalities finding that S.B. 331 did not violate the one-subject rule and, thereby, is constitutional. The trial court did not enter any ruling regarding the parties' alternative constitutional argument regarding the three-reading rule. Upon the Municipalities' unopposed motion, the trial court added the Civ.R. 54(B) certification to the judgment entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Municipalities have timely appealed from this judgment, raising four assignments of error. Additionally, before this Court is an amicus curiae brief in support of the constitutionality of S.B. 331 filed, with leave of this Court, by CITA-The Wireless Association. Further, both the Municipalities and the State have filed multiple notices of supplemental authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DETERMINED THAT [S.B. 331] DID NOT VIOLATE ARTICLE II, SECTION 15(D) OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE ONE-SUBJECT RULE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ESTABLISHED AN ERRONEOUS STANDARD FOR REVIEWING ONE-SUBJECT CHALLENGES.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO INVALIDATE AND SEVER THOSE PROVISIONS OF\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   S.B. 331 UNRELATED TO THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE BILL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 4\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING [THE MUNICIPALITIES] FAILED TO ESTABLISH A VIOLATION OF THE ONE-SUBJECT RULE \"BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Municipalities raise four assignments of error challenging the trial court's determination that S.B. 331 is constitutional. As a preliminary matter, this Court must address the validity of the judgment entry being appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Upon review of the record and the judgment entry, this Court issued a show cause order to the parties to address two issues: 1) whether this Court has jurisdiction, and the propriety of the Civ.R. 54(B) certification in the context of judicial economy when there is no judgment against two of the municipalities who asserted the same cause of action, and 2) whether the judgment entry ruling on the first amended complaint is valid when there is a second amended complaint pending. The Municipalities and the State each filed a response to the show cause order. This Court will only address the validity of the judgment entry as it is dispositive in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Both the Municipalities and the State assert that the judgment entry is valid and that this Court should proceed to consider the merits of the appeal. While this Court recognizes the parties' desire to proceed on the merits, this Court cannot review a judgment that is a nullity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In this case there was a complaint, a first amended complaint, and a second amended complaint. Eleven days after filing the original complaint, the Municipalities filed the first amended complaint which added twelve plaintiffs and two causes of action, deleted one cause of action, and modified the relief sought. Upon the consent of the State, the Municipalities filed a second amended complaint which added two more plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Upon agreement of the parties, they filed cross motions for summary judgment as to the first and fourth causes of action only. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and against the Municipalities on the first cause of action, but did not enter any judgment as to the fourth cause of action. The trial court's judgment entry specified four times that the grant of summary judgment was based upon \"Count I of the Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint\" despite the Municipalities properly filing a second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The Ohio Supreme Court has stated that \"it is elementary law that when a party substitutes an amended petition for an earlier one, this constitutes an abandonment of the earlier pleading and a reliance upon the amended one. The earlier pleading becomes functus officio.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis deleted.)\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Talaba v.

Instead of addressing whether the judgment entry was a valid judgment or a nullity as instructed in the show cause order, the State argued why the judgment entry was a final, appealable order. Accordingly, the State's response to this issue was not on point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Similar to the State, the Municipalities asserted that the first cause of action was the same in both the first and second amended complaints. The Municipalities, however, expanded this concept to argue that \"[t]he trial court's incorrect reference to the [f]irst [a]mended [c]omplaint [was] harmless and should be disregarded.\" The Municipalities relied upon\n   <em>\n    West v.

To support the fact that the trial court did take the action and that there was a clerical error, there needs to be \"such convincing evidence as to exclude all conjecture.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacks\n   </em>\n   at 404,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20N.E.%2048\">\n    47 N.E. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The Municipalities asserted that \"the trial court's reference to the [f]irst [a]mended [c]omplaint [was] a clerical error\" and \"[t]he trial court inadvertently referenced the incorrect amended complaint in its judgment entry.\" The Municipalities, however, provided no factual support from the record to support this position, and instead simply put forth conjecture that there was a clerical error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The judgment entry specifically identified on four separate occasions the first amended complaint as the pleading upon which summary judgment was considered and granted. There is nothing contrary in the judgment entry to support the Municipalities' position that the trial court, in fact, based its summary judgment decision on the second amended complaint and \"inadvertently referenced\" the first amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Further, the docket reflects the Municipalities filed the second amended complaint pursuant to the consent of the State and not upon leave of court. Thus, the trial court was not actively put on notice by the parties of the filing of the second amended complaint. Moreover, neither party identified upon which pleading the summary judgment motions were premised. Based on the foregoing, there was not clear and convincing evidence that \"the trial court's reference to the [f]irst [a]mended [c]omplaint [was] a clerical error\" to support a limited remand for a nunc pro tunc entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The Municipalities' assignments of error are moot. The August 1, 2017 judgment entry of the Summit County Common Pleas Court is vacated and the cause is remanded for consideration of the cross summary judgment motions as applied to the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Judgment vacated and cause remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   SCHAFER, P.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   TEODOSIO, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CONCUR.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Functus officio is defined as \"[h]aving fulfilled the function * * * or accomplished the purpose, and therefore of no further force or authority.
