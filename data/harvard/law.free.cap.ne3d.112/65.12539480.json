Stated another way, agreeing to the imposition of multiple sentences is a necessary prerequisite to agreeing to consecutive service, for it is \"[o]nly after the judge has imposed a separate prison term for each offense may the judge then consider in his discretion whether the offender should serve those terms concurrently or consecutively.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Tr. 19:7-11. Lee necessarily waived the argument that the underlying offenses were allied ones of similar import through his agreement to serve all counts consecutively; otherwise, consecutive sentences would not have been possible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Since Lee waived the merger issue, his sentences are authorized by law.\n   <em>\n    Sergent\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} For the sake of discussion, and in light of the concurring opinion's misplaced focus on\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   , even if Lee had not waived his right to challenge his sentences under R.C. 2941.25 by agreeing to consecutively serve the separate sentences, he at the least forfeited the merger argument by failing to object to the imposition of multiple sentences at the sentencing hearing. The trial court did not consider R.C. 2941.25 at sentencing because Lee failed to object to his sentences. It is only once the allied-offense issue is raised by the defendant that the mandatory sentencing provision under R.C. 2941.25 may be implicated, but only in situations in which the trial court concludes or the parties concede that the offenses are allied ones of similar import.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25-28. Accordingly, the sentences in this case comport with all mandatory sentencing provisions as contemplated under\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   and R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), even if Lee had not negotiated the question of merger out of the sentencing equation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The concurring opinion suggests the existence of a paradox that permits appellate review of the sentences in this case, that under\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   the appellate court must review the validity of the imposed sentences under the plain-error standard of review in order to determine whether the sentences are \"authorized by law\" under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1). The existence of plain error, a standard of appellate\n   review, does not resolve or even impact the threshold question of whether a sentence is \"authorized by law\" under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), a legal determination focusing on the trial court's mandatory sentencing obligations. The plain-error standard of review necessarily assumes that appellate review of a sentence is authorized under R.C. 2953.08.

There is no dispute that the trial court notified Lee of the maximum sentences he faced on the individual offenses during the plea colloquy (14 years alone on the aggravated robbery that included a mandatory consecutive three-year firearm specification on top of the maximum 11-year sentence for the first-degree felony) and that no promises had been given in exchange for the plea agreement.

He also asserts that \"these offenses were not committed separately\" and that \"they were not committed with a separate animus or motivation.\" Thus, Lee argues he was illegally subjected to multiple punishments for the same conduct in violation of R.C. 2941.25. He contends his jointly agreed sentence is not authorized by law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 33} R.C. 2941.25 codifies the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution, which prohibit multiple punishments for the same offense. The majority acknowledges that Lee never expressly stipulated that the offenses were committed with a separate animus, but asserts that his agreement to serve consecutive prison sentences is equivalent to agreeing that his multiple convictions are dissimilar in import and not subject to merger under R.C. 2941.25. (Majority opinion at \u00b6 8.) Indeed, the agreed 14-year sentence cannot be reached without imposing separate sentences on multiple counts and running the sentences consecutively to one another since the maximum prison term on each individual offense is less than 14 years.

However, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   rejected these arguments, explaining that a defendant is prejudiced by having more convictions than are authorized by law regardless of his plea bargain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 35} The majority in\n   <em>\n    Underwood\n   </em>\n   also observed that courts indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights and that they do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.
