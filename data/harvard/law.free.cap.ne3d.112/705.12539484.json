The latter suspension type requires the petitioner to seek relief in his or her county of residence; the former requires the petitioner to file in each court that ordered a suspension.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   But where is the proper venue for seeking relief when that person \"forfeits\" driving privileges for life following a felony conviction for driving while suspended? Because we consider this lifetime forfeiture an administrative suspension, we hold the proper venue is the trial court in a person's county of residence. We thus affirm the trial court's order granting Reinhart's petition for specialized driving privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Daniel Reinhart, a resident of Adams County, is subject to three separate driver's license suspensions. The BMV imposed two of these suspensions, in 2012 and 2015, for habitual traffic violations in Adams County. The third suspension is a lifetime forfeiture resulting from a 2015 felony conviction in Noble County for driving while suspended as a habitual traffic violator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%209-30-10-16\">\n    Ind.

The SDP order stayed all three suspensions for two years, allowing Reinhart to drive to and from work, to visit his children, and to other limited locations (for example, to buy groceries or attend medical appointments) at specified times. The State moved to correct error, arguing that the Adams Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to stay or modify the lifetime forfeiture imposed by the Noble Superior Court.

Unlike its predecessor statute, the SDP Statute contains no express limitations on the type of relief a petitioner may seek. Instead, the SDP Statute permits the trial court to define the \"terms of specialized driving privileges\" at its discretion. I.C. \u00a7 9-30-16-3(d). And, with certain exceptions, these privileges apply for up to two and a half years, \"regardless of the\n   underlying offense.\" I.C. \u00a7 9-30-16-3(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To secure relief, a petitioner for SDP must follow specific pleading requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9-30-16-3(b) (listing conditions for form, filing, and service of process); 9-30-16-4(b) (same). And the proper venue in which to file depends on whether the petitioner's underlying suspension was court ordered or imposed by the BMV. The latter suspension type requires the petitioner to file in his or her county of residence, while the former type requires the petitioner to file in each court that ordered a suspension.

The dispute centers instead on the proper venue for seeking relief from the lifetime forfeiture of driving privileges resulting from Reinhart's 2015 felony conviction in Noble County. Resolution of this dispute turns on whether the lifetime license forfeiture imposed under Section 16 constitutes an administrative or court-ordered suspension, as those terms apply to the SDP Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 16 makes it a Level 6 felony for a person who knowingly drives with a suspended license. I.C. \u00a7 9-30-10-16(a). But at the time of Reinhart's conviction, Section 16 added that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [i]n addition to any criminal penalty, a person who is convicted of a felony under subsection (a)\n   <em>\n    forfeits the privilege of operating a motor vehicle for life\n   </em>\n   . However, if judgment for conviction of a Class A misdemeanor is entered for an offense under subsection (a), the court may order a period of suspension of the convicted person's driving privileges that is in addition to any suspension of driving privileges already imposed upon the person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I.C. \u00a7 9-30-10-16(c) (emphasis added) (repealed 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Whether the lifetime forfeiture of driving privileges is administrative or court ordered is a question of statutory interpretation. \"The goal of statutory interpretation is to discern and further the intent of the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    West v.

I.C. \u00a7 9-30-10-17(a).

The State's reading of the statute, by contrast, would require individuals to petition each court from which a lifetime\n   forfeiture arose, increasing exponentially the number of SDP petitions filed and adding to the already-congested dockets of our trial courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. A conviction modification under Section 16 results in a court-ordered suspension.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Unlike the opening sentence of subsection 16(c), its second sentence expressly vests discretionary authority in the trial court to \"order a period of suspension\" when \"\n   <em>\n    judgment for conviction\n   </em>\n   of a Class A misdemeanor\n   <em>\n    is entered\n   </em>\n   for an offense under subsection (a).\" I.C. \u00a7 9-30-10-16(c) (emphasis added). This second sentence implicates two criminal statutes governing the conversion of Level 6 felonies to Class A misdemeanors: Indiana Code sections 35-50-2-7 and 35-38-1-1.5. The former statute permits a trial court to modify the conviction at the time it delivers its sentence. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-7(c) (2014) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

This conclusion fits logically with Section 3's venue requirement that a suspended driver seek relief from the court (or courts) that modified the suspended driver's conviction. As Reinhart notes, the \"duration of the suspension\" imposed by the court depends \"on the facts of that particular case, including the nature and severity of the offense, as well as the character of the defendant.\" Appellee's Pet. to Trans. at 22. A non-discretionary lifetime forfeiture, on the other hand, depends simply on the defendant's HTV status, not the specific facts of the case or the agreed-upon conditions he must fulfill to reduce the sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, we hold that, under Section 16, a conviction modification from a Level 6 felony to a Class A misdemeanor results in a court-ordered suspension.
