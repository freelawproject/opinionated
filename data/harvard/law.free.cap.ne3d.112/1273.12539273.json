Mason appeal the judgment entered by the Licking County Common Pleas Court ordering a former attorney for Appellants to answer questions posed in a deposition by Appellee Stuart Hinerman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellee is a member in the limited liability companies The Grill on Twenty First and Twenty First Properties, Appellants in this case. Appellant Mason and Appellee agreed to go into business together operating a restaurant previously owned and operated by Appellee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At the time they were discussing the new venture, Mason was represented by Attorney Adam Vernau, who was a member of the Newark law firm of Morrow, Gordon &amp; Byrd. Mason notified Hinerman he had contacted Vernau to draft the operating agreements governing the new corporations. Hinerman was already a client of another attorney at the same law firm, and agreed to have Vernau prepare the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 20, 2006, Hinerman met with Vernau at the law firm's office and signed operating agreements with respect to both companies. The Grill on Twenty First, LLC was organized to operate the restaurant business, while Twenty First Street Properties, LLC was organized to own and manage the real estate on which the restaurant was located.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellee filed the instant case on December 7, 2015, seeking damages for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty, as well as an accounting from Appellants. Appellants filed a counterclaim against Appellee for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} A deposition of Attorney Adam Vernau was scheduled for June 15, 2017. On the day of the deposition, Appellant Mason asserted all communications between himself and Vernau regarding the preparation of the operating agreements for the two companies were privileged. The deposition was cut short due to Appellant Mason's objections. Appellee sought a ruling from the court on the issue of whether attorney-client privilege could be invoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After an evidentiary hearing on the issue of attorney-client privilege, the court allowed the parties to supplement the record with affidavits from any person who testified at the hearing, as well as an affidavit from Vernau. The court found the joint representation exception to the attorney-client privilege was demonstrated by the evidence, and ordered Vernau to answer questions as to whether either party gave special instructions when drafting the contract regarding the division of losses from the company and the liability of Hinerman and Mason, and to answer the question as to whether he drafted any contracts which are the subject of the dispute of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} It is from this October 3, 2017 judgment Appellants prosecute their appeal, assigning as error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THERE WAS JOINT REPRESENTATION BETWEEN PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT AND ATTORNEY ADAM VERNAU AND IN ENTERING A DISCOVERY ORDER THAT BREACHES THE CONFIDENTIALITY GUARANTEED BY THE ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Generally, discovery orders are not immediately appealable.\n   <em>\n    Walters v.

The test for determining the existence of an attorney-client relationship is both subjective and objective; it is a question of both what the putative\n   client believed and whether or not that belief was reasonable based on the surrounding circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Stuffleben v.

The court found Appellee had an honest belief the former attorney was employed by both himself and Appellants, and this belief was reasonable based on the surrounding circumstances. The court further concluded the parties had a common interest when hiring the former attorney. Appellant argues the court erred in finding Vernau jointly represented both Mason and Hinerman in the drafting the agreements surrounding the establishment of the two limited liability companies at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Although issues surrounding an assertion of privilege are generally subject to de novo review, with respect to questions of fact, an appellate court must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    MA Equip.

Mason.\" However, in his testimony at the original deposition which gave rise to the initial question of attorney-client privilege, he testified the client would have been the LLCs, and the members, so \"I guess, Eric, Stu and there's two LLCs, is my recollection.\" Deposition of Adam Vernau, p.6. He further testified he thinks as a matter of law he represented Appellee, but his interaction with him was limited. Deposition of Adam Vernau, p. 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding Appellee believed Vernau represented himself and Mason jointly. His affidavit provided direct evidence as to his belief. The court further did not abuse its discretion in finding Appellee's belief of joint representation to be reasonable. Appellee was already a client\n   of the law firm when Mason came to him and suggested Vernau draw up the operating agreements. His affidavit recites he was never advised by Vernau he was representing Mason only. He and Mason shared a common interest in the operating agreements which created their limited liability companies for their joint business venture. Further, Vernau acknowledged while most of his interaction was with Mason, he believed his clients legally were both Mason and Appellee, as well as the two limited liability companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Because the court did not abuse its discretion in finding joint representation based upon the evidence before it, the trial court did not err in finding the attorney-client privilege inapplicable based on the joint representation exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The judgment of the Licking County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Delaney, J. and Wise, Earle, J. concur\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
