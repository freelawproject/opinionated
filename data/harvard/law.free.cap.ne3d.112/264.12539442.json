L. c. 272, \u00a7 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claiming that, without further clarification, the language of this statute is unconstitutionally vague and that he suffered prejudice from jury instructions tracking such language, the defendant, Jonathan E. Brown, seeks reversal of his conviction on a single count of deriving support from prostitution under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. We disagree and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, is constitutional, as we construe it to target those who,\n   <em>\n    with the intent to profit from prostitution\n   </em>\n   , live or derive support or maintenance from, or share in the earnings or proceeds of, the known prostitution of others. We reach this conclusion from reading the statutory language in the context of common understanding and ordinary usage, as well as the statute's legislative history and severe penalty provisions, all of which demonstrate with sufficient clarity that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, is directed at so-called \"pimping.\" Because a pimp knowingly and intentionally profits from the prostitution of another, he or she differs from the child of a sex worker, a local merchant\n   who sells food to a known sex worker, or a medical professional who provides a sex worker with counselling services; the literal language of the statute may reach all of these individuals, but, unlike a pimp, they lack the intention to profit from the prostitution of another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Here, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the defendant -- who accompanied a woman to a prearranged prostitution transaction and was caught, immediately after leaving the scene with that woman, with the entire proceeds of the transaction hidden in his shoe -- knowingly and intentionally profited from the prostitution of another, and therefore engaged in pimping within the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. While we prospectively clarify the jury instructions to avoid any possible confusion that this statute might apply to those who lack such an intent, we discern no prejudicial or other reversible error in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   .

Police were instructed to watch for two women arriving at the Saugus hotel, and that evening, a police surveillance team observed two women, the defendant, and another man arrive at the hotel in a black motor vehicle. The two men waited in the vehicle in the rear parking lot of the hotel while the women went inside to a hotel room. There, another surveillance team observed as an undercover officer, posing as a customer, agreed with one of the women to have sex for $250. The officer handed the woman $250 in cash, after which he answered a prearranged telephone call and told the two women they had to leave. The women returned to the vehicle and were driven away with the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police stopped the vehicle and, after frisking the defendant, found the same $250 that the officer had given the woman as payment for sex hidden in the defendant's shoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was subsequently charged and convicted at a bench\n   trial of deriving support from prostitution under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but his conviction was reversed by the Appeals Court in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to its rule 1:28 due to the prosecution's errors in its closing argument.

Before his second trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the charge, claiming that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness. That motion was denied. At the second trial, which was tried before a jury, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, relying on the Appeals Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thetonia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3997337\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/27/783/\">\n    27 Mass.

That motion was also denied. Finally, relying again on\n   <em>\n    Thetonia\n   </em>\n   , the defendant sought supplementary instructions that would change Instruction 7.140 of the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (2009) (model jury instruction 7.140). The defendant's requested instruction, based on model jury instruction 7.140, with his requested supplementary language emphasized, is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Deriving Support from Prostitution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"The defendant is charged with knowingly deriving support from the earnings of a prostitute.\n   <em>\n    This is commonly known as the 'pimping' statute.\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 of Section 272 of our General Laws provides as follows: 'Whoever, knowing a person to be a prostitute, shall live or derive support or maintenance, in whole or in part, from the earnings or proceeds of his prostitution ... or shall share in such earnings or proceeds ... shall be punished.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"In order to prove the defendant guilty of this offense, the Commonwealth must prove three [ (and with the requested changes, four) ] things beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"First, that a particular person was engaged in prostitution.

The jury found the defendant guilty under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Purpose of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7\n   </em>\n   . To determine the meaning of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, we begin, as we must, with the statutory language, interpreted in light of \"ordinary and approved usage\" and \"sound reason and common sense\" (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549246\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1189/#p166\">\n    479 Mass. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166-167,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12549246\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/92/1189/#p166\">\n    92 N.E.3d 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). The text of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, imposes criminal liability when a person (1) knows another person is a prostitute; and (2) lives off or otherwise shares in money that the prostitute earned from prostitution activities or received from a brothel or its employees. In other words, the statute plainly targets third parties who knowingly derive their livelihood or otherwise profit from prostitution. In common vernacular and understanding, the statute appears to target \"pimps.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The legislative history confirms such an understanding of this century old provision. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bundy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275311\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/538/#p545\">\n    465 Mass. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 545,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=989%20N.E.2d%20496\">\n    989 N.E.2d 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), quoting\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"201311\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/438/282/#p285\">\n    438 Mass. 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=780%20N.E.2d%2053\">\n    780 N.E.2d 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002) (\"We cannot interpret statutory language in a vacuum, ignoring the Legislature's purpose in enacting the statute and oblivious to 'the time in which [the language] is used' \"). It expressly informs us that the statutory purpose of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, is to target \"pimps\" who profit from \"the business of commercialized prostitution.\" Report of the Commission for the Investigation of the White Slave Traffic, So Called, 1914 House Doc. No. 2281, at 22 (1914 report). A draft version of the original 1910 legislation, consistent with nearly identical contemporary legislation in other States, explicitly defines the prohibited conduct as \"pimping.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, a 1914 report\n   commissioned by the Legislature recommended amending the 1910 statute to better\n   prosecute \"pimps and procurers,\" which it defined as \"exploiters of women\" who profit from \"the business of commercialized prostitution.\" 1914 report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 20, 22, 82-83. See St. 1914, c. 621 (enacting proposed amendment).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 4B, which criminalizes living off of or sharing in the earnings of a prostitute who is a minor in language that parallels the language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, was introduced as a bill targeting \"pimps.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the title of the 1980 session law amending G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 6 and 7, is \"An Act increasing the penalty for a so-called pimp or purveyor.\" St. 1980, c. 409.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Our case law has also recognized that the statutory language of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, must be read in light of its purpose of proscribing pimping. We made this point in passing when we upheld the penalty provision of the statute in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lightfoot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918596\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/391/718/#p720\">\n    391 Mass. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 720-721,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=463%20N.E.2d%20545\">\n    463 N.E.2d 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (inferring legislative intent to increase penalties for deriving support or maintenance from prostitute \"from the title of the act, 'An Act increasing the penalty for a so-called pimp or purveyor,' St. 1980, c. 409\"). The Appeals Court, in\n   <em>\n    Thetonia\n   </em>\n   , further analyzed and clarified the statutory purpose of proscribing pimping when it reversed the conviction of a defendant who, while occasionally receiving small amounts of money from her friend in exchange for driving her friend to prostitution activities, \"did not ... engage in pimping\" within the\n   meaning of the statute.\n   <em>\n    Thetonia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3997337\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/27/783/\">\n    27 Mass.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 7 -- a five-year maximum sentence with a two-year mandatory minimum sentence -- provides further support that the statute is directed at the serious crime of pimping. By contrast, patronizing an adult prostitute and engaging in prostitution are both misdemeanors punishable by less severe sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendant is correct that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, absent such construction, could literally be read to cover innocent conduct (e.g., the children of a sex worker who know what their parent does for a living, the local storekeeper who sells food or clothing to a known sex worker, or a medical professional providing counselling or other health care services to a sex worker). We do not think, however, that the common understanding of the statutory text, combined with the clear and express legislative antipimping purpose, would support its application in instances -- such as prosecuting a child for taking a sandwich from his or her mother -- that do not in any way involve pimping and which the defendant\n   himself characterizes as \"absurd.\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cassidy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552919\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/96/691/#p534\">\n    479 Mass. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 534,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12552919\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/96/691/#p534\">\n    96 N.E.3d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12621872,12621873,12621874,12621875,12621876,12621877\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/276/\">\n    139 S.Ct. 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , --- L.Ed.2d ---- (2018) (\"[w]e will not adopt a literal construction of a statute if the consequences of such construction are absurd or unreasonable\" [citation omitted] ).

We thus reject his facial challenge to the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Turning to the constitutionality of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, as applied to the facts of the defendant's case, we likewise find no merit to that challenge. Our analysis of the common understanding of the statutory language, the legislative history, and the severity of the statutory penalty establishes that, through the statute's prohibition on living off of or sharing in the proceeds of prostitution, the Legislature sought to proscribe the conduct of a pimp: one who knowingly and intentionally profits from the prostitution of another. See, e.g., 1914 report,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 22 (describing pimp as someone profiting from \"the business of commercialized prostitution\"). As so construed, we do not consider G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, to be \"vague as applied\" to the actual circumstances of the defendant's case.\n   <em>\n    Walter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"911069\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/388/460/#p465\">\n    388 Mass. at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20N.E.2d%20707\">\n    446 N.E.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike the hypothetical prosecutions the defendant imagines, the conduct of the defendant fits within the core concern of the statute. In short, the defendant can only challenge the constitutionality of the statute as applied to him, and consistent with our judicial construction of the statute to target those who intend to profit from the prostitution of another, we hold that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, is not unconstitutional\n   as applied to this defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Absence of jury instructions\n   </em>\n   . In addition to challenging the constitutionality of G. L. c. 272 \u00a7 7, the defendant argues that he was prejudiced by the trial judge's failure to issue his requested jury instructions. These requested instructions would have supplemented model jury instruction 7.140, which essentially repeats the statutory prohibition that makes it a crime for a person, knowing another person to be a prostitute, to share in the earnings or proceeds of that person's prostitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because\n   the defendant properly preserved his objection to the judge's denial of his requested instructions, we review for prejudicial error. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824091\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/589/#p591\">\n    445 Mass. 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=839%20N.E.2d%20324\">\n    839 N.E.2d 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Specifically, a judge's failure to give a requested jury instruction \"is reversible error only if the requested instruction was substantially correct; was not substantively covered in the jury charge; and concerns an important issue such that the failure to give the instruction seriously impaired the defendant's ability to present a given defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Deane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270010\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/43/\">\n    458 Mass. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=934%20N.E.2d%20794\">\n    934 N.E.2d 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Additionally, we consider whether the absence of an instruction clarifying that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, expressly requires intent to profit from the prostitution of another caused a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12551289\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/94/819/#p353\">\n    479 Mass. 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12551289\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/94/819/#p353\">\n    94 N.E.3d 819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (where defendant does not request jury instruction at trial, reviewing court applies substantial risk of miscarriage of justice standard).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As explained above, the defendant requested three supplementary instructions. First, he requested that a sentence be added indicating that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, \"is commonly known as the 'pimping' statute.\" Second, he requested that the word \"substantial\" be added to the requirement that he have received support and maintenance from the earnings of a prostitute. Finally, he requested that the following fourth element be added: \"Fourth, The Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant played a substantial role in facilitating this person's prostitution. For example, it is not enough if the Defendant simply drove the prostitute to a job.\" On appeal the defendant, relying on\n   <em>\n    Thetonia\n   </em>\n   , further seeks to limit the definition of \"pimping\" to procuring customers for a client. See\n   <em>\n    Thetonia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3997337\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/27/783/\">\n    27 Mass.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, is \"commonly known as the 'pimping' statute.\" We agree that this statement is correct as a matter of legislative history and common understanding. As explained, however, we do not see the necessity for further emphasizing this common understanding in these circumstances. Moreover, without further definition of \"pimping,\" such instruction would provide little additional guidance to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, the defendant's request for an instruction that the Commonwealth must prove that he \"shared in some\n   <em>\n    substantial\n   </em>\n   way\" in the earnings of prostitution is not an accurate statement of the law. The key factor is the defendant's intention to profit from the prostitution of a known prostitute, not the substantiality of the defendant's gains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Third, we conclude that the fourth element that the defendant sought to add -- substantial facilitation of another's prostitution -- is not a necessary aspect of \"pimping\" proscribed by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. It is true that standard definitions of \"pimping\" -- including one suggested by Thetonia -- describe facilitation of, as well as profiting from, prostitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet\n   G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, makes no mention of facilitation of prostitution (which would include, for example, soliciting for customers) because the Legislature chose to criminalize such conduct under separate sections of G. L. c. 272, not as a required element of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7. See St. 1910, c. 424 (enacting or amending present G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6, 8, 12, and 13 ).

Although we conclude that such an instruction should be given prospectively, it was not required in the instant case. The Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court required the jury to determine that another person engaged in prostitution, the defendant knew that the other person was engaged in the prostitution, and the defendant received the proceeds from that prostitution. As explained above, the common understanding of this language would be that it targets pimping, and the factual scenario here did not present concerns about innocent activity that might otherwise meet the literal language of the statute. Rather, the defendant's conduct fell within the core concern of the statute. In sum, we conclude that such an instruction was not required in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We do decide, however, that the jury instructions for this crime should be expanded prospectively beyond those included in the Criminal Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court to avoid prosecution and thus possible conviction for conduct that could not be classified as pimping but might otherwise meet the literal language of the statute. Model jury instruction 7.140 should be modified as follows by inserting the emphasized language and deleting the struck through language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"Deriving Support from Earnings of a Prostitute\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"The defendant is charged with knowingly (deriving support from) (sharing in) the earnings of a prostitute.\n   <em>\n    This statute makes it a crime to engage in 'pimping,' that is, 'knowingly and intentionally profiting from the prostitution of another.'\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Chapter 7 of section 272 of our General Laws provides as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \" 'Whoever, knowing a person to be a prostitute, shall live or derive support or maintenance, in whole or in part, from the earnings or proceeds of his prostitution ... or shall share in such earnings [or] proceeds ... shall be punished ....'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"In order to prove the defendant guilty of this offense, the Commonwealth must prove three things beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"First: That a particular person was engaged in prostitution.

The defendant also argues that (1) G.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, requires an intent to profit from the prostitution of another, we reject the defendant's argument that this statute lacks a mens rea element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We also reject the defendant's arguments that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536498\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/107/1146/#p674\">\n    480 Mass. 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536498\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/107/1146/#p674\">\n    107 N.E.3d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018) (reciting sufficiency of evidence standard). The defendant's main insufficiency argument hinges on his contention that G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 7, incorporates the facilitation of prostitution as a necessary element, but for the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we reject that argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a rational trier of fact reasonably could have inferred from witness testimony and circumstantial evidence that the defendant knowingly and intentionally profited from the prostitution of another. The defendant was in the vehicle in which a woman was driven to a hotel in response to an online advertisement for sexual services, and he waited in the parking lot while the woman went into the hotel to the prearranged prostitution transaction. That woman accepted money for sex and then immediately gave the defendant the money, which he concealed in his shoe. From this conduct the jury could infer that the defendant knew that the woman was a prostitute, knew she had received money for engaging in an act of prostitution, and, by taking the money from her, revealed an intention to profit from prostitution.

The defendant makes much of one prosecution witness's equivocation as to whether the defendant was driving the vehicle that transported the two women to and from the hotel or instead may have been in the front passenger's seat. See note 3,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Whether or not the defendant was driving, as the prosecution said in its closing argument, the evidence still revealed that he accompanied the prostitute to and from the prearranged prostitution transaction at the hotel and received the proceeds from the transaction.
