At the time, Jeffries lived on Elkhorn Drive with J.J., R.J., M.J., and his girlfriend Elizabeth Mehl (\"Liz\"). When Detective Sean Maher went to the home to speak to Jeffries about the truancy, he left believing that something was \"severely wrong,\" after sensing fear in J.J. and M.J., whom he met on the same visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The police expanded the investigation due to allegations that Jeffries was trafficking drugs out of the family home and sexually abusing his youngest daughter, R.J. Later, Detective Joe Carter conducted surveillance on the home and observed a large amount of vehicle traffic coming and going, with the visitors staying no more than a few minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} During a search of Jeffries' home on April 14, the police recovered a large quantity of blue Percocet pills containing oxycodone, a schedule II controlled substance, in pill bottles not labeled with prescriptions. They found other evidence of drug trafficking and drug abuse, but not a ledger of transactions or a large amount of cash. And the police collected a towel and other items from R.J.'s bedroom for DNA testing based on R.J.'s statements concerning the sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} When interviewed by the police, Jeffries stated that any drugs recovered in the home belonged to him, and he made admissions concerning two cell phones the police recovered in the home. One cell phone was connected to text messages that incriminated Jeffries in the trafficking of drugs, and the other was connected to text\n   messages that incriminated him in the sexual abuse of R.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} During the interview, Jeffries also made statements incriminating himself in the sex offenses against his daughter, including admitting that his semen would likely be found on the items from R.J.'s bedroom that were submitted for DNA testing. But he denied having an inappropriate relationship with R.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After his arrest, Jeffries had several conversations with Liz over the telephone from the Hamilton County Justice Center that the police recorded. In these conversations, Jeffries discussed his drug-trafficking operation, asking Liz if the police had found the \"blue caps,\" and lamenting that they had so many pills in the home at one time. In another conversation, he and Liz discussed that the reason why the police did not seize much money during the search was because Liz had it on her person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Ultimately, Jeffries was indicted in the case numbered B-1602033 on seven counts. The first count charged aggravated drug trafficking on or about April 14, 2016. The second, third, and fifth counts charged the rapes of R.J., and the fourth, sixth, and seventh charged gross sexual imposition (\"GSI\") related to R.J. The sex-offense counts involved conduct beginning in 2010 and ending on or about April 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Jeffries moved for a separate trial on the first count, claiming both that the joinder of the drug-offense count in the same indictment as the sex-offense counts was not permitted under Crim.R. 8(A) because the offenses were completely unrelated, and that joinder was prejudicial under Crim.R. 14. The trial court denied his motion. But the court granted, over Jeffries' objection, the state's motion to join the indictment with another indictment charging Jeffries with one count of GSI involving another minor, K.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} At a single trial on both indictments, Jeffries tried to introduce evidence that R.J. had been sexually abused by a different individual who had been convicted for that conduct. The trial court found the evidence inadmissible under Ohio's rape-shield statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Through various witnesses, the state presented substantial evidence of the offenses in the first indictment. But the evidence in support of the sex offenses related to R.J. did not include any DNA lab test results, even though the jury was informed that items had been collected from R.J.'s bedroom and submitted for DNA testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Jeffries testified and denied sexually abusing R.J. In closing argument, defense counsel argued the state failed to prove he committed the sex offenses against R.J. because it did not present any DNA lab test results. The jury found Jeffries guilty on all the counts set forth in the first indictment, but acquitted him on the one count of GSI set forth in the second indictment. At sentencing, the trial court imposed consecutive prison terms, for an aggregate prison term of life without parole plus 37 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Jeffries now appeals, raising six assignments of error. He argues the trial court erred by applying the rape-shield statute to exclude evidence of R.J.'s prior nonconsensual sexual activity. Further, he claims the trial court erred by failing to sever the drug-offense count from the sex-offense counts, and by ordering that his sentence on the drug offense be served consecutively to the sentences imposed for the sex offenses. Finally, Jeffries contends that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence, and that he was denied the effective assistance of\n   counsel because counsel did not present expert testimony about the DNA testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Finding no merit to the errors assigned, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The state's evidence at trial showed that Jeffries began sexually abusing R.J., who was born in December 2001, in the spring of 2010. She was nine years old, and the family was living in a house on Wenning Drive. R.J. had a \"rash\" on her \"butt\" that she was treating with a prescription cream. R.J. testified that one day, after Jeffries had applied the cream to the rash while she lay on her stomach on his bed, \"he had me lay on my back, and he put a pillow over my face. * * * He just started rubbing me with a rag, and then he started rubbing me-rubbing his dick on my vagina.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} According to R.J., the sexual abuse continued through the years as the family, including her younger brother and older sister, moved to different residences. She specifically recalled for the jury an incident occurring one evening between June and August 2012, when she was 11 years old and the family was living on DeSoto Drive. She was in the living room alone with Jeffries, lying on the couch watching television. Without saying anything to her, Jeffries pulled down her pants and underwear and began licking her vagina and sticking his tongue in and out of it. Jeffries then told her to kiss his penis and put it in her mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} R.J. also specifically recounted abuse that occurred one evening in December 2015 after a school concert. She was 14 years old, and had asked Jeffries on the drive home from her school if she could spend the night with a friend. He mentioned that it was a school night, and then pulled his car into the parking lot of the Towne Terrace Apartments on Pippen Road. There he reclined her seat and got on top of her. He then pulled down her pants and underwear, unzipped his zipper, rubbed his penis on her, and put his fingers inside her vagina. When finished, he agreed that she could spend the night with her friend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} With respect to the April 13, 2016 incident, R.J. stated that she was 16 years old, and she and her father had returned to their house on Elkhorn Drive from a cheerleading meeting. Her brother and sister were not home, nor was Liz. When R.J. was in her bedroom, Jeffries entered and commented on how much money he would have to pay for her to participate in cheerleading. He then told her that for him to pay for it she needed to \"inspire\" him. Subsequently, he had her remove her clothes and lay on her back on her bed. After rubbing his penis on her vagina, he had her turn over and rise onto her elbows and knees. He then penetrated her vagina with his penis from the rear and had intercourse with her. Afterwards, he told her that she was his \"favorite\" and if she needed anything he would find a way to do it, but she would have to \"inspire him for it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} R.J. explained that her father would often use the code word \"inspire\" to indicate he wanted to touch her in exchange for something she wanted. The text messages between the two of them showed that Jeffries required \"inspiration\" for a variety of things, including keeping R.J.'s older sister out of her room and driving R.J. to school. Jeffries texted R.J., \"I'll tell her to stay out of your room. * * * I'll add it to your inspirational list, ok,\" and \"Of course you know with a little inspiration I can run you to school in 25 minutes, just [a] thought. Lol.\" Another message from Jeffries to R.J. provided, \"Inspiration right when u wake up, ok. ;).\" Additionally, in one series of text messages, after referencing that Liz was not home, Jeffries texted\n   to R.J., \"You should have inspired me in her absence. Missing it. Still have time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} According to R.J., Jeffries also used the code word \"air-dry\" to relay to R.J. when she \"ha[d] to sleep with no pants or underwear on\" because he would be coming to her room to abuse her. For example, when Jeffries texted R.J. about switching her cell phone to his account, he added, \"If you want me to do it, it will cost you though, you know! :-) Like air-dry visit late as needed.\" The relevant text messages showing Jeffries' use of these code words were admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} R.J. explained that she had not wanted to engage in any of the sexual conduct with her father, but she feared him and did know how to say \"no\" to him. He would get \"very angry\" when he did not get his way, and had punished her and her siblings by beating them with a belt, striking their hands with spoons, and forcing them to eat soap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 22} R.J. testified that when she was younger she had told \"Jackie,\" a former stepmother, about the abuse, but Jackie had not believed her. After Jeffries forced her to have vaginal intercourse with him on April 13, 2016, R.J. for the first time told her older sister M.J. about the abuse that had occurred earlier in the day. This incident had been worse than the others and had \"hurt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Consistent with R.J.'s testimony, M.J. stated that when she returned home from work on the evening of April 13, R.J. disclosed the abuse to her and told her it \"hurt.\" They both cried about it. Although M.J. was previously unaware of the abuse, she said that it made sense to her when thinking about certain circumstances over the years. The night of the disclosure, M.J. slept in R.J.'s room due to fear of her father. The next day she reported the sex abuse to a counselor at the high school they both attended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 24} After M.J. reported the abuse, R.J. was taken from her school to the Mayerson Center at Children's Hospital, where Tracy Collier, a social worker performed a forensic interview. Collier observed that R.J. discussed the sexual abuse in a matter-of-fact manner and looked down to the floor, a presentation and demeanor that, based on the social worker's experience, was not inconsistent with a victim of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Although the state did not present any DNA evidence, it did present several incriminating statements Jeffries had made when interviewed by Detective Mike Stockmeier about the sex-abuse allegations. This included Jeffries' statement that his semen would likely be found on a towel in R.J.'s bedroom. Jeffries had qualified the statement by stating that he had sex in R.J.'s bedroom with several women, and that he wanted to hide this conduct from Liz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The state's evidence at trial also demonstrated that Jeffries was trafficking the drug oxycodone in an amount far more than bulk out of the family's home. Detective Carter had observed a high amount of vehicle traffic outside the home, consistent with drug trafficking, before obtaining and executing a search warrant for the residence. During the search on April 14, 2016, the police recovered over 85 Percocet pills containing oxycodone that Jeffries claimed to own in an interview with the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 27} According to Detective Stockmeier, the amount of the drugs recovered was consistent with drug trafficking but not personal use, and exceeded the bulk amount by five times. The pills were contained in three bottles without prescription labels that were discovered in a basket of laundry along with a package of miniature plastic bags that zipped and drug paraphernalia. This included a pill crusher and\n   a handful of cut plastic sipping straws, each labeled with a different name and containing residue from a white powder, to be used to snort crushed narcotic pills such as Percocet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The state also offered into evidence a printout of the many text messages downloaded from a black cell phone belonging to Jeffries that incriminated him in drug trafficking, and recorded telephone calls Jeffries made from jail that implicated him in the sale of the pills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Finally, both R.J. and M.J. testified that when they were under the age of 18 they had observed their father conduct sales of drugs in the home. According to these witnesses, Jeffries had used code names, and the drugs were exchanged for cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Jeffries testified in his defense. He denied ever sexually abusing his daughter R.J. Jeffries further claimed he had learned the word \"inspire\" when he served in the Marine Corps, and he used the term with all his children, including R.J., to encourage them. Specifically, he said he used the word in his text messages with R.J. to encourage her to practice her cheerleading. But he acknowledged on cross-examination that when he used the word with R.J. the context was to inspire him-not her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Contrary to R.J.'s testimony, Jeffries stated that when he used the phrase \"air-dry,\" he was communicating with R.J. to leave her bedroom door unlocked so he could dry some wet clothes with the ceiling fan in the room. He also suggested the reference to \"air dry\" in the text messages meant that she was not to wear any tight clothing because she had a boil or cyst on her vaginal area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Jeffries admitted that he had rubbed a prescription cream to \"warts\" on R.J.'s \"vaginal\" and \"anal\" areas when they lived on Wenning Road, explaining that her mother was not around to do it. He also confirmed R.J.'s testimony that years earlier R.J. had told his former wife \"Jackie\" that he was sexually abusing her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 33} With respect to the drug-trafficking count, Jeffries testified that all of the illegally obtained Percocet pills recovered in the home were his. He admitted that some of the pills were intended to be sold, and contended that most were for his and Liz's personal use. But of the three bottles recovered, only one bottle was marked \"personal,\" and that bottle contained just a few pills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Although Jeffries acknowledged that some pills were to be sold, and that he had sold illegally obtained prescription drugs in the past, he insinuated that Liz was running the drug-trafficking operation in his home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 35}\n   <em>\n    Rape-Shield Statute\n   </em>\n   . Jeffries' first assignment of error involves Ohio's rape-shield statute, R.C. 2907.02(D), which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Evidence of specific instances of the victim's sexual activity, opinion evidence of the victim's sexual activity, and reputation evidence of the victim's sexual activity shall not be admitted under this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The statute then provides certain exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 36} At trial, Jeffries sought to introduce evidence that R.J. had been sexually abused by another person who had been convicted for that conduct. First, he tried to cross-examine R.J. on the issue, claiming it was relevant to show her knowledge of sexual terms used in her testimony, an argument he has abandoned on appeal. Later, he tried to present his own testimony on the topic, requesting to testify that he was rubbing a prescription cream on\n   R.J.'s vaginal and anal areas because she had \"a medical condition caused by the prior abuse.\" The trial court allowed Jeffries to testify that he was rubbing the cream on R.J.'s genital area due to \"warts,\" but it did not allow Jeffries to testify that the warts were caused by the prior abuse. Jeffries argues this was error that violated his constitutional rights to confront witnesses and to present a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Initially, Jeffries argues, as he did before the trial court, that the rape-shield statute does not apply when the evidence sought to be introduced involves nonconsensual sexual activity of the victim. Because R.J.'s prior sexual abuse was nonconsensual, he contends testimony on the topic was not protected by the statute. In support of his argument, he cites\n   <em>\n    State v. Stoffer\n   </em>\n   , 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 09-CO-1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011-Ohio-5133\">\n    2011-Ohio-5133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204579182\">\n    2011 WL 4579182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Stoffer\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh District Court of Appeals held that the rape-shield statute does not apply to prior sexual abuse suffered by the victim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 98. The interpretation of a statute is an issue of law that this court reviews de novo.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Boggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1714495\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/63/418/\">\n    63 Ohio St.3d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    588 N.E.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). In\n   <em>\n    Boggs\n   </em>\n   , the alleged rape victim was alleged to have made prior false rape accusations against a person other than the defendant, and Boggs sought to cross-examine her on the issue. The court examined whether the rape-shield provisions of R.C. 2907.02(D) prohibited such cross-examination. The court stated\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   R.C. 2907.02 prohibits only evidence of \"sexual activity\" of the victim. Because prior false accusations of rape do not constitute \"sexual activity\" of the victim, the rape shield law does not exclude such evidence. A great number of courts from other jurisdictions have also reached this conclusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   When the defense seeks to cross-examine on prior false accusations of rape the burden is upon the defense to demonstrate that the accusations were totally false and unfounded. Hence the initial inquiry must be whether the accusations were actually made by the prosecutrix. Moreover, the trial court must also be satisfied that the prior allegations of sexual misconduct were actually false or fabricated. That is, the trial court must ascertain whether any sexual activity took place, i.e.,\n   <strong>\n    an actual rape or consensual sex\n   </strong>\n   . If it is established that either type of activity took place, the rape shield statute prohibits any further inquiry into this area. Only if it is determined that the prior accusations were false because no sexual activity took place would the rape shield law not bar further cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 423,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=588%20N.E.2d%20813\">\n    588 N.E.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Of importance, the\n   <em>\n    Boggs\n   </em>\n   court interpreted \"sexual activity\" to include \"an actual rape.\" The Eighth District Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The bulk amount for the Percocet pills belonging to Jeffries and containing oxycodone was less than 16 pills. The state proceeded against Jeffries as the principal of the offense or as a complicitor to Liz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 66} Jeffries argues the state did not present any evidence that he had prepared the pills for distribution. We disagree. The evidence presented by the state, if believed, indicated that Jeffries obtained at least 85 Percocet pills, put a few in a container marked \"personal\" to keep for his own use, and put the rest aside in two other containers with the intent that those pills would be sold. Once sold, the pills\n   would be either crushed for regular customers who kept snorting straws in Jeffries' home, or placed in a miniature zip-lock like bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 67} The evidence also showed that Jeffries was engaged in and regularly dealt in the business of drug sales for profit. This included testimony from Detective Carter concerning the pattern of vehicle traffic outside the home, R.J.'s and M.J.'s testimony concerning drug transactions in the home, Jeffries' text messages and recorded phone call conversations, and Jeffries' testimony at trial that he sold drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 68} From this set of facts, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Jeffries was preparing the pills in an amount equaling or exceeding bulk for distribution and sale, or that he was complicit in Liz's commission of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 69} Our review of the record convinces us that the evidence was not just sufficient, but overwhelming, and that the jury did not lose its way in its assessment of the weight and credibility of this evidence when finding Jeffries guilty of aggravated drug trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    Sex Offenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Jeffries was convicted of several sex offenses related to his daughter R.J. This included rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), occurring when she was 14 years old (count 2), rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), occurring when she was 13 years old (count 3), GSI in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(1), occurring when she was 13 years old (count 4), rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), occurring when she was 11 years old (count 5), GSI in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), occurring when she was 11 years old (count 6), and GSI in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(5), occurring when she was 9 years old (count 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 71} R.J. testified to the detailed incidents of rape and GSI that occurred on four separate occasions between 2010 and 2016. Her unequivocal testimony was corroborated by other evidence, including incriminating text messages sent to her from Jeffries, as well as Jeffries' statements to the police and M.J.'s testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Jeffries generally challenges the state's proof with respect to all the sex offenses, citing the lack of \"physical\" evidence such as DNA test results to corroborate R.J.'s testimony. But the state is not required to present corroborating DNA test results or other corroborating physical evidence to meet its burden of proof, even in a rape case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our review of the record shows the state easily met the test of sufficiency with respect to the sex offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Jeffries argues also that his testimony denying the conduct was more credible than the accusatory testimony of R.J. and M.J. In support of his conclusory attack on the credibility of these witnesses, he cites only one instance involving their testimony. This related to circumstances surrounding R.J.'s disclosure of the abuse to M.J. on April 13. M.J. testified that when she walked into R.J.'s room that evening, R.J. was unusually withdrawn and \"upset,\" \"just staring at her phone,\" which caused M.J. to ask her what was wrong. According to M.J., R.J. then wrote down what her father had done to her and then they talked about it. R.J., however, testified that she disclosed the abuse by showing M.J. the text messages from her father on her cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Although the sisters' testimony was not identical on the issue of the disclosure,\n   it was generally consistent, as both R.J. and M.J. recalled that the initial disclosure was nonverbal. The jury was free to judge the credibility of R.J. and M.J., and we cannot say that it lost its way in its assessment of the weight and credibility of the evidence. This evidence included Jeffries' implausible explanation for the text messages he sent to R.J. containing the words \"inspire me\" and \"air dry.\" Ultimately, Jeffries' sufficiency and weight-of-the-evidence challenges are unfounded, and his third and fourth assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 75}\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </em>\n   . In his fifth assignment of error, Jeffries claims he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because counsel did not call a DNA expert to testify as to the results of the DNA testing on items recovered from R.J.'s room. At trial, the evidence showed that items were taken for testing, but no test results were offered or admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 76} To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Jeffries must show that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Here, Jeffries has failed to show any prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Jeffries claims counsel was ineffective for not presenting an expert witness to testify as to the DNA test results, but there is nothing in the record from which we can determine that such testimony would have been favorable to Jeffries and caused the outcome of the trial to be different. The prosecutor suggested that the laboratory technician who performed the testing would have testified, based on the results, \"[I] can't say it's his [DNA] and [I] can't say its not his [DNA].\" But we do not know what any expert would have said about the test results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Similarly, Jeffries' claim fails to the extent he is additionally arguing counsel was ineffective for not hiring an expert to \"separately examine\" the items recovered from R.J.'s room. Nothing in our record shows that additional testing would have been favorable to Jeffries and would have altered the outcome of the trial. Accordingly, we overrule the fifth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 80}\n   <em>\n    Consecutive Sentence for Drug Offense\n   </em>\n   . Jeffries sixth assignment of error challenges his sentence. Jeffries does not attack the length of any sentence imposed. He argues only the trial court erred by ordering that he serve the sentence for the drug offense consecutively to the sex-offense sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 81} When, as here, the trial court exercises its discretion to impose consecutive sentences, it must make the consecutive-sentences findings set out in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), and those findings must be made at the sentencing hearing and incorporated into the sentencing entry.\n   <em>\n    State v.

But our review of the record shows the trial court made the requisite consecutive-sentencing findings for \"all\" the offenses at the sentencing hearing and then incorporated those findings into the sentencing entry, as required by\n   <em>\n    Bonnell\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 82} Next Jeffries contends that the record could not support a finding that consecutive sentences were proportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct, the finding set forth in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). According to Jeffries, there was no evidence of a \"high-budget\" drug-trafficking operation, as the police did not recover \"large stacks of cash\" or \"flashy jewelry.\" But these facts were only part of the facts the trial court considered in determining whether to impose a consecutive sentence for the drug-trafficking operation that Jeffries ran out of the family residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Under these circumstances, we cannot clearly and convincingly find that the record does not support the court's consecutive-sentencing findings or that the imposition of the consecutive sentence was contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.
