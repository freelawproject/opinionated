Upon review, we hold that the Court of Criminal Appeals erred in reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence. In particular, we conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on facilitation and solicitation or by permitting the medical examiner to display the victim\u2019s cleaned and reconstructed skull as a demonstrative aid during his testimony; that the prosecution did not present inconsistent theories and evidence in the separate trials of the defendant and co-defendant Prentiss Phillips; and that the sentence of death is not disproportionate considering the circumstances of the crime and the defendant. Having reinstated the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence, we have also reviewed and considered all other errors alleged by the defendant and conclude that none warrants relief. With respect to issues not herein specifically addressed, we affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. Relevant portions of that opinion are published hereafter as an appendix. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed in part, affirmed in part, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\n<em>I. Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The defendant, Gregory Robinson, was convicted by a Shelby County jury of the premeditated first degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping of Vernon Green. Proof presented at trial established that on the afternoon of April 30, 1997, a squabble between two small children in the Hurt Village Apartments in North Memphis led to an argument between the mothers of these children, which escalated into a fight, including gunfire, between the women\u2019s boyfriends, members of rival Memphis gangs \u2014 the Gangster Disciples and the Vice Lords.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this fight, the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples called an \u201caid and assist\u201d meeting, and Memphis-area Gangster Disciples congregated at an apartment in the Hurt Village complex for this meeting. Although the victim was not a gang member and had not been involved in the earlier fight, he was seen near the apartment where the aid and assist meeting was being held. When a gang member accused Green of acting as a lookout for the Vice Lords, the defendant instructed other gang members to \u201csnatch him up\u201d and bring him to the apartment. For one and one-half to two and one-half hours, the defendant, along with other gang members, beat and interrogated Green. Eventually Green was taken from the apartment by six gang members and shot to death in Jessie Turner Park.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Green\u2019s body was discovered in the park between 5 and 5:30 a.m., on May 1,1997, by members of a local walking club, who called the police. When Officer Alvin Peppers arrived at the scene, he found the victim\u2019s body lying face down in a prone position. Officer Peppers explained that he could not identify the victim\u2019s features, such as eye color, because the \u201cface of the body was so mutilated that there was nothing that we could identify.\u201d Officer Peppers found no identifying objects on the body, such as a wallet or jewelry, but he recovered a numbered dry cleaner\u2019s tag from inside the victim\u2019s clothing that apparently was helpful in identifying the victim. Two live .45 caliber bullets, two .45 caliber bullet casings, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>one .20 gauge shotgun shell casing were found within a five foot radius of the victim\u2019s body. The following complicated and detailed recitation of the testimony at trial is necessary to a full and proper consideration of the issues presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Several former gang members testified about the events surrounding Green\u2019s kidnapping and murder. Two of these testified for the prosecution. The first, Christopher James, known as \u201cBig Chris,\u201d testified for the prosecution. James had been a Gangster Disciple for three or four months on April 30, 1997. Around 5 or 6 p.m. on April 30, 1997, James and fellow Gangster Disciples, Jarvis Shipp, known as \u201cJ-Roc,\u201d and two other gang members called \u201cPopcorn,\u201d and \u201cSteve,\u201d witnessed a fight between Shipp\u2019s girlfriend and the girlfriend of \u201cSnoop,\u201d a Vice Lords gang member. Later, as James, Shipp, and Popcorn were walking toward the apartment of Shipp\u2019s girlfriend, Snoop approached them and begin swinging at Shipp. After Shipp and Snoop began fighting, another Vice Lord drew a gun. At this point, James and Popcorn fled, but a bullet grazed Popcorn\u2019s hand as they were running from the scene. They arrived from the fight at the Hurt Village apartment of sisters Natalie, Nichole, and April Black around 8 p.m. Shortly thereafter, Shipp, along with fellow Gangster Disciples Prentiss Phillips, James Lee White Car-radine, known as \u201cThug Life,\u201d and \u201cSteve,\u201d and \u201cChuck\u201d arrived at the apartment. Shipp was angry and decided to \u201ccall some more Gangsters over there to Hurt Village.\u201d An aid and assist meeting was called, and according to James, twenty or thirty additional Gangster Disciples from all over Memphis arrived at the apartment for the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">After their arrival, Phillips came inside the apartment and said that Vernon Green was outside \u201cwatching out at the apartment.\u201d One of the later arriving Gangster Disciples, whom James identified as the defendant, instructed Shipp and three other Gangster Disciples to \u201cgo snatch up\u201d Vernon Green. James said Shipp and the others followed the defendant\u2019s instruction without hesitation. Green arrived at the apartment around 10 p.m., escorted by \u201c[t]wo disciples in front [and] two disciples in the back.\u201d Green stood in the middle of the floor as the defendant asked Green if he had been outside watching for the Vice Lords. The defendant then hit Green in the face, struck Green numerous times, both with his fists and with a broom stick, and then pushed Green onto the couch. James, who had lived in the Hurt Village apartments and known Green for seven years, described Green as the neighborhood comedian and stated that Green had not been a gang member and had not been involved in the fight earlier in the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">After Green was beaten, he was taken upstairs by \u201ctwo other guys.\u201d Green remained upstairs for thirty to forty-five minutes. During this time, James was \u201cjumped on\u201d and \u201cbeat up\u201d downstairs by six Gangster Disciples because he had not helped \u201cJarvis and them fight.\u201d James testified that Phillips came out of the kitchen, where he had been meeting with Shipp and Kevin Wilkins, known as \u201cBig Folk,\u201d \u201ccut on the radio and started picking out six people,\u201d who then beat James for fleeing rather than aiding Shipp during the fight with Snoop. James testified that Phillips, not the defendant, selected the gang members who beat James and that the defendant had been upstairs at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Green was escorted downstairs after James was beaten, but a short time later, Green was taken from the apartment. Before Green left the apartment, James saw the defendant, Shipp, and Phillips talking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>together in the kitchen and overheard the defendant say, \u201cY\u2019all know what to do.\u201d James believed this statement meant \u201c[t]hey [were] going to kill [Green].\u201d James recalled that the victim had been held at the apartment two or two and one-half hours. When asked if the victim said anything during this time, James said the victim \u201ctold Prentiss [Phillips], \u2018tell them folks to stop.\u2019 \u201d When Green was escorted from the apartment by Shipp, Wilkins, Charles Golden, known as \u201cFu\u00f1\u00ed,\u201d and Antonio Jackson, Green had been wearing a black shirt, black pants, and black shoes. Green\u2019s black shirt had been pulled over his head so that Green was unable to see or use his arms to resist. As this group left the apartment, James overheard the defendant again say, Wall know what to do.\u201d James also testified that the defendant at one point aimed a nine millimeter gun at his face, while threatening that the \u201csame thing\u201d would happen to James if James ever said \u201csomething about it.\u201d James believed the defendant\u2019s comment meant \u201c[t]hey going to kill me too.\u201d After Green and the other gang members left the apartment, Phillips and \u201cSteve\u201d walked James home in the early morning hours of May 1,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">James admitted that he had never seen the defendant before April 30, 1997, and that the defendant had not been a member of the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples. James maintained, however, that the defendant had been a member of the Memphis Gangster Disciples and had been present at the Hurt Village apartment on April 30,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Defense counsel on cross-examination questioned James regarding a statement he made to the police on May 8, 1997, one week after these events occurred. In that statement, James informed the police that \u201c[he] saw Anthony, Jarvis Shipp, <em>Shaun, </em>and a big heavy-set guy that I don\u2019t know his name, Antonio Jackson, and Big Folk\u201d Idll Green. (Emphasis added.) In his May 8 statement James also said that \u201cShaun\u201d instructed Shipp and three other gang members to \u201cgo snatch Vernon Green up\u201d and that \u201cShaun\u201d questioned and hit Green at the apartment. In his May 8 statement James provided the following account of the events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">J-Roc, MacKaos, Shaun, and LowDown went into the Mtehen for a private meeting. And I heard them talMng softly to each other for about five minutes. And then J-Roc and Shaun came out of the Mtehen. And then MacKaos and Low-Down came out of the Mtehen. And MacKaos said, you all need to take care of this and told Jarvis, what you-all do now is personal. Then MacKaos and Low-Down left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Also in his May 8 statement, James indicated that \u201cShaun came up to me and said I better not say nothing to nobody, and if you think this was something let us find out that you said something about this.\u201d Although on May 8, 1997, James told the police that many gang members beat the victim, James testified at trial that only the defendant beat Green. Finally, in this May 8,1997, statement James claimed he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">heard three cars start and heard at least six doors close. And after they left-and Prentiss had a gun in his right hand and said, if anyone say anything about this they will be dealt with. And then he said, all the gangsters in here keep this on the 1919. And after that Prentiss and Steve escorted me to my house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA9\">When asked by police on May 8 if he had anything else to add to his statement to aid the investigation, James had replied: \u201cAll I can say is that Vernon was a good person and didn\u2019t need to be killed by anyone.\u201d When defense counsel pressed James to explain why he had mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the name \u201cShaun\u201d and had not once mentioned the defendant\u2019s name in his May 8, 1997, statement, James replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">Man, hold up man. When Vernon was getting beat, man, Vernon the one who called that man Shaun. So I went by what Vernon called him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">James admitted he had not previously provided this information to police and also conceded he had not previously indicated the defendant threatened him while holding a nine millimeter gun to his head. Although James had consistently \u201cgiven the same name for everybody else that did everything that night,\u201d the actions he attributed to the defendant at trial had been attributed to \u201cShaun\u201d in his May 8 statement. In response to questions from defense counsel, James indicated that Phillips was \u201ccoordinator\u201d and Shipp \u201cchief of security\u201d of the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples. James did not attribute a rank to the defendant, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">On re-direct examination, James clarified his prior testimony and May 8 statement, explaining that many gang members beat the victim, but the defendant hit Green first and no other gang member beat Green at the same time as the defendant. James also explained he had not known the gang members present on April 30, 1997, by their legal names and had referred to them by their street names. James said he had never seen the defendant before that night, had not known the defendant\u2019s name, and had referred to the defendant as \u201cShaun\u201d in his May 8 statement because he heard Green refer to the defendant as \u201cShaun.\u201d James explained that, when the police showed him a photographic array shortly after Green\u2019s kidnapping and murder, he selected the defendant\u2019s photograph but referred to the person in the photograph as \u201cShaun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">James maintained the accuracy and truthfulness of his May 8 statement and claimed its only error was his use of the name \u201cShaun\u201d when describing the defendant\u2019s actions. James claimed he had not learned the defendant\u2019s correct name until the first day of trial. James reaffirmed his direct testimony and reiterated that the defendant gave the order to \u201csnatch up\u201d Green; that the defendant beat Green; that the defendant met with Phillips, Shipp, and Wilkins in the kitchen; and, that the defendant twice commented,\u2019\u2019Ya\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d On re-cross-examination, defense counsel pointed out that, despite his proclamation to the contrary, James knew the defendant\u2019s correct name prior to trial and had used the defendant\u2019s correct name when previously testifying. Sergeant William Ashton of the Memphis Police Department corroborated James\u2019s testimony regarding the photographic array. Sergeant Ashton recalled that James identified the defendant\u2019s photograph from the array, but referred to the person in the photograph as \u201cShaun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Testifying next for the prosecution, Jarvis Shipp, known also as \u201cJ-Roc,\u201d admitted he had been a Gangster Disciple and that he had held the \u201cchief of security\u201d rank in the Hurt Village section of the gang. Shipp corroborated James\u2019s testimony concerning the squabble between the children that led to the argument between the children\u2019s mothers that eventually escalated to the altercation between Shipp and Snoop. Shipp also corroborated James\u2019s testimony concerning James and Popcorn fleeing the fight and the gunshot injury to Popcorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">When he arrived at the Hurt Village apartment of Natalie, Nichole, and April Black at about 9 p.m., Shipp saw James, Popcorn, Phillips, Isiah Triplett, Sepacus Triplett, Steve Hardin, and James Lee White Carradine, all members of the Gangster Disciples. The Black sisters also were present, but Phillips, the \u201ccoordinator\u201d of the Hurt Village Gangster Disci-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>pies, ordered the Black sisters upstairs. After they complied, Phillips called an aid and assist meeting, stating that the Gangster Disciples were going to \u201cstep to another level\u201d and retaliate against the Vice Lords. Shipp believed Phillips meant the Gangster Disciples were going back to hurt all or some of the Vice Lords as revenge for injuring Popcorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Shipp explained how the Gangster Disciples were organized into sections throughout Memphis. In addition to the Hurt Village section, where Phillips was the \u201ccoordinator\u201d and Shipp the \u201cchief of security,\u201d the Gangster Disciples had sections in Mitchell Heights, South Memphis, Scut-terfield, Frayser, Watkins Manor, Bin-ghampton, Hyde Park, Douglass, Riverside, Castalia, Whitehaven, Tulane, and Westwood. According to Shipp, \u201cT-Money,\u201d who lived in Chicago, was the \u201chead guy over the whole entire city\u201d of Memphis. Kevin Foley, also known as \u201cKaos,\u201d was the number two person over the entire city. However, because \u201cT-Money\u201d was out of town, \u201cKaos was like the governor\u201d over Memphis. According to Shipp, the defendant was from the Mitchell Heights section of the gang and \u201cat that particular time he was a active chief of security over the entire city of Memphis.\u201d As such, the defendant ranked just below Kaos, and because T-Money was out of town, the defendant effectively ranked second in the Memphis Gangster Disciples. As chief of security for Memphis, the defendant ensured that all section security chiefs were organized and gave orders when Kaos was not around to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Shipp and Phillips followed the chain of command when calling the aid and assist meeting on April 30, 1997, calling first Kaos then the defendant. After these calls were made, forty to eighty Gangster Disciples from all over Memphis arrived at the apartment, and many of them were armed with handguns. After their arrival, Phillips ordered James Lee White Curra-dme and another person upstairs to prevent the Black sisters from coming downstairs or leaving the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Kaos arrived at the apartment about 9:30 or 9:45 p.m. The defendant arrived shortly thereafter and immediately asked Shipp, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t your guys on point?\u201d Shipp said the defendant meant, \u2018Why aren\u2019t your guys on security, watching out, looking?\u201d The defendant directed Shipp, as \u201cthe security of Hurt Village\u201d to determine the identity of the \u201cguy peeping around the corner.\u201d After escorting the defendant inside the apartment, Shipp left to determine the identity of the person. When Shipp returned a short time later and advised the defendant that the person was Vernon Green, the defendant inquired, \u201cWho is Vernon Green?\u201d Phillips and others \u201cstarted screaming\u201d that Green was a Vice Lord. The defendant then ordered Shipp and five other gang members to place Green under \u201cGD arrest.\u201d According to Shipp, the defendant meant gang members were to detain and hold Green against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">After locating Green, Shipp told Green \u201cmy brothers, the Gangster Disciples, wanted to speak with him,\u201d and escorted Green inside the apartment. After directing Green into the dining room, the defendant asked Green if he was a Vice Lord. When Green replied,\u201dno,\u201d the defendant asked Green if he knew where the Vice Lords were located. When Green again replied \u201cno,\u201d the defendant, Phillips, and Wilkins began punching, hitting, and physically abusing Green. After Green fell to the ground, Shipp asked the others gang members to \u201chold up\u201d on beating Green. Shipp then assured Green \u201cwe weren\u2019t going to do nothing to him, we just wanted to know\u201d the location of the Vice Lords. Green then said the Vice Lords were at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>particular location, so the defendant ordered Shipp, and five other gang members to verify Green\u2019s information. About halfway to this location, Shipp and the others met a woman \u201cwho considered herself a sister of the Gangster Disciples.\u201d She told them the Vice Lords were \u201crunning down Danny Thomas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Shipp and the others returned to the apartment, and when they arrived, the victim was sitting in a corner, away from the couch. According to Shipp, Green had been forced to sit in the corner because Green \u201chad defecated on himself.\u201d Shipp and other gang members ridiculed Green for doing so. After learning the Vice Lords had not been at the location Green provided, the defendant ordered Sepacus Triplett and another gang member to take Green upstairs. Shipp went upstairs as well and saw Green lying on the floor of a bedroom with gang members standing around him pointing guns at his head and threatening to kill him. Shipp said the Black sisters were in another upstairs bedroom with a box springs mattress across the door to prevent their departure. When Shipp heard loud music and returned downstairs, Phillips and the defendant were selecting gang members and instructing them to form a circle. Phillips \u201ctold James to get in the center of the circle.\u201d Shipp said Phillips was in charge of the situation, but the defendant was advising on the proper procedure because Phillips had never before \u201cput a brother in violation.\u201d When asked which of the two had the higher rank, Shipp replied: \u201cBasically, you\u2019ll say Gregory Robinson.\u201d However, Shipp qualified his reply by pointing out that these events occurred in Hurt Village, Phillips\u2019s \u201cturf.\u201d Shipp agreed that the Gangster Disciples are structured somewhat like the United States, with a national leader and local leaders.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">After James moved to the center of the circle, the defendant and Phillips announced James had \u201csix minutes six seconds, no cover up,\u201d meaning James would be beaten for six minutes and six seconds by six people.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gangster Disciples referred to this punishment as \u201ca pumpkin head.\u201d According to Shipp, James was placed in \u201cretirement\u201d or \u201con hold\u201d for six months and told not to consider himself a Gangster Disciple. Phillips and another individual, whom Shipp did not know, then escorted James out of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">After James left, Shipp told \u201cthe guys to bring [Green] downstairs.\u201d Green arrived downstairs with a t-shirt over his head to obstruct his sight and to restrict his hands so that he could not break away or defend himself. Shipp testified that the defendant, Phillips, and Wilkins each individually spoke to Kaos on a cellular telephone, during \u201cone long continuous conversation.\u201d Shipp reported that after hanging up, \u201c[t]hey said Kaos said, \u2018take him fishing.\u2019 \u201d Shipp, who was not a part of the conversation with Kaos, understood this meant they were to \u201ctake [Green] way out somewhere out of the district, rough him up a little bit by physical abuse, and let him get back the best way he could.\u201d Shipp then heard the defendant direct Phillips and Wilkins to select six men to take Green to a destination. Wilkins picked Antonio Jackson, a man known as \u201cParis,\u201d and another individual Shipp did not know. Phillips selected Shipp, Charles Poole, and a man known as \u201cMacEndo.\u201d Shipp testified that Wilkins, Jackson, Paris, and MacEndo were from Mitchell Heights. Shipp was from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Hurt Village, and Charles Poole was from Scutterfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Wilkins left with the six men selected, and Phillips remained at the apartment. The men drove in two separate cars to Bellevue Park. When Green pulled the shirt from his eyes and realized he was in a dark area, he began pleading with them, saying numerous times, \u201cjust let me go, man, I\u2019m not going to say nothing, please, just let me go.\u201d Shipp, Paris, Poole, and MacEndo physically carried Green to the top of a hill and dropped him onto the ground. Wilkins \u201csuggested\u201d the other men stand a few feet away from Green. Shipp testified that although Wilkins was not superior in rank to the defendant, Wilkins was the \u201cbig head\u201d who was giving directions at the park. Wilkins kicked Green in the side and asked Green if he had any last words. Shipp then heard a gun being cocked and saw Jackson fire the gun. Green was lying face down, and bullets struck his lower back and buttocks. Green began gasping for breath and saying that he had been hit, that he was dead, and that he was not going to say anything. When Jackson remarked to Wilkins that the buckshot were not affecting Green, Wilkins asked Paris for his chrome plated automatic pistol. Wilkins handed the pistol to Jackson, who shot Green in the head. The gun jammed, but Jackson adjusted it and fired again. The gang members then fled the scene and later met at a gas station on South Parkway, where Wilkins advised them to \u201ctake the streets, act normal.\u201d Wilkins gave them marijuana to \u201ccalm us down.\u201d They met again at an apartment in the Mitchell Heights area. Shipp later learned this apartment belonged to \u201cFufu\u201d \u2014 Charles Golden.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Two days after the murder, Phillips told Shipp to take a \u201csix day vacation.\u201d Phillips called the defendant, and the defendant arrived and drove Shipp, his \u201cbaby\u2019s mother\u201d and his children to a local motel. The defendant told Shipp not to answer his pager or use the telephone. However, Shipp answered a page from Phillips and learned that the police were looking for him. Shipp then paged the defendant, who immediately returned Shipp\u2019s call but reprimanded Shipp for being \u201ca knucklehead\u201d who disobeyed orders not to use the telephone or answer his pager. After again telling Shipp not to answer the telephone or respond to his pager, the defendant assured Shipp that he, or \u201cother brothers,\u201d would be dropping by to check on Shipp. Three days later, the defendant sent \u201ca guy by the name of Crenshaw and two more younger guys\u201d to pick up Shipp and his family at the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">At the conclusion of his direct examination testimony, Shipp claimed that he had been threatened by Gangster Disciples for being a \u201csnitch\u201d and explained that he had sought protective custody because he feared he would be unable to survive in the general jail population, which included many Gangster Disciples. Shipp declared he had given truthful testimony and denied the State had offered any deals, promises, or representations in exchange for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">On cross-examination, Shipp admitted that he had given a lengthy statement to the police on May 27, 1997, and had not once mentioned the defendant\u2019s name, even though he had mentioned numerous Gangster Disciples, including Kaos, Phillips, Jackson, and Wilkins. Shipp admitted he had identified numerous Gangster Disciples when shown photographic arrays, including Kaos, Phillips, Wilkins, Jackson, Carradine, Golden, \u201cSmash,\u201d Anthony, Johnny, and Sepacus Triplett, but had failed to identify the defendant when given the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Although Shipp indicated in his May 27, 1997, statement that Kaos was the gover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>nor of Memphis, contrary to his trial testimony, in this same statement Shipp claimed that Wilkins, from the Mitchell Heights area, was the chief of security for North Memphis, that Phillips outranked Wilkins, and that Jackson was chief of security of Scutterfield. Furthermore, in his May 27, 1997, statement Shipp indicated that Phillips, not the defendant, instructed him to arrest Vernon Green; that Phillips, not the defendant, beat the victim; that Phillips, not the defendant, instructed gang members to take Green upstairs after he had been beaten; and that Phillips, not the defendant, decided Green\u2019s fate because Phillips and others assumed Green would \u201cput the law in [Phillips\u2019s] business or [Green] would get the Vice Lords to retaliate against us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">On cross-examination, Shipp admitted that Shaun Washington, a Gangster Disciple from Mitchell Heights, had been present at the apartment on April 30, 1997, although he had failed to mention Shaun Washington in his May 27,1997, statement to the police or in his direct testimony. Shipp testified that some Gangster Disciples have gold teeth, that the Gangster Disciple symbols include the six-point star, the pitchfork, the heart with wings, a crown, a \u201cdevil tail,\u201d and the world with a sword piercing it. Shipp claimed that he had never heard the phrase \u201ctake him fishing\u201d before April 30,1997, but he maintained he had believed the phrase meant they were to drive away and leave Green to make his own way home. Shipp admitted there had been no discussion at the park about whether or not they were to kill Green. Shipp also admitted that he had been acquainted with Green because he had dated Green\u2019s sister. Shipp conceded that he had been charged with first degree murder after giving the May 27, 1997, statement, and that the prosecution had filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty. When asked if he expected any consideration from the prosecution in exchange for his testimony, Shipp responded, \u2018Tes, because the simple fact I\u2019m facing the death penalty.\u201d When asked to clarify, Shipp stated, \u201cIf it\u2019s in the progress. If it\u2019s in the will.\u201d When defense counsel commented, \u2018Tou\u2019re not up here testifying for your health, are you, sir?\u201d Shipp responded, \u201cI\u2019m up here testifying to tell the truth on my behalf and on behalf of the victim\u2019s family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">On re-direct examination, Shipp confirmed that he had identified only one Gangster Disciple, Kaos, who outranked the defendant, and Shipp said he did so because \u201cKaos had told on\u201d him. Shipp pointed out that the defendant, not Kaos, had taken him to a hotel and advised him how to protect himself. Shipp also claimed he had been afraid to identify the defendant because the defendant was \u201cnot playing with a full deck.\u201d Shipp maintained he had told the truth at all times, including his May 27, 1997, statement, except for his failure to identify the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On re-cross examination Shipp emphasized that he had implicated Kaos because \u201c[e]veryone knew that Kaos was a snitch.\u201d Shipp conceded he had initially implicated and identified Phillips, even though he had testified that Phillips and the defendant were \u201ckind of on the same level\u201d in terms of authority. Shipp admitted he had never implicated the defendant prior to testifying at trial and acknowledged that he hoped to avoid the death penalty by testifying against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Also testifying for the prosecution, Dr. Thomas Deering, the forensic pathologist and assistant Shelby County medical examiner who performed Green\u2019s autopsy, explained that Green had a shotgun wound and two gunshot wounds to the right side of his head, a shotgun wound across his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>upper back, and a shotgun wound to his left buttock. The shotgun wound to the right side of Green\u2019s head lacerated his brain and fractured the base of his skull and would have itself been fatal. Gunshot wound B, near Green\u2019s right temple, also fractured Green\u2019s skull and struck his brain and was alone \u201ca severe if not fatal wound.\u201d Gunshot wound C began at Green\u2019s right temple, fractured his skull, broke his jawbone on the right, traveled through the back part of his tongue, and injured muscles in the right side of his neck. The shotgun wound to Green\u2019s upper back caused superficial scraping and would not have produced death in and of itself, although it would have been painful. The shotgun wound to Green\u2019s left buttock fractured the lower part of his back bone and his coccyx and also lacerated his rectum and bladder. Dr. Deering opined that the victim was alive when the various wounds were inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"AI-b\">Dr. Deering cleaned and reconstructed the victim\u2019s skull to determine the order of the gunshot wounds. After examining the reconstructed skull and considering the level of bleeding at each wound, Dr. Deer-ing determined that the shotgun wound to the right side of Green\u2019s head was inflicted first, that gunshot wound B was inflicted second, and gunshot wound C was next inflicted, in almost the same location as gunshot wound B. Although he could not determine if the shotgun wounds to Green\u2019s back and buttocks preceded the wounds to his head, Dr. Deering testified that the shotgun wound to Green\u2019s buttocks had a great deal of associated bleeding and would have been quite painful. Given the minimal associated bleeding, Dr. Deering opined that Green had very little blood pressure and was \u201cin trouble\u201d at the time Green was shot in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Deering agreed that he had reported no physical evidence of a severe beating. On redirect, Dr. Deering acknowledged that Green\u2019s head was so severely damaged by the gunshot wounds that physical evidence of any beating about Green\u2019s head may not have been visible. Nonetheless, on re-eross-ex-amination, Dr. Deering admitted that \u201can average-sized guy\u201d striking \u201chard blows with a closed fist\u201d to a person\u2019s head would result in visible injuries. The prosecution then rested its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Testifying first for the defense, James Lee White Carradine, known as \u201cThug Life,\u201d admitted he had been present at the Hurt Village apartment on the evening Green was kidnapped and murdered. Carradine maintained, however, that he and Isiah Triplett had remained upstairs with the Black sisters for most of the evening. Although Carradine identified several Gangster Disciples who were at Hurt Village apartment, he maintained the defendant had not been present at the apartment. Carradine said he first met the defendant at the Shelby County jail and did not know whether the defendant was a Gangster Disciple.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Carradine explained that, although a man known variously as \u201cGreg,\u201d \u201cMacGreg,\u201d or \u201cRed Greg,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had been present at the apartment in Hurt Village on the evening of Green\u2019s murder, the defendant was not that man. As to MacGreg\u2019s rank, Carradine stated, \u201cI\u2019m just not familiar. You know, he had top rank.\u201d Nonetheless, Carradine maintained that Phillips outranked \u201cthat MacGreg\u201d and that \u201cKaos was the dude that was over all of it.\u201d Carradine said the person he knew as MacGreg had been present at the apartment and armed with a gun. He described MacGreg as bald, with a light mustache, very light complect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>ed, about 5'6\" or 5'7\" in height, with \u201ca bunch of tattoos,\u201d and \u201ctwelve gold in his mouth,\u201d a \u201csix-point star in the web of his hand,\u201d tattoos on his neck, body, and arms, including a \u201cGD\u201d tattoo, a \u201cMacGreg\u201d tattoo on his right forearm, and a \u201cto the world blow\u201d tattoo on his left arm. Carra-dine confirmed that he had told the police in a May 9, 1997, statement that MacGreg was chief of security and was know as the \u201cExecutioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On cross-examination, the prosecution pointed out that Carradine had testified similarly at Kevin Wilkins\u2019s trial, stating that he knew a person known as \u201cBig Folk\u201d but that Kevin Wilkins was not that person. Carradine reluctantly admitted he had been a Gangster Disciple but maintained that he had no leadership role or rank within the gang. While Carradine denied participating in the physical assault on Green, he recalled seeing the victim kneeling beside the staircase, with Shipp and six others standing around him. Car-radine explained that Phillips, along with the men he knew as MacGreg and Big Folk, were \u201cstanding behind the six dudes that were around Vernon,\u201d talking on the telephone. Carradine recalled Shipp had been walking between the two groups. After Green was moved to an upstairs bedroom, Carradine heard someone telling Green \u201cto shut up before he got killed then.\u201d Carradine confirmed that Phillips was the Hurt Village coordinator and Shipp the Hurt Village chief of security and said that MacGreg ranked \u201csomewhere around\u201d two or three in the Memphis Gangster Disciples.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">After Carradine testified, the defendant displayed his person to the jury. The record reflects he had no tattoos on his chest, neck, or back, no \u201cMacGreg\u201d or \u201cGreg\u201d tattoo on his right arm, no star tattoos on his hands, and no tattoo of \u201cto the world blow\u201d on his left arm. The record also reflects that the defendant had on his left arm a tattoo of \u201ctwo heart\u2019s intertwined with each other, one with the name Sardie, one with the name Samantha.\u201d Also tattooed on his left arm was the word \u201cRed.\u201d A tattoo on the defendant\u2019s right arm was described as following in the record; \u201ca number one with what appears to be a brick of a wall with Mom and Annie on it.\u201d Finally, the record reflects that the defendant had six gold teeth on the bottom and four gold teeth on the top, for a total of ten. The letters \u201cG\u201d \u201cR\u201d \u201cE\u201d \u201cG\u201d appeared on his four top gold teeth. The record reflects there were no stars or \u201cpitch forks or anything else on the teeth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Annie Robinson, the defendant\u2019s mother, along with Nichole Robinson and Patricia Anne Robinson, two of the defendant\u2019s sisters, testified that the defendant never had tattoos or gold teeth as described by Car-radine. The defendant\u2019s mother, along with the defendant\u2019s friends, Danny Williams and Ronald Dowell, testified that the defendant had never been a gang member.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">While admitting he had been at the Hurt Village apartment on April 30, 1997, Sepa-cus Triplett nonetheless denied being a member of the Gangster Disciples. However, Phillips directed Triplett to \u201ccontrol the door,\u201d so Triplett had answered the door for \u201ceverybody\u201d and knew \u201cwho came in and who didn\u2019t come in.\u201d Triplett said he had not seen the defendant at the apartment and believed Phillips was \u201cin charge.\u201d On cross-examination, Sepacus Triplett admitted he had lied to the police in a statement given on May 8, 1997, and that he had pleaded guilty to facilitation in connection with Green\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">Frederico Mason testified that, although he was not a member of the Gangster Disciples, he had been present at the apartment on April 30, 1997. Mason had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>seen a man known as \u201cMacGreg\u201d a \u201ccouple of times at Hurt Village,\u201d but Mason did not know if MacGreg was a Gangster Disciple. Mason maintained the defendant and MacGreg were not the same man. Mason did not see the defendant at the apartment on April 30, 1997, had never seen the defendant at the Hurt Village complex, and had first seen the defendant when shown a picture by a police detective. Mason did not know if MacGreg had been at Nichole Black\u2019s apartment on April 30, 1997, because he was \u201cgoing upstairs and downstairs.\u201d Mason knew Kaos but said he did not know if Kaos had been at the apartment on April 30, 1997, but Mason had seen Phillips and Shipp discussing Green\u2019s fate. When asked if he saw anyone else, Mason replied, \u201cLike I said, them the only peoples that I just knew, you know.\u201d On cross-examination, Mason admitted he left the apartment at approximately 10 p.m. and did not return until approximately 3 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Steven Hardin testified also and admitted he had pleaded guilty to facilitation to especially aggravated kidnapping in connection with Green\u2019s kidnapping and murder. Hardin arrived at the apartment between 5:30 and 6 p.m. on April 30, 1997. Hardin said Shipp called the aid and assist meeting and many people arrived whom Hardin had never before seen. Hardin \u201cvaguely\u201d remembered some of the people who arrived for the meeting, and in particular, he remembered a man known as MacGreg being there that night. Hardin said MacGreg had tattoos on his hand, arms, neck, and shoulder and had a nicely trimmed \u201cblondish beard.\u201d Hardin maintained the defendant was not \u201cMacGreg,\u201d and said at no time during the evening did Hardin observe the defendant at the apartment. Hardin admitted that he had been \u201ctold to go upstairs by Prentiss Phillips and lookout the window and inform them\u201d if anyone, the police, the Vice Lords, \u201cwhoever tried to come up to the apartment.\u201d Hardin stayed at his upstairs lookout post from 6:30 p.m. until 12 or 1 a.m. On cross-examination, Hardin admitted that, after pleading guilty, he had feared revenge from other Gangster Disciples incarcerated with him and acknowledged that his incarceration with other gang members was a frightening situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">April Black testified that, on the evening of April 30, 1997, she was held in an upstairs bedroom at gunpoint by members of the Gangster Disciples. Black acknowledged her acquaintance and association with members of the Gangster Disciples, including Kaos, MacGreg, and Phillips. She admitted MacGreg had been at the aid and assist meeting at her apartment, but maintained the defendant is not MacGreg. Black admitted she was serving a ten-year sentence in the Mississippi Department of Correction for armed robbery, but claimed she was not incarcerated with Gangster Disciples from Memphis. On cross-examination Black admitted her brother had been shot by Gangster Disciples in the Shelby County jail, but she denied being afraid of the gang, although admitting she was \u201cconcerned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Horace Black, April Black\u2019s brother, admitted he had been a member of the Gangster Disciples for ten years. He also admitted knowing the defendant from jail, but said, to his knowledge, the defendant had never been a member of the Gangster Disciples. Horace Black said he did not know Kaos, despite being a gang member for ten years. On cross-examination, Horace Black admitted that he previously had been convicted of possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, and aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Sergeant Richard Parker, a Memphis police officer who had been assigned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Gang Task Force for five years, testified for the defense about gang tattoos. Sergeant Parker described the readily identifiable tattoos often used by Gangster Disciples. He stated the defendant\u2019s tattoos could \u201cpossibly\u201d be gang tattoos, but he could not readily identify them as such. He indicated the letter \u201cE\u201d of the defendant\u2019s \u201cRED\u201d tattoo resembled a Gangster Disciple trademark, \u201calthough it was missing the post under it.\u201d He further noted that gang members often \u201ccamouflage\u201d their tattoos, and he pointed out that tattoos can be easily changed. Sergeant Parker indicated that gang members had begun to eschew tattoos to avoid detection and explained that gold teeth, common among Gangster Disciples, can be removed and changed. Defense counsel pointed out that when he initially showed Sergeant Parker photographs of the defendant\u2019s tattoos, Sergeant Parker opined that the defendant\u2019s tattoos were not gang-related. After speaking with the prosecuting attorneys in the hall outside the courtroom, Sergeant Parker \u201ccame to the conclusion that the tattoos could possibly be gang-related.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Based upon this proof, the jury convicted the defendant of premeditated first degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping, finding the defendant criminally responsible for the conduct of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The trial proceeded to the penalty phase. To establish the two aggravating circumstances \u2014 the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death and the murder was committed during a kidnapping<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 the prosecution relied upon the proof presented during the guilt phase of the trial and re-called Sergeant Peppers to the stand. Sergeant Peppers identified a photograph of the victim\u2019s body as it appeared when discovered in Jessie Turner Park on the morning of May 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">A friend of the defendant, his mother, and two of his sisters testified in mitigation. They described him as a \u201cloving father\u201d of seven children, ranging in age from one to six years old, a member of a large, close-knit family, a concerned and caring brother to his five sisters, and the youngest of his mother\u2019s six children and her only son. He attended church. Although he had no steady job, the defendant had been trained as a welder. Both the defendant\u2019s mother, and Debra McNeese, a mitigation specialist with Probation Management Group, testified that the defendant had a learning disability and had dropped out of school in the ninth grade. After leaving school, the defendant worked with his father at Eagle Iron Work. Testifying in his own behalf, the defendant asked the jury to spare his life so that he could see his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">Upon finding that the prosecution had proven both aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury imposed a sentence of death. The defendant appealed, and the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death. The State thereafter filed an application for permission to appeal. For the following reasons, we disagree with the Court of Criminal Appeals and reinstate and affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\n<em>II. Failure to Instruct on Lesser-included Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The Court of Criminal Appeals held that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on facilitation and solicitation of first degree premeditated murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. The Court of Criminal Appeals therefore reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions and remanded to the trial court for a new trial. In this Court, the State concedes that, under the circumstances of this case and the test enunciated in <em>State v. Burns, </em>6 S.W.3d 453, 466-67 (Tenn.1999), facilitation and solicitation are lesser-included offenses of first degree premeditated murder. Nonetheless, the State maintains that the evidence in this case did not justify a jury instruction on either of these lesser-included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In <em>State v. Burns, </em>6 S.W.3d at 466-67, this Court explained that an offense is lesser-included if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">(a) all of its statutory elements are included within the statutory elements of the offense charged; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(b) it fails to meet the definition in part (a) only in the respect that it contains a statutory element or elements establishing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">(1) a different mental state indicating a lesser kind of culpability; and/or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-9\">(2) a less serious harm or risk of harm to the same person, property or public interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-10\">(c) it consists of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-11\">(1) facilitation of the offense charged or of an offense that otherwise meets the definition of lesser-included offense in part (a) or (b); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-13\">(2) solicitation to commit the offense charged or an offense that otherwise meets the definition of lesser-included offense in part (a) or (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">\u201cWhether or not a particular lesser-included offense should be charged to the jury depends on whether proof in the record would support the lesser charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468. This Court has adopted a two-step inquiry for determining if the evidence justifies a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense. The trial court must first determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-15\">whether any evidence exists that reasonable minds could accept as to the lesser-included offense. In making this determination, the trial court must view the evidence liberally in the light most favorable to the existence of the lesser-included offense without making any judgments on the credibility of such evidence. Second, the trial court must determine if the evidence, viewed in this light, is legally sufficient to support a conviction for the lesser-included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-16\"><em>Id., </em>at 469. Whether an instruction is required depends upon the evidence, not the theory of the defense or the State. <em>State v. Allen, </em>69 S.W.3d 181, 188 (Tenn.2002); <em>State v. Richmond, </em>90 S.W.3d 648, 660 (Tenn.2002). Applying these principles, we conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on solicitation and facilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">A. Solicitation</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">A person may be convicted of solicitation if that person \u201cby means of oral, written or electronic communication, directly or through another, intentionally commands, requests or hires another to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>commit a criminal offense ... with the intent that the criminal offense be committed .... \u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-12-102(a) (1997). Part (c) of the <em>Bums </em>test, which makes solicitation a lesser-included offense, applies \u201cto situations in which a defendant attempts to commit, or solicits another to commit, either the crime charged or a lesser-included offense, but no proof exists of the completion of the crime.\u201d <em>State v. Ely, </em>48 S.W.3d 710, 719 (Tenn.2001); <em>See also State v. Marcum, </em>109 S.W.3d 300, 303-04 (Tenn.2003) (quoting this principle and holding that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct on attempted rape where the evidence did not support an attempt but instead supported only the completed offense of rape or the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence). As in <em>Marcum, </em>in this case, the evidence unmistakably established either the completed offenses of murder and especially aggravated kidnapping or the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence. Consequently, the trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on solicitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">B. Facilitation</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Part (c)(1) of the <em>Bums </em>test clearly designates facilitation a lesser-included offense of the charged offense. <em>Burns, </em>6 S.W.3d at 467. Thus, facilitation is a lesser-included offense of premeditated murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. Having determined that facilitation is a lesser-included offense, we must next determine whether the evidence in this case warranted an instruction on facilitation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At6\">Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-ll-403(a) (1997), defines \u201cfacilitation\u201d as follows: A person is criminally responsible for the facilitation of a felony if, <em>knowing that another intends to commit a specific felony, but without the intent required for criminal responsibility under \u00a7 39-11-4.02(2), </em>the person <em>knowingly furnishes substantial assistance </em>in the commission of the felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">(Emphasis added.) Criminal responsibility requires \u201cthe intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 39-11-402 (1997). Significantly, facilitation requires the lack of criminal responsibility intent. Thus, for a reasonable jury to find the defendant guilty of facilitation of first degree premeditated murder or especially aggravated kidnapping, the jury would have to conclude that the defendant, while <em>lacking </em>the intent to promote or assist the commission of either offense, knowingly furnished substantial assistance in the commission of premeditated murder and especially aggravated kidnapping. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 39-11-403(a) (1997). This record contains no evidence that reasonable minds could accept to support these conclusions. As recounted in great detail above, with respect to premeditated murder, the evidence reasonably supports only one of the following conclusions: (1) Robinson was not present at the apartment, was not involved in Green\u2019s murder or the Gangster Disciples, and therefore is completely innocent; (2) Robinson is innocent because, while he gave orders, he did not order anyone to kill or kidnap Green; or (3) Robinson is guilty by criminal responsibility because he ordered other gang members to kidnap and kill Green. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the existence of the lesser-included offense, the evidence does not support the notion that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>dant merely furnished substantial assistance in the commission of premeditated first degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping, without intending to promote or assist the commission of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The Court of Criminal Appeals opined that the \u201cknowingly furnishes substantial assistance\u201d element of facilitation of first degree murder was supported by proof that the defendant ordered others to take Green to a secluded location. However, as the State points out, the evidence indicates that the defendant told other gang members to take the victim \u201cfishing.\u201d Shipp testified that he had never before heard that instruction but believed it meant gang members were to take the victim \u201cway out somewhere out of the district, rough him up a little bit by physical abuse, and let him get back the best way he could.\u201d Accepting this view of the proof, no reasonable juror could have found that the defendant knowingly furnished substantial assistance in the commission of the murder. Indeed, under this view of the proof, Green\u2019s murder directly violated the defendant\u2019s instruction. It simply defies logic to conclude that the defendant, while not intending to aid or promote Green\u2019s murder, nevertheless ordered other gang members to take Green \u201cout of the district, rough him up a little bit by physical abuse, and let him get back the best way he could,\u201d knowing all along that these gang members intended to kill Green. Simply put, no reasonable jury could have concluded from the evidence presented that the defendant had the knowledge required for facilitation but lacked the intent required for criminal responsibility. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on facilitation to commit premeditated murder. <em>See Ely, </em>48 S.W.3d at 724 (holding that the trial court did not err by failing to instruct facilitation as no reasonable jury could believe that, although the defendant was present at the scene of the robbery, knew that the accomplice intended to commit robbery, and substantially assisted in the commission of the robbery, he \u201cnevertheless did not intend \u2018to promote or assist the commission of the offense ...\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bums, </em>6 S.W.3d at 471 (holding that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on facilitation because no reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant had the knowledge required for facilitation but lacked the intent required for criminal responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">As to facilitation to commit especially aggravated kidnapping, the Court of Criminal Appeals explained that, although the proof established the defendant\u2019s direct participation in initially kidnapping and beating Green at the apartment, a jury could have concluded that the defendant did not intend the kidnapping be especially aggravated when he ordered gang members to take Green \u201cfishing.\u201d Again, as explained above, from the evidence presented, no reasonable jury could have concluded that the defendant had the knowledge required for facilitation but lacked the intent required for criminal responsibility to commit especially aggravated kidnapping. Given the proof presented, the defendant was either guilty by virtue of criminal responsibility or he was innocent. Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on facilitation of especially aggravated kidnapping. The Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision setting aside the defendant\u2019s convictions and remanding for a new trial therefore is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\n<em>III. Jarvis Shipp Accomplice Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The defendant asserts that the trial court erred by instructing the jury they were to determine as a question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>fact whether or not Jarvis Shipp was an accomplice to the crime. The State asserts the defendant waived this issue by failing to object to the charge given the jury. Alternatively, the State argues that any error was harmless because Shipp\u2019s testimony was corroborated abundantly by James\u2019s testimony and other evidence, as the Court of Criminal Appeals found.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">When the facts concerning a witness\u2019s participation are clear and undisputed, the trial court determines as a matter of law whether the witness is an accomplice. <em>Ripley v. State, </em>189 Tenn. 681, 687, 227 S.W.2d 26, 29 (1950); <em>State v. Perkinson, </em>867 S.W.2d 1, 7 (Tenn.Crim.App.1992). If the facts are disputed or susceptible to different inferences, the jury must decide as a question of fact whether the witness is an accomplice. <em>Perkinson, </em>867 S.W.2d at 7. The test generally applied is whether the witness could be indicted for the same offense charged against the defendant. <em>Monts v. State, </em>214 Tenn. 171, 191, 379 S.W.2d 34, 43 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In this case, the facts were not disputed, and the trial court should have instructed the jury to consider Shipp an accomplice as a matter of law. However, the defendant failed to object to the trial court\u2019s instruction and thus waived the issue. Furthermore, even considering the merits of the issue, the error is harmless because James\u2019s testimony and Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony sufficiently corroborated Shipp\u2019s description of the events so that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict of first degree murder. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\n<em>IV. Display of Skull and Admission of Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The State next challenges the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the trial court erred both in allowing the forensic pathologist to use the victim\u2019s cleaned and reconstructed skull when testifying about the victim\u2019s injuries and in admitting into evidence certain photographs depicting the victim\u2019s body. While the State concedes that the Court of Criminal Appeals recited the correct standard of appellate review, the State nonetheless maintains that the Court of Criminal Appeals failed to apply the correct standard. According to the State, rather than determining whether the trial court abused its discretion, the intermediate appellate court independently assessed the propriety of using the skull at trial before concluding there was <em>\u201cno </em>need for its introduction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State also relies upon several cases in which this Court rejected defense challenges to the admission of a victim\u2019s skull during a murder trial. <em>See, e.g., State v. Pike, </em>978 S.W.2d 904, 925 (Tenn.1998); <em>State v. Cazes, </em>875 S.W.2d 253, 263 (Tenn.1994); <em>State v. King, </em>718 S.W.2d 241, 250-51 (Tenn.1986); <em>State v. Morris, </em>641 S.W.2d 883, 888 (Tenn.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">In response, Robinson argues that this Court\u2019s prior decisions are not controlling because, unlike the defendants in those cases, he was charged with premeditated first degree murder by criminal responsibility and was not accused of actually inflicting the fatal injuries upon the victim. Furthermore, the defendant argues that Dr. Deering\u2019s thorough and clear testimony regarding the victim\u2019s injuries rendered the skull\u2019s use unnecessary. Although Robinson admits that Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony and use of the skull to explain the order of the gunshots corroborated Shipp\u2019s testimony, the defendant nonetheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>maintains that the skull was not relevant to \u201cany disputed issue in the guilt phase\u201d of his trial. The defendant argues that, in light of the great danger of unfair prejudice, the trial court erred by allowing Dr. Deering to testify and display the skull during his testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Admission of evidence is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, and a trial court\u2019s ruling on evidence will be disturbed only upon a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. DuBose, </em>953 S.W.2d 649, 652 (Tenn.1997). A trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will not be reversed on appeal unless the court \u201capplied an incorrect legal standard, or reached a decision which is against logic or reasoning that caused an injustice to the party complaining.\u201d <em>State v. Shuck, </em>953 S.W.2d 662, 669 (Tenn.1997). When determining admissibility, a trial court must first decide if the evidence is relevant. Tenn. R. Evid. 402 (\u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible except as provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of Tennessee, these rules or other rules or laws of general application in the courts of Tennessee. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d); <em>State v. James, </em>81 S.W.3d 751, 757 (Tenn.2002). Evidence \u201chaving any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d is relevant evidence. Tenn. R. Evid. 401. After a court concludes evidence is relevant, the court must then weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger the evidence will unfairly prejudice the defendant at trial. Relevant evidence should be excluded if the court determines that the probative value of the evidence \u201cis <em>substantially </em>outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Tenn. R. Evid. 403 (emphasis added). This Court previously has emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">Rule 403 is a rule of admissibility, and it places a heavy burden on the party seeking to exclude the evidence. Ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>eluding relevant evidence under this rule is an extraordinary remedy that should be used sparingly and persons seeking to exclude otherwise admissible and relevant evidence have a significant burden of persuasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\"><em>James, </em>81 S.W.3d at 757-58 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing Dr. Deering to testify and display the skull to explain his testimony. Indeed, nothing in this record indicates that the trial court \u201capplied an incorrect legal standard, or reached a decision which is against logic or reasoning that caused an injustice to the party complaining.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In a jury-out hearing the trial court carefully considered the defense objections, correctly summarized governing law regarding the prosecution\u2019s right to prove its case, and accurately concluded that this right may not be foreclosed by a defendant\u2019s characterization of the proof as undisputed or by a defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate or concede certain factual issues. <em>See James, </em>81 S.W.3d at 761; <em>State v. West, </em>767 S.W.2d 387, 394 (Tenn.1989) (holding that the trial judge did not err by refusing to accept defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate the identity of all property when the defendant made the offer in an effort to eliminate highly emotional and prejudicial testimony); <em>King, </em>718 S.W.2d at 250-51 (holding that the victim\u2019s skull and skull fragments were properly admitted even though the defendant stipulated prior to trial that the victim\u2019s death resulted from a shot in the back of the head from a high-powered rifle). After acknowledging that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, the trial court specifically concluded that the probative value of Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony and his use of the skull to explain his testimony outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial court stated: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better way to display and show the injuries than by use of the actual skull. I\u2019m not sure that you could recreate that sufficient to do what I anticipate the doctor\u2019s going to do based on what I heard him do last time.\u201d Later in the proceeding while ruling upon the admissibility of certain photographs, the trial court noted that the skull was less graphic and a better aid \u201cto demonstrate the injuries\u201d than some of the photographs. Defense counsel apparently agreed with this assessment, stating, \u201c[a]nd with that skull you don\u2019t have the blood and the gore that you see in those photographs. [Dr. Deering] more than adequately demonstrated to this entire courtroom in a very academic, professional fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Furthermore, as the defendant correctly admits, Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony about the order of the gunshots corroborated Shipp\u2019s testimony. Indeed, it was Shipp\u2019s testimony about the order of the gunshots that Dr. Deering used the skull to clarify and explain. Such corroborating evidence clearly was relevant because it was necessary to the prosecution\u2019s case. This Court repeatedly has held that a conviction may not be based solely upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice to the offense. <em>See State v. Bane, </em>57 S.W.3d 411, 419 (Tenn.2001); <em>State v. Stout, </em>46 S.W.3d 689, 696-97 (Tenn.2001); <em>State v. Bigbee, </em>885 S.W.2d 797, 803 (Tenn.1994). Evidence corroborating an accomplice\u2019s testimony, such as Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony, therefore certainly qualifies as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable.\u201d Tenn. R. Evid. 401. The defendant bore the heavy burden of establishing that the danger of unfair prejudice from Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony and use of the skull <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>substantially </em>outweighed its probative value. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the defendant failed to meet this burden. The Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision to the contrary is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The State also challenges the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the trial court erred by admitting Exhibit 10, a post-mortem photograph of the victim\u2019s right forehead. Again, admission of evidence is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, and appellate courts should not reverse a trial court\u2019s admissibility decision absent a showing of abuse of discretion. Here again, no abuse of discretion has been shown. The trial court found, and the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed, that the photograph in question, Exhibit 10, along with two other photographs, Exhibits 8 and 9,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were relevant to show premeditation, the cause of death, and the victim\u2019s location and body position, and also were necessary to illustrate the testimony of many of the state\u2019s witnesses. Immediately upon admission of the photographs, the trial court gave the jury a limiting instruction and cautioned the jury against improperly using the photographs. The trial court did not act as a rubber stamp and admit every photograph the prosecution proffered. As previously stated, the trial court excluded certain autopsy photographs, noting their admission was not necessary because Dr. Deering had been allowed to use the victim\u2019s skull as a demonstrative aid. The trial court did not apply an incorrect legal standard. Tennessee courts follow a policy of liberality in the admission of photographs in both civil and criminal cases. <em>See State v. Banks, </em>564 S.W.2d 947, 949 (Tenn.1978). Photographs of a corpse are generally admissible in murder prosecutions if they are relevant to the issues at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 950-51. The trial court\u2019s determination that the photographs were relevant to issues at trial is not illogical nor irrational and did not cause an injustice to the defendant. As the trial court found, the photographs were relevant to several issues, illustrated and supplemented the testimony of Dr. Deering, and revealed the brutality of the attack and the extent of force used against the victim. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>868 S.W.2d 561, 576 (Tenn.1993). For all these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err by admitting Exhibits 8, 9, and 10 into evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision to the contrary is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">\n<em>V. Sergeant Ashton\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2Q\">Relying upon <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), defense counsel complains that Sergeant Ashton\u2019s testimony regarding Shaun Washington\u2019s identification of the defendant constituted inadmissible hearsay that violated his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. We agree with the Court of Criminal Appeals and the trial court that the defendant elicited this hearsay evidence and cannot complain now about its introduction. When defense counsel cross-examined Sergeant Ashton about his preparation of photo spread \u201cGG,\u201d the following exchange occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">Q: And as case coordinator during your investigation are you aware of any other individuals that were interviewed that identified \u201cGG,\u201d number six, as being there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">Q: And who would that be, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>A: Right offhand I wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019d have to look at my case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">Q: Okay. Would you please \u2014 do you have that somewhere nearby?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">A: I believe I\u2019ve got a copy of it in my office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">Q: Okay. Could you go obtain that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">A: It\u2019d take me a few moments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">Q: Okay. Could you do that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">THE COURT: What are you asking Mr. Ozment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">MR. OZMENT: You honor, I\u2019m asking him to obtain whatever other identifications were made of \u201cGG\u201d six.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">The court then recessed for the evening, and when cross-examination resumed the next day, the following exchange occurred between defense counsel and Sergeant Ashton.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">Q: Sergeant Ashton, yesterday when we left off we were talking about the photo spread and the people that had identified people in the photo spread, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-14\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">Q: Particularly photo spread \u201cGG,\u201d correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-16\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-17\">Q: And the last question I left on was who else identified someone out of photo spread \u201cGG.\u201d Have you had an opportunity to check your records on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-18\">A: The best I could determine it was Christopher Lewis and Shaun Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-19\">Q: Okay. So out of all the people that \u2014 when they were shown this photo spread by officers in your department that identified Gregory Robinson during the course of your investigation the only two were Christopher James and Shaun Lewis, correct \u2014 Shaun Lewis James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-20\">A: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got in their statements, correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-21\">On re-direct, Sergeant Ashton testified that, while giving a statement on June 13, 1997, Shaun Washington looked at photographic array \u201cGG\u201d and identified the defendant as MacGreg. When asked about Washington\u2019s demeanor at the time, Sergeant Ashton responded, \u201cHe was very sure of himself.\u201d The defendant did not interpose an objection to Sergeant Ash-ton\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-22\">While the defendant may very well be correct that both <em>Crawford </em>and Tennessee Rule of Evidence Rule 803(1.1) bar hearsay statements of identification if the declarant does not testify at trial, neither <em>Crawford </em>nor Rule 803(1.1) is disposi-tive in this case because the defendant himself both elicited and opened the door to the testimony he now assigns as error. Under these circumstances, the defendant is not entitled to relief. Indeed, it is well-settled that a litigant \u201cwill not be permitted to take advantage of errors which he himself committed, or invited, or induced the trial court to commit, or which were the natural consequence of his own neglect or misconduct.\u201d <em>Norris v. Richards, </em>193 Tenn. 450, 246 S.W.2d 81, 85 (1952); <em>see also State v. Smith, </em>24 S.W.3d 274, 279-80 (Tenn.2000); Tenn. R.App. P. 36(a). Thus, the defendant is <em>not </em>entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-23\">\n<em>VI. Failure to Declare a Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-24\">The defendant further maintains that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial given the prosecutorial misconduct in presenting Nichole Black\u2019s testimony. During its rebuttal, the prosecution called Nichole Black, one of the sisters held in the apartment on the night of Vernon Green\u2019s murder. Black testified that the defendant had been in the apartment on the night in question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>On redirect examination, the prosecutor handed Black a photograph and asked if she could identify the person in the photograph. Defense counsel objected to the identification, and the trial court held a jury-out hearing. Ultimately, the trial court excluded Black\u2019s testimony and ordered it entirely stricken from the record because the prosecution had failed to inform defense counsel that Black had made a prior identification of the defendant. Although the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial, the trial court instructed the jury to disregard Black\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The decision of whether to grant or deny a motion for a mistrial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. A mistrial should be declared only upon a showing of manifest necessity. <em>State v. Saylor, </em>117 S.W.3d 239, 250-51 (Tenn.2003). \u201cIn other words, a mistrial is an appropriate remedy when a trial cannot continue, or a miscarriage of justice would result if it did.\u201d <em>State v. Land, </em>34 S.W.3d 516, 527 (Tenn.Crim.App.2000). Appellate courts should not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision denying a request for a mistrial absent a clear showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Reid, </em>91 S.W.3d 247, 279 (Tenn.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The record in this case supports the trial court\u2019s decision and demonstrates no abuse of discretion. Nichole Black testified that even though the power was out in her apartment on April 30, 1997, she had observed a man for approximately thirty seconds by the light of a small pocket pager held near her face and that the man in the photograph \u201clooked like\u201d the man she observed. Nichole Black had just previously testified that no one in the courtroom, including the defendant, was at her apartment the night of Green\u2019s abduction and murder. Viewing it as a whole, Nichole Black\u2019s testimony was uncertain and vague. The trial judge twice instructed the jury to disregard her testimony in its entirety. Jurors are presumed to follow the instructions of the court. <em>Reid, </em>91 S.W.3d at 279; <em>Stout, </em>46 S.W.3d at 715; <em>State v. Williams, </em>977 S.W.2d 101, 106 (Tenn.1998). Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant\u2019s request for a mistrial. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">\n<em>VII. Due Process Violation: Inconsistent Theories &amp; Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">In his October 2000 motion for a new trial, the defendant alleged his Due Process rights had been violated because the theory of guilt presented by the prosecution at the October 1999 trial of co-defendant Phillips was fundamentally inconsistent with and inherently contradictory to evidence and argument presented by the prosecution at his November 1998 trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial judge who presided at the various trials and plea colloquies related to this murder rejected the defendant\u2019s claim. The trial court noted that although \u201cthe evidence did not absolutely establish the identity of the leader at this meeting, there was ample evidence that the Defendant was a leader at that meeting. The fact that Prentiss Phillips, a co-defendant was also identified as a leader at this meeting does not render the finding that this Defendant was a leader invalid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">The defendant renewed his Due Process claim in the Court of Criminal Appeals. After announcing that the claim was a question of first impression in Tennessee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the Court of Criminal Appeals adopted the analysis of the United States Court of Appeals in <em>Smith v. Groose, </em>205 F.3d 1045, 1052 (8th Cir.2000). Consistent -with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s approach, the Court of Criminal Appeals explained that, in separate trials against co-defendants for the same crime, the prosecution violates Due Process by pursuing factually contradictory theories that are at the core of the prosecution\u2019s case. The intermediate appellate court explained that to obtain relief under this approach, a defendant must establish not only a \u201ccore\u201d inconsistency, but also a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent the inconsistency. Applying this test, the intermediate appellate court found that, during the separate trials of the defendant and co-defendant Phillips, the prosecution \u201cpresented some proof and arguments which were inconsistent, contradictory, and factually irreconcilable regarding the relative rank of the defendant and Phillips.\u201d The Court of Criminal Appeals nonetheless concluded that the defendant had failed to establish a reasonable likelihood that absent these prosecu-torial inconsistencies the jury\u2019s verdict in the guilt phase would have been different. However, finding a reasonable likelihood that the jury would not have imposed a sentence of death absent the inconsistencies, the Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence of death should be reversed on this ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In this Court, the State initially argues that the Court of Criminal Appeals erred in recognizing an independent Due Process bar to the prosecution\u2019s reliance and pursuit of inconsistent theories at separate trials involving the same crime. The State concedes that a prosecutor clearly deprives a defendant of Due Process by knowingly using false evidence or argument to obtain a conviction or sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, citing cases from other jurisdictions, the State points out that the law is less clear as to whether Due Process precludes a prosecutor\u2019s use of factually inconsistent or contradictory theories where there is no known falsity. <em>See, e.g., People v. Sakarias, </em>22 Cal.4th 596, 94 Cal.Rptr.2d 17, 995 P.2d 152, 174 (2000) (\u201cLess clear is whether, knowing falsity aside, a prosecutor oversteps constitutional limits by asserting, in separate trials of different defendants, factually inconsistent or contradictory theories of criminal events.\u201d) The State also maintains that this Court need not definitively clarify the law in this case because the prosecution neither pursued inconsistent theories nor presented contradictory evidence at these separate trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In contrast, the defendant argues that the Court of Criminal Appeals correctly recognized the Due Process claim, appropriately adopted the Eighth Circuit\u2019s analysis of such claims, and accurately found a Due Process violation in this case. Nonetheless, the defendant challenges the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the Due Process violation did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict at the guilt phase of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Having thoroughly reviewed the defendant\u2019s extensive trial record, the supplemental record consisting of transcripts from the separate trials or plea colloquies of co-defendants Antonio Jackson, Prentiss Phillips, Jarvis Shipp, and Kevin Wilkins, and the very lengthy appellate briefs, we are not persuaded the prosecution pursued inconsistent theories or offered contradic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>tory proof at the separate trials of these co-defendants.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">As previously detailed, the prosecution offered proof at the defendant\u2019s trial to establish that the defendant, as chief of security, ranked third in the city-wide hierarchy of the Memphis Gangster Disciples. Witnesses testified the defendant ordered other gang members to \u201csnatch up\u201d the victim, and that the defendant himself beat the victim at the apartment. Proof also showed that the defendant ordered others to take the victim upstairs and detain him. Witnesses testified that the defendant ordered Wilkins and Phillips to select gang members to take the victim \u201cfishing.\u201d But, the jury also heard proof to show that Phillips was coordinator for the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples. When asked who had the higher rank, Phillips or the defendant, Shipp indicated the defendant ranked higher, but Shipp emphasized that the murder occurred on Phillips\u2019s \u201cturf\u201d in Hurt Village and that Phillips and the defendant were \u201ckind of on the same level\u201d in terms of authority. James was not asked about the defendant\u2019s rank, did not attribute a rank to the defendant, and stated he had never seen the defendant before April 30, 1997. However, James testified that Phillips held the rank of coordinator within the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples and it was Phillips whom the victim asked to stop the assault. Moreover defense counsel emphasized through cross-examination that Shipp and other prosecution witnesses had initially given statements to the police implicating Phillips as the ranking Gangster Disciple responsible for the orders that resulted in the victim\u2019s murder. Indeed, both James and Shipp were closely questioned about their failure to initially implicate the defendant, and in particular, defense counsel emphasized that Shipp did not implicate or mention the defendant in his initial statement to the police but had instead named and implicated Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Both Shipp\u2019s and James\u2019s testimony conveyed Phillips\u2019s leadership role in Green\u2019s kidnapping and murder. Testimony indicated that Phillips announced the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples were going to retaliate against the Vice Lords and step up the violence to another level and that Phillips and Shipp called the aid and assist meeting. Testimony also showed that Phillips posted gang members as lookouts at the door of the apartment and in an upstairs bedroom, that Phillips accused the victim of being a lookout for the Vice Lords, and that the victim asked Phillips, rather than the defendant, to \u201ctell them folks to stop.\u201d Furthermore, the testimony indicated that Phillips announced James would be punished for fading to aid Shipp in the fight with the Vice Lords and selected gang members to inflict the punishment. In addition there was proof that Phillips met with the defendant and Kaos. A defense witness said he heard Phillips and Shipp discussing Green\u2019s fate; and testimony indicated that Phillips, at the defendant\u2019s direction, selected three of the gang members who removed Green from the apartment. Finally, there was testimony that Phillips escorted James home and told Shipp to take \u201ca six day vacation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">At Phillips\u2019s subsequent trial the State argued and presented evidence to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>that Phillips, as coordinator, was the ranking member of the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples, called the aid and assist meeting, and gave orders to others during the meeting. There was testimony that Phillips reported the victim was outside and that Phillips stated the victim would have to be killed. The proof showed that Phillips picked other gang members, including his number two man Shipp, to be part of the group that removed Green from the apartment and killed him. However, the proof at Phillips\u2019s trial also showed that the defendant, answering Phillips\u2019s call, attended the aid and assist meeting, ordered others to \u201csnatch up\u201d the victim, met with Phillips in the kitchen, ordered the victim taken upstairs after the victim had been beaten. The jury at Phillips\u2019s trial also heard evidence that the defendant was Kaos\u2019s chief of security with authority to carry out orders from Kaos, that the defendant ordered the victim taken from the apartment, and that the defendant and Phillips each picked three gang members to take the victim from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">As should be apparent from these brief summaries, the prosecution did not pursue inconsistent theories or present inconsistent proof at these separate trials. As the State points out, the focus in each trial was upon each defendant\u2019s culpability, but the theory remained the same. At Phillips\u2019s trial, the prosecution focused on Phillips\u2019s culpability for the kidnapping and murder, and much of this proof related to Phillips\u2019s position as coordinator of the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples. Witnesses at Phillips\u2019s trial were familiar with Phillips\u2019s coordinator rank, but had never seen the defendant before the evening of April 30, 1997. The defendant makes much of the fact that the prosecution at Phillips\u2019s trial argued that Phillips, as coordinator of the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples, had an additional reason for participating in the victim\u2019s kidnapping and murder, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">[P]art of this ... was a personal situation. This wasn\u2019t entirely a Gangster Disciple matter. It was personal. It was a personal affront to this man\u2019s ego, this man, the coordinator of Hurt Village. An altercation had happened on his turf between the Vice Lords and the Gangster Disciples and it diminished his power. And he wasn\u2019t going to stand for it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The prosecution did not make this argument at the defendant\u2019s trial. And, given that this argument was completely unrelated to the defendant, the prosecution\u2019s failure to press this argument is logical. However, this argument is entirely consistent with testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial indicating that Phillips was very upset after the skirmish with the Vice Lords and called the aid and assist meeting because he wanted to step up the violence and retaliate against the Vice Lords. Thus, from our thorough review of the record and the briefs, we conclude that the prosecution did not pursue inconsistent theories at these separate trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">By so stating, we do not intend to imply the evidence at these separate trials was identical. It was not \u2014 discrepancies exist. But these discrepancies were isolated and immaterial when taken in context and certainly do not give rise to a Due Process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">As a practical matter, discrepancies are commonly unavoidable when several individuals are prosecuted in separate trials for the same offense. Indeed, such trials present challenges because \u201cthe truth is clouded by secret and elaborate gang rituals; the use of two and three code names for gang members; and the commission of crimes by groups.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>76 S.W.3d 1, 10 (Tenn.Crim.App.2001). Furthermore, as the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals noted, \u201cevidence of criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>conspiracies hardly ever comes from ministers and civic leaders.\u201d <em>Anderson v. State, </em>354 So.2d 1156, 1159 (Ala.Cr.App.1977). This case well-illustrates that point. James and Shipp were themselves gang members, and Shipp was an accomplice to these crimes. The Court of Criminal Appeals has described James as \u201ca rather inarticulate witness who was prone to cryptic responses.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>52 S.W.3d 661, 667 (Tenn.Crim.App.2001). This description is entirely accurate. James appeared to contradict himself while testifying at both the defendant\u2019s trial and Phillips\u2019s trial, but the prosecution did not encourage him to do so. Rather, the record suggests the prosecutors were sometimes themselves surprised or confused by his answers. At the defendant\u2019s trial, James was not asked and did not ascribe a rank to the defendant but indicated that Phillips and Shipp followed the defendant\u2019s directions without hesitation. At Phillips\u2019s trial, James first said Phillips outranked the defendant but later testified the defendant, not Phillips, had been \u201ccalling the shots\u201d in the apartment. The prosecutors did not adopt this testimony to argue that Phillips outranked the defendant. Instead, the prosecution\u2019s evidence, argument, and theory focused upon Phillips\u2019s own statements and actions and upon Phillips\u2019s rank and authority as coordinator of the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">We also are not troubled, as was the Court of Criminal Appeals, by the prosecution\u2019s decision to call Shipp as a witness at the guilt phase of the defendant\u2019s trial while offering his testimony at only the sentencing phase of Phillips\u2019s trial. As previously explained, Shipp initially gave a statement to the police implicating Phillips and attributing to Phillips many of the actions h'e attributed to the defendant at the defendant\u2019s trial. Had Shipp been called by the prosecution as a witness at Phillips\u2019s trial and then provided testimony consistent with his initial statement to the police, the prosecution\u2019s proof at the separate trials would have been inconsistent. By choosing not to call Shipp during the guilt phase of Phillips\u2019s trial, and offering his testimony on a narrow point at the sentencing phase, the prosecution avoided even the potential for inconsistencies. Furthermore, unlike the Court of Criminal Appeals, we do not find the prosecution\u2019s failure to question James about the defendant\u2019s rank at the defendant\u2019s trial unusual. James testified he had never seen the defendant prior to April 30, 1997, and had been a member of the East Village Gangster Disciples only three or four months at that time. Given this testimony, the prosecution had no reason to believe James knew anything about the defendant\u2019s rank. Moreover, James illustrated his lack of knowledge or uncertainty on this issue at Phillips\u2019s trial where James testified inconsistently when questioned about the relative ranks of Phillips and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In short, the prosecution presented a consistent theory at these separate trials. The prosecution at each trial sought to establish each defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility for first degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping by showing that each defendant held a leadership position in the gang, either citywide chief of security or Hurt Village coordinator, and that, acting in his leadership role, each defendant ordered and otherwise directed gang members to kidnap and murder Vernon Green. Accordingly, we do not agree with the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s conclusion that the prosecution presented factually inconsistent theories and evidence at the defendant\u2019s and Phillips\u2019s separate trials. Reversal of the defendant\u2019s death sentence on this basis, therefore, is not warranted. The defendant\u2019s sentence of death is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\n<em>VIII. Apprendi &amp; Ring Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Having concluded that the defendant\u2019s conviction of first degree murder and sentence of death should be reinstated, we next consider the defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence should be vacated as unconstitutional because the aggravating circumstances were not charged in the indictment. As support for this claim the defendant relies upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002). This issue is without merit. <em>See State v. Berry, </em>141 S.W.3d 549 (Tenn.2004).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\n<em>IX. Mandatory Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Tennessee Code Annotated section 39-13-206(c)(l) (1997), mandates that this Court determine: (1) whether the sentence of death was imposed in any arbitrary fashion; (2) whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of statutory aggravating circumstances; (3) whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that aggravating circumstances outweigh any mitigating circumstances; and (4) whether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the nature of the crime and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">A thorough review of the record reveals that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of the aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury based imposition of the death penalty upon two aggravating circumstances: \u201cthe murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that in involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death\u201d and \u201cthe murder was knowingly committed, solicited, directed, or aided by the defendant, while the defendant had a substantial role in committing or attempting to commit ... kidnapping.\u201d <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-204(9(6), (7) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">The defendant contends that the evidence is not sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance because the aggravating circumstance may not be vicariously applied where, as here, the first degree murder conviction is based upon criminal responsibility. In determining whether the evidence supports a jury\u2019s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, the proper inquiry for an appellate court is whether, after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could have found the existence of the aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Sutiles, </em>30 S.W.3d 252, 262 (Tenn.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">In <em>Owens v. State, </em>13 S.W.3d 742, 760 (Tenn.Crim.App.1999), <em>perm. app. denied </em>(Tenn.2000), the intermediate appellate court approved vicarious application of the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance. The defendant in <em>Owens </em>hired Sidney Porterfield, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>her co-defendant, to kill her husband. Porterfield bludgeoned Owens\u2019s husband to death with a tire iron. Owens did not participate in the bludgeoning, and, as here, was not present when the assault occurred; yet the jury applied the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance to support imposition of the death penalty. Owens argued the jury had erred in applying the aggravating circumstance because she actually had not participated in the murderous assault. In rejecting this assertion, the Court of Criminal Appeals emphasized that the statutory language of the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance focuses on the nature and circumstances of the murder rather than the conduct or intent of the defendant. The intermediate appellate court opined that this Court had implicitly approved vicarious application of the aggravating circumstance in another case. <em>Owens, </em>13 S.W.3d at 761 (citing <em>State v. Blanton, </em>975 S.W.2d 269, 279-80 (Tenn.1998) (upholding the jury\u2019s finding of the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance to support death sentence on the premeditated murder convictions despite the lack of evidence indicating that the defendant inflicted the fatal blows)). Thus, the <em>Owens </em>court held that the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance can be applied to support the death penalty for a defendant, who, like Owens, did not inflict the fatal blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Applying the analysis the Court of Criminal Appeals applied in <em>Owens, </em>this Court has held that the (i)(3) aggravating circumstance may not be vicariously applied. <em>Johnson v. State </em>38 S.W.3d 52, 63 (Tenn.2001). In so holding, we emphasized that, \u201cunlike other aggravating circumstances, such as the (i)(5) aggravator, the statutory language of the (i)(3)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> aggravating circumstance\u201d focuses upon the defendant\u2019s actions and intent rather than upon the actual circumstances surrounding the killing. <em>Id. </em>Although we formally adopted the analysis of <em>Owens, </em>we expressly declined in <em>Johnson </em>to adopt the holding of <em>Owens </em>with respect to the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Vicarious application of the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance now is squarely presented. Therefore, we take this opportunity to agree with the Court of Criminal Appeals and adopt the holding of <em>Owens. </em>We hold that the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance may be vicariously applied because the statutory language focuses upon the nature and circumstances of the crime, rather than the actions, intent, and conduct of the defendant. This holding breaks no new ground. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>988 S.W.2d 145, 150 (Tenn.1999) (noting that the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance focuses upon the \u201ccircumstances of the killing\u201d and stating that \u201cwhether the defendant intended the victim\u2019s suffering is irrelevant under (i)(5)\u201d). Thus, the defendant\u2019s assertion is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Furthermore, the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of the (i)(5) aggravating circumstance. Green was \u201carrested\u201d and held at an apartment where numerous armed gang members, led by the defendant, beat and threatened him. Testimony indicated that Green asked his captors for release and relief, that he appeared very frightened, that he defecated during the ordeal and was ridiculed for doing so, and that he begged his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>captors to let him go, promising that he would not report their crimes. Witnesses indicated that Green became even more frightened upon arriving at the park where he was murdered. There, Green\u2019s captors physically carried and dropped him on the hilltop where he was murdered. Before Green was repeatedly shot in the head, Green begged for his life. Green continued to beg for his life and cry out after being shot in the buttocks and the back. Dr. Deering opined that the gunshot wounds to Green\u2019s buttocks would have been very painful. Dr. Deering also opined that the first gunshot wound to Green\u2019s head would have been fatal. In short, the evidence clearly is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that \u201cthe murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that in involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that necessary to produce death.\u201d This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Also without merit is the defendant\u2019s claim that the (i)(7) felony murder aggravating circumstance may not be applied to impose the death penalty upon a defendant who did not personally kill the victim. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-204(i)(7). This aggravating circumstance may be applied upon proof that \u201cthe murder was knowingly committed, solicited, directed, or aided by the defendant, while the defendant had a substantial role in committing or attempting to commit ... kidnapping.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at (5), (7). The proof in this record clearly is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that Green\u2019s murder was knowingly directed by the defendant while the defendant had a substantial role in committing Green\u2019s kidnapping. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Furthermore, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s determination that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Additionally, there is no indication that the sentence of death was imposed in an arbitrary fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">We must next conduct a comparative proportionality review. Addressing this issue, the Court of Criminal Appeals held the death sentence disproportionate.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. Statutory comparative proportionality review is an additional safeguard against arbitrary and capricious death sentences. <em>State v. Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d 651, 663 (Tenn.1997); Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-206(c)(l)(D). Our function in performing this review is not to search for proof that a defendant\u2019s death sentence is perfectly symmetrical with the penalty imposed in all other first degree murder cases, but to identify and invalidate the aberrant death sentence. <em>State v. Godsey, </em>60 S.W.3d 759, 782 (Tenn.2001); <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 665. In conducting comparative review, we do not act as a \u201csuper jury,\u201d nor do we second-guess the jury\u2019s decision. <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 668. A death sentence is aberrant, and thus disproportionate, \u201c[i]f the case, taken as a whole, is plainly lacking in circumstances consistent with those in similar eases in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u201d <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\u201cSelecting similar cases ... for comparison is not an exact science.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. \u201cNot included in the pool of similar cases are first degree murder cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>which the State did not seek the death penalty or first degree murder cases in which a sentence other than death was agreed upon as part of a plea bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Godsey, </em>60 S.W.3d at 784. Comparative proportionality review is not a search for disproportionate or aberrant life cases. <em>Id. </em>As -the United States Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">Since the proportionality requirement on review is intended to prevent caprice in the decision to inflict the [death] penalty, the isolated decision of a jury to afford mercy does not render unconstitutional death sentences imposed on defendants who were sentenced under a system that does not create a substantial risk of arbitrariness or caprice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\"><em>Gregg v. Georgia, </em>428 U.S. 153, 203, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976); <em>Godsey, </em>60 S.W.3d at 784-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">After identifying similar cases, this Court carefully examines the facts of the crimes, the characteristics of the defendants, and the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case on appeal and the similar cases. <em>Godsey, </em>60 S.W.3d at 782; <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 664. While the aggravating and mitigating circumstances are important for comparison purposes, this Court considers many variables including: (1) the means of death; (2) the manner of death (e.g., violent, torturous, etc.); (3) the motivation for the killing; (4) the place of death; (5) the similarity of the victims\u2019 circumstances including age, physical and mental conditions, and the victims\u2019 treatment during the killing; (6) the absence or presence of premeditation; (7) the absence or presence of provocation; (8) the absence or presence of justification; and (9) the injury to and effects on non-decedent victims. <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 667 (citing cases). In addition, several criteria are relevant to a comparison of the characteristics of defendants, including: (1) the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record or prior criminal activity; (2) the defendant\u2019s age, race, and gender; (3) the defendant\u2019s mental, emotional or physical condition; (4) the defendant\u2019s involvement or role in the murder; (5) the defendant\u2019s cooperation with authorities; (6) the defendant\u2019s remorse; (7) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of helplessness of victim(s); and (8) the defendant\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">Mindful of these factors, we have compared the defendant\u2019s sentence to the sentence imposed in similar cases in the relevant pool and have determined that the death sentence imposed upon the defendant is not disproportionate. As the State points out, the death penalty has been imposed and upheld in at least five other execution-style first degree murder cases. <em>See State v. Reid, </em>91 S.W.3d 247, 287 (Tenn.2002); <em>State v. Austin, </em>87 S.W.3d 447, 465 (Tenn.2002); <em>State v. Howell, </em>868 S.W.2d 238, 262 (Tenn.1993); <em>State v. Van Tran, </em>864 S.W.2d 465, 482 (Tenn.1993); <em>State v. Harris, </em>839 S.W.2d 54, 77 (Tenn.1992). Furthermore, the death penalty has been imposed in several cases in which the jury found the same two aggravating circumstances as those relied upon by the jury to support imposition of the death penalty in the defendant\u2019s case. <em>See State v. Morris, </em>24 S.W.3d 788, 791 (Tenn.2000); <em>State v. Mann, </em>959 S.W.2d 503, 504 (Tenn.1997); <em>State v. Hall, </em>958 S.W.2d 679, 683 (Tenn.1997); <em>State v. Barber, </em>753 S.W.2d 659 (Tenn.1988); <em>State v. Zagorski, </em>701 S.W.2d 808, 811 (Tenn.1985). Perhaps most significantly, however, the death penalty has been imposed and upheld in several other cases in which the defendant, like the defendant in this case, was not present at the scene of the murder. <em>Austin, </em>87 S.W.3d at 465-66; <em>State v. Stevens, </em>78 S.W.3d 817, 823 (Tenn.2002); <em>State v. Hutchison, </em>898 S.W.2d 161, 164 (Tenn.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>1994); <em>State v. Porterfield and Owens, </em>746 S.W.2d 441, 444 (Tenn.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The Court of Criminal Appeals distinguished these eases, noting that this case does not involve a \u201cmurder for hire.\u201d While this clearly is a distinction, it is not a difference that renders these cases wholly irrelevant for comparative proportionality review. Motive is merely one factor to be considered. Proof that the defendant had the authority to direct this murder <em>without </em>providing remuneration to the perpetrators does not mitigate his culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The intermediate appellate court also distinguished this case on the basis that there was no evidence the murder was carefully planned. We disagree. The record establishes that the victim was held at the apartment several hours, and during this time, the defendant and other gang leaders met several times in the kitchen and also spoke several times on the telephone to discuss the victim\u2019s fate. At the defendant\u2019s direction, Phillips and Wilkins hand-selected gang members to take the victim from the apartment. This circumstantial evidence indicates that the victim\u2019s murder was planned by several gang members, including the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Another factor influencing the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s decision to find the sentence disproportionate was the lack of evidence indicating the defendant instructed other gang members how to commit the murder. Again, we disagree that this lack of evidence is unique. For example, there was no evidence in <em>Owens </em>to suggest that the defendant instructed Porterfield to bludgeon her husband to death with a tire iron. The lack of definitive evidence<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> suggesting the defendant told other gang members how to commit the murder does not render the death sentence comparatively disproportionate, although this is a fair point to argue as mitigation in a capital sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Although differences exist between this case and the similar cases listed above, we have previously indicated that comparative proportionality review \u201cis not a search for proof that a defendant\u2019s death sentence is perfectly symmetrical.\u201d <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 665. Indeed, \u201cno two defendants and no two crimes are precisely alike.\u201d <em>State v. Bane, </em>57 S.W.3d 411, 429 (Tenn.2001). We are unable to conclude that this case is \u201cplainly lacking in circumstances consistent with those in similar cases in which the death penalty has been imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">The Court of Criminal Appeals also based its finding of disproportionality on its conclusion that no rational basis justified imposing a death sentence upon the defendant and a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole upon Phillips. In so holding, the lower court relied upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Cauthern, </em>967 S.W.2d 726, 741 (Tenn.1998), for the proposition that disparate sentences between co-defendants render the capital sentence disproportionate unless there is a rational basis for the disparate sentences. As the State points out, the disparate sentences at issue in <em>Cauth-em </em>were initially imposed by the same jury. The intermediate appellate court also failed to note that this Court has emphasized and reiterated that a death sentence is not disproportionate \u201cmerely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>because the circumstances of the offense are similar to those of another offense for which a defendant has received a life sentence.\u201d <em>Austin, </em>87 S.W.3d at 465; <em>State v. Hall, </em>976 S.W.2d 121, 135 (Tenn.1998). Furthermore, this Court has often stressed that a jury\u2019s isolated decision to afford mercy does not render a death sentence disproportionate, unless the death sentence is aberrant, i.e., the case, taken as a whole, is plainly lacking in circumstances consistent with other cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. As previously explained, the death sentence in this case is not aberrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The defendant\u2019s and Phillips\u2019s cases are extremely similar, as the State concedes. Nonetheless, differences significant to comparative proportionality review exist. Most importantly, Phillips\u2019s jury found only one aggravating circumstance \u2014 that the murder was committed in the course of a kidnapping. Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-206(i)(7) (1997). Furthermore, although Phillips was the Hurt Village Gangster Disciples coordinator, the defendant ranked third in the citywide hierarchy of the Gangster Disciples and bears more of the responsibility for Green\u2019s murder. For all these reasons, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s sentence of death is not disproportionate to the sentence imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\n<em>X. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\"><em>We </em>have considered the entire record in this case and find that the sentence of death was not imposed in any arbitrary fashion, that the sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate, and that the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of the statutory aggravating circumstance and the jury\u2019s finding that these aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. We have also considered the defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error and conclude that none warrant relief. With respect to issues not specifically addressed herein, we affirm the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, authored by Judge Joe G.

DENIAL OF INDIVIDUAL AND SEQUESTERED <em>VOIR DIRE </em>OF THE VENIRE</p>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion for individual, sequestered <em>voir dire </em>of the jury panel. The prevailing <em>voir dire </em>practice is to examine jurors collectively. <em>State v. Austin, </em>87 S.W.3d 447, app. at 471 (Tenn.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-(2003). There is no requirement in capital cases that death qualification of a capital jury be conducted by individual, sequestered <em>voir dire. Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Stephenson, </em>878 S.W.2d 530, 540 (Tenn.1994)). Moreover, as a general rule, the decision to allow individual <em>voir dire </em>of prospective jurors is within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Stephenson, </em>878 S.W.2d at 540. The defendant has failed to show the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for individual, sequestered voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">II. REJECTION OF <em>BATSON </em>CHALLENGE</p>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">The defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s conclusory rejection of a timely <em>Batson </em>challenge to the state\u2019s striking of five African-American members of the venue, without any contemporaneous findings and without requiring the state to proffer an explanation, warrants a remand for a hearing to determine whether a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">During <em>voir dire, </em>seven jurors were excused by the state as a result of peremptory challenges. After their dismissal, the defense raised an objection and noted that five of these jurors were African-American. The trial court found there was no basis to declare that any of the challenges were based upon race.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-22\">A state\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to intentionally exclude jurors of the defendant\u2019s race violates the defendant\u2019s right to equal protection. <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The Court upheld this principle in <em>Powers v. Ohio, </em>but eliminated the requirement that the defendant and the potential juror share the same race. 499 U.S. 400, 415, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991). A defendant seeking to raise a <em>Batson </em>claim must first make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination against a prospective juror. <em>Bat-son, </em>476 U.S. at 93-94, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The defendant must establish \u201cthat a consideration of all the relevant circumstances raises an inference of purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Woodson v. Porter Brown Limestone Co., </em>916 S.W.2d 896, 903 (Tenn.1996). If a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination is established, the burden then shifts to the state to establish a neutral basis for the challenge. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97, 106 S.Ct. 1712.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">The trial court must give specific reasons for each of its factual findings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ruling on peremptory challenges. <em>Wood-son, </em>916 S.W.2d at 906. This should include the reason the objecting party has or has not established a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination. The trial court\u2019s findings are to be accorded great weight and will not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>Id.; see also Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (noting deference to the trial court is necessary relating to credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The trial court found that the defendant had not made a <em>prima facie </em>showing of discrimination. In determining whether the defendant has established a <em>prima fa-cie </em>case, the trial court may consider whether similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury. <em>State v. Stout, </em>46 S.W.3d 689, 711 (Tenn.) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 998, 122 S.Ct. 471, 151 L.Ed.2d 386 (2001). The trial court may also consider the demeanor of the attorney who exercised the challenge, which is often the best evidence of the credibility of proffered explanations. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In the instant case, the record reveals that the final jury consisted of six African-Americans and six Caucasians. At the motion for new trial, the court commented that the only reason advanced by the defense to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case was the number of strikes used against African-Americans. While the court conceded that a <em>prima facie </em>case may be established by numbers alone, the trial court further explained that was not done in the instant case. Indeed, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">... if all you\u2019re standing up and saying is ... numbers alone, that\u2019s my <em>prima facie </em>case, I still \u2014 and I know what the case law says \u2014 but I\u2019m still of the opinion that at the time of my observations, my being present, listening to the jurors testify, observing the demeanor of the jurors, watching and taking notes of what was going on, I was not convinced at that time that there was a systematic exclusion of African-Americans from this jury, and that was the basis for it; not strictly on numbers, but it was based on the overall circumstances of what was occurring in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">We cannot conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. <em>See State v. Keen, </em>31 S.W.3d 196, app. at 227-29 (Tenn.2000) (holding there was no showing of purposeful discrimination where four African-American jurors were peremptorily challenged by the state), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 907, 121 S.Ct. 1233, 149 L.Ed.2d 142 (2001). In light of the trial court\u2019s findings, we conclude this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">III. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">The defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">A. Legal Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">In Tennessee, great weight is given to the result reached by the jury in a criminal trial. A jury verdict accredits the state\u2019s witnesses and resolves all conflicts in favor of the state. <em>State v. Bigbee, </em>885 S.W.2d 797, 803 (Tenn.1994). On appeal, the state is entitled to the strongest legitimate view of the evidence and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom. <em>Id.; State v. Cabbage, </em>571 S.W.2d 832, 835 (Tenn.1978). Moreover, a guilty verdict removes the presumption of innocence which the appellant enjoyed at trial and raises a presumption of guilt on appeal. <em>State v. Grace, </em>493 S.W.2d 474, 476 (Tenn.1973). The appellant has the burden of overcoming this presumption of guilt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Where sufficiency of the evidence is challenged, the relevant question for an appellate court is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime or crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Tenn. R.App. P. 18(e); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>State v. Abrams, </em>935 S.W.2d 399, 401 (Tenn.1996). The weight and credibility of the witnesses\u2019 testimony are matters entrusted exclusively to the jury as the triers of fact. <em>State v. Sheffield, </em>676 S.W.2d 542, 547 (Tenn.1984); <em>State v. Brewer, </em>932 S.W.2d 1, 19 (Tenn.Crim.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The state\u2019s theory at trial was that the defendant was responsible for the actions of his fellow Gangster Disciples based upon the theory of criminal responsibility. It is undisputed that the defendant was not present at the murder scene. As applicable to the case at bar, a person is criminally responsible for the conduct of another if, \u201c[a]cting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the offense, or to benefit in the proceeds or results of the offense, the person solicits, directs, aids, or attempts to aid another person to commit the offense.\u201d TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 39-11-402(2) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">B. Analysis of Overall Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">In this case, it is without dispute that the victim was unlawfully removed or confined so as to substantially interfere with his liberty; it was accomplished with a deadly weapon; and the victim suffered serious bodily injury. Thus, an especially aggravated kidnapping was committed. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-13-302(a), -305(a)(1), (4). It is further without dispute that the victim was intentionally killed with premeditation. Thus, a premeditated first degree murder was committed. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 39-13-202(a)(l). The only issue relating to sufficiency of the evidence is whether the defendant was criminally responsible for the conduct of those who actually committed or consummated these offenses. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 39-11-402(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">We begin our detailed analysis of the evidence in this case by reiterating that our standard of examining the evidence in a light most favorable to the state includes \u201call reasonable and legitimate inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>24 S.W.3d 274, 279 (Tenn.2000) (citing <em>Cabbage, </em>571 S.W.2d at 835). Thus, we recognize that jurors may evaluate the evidence in light of their common experiences in life and their common sense. <em>See Liabas v. State, </em>199 Tenn. 298, 286 S.W.2d 856, 858-59 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, the evidence established the defendant was a high ranking Gangster Disciple. He was portrayed as chief of security for the entire city of Memphis. Upon his arrival at Black\u2019s apartment, he ordered fellow Gangster Disciples to \u201csnag\u201d the victim for \u201cGD arrest.\u201d Several Gangster Disciples, in parade-like fashion, brought the victim before the defendant. The defendant initiated a beating of the victim by hitting him numerous times; others subsequently joined in the beating. The defendant demanded that the victim tell him the location of the Vice Lords. Reluctantly, the victim revealed a location. The defendant then ordered some Gangster Disciples to scout the location and return with their findings, which they did. The evidence further indicated that the defendant was angry upon learning that the Vice Lords were not at the location described by the victim. The defendant, Prentiss Phillips, and Kevin Wilkins were each part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>telephone conversation with Kaos, who was superior in rank to the defendant. Immediately after this conversation, the defendant directed Phillips and Wilkins to each pick three men and take the victim \u201cfishing.\u201d He further stated, \u201cY\u2019all know what to do.\u201d Thus, it was reasonable for the jury to assume the defendant, Phillips, and Wilkins were all aware of Kaos\u2019s directive, and the defendant ordered that Phillips and Wilkins be responsible for carrying out. that directive. Although Shipp thought the order to take the victim \u201cfishing\u201d only meant physical abuse, Shipp was not a part of the conversation with Kaos.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The jury could further infer that Wilkins, who had been a part of the phone conversation and knew the victim was to be killed, was ordered by the defendant to carry out the directive. One of the first things said to the victim at the park was from Wilkins, who was the ranking Gangster Disciple at the park and who asked the victim if he had any last words. The murder was then accomplished under Wilkins\u2019 direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">As it relates to the charge of premeditated first degree murder, the state was required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in giving these orders had the specific intent that the victim be murdered. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-11-402(2). Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, we conclude a rational trier of fact could find the defendant and Wilkins got the directive from Kaos that the victim was to be killed; the defendant ordered Wilkins (and Phillips) to carry out the directive; and Wilkins, a subordinate of the defendant, personally supervised the murder. The jury could further rationally conclude from the evidence that the Gangster Disciples was an organization structured according to rank and that orders given by those of superior rank should be obeyed in order to avoid severe sanctions. Thus, the jury could rationally conclude Wilkins carried out the order of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">What started out as a rift between a Vice Lord and a Gangster Disciple culminated in the gathering of a throng of Gangster Disciples, heavily armed and bent on retaliation. The retaliation effort had as one of its leaders the defendant. The lower-ranking Gangster Disciples followed not only the defendant\u2019s orders, but his example of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Accordingly, the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction for criminal responsibility for premeditated first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">As to the defendant\u2019s conviction for especially aggravated kidnapping, we conclude the evidence is sufficient. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, the defendant ordered the victim to be brought to the apartment where numerous Gangster Disciples had weapons. The defendant severely beat the victim with his fist and a broom stick; others beat him as well. The defendant ordered that Green be taken upstairs where numerous gang members threatened him with weapons pointed at his head. The defendant ordered Green be taken \u201cfishing\u201d and told his fellow Gangster Disciples, Wall know what to do.\u201d Wilkins followed those orders, took the victim to Bellevue Park, and supervised the murder. This evidence is more than sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction for especially aggravated kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">C. Accomplice Corroboration</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">The defendant argues that the evidence is insufficient because it consisted of uncorroborated accomplice testimony. Additionally, he asserts that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that (a) accomplice testimony cannot be corroborated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>evidence from another accomplice; (b) only a non-accomplice can corroborate the testimony of an accomplice; (c) Jarvis Shipp was an accomplice as a matter of law; and (d) the jury must decide whether Christopher James and Shaun Washington were accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">1. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The state contends that the defendant has waived these issues for failing to submit proposed instructions on accomplice testimony. <em>See State v. Anderson, </em>985 S.W.2d 9, 17 (Tenn.Crim.App.1997) (holding the failure to request accomplice instruction waives issue); <em>State v. Foster, </em>755 S.W.2d 846, 848-49 (Tenn.Crim.App.1988) (noting the defendant\u2019s responsibility to request instruction; failure constitutes waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">In instructing the jury regarding accomplice testimony, the trial court utilized the pattern jury instruction. <em>See </em>T.P.I.\u2014 CRIM. 42.09 (4th ed.1995). The trial court further instructed the jury that they were to determine whether the witness, Jarvis Shipp, was an accomplice to the alleged crime. The pattern charge does not contain a specific provision that accomplice testimony cannot be corroborated by other accomplice testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The record reflects the trial court advised the parties that it would be instructing on accomplice testimony. There were no special requests. After instructing the jury and prior to jury deliberations, there were no objections and no special requests. Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 30(b) provides that the parties are to be given an opportunity to object to the content of jury instructions or the failure to give requested instructions; however, the failure to make objections in these instances does not prohibit them from being used as grounds in the motion for new trial. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.Crim. P. 30(b); <em>State v. Lynn, </em>924 S.W.2d 892, 898-99 (Tenn.1996). However, alleged omissions in the jury charge must be called to the trial judge\u2019s attention or be regarded as waived. <em>State v. Haynes, </em>720 S.W.2d 76, 84-85 (Tenn.Crim.App.1986). In contrast to an erroneous instruction or the failure to give a requested instruction, defense counsel cannot sit on an objection to an omitted charge and allege it as a ground in the motion for new trial. <em>Id.; State v. Stigall, </em>No. 02C01-9610-CR-00371, 1998 WL 3340, at *1, 1998 Tenn.Crim.App. LEXIS 27, at *4 (Tenn.Crim.App. Jan. 7, 1998, at Jackson).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">The jury instruction given by the trial court was accurate. The defendant has waived any alleged error for the failure to specifically charge the jury that accomplice testimony cannot be corroborated by the testimony of other accomplices. Further, we discern no plain error. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">2. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">An accomplice is a person who \u201cknowingly, voluntarily and with a common intent unites with the principal offender in the commission of a crime.\u201d <em>State v. Allen, </em>976 S.W.2d 661, 666 (Tenn.Crim.App.1997). Uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice-witness will not support a conviction. <em>State v. Bane, </em>57 S.W.3d 411, 419 (Tenn.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1115, 122 S.Ct. 925, 151 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002). Corroborating evidence is evidence \u201centirely independent of the accomplice\u2019s testimony, which, taken by itself, leads to the inference not only that a crime has been committed but also that the defendant was implicated in it.\u201d <em>Bigbee, </em>885 S.W.2d at 803 (citations omitted). The independent corroborative testimony must include some fact or circumstance which affects the defendant\u2019s identity. <em>State v. Boxley, </em>76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>S.W.3d 381, 387 (Tenn.Crim.App.2001). In <em>Bethany v. State, </em>this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">The question of who determines whether a person is an accomplice depends upon the facts of each case. When the facts of a witness\u2019s participation in a crime are clear and undisputed, it is a question of law for the court to decide. When such facts are in dispute or susceptible of an inference that a witness may or may not be an accomplice, it then becomes a question of fact for the jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">565 S.W.2d 900, 903 (Tenn.Crim.App.1978); <em>see State v. Lawson, </em>794 S.W.2d 363, 369 (Tenn.Crim.App.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">3. Christopher James</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The evidence established that Christopher James was a relatively new member of the Gangster Disciples and had no \u201crank\u201d within the group. The evidence further established that, at the \u201caid and assist\u201d meeting held at the apartment, James was punished for fading to take part in the earlier fight that initiated the chain of events culminating in the murder. Although he was present when Vernon Green was brought into the apartment, there is no evidence that James did anything other than sustain a beating for his failure to assist fellow gang members earlier that day. The proof fails to establish that James was an accomplice to the murder and kidnapping of Vernon Green.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have submitted an instruction to the jury as to whether Christopher James was an accomplice is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">4. Shaun Washington</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The defendant contends Shaun Washington\u2019s identification should be considered accomplice testimony. Washington did not testify as a witness in this matter. Sergeant William Ashton testified that Christopher James identified the defendant in a photo line-up as the person whom James referred to as \u201cShaun.\u201d Defense counsel asked Sergeant Ashton on cross-examination if anyone else identified the defendant in the photo line-up. Sergeant Ashton, in response to this question, stated that Washington had identified the defendant as being present at the apartment on the night of the murder. There was no request that Washington be included in the accomplice instruction. This issue is waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">[Deleted: 5. Jarvis Shipp]</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">D. Identification Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">Within his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant challenges the following identifications: (1) the identification made by Christopher James using a photograph array; (2) the identification made by Shaun Washington; (3) the testimony of Jarvis Shipp; and (4) the testimony of Nichole Black. With the exception of the challenge to Shipp\u2019s testimony, these issues are discussed in issue six, <em>infra. </em>Regarding Shipp, the defendant contends that his testimony is uncorroborated. However, we have concluded that the evidence sufficiently corroborated Shipp\u2019s testimony. Moreover, any conflicts between Shipp\u2019s testimony and his prior statement to police were thoroughly addressed on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>E. Testimony of Christopher James</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The defendant alleges the testimony of Christopher James as to what he thought was going to happen to the victim when he left the apartment was \u201cpure, baseless speculation\u201d and should be excluded from consideration in this appeal. During direct examination of James, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">Q: What did you hear him say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">A: \u201cY\u2019all know what to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAACa\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">Q: Now, was this after they had beaten you up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">A: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">Q: What did you think \u2014 what did you feel at this time was going on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">A: I really couldn\u2019t say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-12\">Q: What did you think was going to happen to Vernon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">A: They was going to kill him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">No objection was made by the defendant. By failing to make a contemporaneous objection to testimony, a defendant waives appellate consideration of the issue. <em>State v. Alder, </em>71 S.W.3d 299, 802 (Tenn.Crim.App.2001); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>36 S.W.3d 102, 108 (Tenn.Crim.App.2000). Accordingly, absent an objection, the statement was properly admitted as proof. <em>State v. Stevens, </em>78 S.W.3d 817, app. at 849 (Tenn.2002), <em>cert. </em>denied, 537 U.S. 1115, 123 S.Ct. 873, 154 L.Ed.2d 790 (2003). We further discern no plain error. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-15\">[Deleted: F. Improperly Admitted Evidence]</p>\n<p id=\"b529-16\">G. <em>Anthony </em>Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">The defendant contends his convictions for both premeditated first degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping violate due process because the kidnapping was incidental to the murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-20\">A separate conviction for kidnapping may violate due process when the kidnapping is \u201cessentially incidental\u201d to the accompanying felony conviction and is not \u201csignificant enough, in and of itself, to warrant independent prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Anthony, </em>817 S.W.2d 299, 306 (Tenn.1991). In examining this issue, we must first determine whether the movement or confinement employed was beyond that which was necessary to commit the accompanying felony. <em>State v. Dixon, </em>957 S.W.2d 532, 535 (Tenn.1997). If so, we must next determine whether the additional movement or confinement: \u201c(1) prevented the victim from summoning help; (2) lessened the defendant\u2019s risk of detection; or (3) created a significant danger or increased the victim\u2019s risk of harm.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-21\">We conclude the defendant\u2019s dual convictions for especially aggravated kidnapping and premeditated first degree murder do not violate due process. The movement and confinement of Green was beyond that necessary to commit the murder. Furthermore, the additional confinement and movement prevented Green from summoning help and lessened the risk of detection. Therefore, the especially aggravated kidnapping was not \u201cessentially incidental\u201d to the premeditated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-22\">[Deleted: IV. PROSECUTORIAL INCONSISTENCY]</p>\n<p id=\"b529-23\">V. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT AND WITNESS JARVIS SHIPP</p>\n<p id=\"b529-24\">The defendant complains that prior to trial, Shipp attributed various acts to Prentiss Phillips, not to the defendant, and failed to identify the defendant as a co-perpetrator in these crimes. The defendant specifically alleges violations of <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87,83 S.Ct. 1194 and <em>Giglio </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). The defendant asserts that the prosecution withheld information of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">(1) an informal \u201cwink and a nod\u201d ... in exchange for Shipp\u2019s testimony, by which the state would not seek the death penalty against him if he went to trial; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">(2) the transcript of a hearing held on Shipp\u2019s motion to suppress his own statement given to police (which had been denied), in which Shipp testified to a motive why he had confessed to the crime [which] was dramatically at odds with the claimed motives he (and the State\u2019s prosecutors) told the jury were his \u201ccourageous\u201d reasons to do so (remorse for the victim and a desire to make amends to the victim\u2019s family).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The defendant claims he requested exculpatory information during pretrial discovery; the state failed to produce the information; and the information would have impeached Shipp\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The duty to disclose exculpatory evidence extends to all \u201cfavorable information\u201d irrespective of whether the evidence is admissible at trial. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>38 S.W.3d 52, 56 (Tenn.2001). The prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose <em>Brady </em>material also applies to evidence affecting the credibility of a government witness, including evidence of any agreement or promise of leniency given to the witness in exchange for favorable testimony against an accused. <em>Giglio, </em>405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763; <em>Johnson, </em>38 S.W.3d at 56. While <em>Brady </em>does not require the state to investigate for the defendant, it does burden the prosecution with the responsibility of disclosing statements of witnesses favorable to the defense. <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>671 S.W.2d 854, 856 (Tenn.Crim.App.1984). However, this duty does not extend to information that the defense already possesses, or is able to obtain, or to information not in the possession or control of the prosecution or another governmental agency. <em>State v. Marshall, </em>845 S.W.2d 228, 233 (Tenn.Crim.App.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">In order to prove a due process violation under <em>Brady, </em>the defendant must show the state suppressed \u201cmaterial\u201d information. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194; <em>State v. Edgin, </em>902 S.W.2d 387, 389 (Tenn.1995). Undisclosed information is material \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375 (citations omitted); <em>Johnson, </em>38 S.W.3d at 58. Furthermore, a reasonable probability is a \u201cprobability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish materiality, an accused is not required to demonstrate \u201cby a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). Therefore, \u201c[t]he question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">A. \u201cWink and a Nod\u201d Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">During the defendant\u2019s trial, Jarvis Shipp testified on direct examination that the state had not made him any promises in exchange for his testimony and that he was testifying freely and voluntarily. On cross-examination, the following colloquy occurred between defense counsel and Shipp:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">Q: ... Let me ask you this. Do you expect some type \u2014 although there\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>not a formal deal, do you expect some type of consideration for your testimony here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">A: Yes, because the simple fact I\u2019m facing the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">Q: Okay. So you do expect to gain something in your case by testifying here today, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">A: If it\u2019s in the progress[sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAKsD\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">Q: Okay. So let me ask you this. You feel like by telling the story that you\u2019ve told today that that could help you, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAq8W\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">Q: And you feel that if you help them convict Mr. Robinson that they might not seek that death penalty against you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">A: No, because they still \u2014 I still could go to trial and they still get the death penalty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">Q: But you\u2019re hoping that they consider that, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">Q: And you\u2019re hoping that that consideration will result in you [sic] not looking at a death-penalty situation, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-16\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-17\">The defendant asserts that, in two subsequent trials, i.e., <em>State v. Antonio Jackson </em>and <em>State v. Prentiss Phillips, </em>Jarvis Shipp acknowledged he had an agreement with the state. During co-defendant Antonio Jackson\u2019s trial, Shipp initially denied that he had an agreement with the state. Later, however, he stated that his attorney had informed him that if he pled guilty, he would receive a sentence of life with the possibility of parole or less. Shipp further stated that, by testifying at Jackson\u2019s trial, he was hoping for a better deal from the state. Later in co-defendant Prentiss Phillips\u2019 trial, Shipp admitted that he intended to enter a guilty plea as to his involvement in the events. He further stated, \u201cI expect my life to be saved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-20\">At the defendant\u2019s hearing on his motion for new trial, Shipp\u2019s attorney, Gerald Ska-han, was called to testify regarding any agreement between his client and the state. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">Q: Do you recall telling me when I asked what sort of agreement, if you had an agreement with the prosecutors, do you recall telling me basically it was a wink and a nod?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-22\">A: I did use ... those words but in a context that \u2014 like I testified to earner, ... I was fortunate enough to have somebody that was able to give testimony....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-23\">What my personal opinion is about the way it\u2019s done, I think everybody knows what\u2019s happening. I think the defense lawyers know. I think the prosecutors know. And I think the defendants know from being in jail. But that\u2019s the way it\u2019s done here.... And as for <em>Giglio </em>and stuff like that, I think- \u2014 that\u2019s where I use it in the context of a wink and a nod; ... I think everybody knows what\u2019s going to happen, but there is never an offer conveyed. There is never something saying that we will specifically do this. It\u2019s just at the end of every one of these trials, it works out. And that\u2019s what I mean by a wink and a nod.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">In its order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, the trial court found that at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, Shipp did not have a \u201cdeal\u201d with the state, although Shipp may have hoped his testimony would lead to a \u201cdeal.\u201d It further found the state did not withhold evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of a \u201cdeal\u201d from the defendant, and the defendant thoroughly questioned Shipp at trial regarding a possible \u201cdeal.\u201d The trial court concluded the state did not violate <em>Brady </em>or <em>Giglio. </em>We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">While Shipp may have hoped that his testimony would result in favorable treatment, the record does not establish that an agreement existed between the state and Shipp at the time of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>See Hartman v. State, </em>896 S.W.2d 94, 101-02 (Tenn.1995). Furthermore, the fact that Shipp later pled guilty to a lesser charge of facilitation of the offenses does not establish the existence of a prior agreement. <em>See State v. Williams, </em>690 S.W.2d 517, 525 (Tenn.1985). Moreover, Shipp testified in this case that he indeed expected to receive favorable treatment in exchange for his testimony. In the absence of any proof that an agreement indeed existed at the time of the Shipp\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial, this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">B. Transcript of Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Next, the defendant asserts that the state, in violation of <em>Brady, </em>failed to provide a copy of the transcript from Shipp\u2019s hearing on the motion to suppress his statement to police. In that transcript, Shipp averred that his original statement to police was given out of fear that he would be placed in a pod with members of the Traveling Vice Lords. The defendant claims that Shipp\u2019s motive of fear in giving the statement was at odds with his alleged noble motive of testifying at trial, which was \u201cto tell the truth on my behalf and on behalf of the victim\u2019s family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">In its order denying the motion for new trial, the trial court found this information would not have affected the verdict. We likewise see little benefit that would have been derived from pointing out to the jury that Shipp\u2019s motive for giving the pretrial statement was fear, whereas his alleged motive for testifying at trial was more noble. In fact, it was the defendant\u2019s position at trial that the contents of Shipp\u2019s pretrial statement, which did not mention any involvement by the defendant, was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">Regardless, we conclude this transcript does not meet the <em>Bagley </em>test for materiality. The trial court noted Shipp testified he hoped to gain some favor with the state through his testimony. The trial court found that defense counsel had questioned Shipp extensively regarding inconsistencies between his statement to police and his testimony at trial. Accordingly, we conclude there was no reasonable probability that, had this evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>See Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375. The failure to reveal this transcript did not undermine the confidence in the outcome of the trial. <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The defendant also contends that by failing to provide the transcript to Shipp\u2019s suppression hearing at the conclusion of Shipp\u2019s testimony, the state violated Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2 by failing to provide what is commonly referred to as <em>Jencks </em>material.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Rule 26.2(a) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct examination, the trial court, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, shall order the attorney for the state or the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney, as the case may be, to produce, for the examination and use of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is in their possession and that relates to the subject matter concerning which the witness has testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">A \u201cstatement\u201d of a witness includes \u201c[a] written statement made by the witness that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved by the witness.\u201d Tenn. R.Crim. P. 26.2(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Numerous federal courts have held that prior testimony does not qualify as <em>Jencks </em>material because the witness\u2019s statements are a matter of public record. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Chanthadara, </em>230 F.3d 1237, 1254-55 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that the prior trial testimony of an expert witness was not <em>Jencks </em>material), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 992, 122 S.Ct. 457, 151 L.Ed.2d 376 (2001); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>160 F.3d 473, 479 n. 5 (8th Cir.1998) (noting that matters <em>of </em>public record do not fall within the scope of the <em>Jencks </em>Act); <em>United States v. Isgro, </em>974 F.2d 1091, 1095 (9th Cir.1992) (stating that \u201ctrial testimony is not within the scope of the <em>Jencks </em>Act\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 985, 113 S.Ct. 1581, 123 L.Ed.2d 148 (1993); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>542 F.2d 1283, 1293 (7th Cir.1976) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 934, 97 S.Ct. 1558, 51 L.Ed.2d 779 (1977). The Tennessee rule is similar to the federal rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 26.2. Here the defendant contends he did not have ready access to this transcript. We need not determine this issue. For the same reasons we found the transcript did not meet the materiality test under <em>Bag-ley, </em>we conclude the defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged violation of Rule 26.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">VI. IDENTIFICATION ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">The defendant asserts that numerous errors regarding a photograph array and identifications warrant a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">A. Suggestive Photograph Array</p>\n<p id=\"Ak5s\">The defendant first asserts that the trial court erred in allowing a suggestive photograph array into evidence over objection. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">1. Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">During the suppression hearing, the defendant presented the testimony of Charles Poole, who stated he was also arrested and charged with the murder of Green. Poole testified that after he was arrested, Sergeant Ashton questioned him and showed him a photograph array. Poole testified that when he did not identify anyone, Sergeant Ashton pointed toward the photograph of the defendant. Poole stated that although he did not identify anyone in the array, he believed the officer wanted him to identify the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>dant\u2019s photograph. Upon viewing the photograph array, Poole stated the array depicted five \u201cdark-skinned\u201d African-Americans and one \u201clight skinned\u201d African-American. He stated the defendant, who was depicted in photograph six, was the person with the light skin tone.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Sergeant William Ashton, the case coordinator, testified he prepared a photograph array and showed it to witnesses. He stated he arranged the array by using the defendant\u2019s photograph and other photographs of those who resembled the defendant. The officer then presented the array to various witnesses and asked them if they could identify anyone in the array. Sergeant Ashton testified he never suggested to witnesses whom they were to identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Sergeant Ashton described the defendant\u2019s skin tone as \u201clight\u201d and opined that all of the men depicted in the photograph array had light skin tones. He stated he showed the array to Shaun Washington and Christopher James, both of whom identified the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">2.Trial Court\u2019s Findings</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the identifications and photograph array, the trial court found that Poole\u2019s credibility was \u201cabout as narrow as it can get.\u201d The trial court then stated it examined the photograph array and described the array as six photographs of African-American males with either a \u201cshaved head or very, very short cropped hair\u201d and \u201clighter\u201d skin tones. It found that the photograph array was not overly suggestive and that photograph six, which depicted the defendant, was not unique as compared to the other five photographs in the array. The trial court then concluded the photograph array was not suggestive, that the officer\u2019s actions were not sugges-five, and the witnesses did not rely upon anything suggestive in making their identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">3.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">The findings of fact made by the trial court at the hearing on a motion to suppress are binding upon this court unless the evidence contained in the record preponderates against them. <em>State v. Ross, </em>49 S.W.3d 833, 839 (Tenn.2001). Absent a showing by the defendant that the evidence preponderates against the judgment of the trial court, this court must defer to the ruling of the trial court. <em>State v. Cribbs, </em>967 S.W.2d 773, 795 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 932, 119 S.Ct. 343, 142 L.Ed.2d 283 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">4.Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pre-trial photographic identification will be set aside only if the photographic identification was \u201cso impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\u201d <em>Simmons v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). However, a pre-trial confrontation procedure may be unlawful if, under the totality of the circumstances, the procedure is unnecessarily suggestive. <em>Stovall v. Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 301-02, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-16\">Although it may be suggestive, an identification may satisfy due process as reliable and admissible when considering the totality of the circumstances. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>795 S.W.2d 689, 694 (Tenn.Crim.App.1990). This court must consider five factors in determining whether the in-court identification is reliable enough to withstand a due process attack despite the suggestiveness of the pre-trial identification. <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number><em>v. Strickland, </em>885 S.W.2d 85, 88 (Tenn.Crim.App.1993). These factors are: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description of the criminal; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation; and (5) the time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Strickland, </em>885 S.W.2d at 88 (citing <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. 375).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Based upon our review of the photograph array, we conclude that the evidence does not preponderate against the findings of the trial court. Although the complexion of the defendant is somewhat lighter than the complexions of other persons in the array, it was not impermissibly suggestive. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">[Deleted: B. Out-of-Court Identification by Shaun Washington]</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">[Deleted: C. Nichole Black\u2019s Testimony]</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">D. Failure to Grant a Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant an overnight continuance to permit him to obtain a \u201ctattoo expert.\u201d At the motion for new trial hearing, this claim was expanded to include a witness regarding dental work. The defendant asserts that the denial prevented him from obtaining testimony which would have cast serious doubt upon the defendant\u2019s identity as the person who gave the orders on the night of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">The defendant asserts he was surprised by the testimony of his witness, Officer Parker, who testified on cross-examination by the state that a tattoo could possibly be altered. The defendant sought permission to find a tattoo expert who could examine his tattoos. The trial court denied the request, noting the testimony was from a defense witness, the cross-examination should have been anticipated by the defendant, and the testimony, at most, indicated a mere possibility of an alteration. At the time the request was made, the defendant had not identified any particular expert nor had his tattoos been examined by someone to determine whether they exhibited signs of alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">At the motion for new trial hearing, defense counsel stated Jason Owens, a tattoo artist, \u201cwould have examined the defendant\u2019s tattoos, and he would have testified to the effect that [defense counsel had] represented and, also, as to his opinion as to whether there had been any cover-up or erasure of the defendant\u2019s tattoos.\u201d Defense counsel stated Owens would further testify that eoverups or erasures are detectable. The defendant also presented a proffer from the records clerk of a dentist. The proffer indicated that the defendant had paid for gold crowns two months prior to the murder and gave no indication that the crowns contained letters or designs of the type attributed to \u201cMacGreg.\u201d As the trial court noted, there had been testimony to the fact that gold caps are removable, and the proffer did not address that possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-15\">The decision whether to grant a motion for a continuance is a matter of discretion for the trial court, the denial of which will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear showing the trial court abused its discretion to the prejudice of the defendant. <em>State v. Melson, </em>638 S.W.2d 342, 359 (Tenn.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1137, 103 S.Ct. 770, 74 L.Ed.2d 983 (1983); <em>Baxter v. State, </em>503 S.W.2d 226, 230 (Tenn.Crim.App.1973). In order to establish an abuse of discretion, the complaining party must make a clear showing of prejudice as a result of the continuance being denied. <em>State v. Teel, </em>793 S.W.2d 236, 245 (Tenn.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1007, 111 S.Ct. 571, 112 L.Ed.2d 577 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The offer to secure dental testimony was not a basis for the motion for a continuance. Since an appellant cannot change theories from the trial court to the appellate court, this aspect of the issue is waived. <em>Alder, </em>71 S.W.3d at 303; <em>State v. Dooley, </em>29 S.W.3d 542, 549 (Tenn.Crim.App.2000). As to the request for a tattoo expert, we note, as did the trial court, that the controverted testimony was elicited from Officer Parker, who was a defense witness. The witness only stated that it was possible that the defendant\u2019s tattoos could have been altered. No particular witness was identified at the time of the request for a continuance, nor had the defendant\u2019s tattoos been examined by a potential witness. The trial court had no assurance that a witness could be secured by the next day of trial. We also note that the basis of identification by the state\u2019s witnesses did not relate to tattoos or gold teeth. The issue of tattoos and gold teeth arose during the testimony of defense witnesses. Under these circumstances, we are unable to conclude the trial court abused its discretion in denying the request for a continuance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">[Deleted: VII. USE OF THE VICTIM\u2019S SKULL AND PHOTOGRAPHS DURING THE GUILT PHASE]</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">VIII. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">The defendant alleges numerous instances of misconduct by the state. The state contends that in most instances the issue is waived due to the absence of a contemporaneous objection. The state further contends these allegations are otherwise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">A. Witness Voucher</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">The defendant asserts that various pros-ecutorial comments made in relation to the testimony of Christopher James and Jarvis Shipp constituted improper vouching for their credibility and rendered his trial unfair. During the state\u2019s closing arguments, the prosecutor made comments regarding the honesty of both James and Shipp. The prosecutor also made comments during the direct-examination of Shipp and closing arguments regarding Shipp\u2019s bravery in testifying. The state responds, in part, that the defendant has waived this issue for failing to enter a contemporaneous objection. We agree with the state that the defendant has waived this issue due to his failure to proffer contemporaneous objections to the challenged remarks. See <em>State v.

R.Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">B. The State Argued Facts not in Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b536-15\">The defendant next complains of the following statement made by the prosecutor during closing argument: \u201c[T]here was a murder, because there was an execution of a person, and the State has a duty to investigate that and do the best they can to determine who is responsible for that.\u201d The defendant argues this statement transforms the prosecutor\u2019s statements regarding the credibility of James and Shipp into \"facts not in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>dence.\u201d The defendant further complains about the following argument made regarding Shipp: \u201c[TJhat was a death sentence right then and there ... [h]e\u2019s got to watch his back everyday for the rest of his life.\u201d In addition, he challenges the following statement made in reference to both -witnesses: \u201c[Chris James and Jarvis Shipp] haven\u2019t conferred.... They haven\u2019t talked. They haven\u2019t met.... These men have not conferred in their testimony in any way.\u201d Finally, the defendant states that the prosecutor improperly argued that, \u201c[Sepacus Triplett], now that he is in the realm of confinement with other people who are involved in the Gangster Disciples organization, all of a sudden now he has a clear memory about his involvement.\u201d The defendant contends no evidence exists in the record to support these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Although we conclude all of these statements are reasonable inferences from the evidence, the defendant has waived any challenge to these issues by failing to raise a contemporaneous objection. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.App. P. 36(a). We further discern no plain error. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">C. The State Commented on the Defendant\u2019s Decision not to Testify</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">During closing arguments in the guilt phase, the prosecutor stated [Jarvis Shipp] said, I\u2019m doing this, I\u2019m telling you the truth to help me, but also doing this to help the victim\u2019s family. Did you hear that from anybody else?\u2014 anybody else who sat in this chair and said, I pled to this, you know, I was there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">Did anyone else exhibit any remorse? Did anyone say, I want to do the right thing. I want to do \u2014 I want to assist this family in the grief that they\u2019re exhibiting, that they\u2019re feeling in this matter. No one else did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The defendant now argues this was an improper remark on his election not to testify. <em>See Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 613, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) (holding prosecutor may not comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify). Although these statements appear to properly relate to an attack on gang members who testified for the defense, the failure to contemporaneously object waives the issue. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.App. P. 36(a). Further, we discern no plain error. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.Crim. P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">D. The State Presented Irrelevant Evidence Regarding the Victim</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">During its case-in-chief, the state presented the testimony of Christina Green, the victim\u2019s sister. Ms. Green stated she and the victim had a \u201creal close\u201d relationship. She further stated she attended the victim\u2019s funeral and that it was a \u201cclosed casket.\u201d Defense counsel then objected, and the trial court sustained the objection, finding the information regarding the casket was not probative to the state\u2019s casein-chief. The prosecutor then asked Ms. Green if she missed her brother, and she responded affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">The defendant asserts that Christina Green\u2019s testimony was irrelevant to the issue of guilt or innocence and was not introduced for any other purpose but to inflame the passions of the jury. However, other than the testimony regarding the victim\u2019s coffin which the trial court sustained, the defendant did not contemporaneously object to this testimony. Therefore, any issue regarding Ms. Green\u2019s testimony in its entirety is waived. <em>See </em>Tenn. R.App. P. 36(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">Next, the defendant alleges Dr. Deer-ing\u2019s remark that the shotgun wound to the buttocks would have been painful was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>not relevant to a determination of guilt or innocence and only inflamed the jury. However, the defendant was charged with especially aggravated kidnapping, one element of which is serious bodily injury. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13-305(a)(4). \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d includes \u201cextreme physical pain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 39-ll-106(a)(34)(C). Accordingly, such testimony regarding the gunshot wound to the buttocks was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">E. The State Made Improper Statements During <em>Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The defendant contends the state made improper statements to the jury during <em>voir dire, </em>which denied him a fair trial. During <em>voir dire, </em>the prosecutor, in discussing the different roles of the courtroom participants, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">On one matter that we all agree, we want a fair trial and impartial judicial proceeding. The defense wants that for them client, Mr. Robinson. But there\u2019s another person in this courtroom, ladies and gentlemen. Someone that you can\u2019t see. And that is the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The defense objected and the trial court instructed the prosecutor to ask the jurors a question. The prosecutor then stated to the jury, \u201cMy question to you, ... is that you keep that in mind throughout all your deliberations \u2014 there\u2019s one other person involved in this process.\u201d The defendant made no objection. The prosecutor then engaged in a lengthy discussion of the law and defined various legal terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The prosecutor\u2019s comments during <em>voir dire </em>had no effect on the result of the trial. These statements were minuscule compared to the lengthy <em>voir dire. </em>Furthermore, there is no indication that the prosecutor was acting with the intent to provoke unfair bias among the potential jurors. This issue lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"ARyJ\">F. Victim\u2019s Identity</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The defendant contends the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct in seeking to suggest that he intended to obliterate the victim\u2019s identity despite the lack of supporting evidence and the trial court\u2019s instructions not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">During the guilt phase of the trial, the state sought to introduce numerous photographs into evidence based upon its theory that the defendant intended that the victim\u2019s identity be obliterated. The trial court refused to admit the photographs based upon this theory. However, Sergeant Alvin Peppers testified that upon arriving at the scene, he was unable to identify any of the victim\u2019s features because \u201cthe face of the body was so mutilated.\u201d Upon objection by defense counsel, the trial court disallowed the introduction of a photograph depicting the victim\u2019s face due to its prejudicial effect but permitted Sergeant Peppers to testify regarding his observations while at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">Prior to Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony, the trial court held a jury-out hearing to discuss photographs which would be introduced during the doctor\u2019s testimony. The trial court again prohibited the state from introducing photographs based upon this theory because no one had testified that the defendant had instructed the gang members to erase the victim\u2019s identity. However, the trial court further stated that the prosecutor could argue an inference based upon the evidence admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">We are unable to conclude the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court refused to admit numerous photographs based upon this theory. Furthermore, the prosecutor could properly argue an inference based upon Sergeant Peppers\u2019 testimony regarding the appearance of the victim at the scene and Dr. Deering\u2019s testimony regarding the location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>and effect of the various gunshot wounds. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">IX. JURY INSTRUCTIONS\u2014 GUILT PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly charged the jury. Specifically, he alleges the jury instructions defining \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201cknowing\u201d conduct, direct and circumstantial evidence, and reasonable doubt were erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Under the United States and Tennessee Constitutions, a defendant has a right to trial by jury. <em>State v. Garrison, </em>40 S.W.3d 426, 432 (Tenn.2000). A defendant also has a right to a correct and complete charge of the law, so that each issue of fact raised by the evidence will be submitted to the jury on proper instructions. <em>Id. </em>In evaluating claims of error in jury instructions, courts must remember that \u201c \u2018jurors do not sit in solitary isolation booths parsing instructions for subtle shades of meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vann, </em>976 S.W.2d at 101 (quoting <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380-381, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1990)), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1071 (1999). Therefore, we review each jury charge to determine if it fairly defined the legal issues involved and did not mislead the jury. <em>See State v. Hall, </em>958 S.W.2d 679, 696 (Tenn.1997), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>524 U.S. 941, 118 S.Ct. 2348, 141 L.Ed.2d 718 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">A. Instruction on Intentionally and Knowingly</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">In instructing the jury on the elements of premeditated first degree murder, the trial court defined \u201cintentionally\u201d as, \u201cA person acts intentionally with respect to the nature of the conduct or to a result of the conduct when it is the person\u2019s conscious objective or desire to engage in the conduct or cause the result....\u201d In regard to second-degree murder, the trial court similarly defined \u201cintentionally\u201d and further instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">\u201cKnowingly\u201d means that a person acts knowingly with respect to the conduct or to circumstances surrounding the conduct when the person is aware of the nature of the conduct or that the circumstances exist. A person acts knowingly with respect to a result of the person\u2019s conduct when the person is aware that the conduct is reasonably certain to cause the result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-14\">The requirement of \u201cknowingly\u201d is also established if it is shown that the defendant acted intentionally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">The defendant cites as error the trial court\u2019s instruction on \u201cintentionally\u2019 for premeditated first degree premeditated murder and \u201cknowingly for second degree murder because they are result-of-conduct offenses. In support of his argument, the defendant relies upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Page, </em>81 S.W.3d 781 (Tenn.Crim.App.2002), a decision filed long after the trial of this case. The defendant argues that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Page </em>requires reversal in the present case as the trial court committed the same error by instructing the jury in the disjunctive on the definition of \u201cintentionally\u201d and \u201cknowingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788.[W]e conclude the instructions constituted harmless error. <em>See State v. Dotson, </em>No. M2001-01970-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 31370471, at *4, 2002 Tenn.Crim.App. LEXIS 884, at *12 (Tenn.Crim.App. Oct. 21, 2002, at Nashville), pe<em>rm, to app. denied </em>(Tenn.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">B. Instruction on Direct and Circumstantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b539-17\">The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s use of the alternative pattern jury instruction on direct and circumstantial evidence. <em>See </em>T.P.I. \u2014 CRIM. 42.03(a) (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ed.1995). It provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">Direct evidence is those parts of the testimony admitted in court which referred to what happened and was testified to by witnesses who saw or heard [or otherwise sensed] what happened first hand. If witnesses testified about what they themselves saw or heard [or otherwise sensed], they presented direct evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">Circumstantial evidence is all the testimony and exhibits which give you clues about what happened in an indirect way. It consists of all the evidence which is not direct evidence....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The defendant claims the instruction erroneously implies that \u201call evidence is direct evidence, except hearsay.\u201d Here, a \u201ccommonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial likely ... prevailed] over technical hairsplitting.\u201d <em>Boyde, </em>494 U.S. at 381, 110 S.Ct. 1190. We conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the jurors interpreted the trial court\u2019s instructions so as to prevent proper consideration of direct and circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">C. Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The defendant argues that the instruction provided by the trial court erroneously defined reasonable doubt. The trial court provided the following instruction on reasonable doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">Reasonable doubt is that doubt engendered by an investigation of all the proof in the case and an inability, after such investigation, to let the mind rest easily as to the certainty of guilt. Reasonable doubt does not mean a captious, possible or an imaginary doubt. Absolute certainty of guilt is not demanded by the law to convict of any criminal charge, but moral certainty is required and this certainty is required as to every proposition of proof requisite to constitute the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-14\"><em>See </em>T.P.I. \u2014 CRIM. 2.03 (4th ed.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">Our courts have upheld the constitutionality of the language contained in this reasonable doubt instruction. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bush, </em>942 S.W.2d 489, app. at 521 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 953, 118 S.Ct. 376, 139 L.Ed.2d 293 (1997); <em>Pettyjohn v. State, </em>885 S.W.2d 364, 365 (Tenn.Crim.App.1994). Accordingly, this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">[Deleted: X. LESSER \u2014 INCLUDED OFFENSES]</p>\n<p id=\"b540-17\">XL JURY MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">The defendant complains that his right to an impartial jury was violated when juror Gina Boyd was untruthful during <em>voir dire, </em>and, despite the sequestration order, Boyd had contact with a person outside the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">A. Bias/Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b540-20\">During <em>voir dire, </em>Boyd stated she worked \u201cintake\u201d as a deputy jailer in Shelby County. She denied knowing the defendant or anything about the case. Boyd stated she would be able to be fair and impartial in hearing all the evidence. During the motion for new trial, Boyd testified that although there were times when she was in different areas of the jail, she did not recall seeing the defendant in the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-21\">Boyd stated that during the trial, she noticed an arm band on the defendant\u2019s wrist and realized he was an inmate, although she still did not know where he was housed. She did not return to the jail until after the conclusion of the trial. Boyd maintained she never had supervisory authority over the defendant at the Shelby County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Defense counsel subsequently presented jail records which established that on October 8, 1998, Boyd was temporarily assigned to work in the pod where the defendant was housed for a period of three hours. Although the duty log sheet reflects that a head count may have been taken while Boyd was working in the pod, there is no indication as to who took the head count.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The burden is on the defendant to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of juror bias. <em>State v. Akins, </em>867 S.W.2d 350, 355 (Tenn.Crim.App.1993). If a juror intentionally fails to disclose information on <em>voir dire </em>which might indicate partiality, a presumption of prejudice arises. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">The trial court found there was no \u201cnexus\u201d shown to exist between the defendant and the juror. The trial court further found there was no indication Boyd recognized the defendant. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling is supported by the evidence. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">B. Separation of Sequestered Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">At the hearing on the motion for new trial, juror Boyd testified that after being selected for the jury, she advised her mother she was selected for a \u201cprofile\u201d murder case and was upset. Defense counsel stated they had interviewed the juror\u2019s mother, who stated her daughter came home in order to secure clothing for her sequestration and said she was \u201cextremely upset\u201d in having to serve on \u201ca high profile gangster case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The trial court found that juror Boyd had already testified she was upset and told her mother she was sitting on a \u201cprofile\u201d murder case. Thus, the court saw no relevance in the mother\u2019s proposed testimony. The defendant made no formal proffer of the mother\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Although we question whether this issue has been properly preserved due to the failure to make a formal proffer of the mother\u2019s proposed testimony, we find it without merit. Once separation of a sequestered jury has been shown by the defendant, the state has the burden of showing that such separation did not result in prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Bondurant, </em>4 S.W.3d 662, 672 (Tenn.1999). Here, the record supports the finding by the trial court that there was no showing of prejudice even if the mother testified in accordance with defense counsel\u2019s declarations. This issue lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">XII. THIRTEENTH JUROR/JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">The defendant asserts that the trial court, acting in its capacity as the thirteenth juror, should have granted a new trial because the guilty verdicts were contrary to the weight of the evidence. Alternatively, he asserts that the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(f) provides that \u201c[t]he trial court may grant a new trial following a verdict of guilty if it disagrees with the jury about the weight of the evidence.\u201d When a trial court makes a determination following Rule 33(f), the court is acting as thirteenth juror. <em>See State v. Gillon, </em>15 S.W.3d 492, 500 (Tenn.Crim.App.1997). In the instant case, the trial court expressly approved the verdict as thirteenth juror in the order overruling the motion for new trial. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the trial court is not required to delete from its consideration evidence that might later be found to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-16\">The defendant also argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>See </em>Tenn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>R.Crim. P. 29. This court has noted that \u201c[i]n dealing with a motion for a judgment of acquittal ... the trial judge is concerned only with the legal sufficiency of the evidence and not with the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>656 S.W.2d 60, 61 (Tenn.Crim.App.1983). The standard for reviewing the denial or grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal is analogous to the standard employed when reviewing the sufficiency of the convicting evidence after a conviction has been imposed. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>973 S.W.2d 288, 292 (Tenn.Crim.App.1998). Thus, our review of this issue is encompassed within our previous review of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">[Deleted: XIII. CUMULATIVE ERROR]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">XIV. SENTENCE FOR ESPECIALLY AGGRAVATED KIDNAPPING</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">The defendant does not challenge the length of his twenty-five-year sentence for especially aggravated kidnapping. However, he argues the trial court\u2019s order that it run consecutively to the sentence of death is flawed in that the trial court failed to make the requisite findings for consecutive sentencing. <em>See State v. Imfeld, </em>70 S.W.3d 698, 708-09 (Tenn.2002); <em>State v. Lane, </em>3 S.W.3d 456, 460 (Tenn.1999); <em>State v. Wilkerson, </em>905 S.W.2d 933, 939 (Tenn.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">A trial court may impose consecutive sentencing upon a determination that one or more of the criteria set forth in Tennessee Code Annotated section 40-35-115(b) exist. This section permits the trial court to impose consecutive sentences if the court finds, among other criteria, that \u201cthe defendant is a dangerous offender whose behavior indicates little or no regard for human life, and no hesitation about committing a crime in which the risk to human life is high.\u201d Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 40-35-115(b)(4). However, before ordering the defendant to serve consecutive sentences on the basis that he is a dangerous offender, the trial court must find that the resulting sentence is reasonably related to the severity of the crimes and necessary to protect the public against further criminal conduct. <em>See Imfeld, 70 </em>S.W.3d at 708-09; <em>Wilkerson, </em>905 S.W.2d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude the trial court\u2019s findings parallel the requirements of the statute addressing consecutive sentencing and <em>Wilkerson. See </em>TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 40 \u2014 35\u2014115(b)(4); <em>Wilkerson, </em>905 S.W.2d at 938-39. The trial court imposed consecutive sentencing based on its finding that the defendant was a dangerous offender. It further found the resulting sentence was reasonably related to the severity of the crimes due to the manner in which the victim was beaten and humiliated prior to his death. The trial court also specifically found society needed to be protected from the defendant. The trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the record based on the defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-14\">[Deleted: ANALYSIS OF ISSUES PRESENTED \u2014 PENALTY PHASE]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">[XV. CHALLENGES TO THE (i)(5) AND (i)(7) AGGRAVATORS]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">The defendant challenges the constitutionality of both the (i)(5) and (i)(7) aggravating factors. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39-13 \u2014 204(i)(5), (7). We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">A. (i)(5) Aggravator \u2014 Unconstitutionally Vague and Overbroad</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">The defendant argues that the \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d aggravator is vague and overbroad. However, our supreme court has rejected this argument. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number><em>Keen, </em>31 S.W.3d 196, 211 (Tenn.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 907, 121 S.Ct. 1233, 149 L.Ed.2d 142 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">He farther asserts that the jury instruction, as given, is not a unitary instruction. Our supreme court has previously stated that the phrase \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d is a unitary concept, <em>State v. Van Tran, </em>864 S.W.2d 465, 479 (Tenn.1993), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>511 U.S. 1046, 114 S.Ct. 1577, 128 L.Ed.2d 220 (1994), which \u201cmay be proved under either of two prongs: torture or serious physical abuse,\u201d <em>Keen, </em>31 S.W.3d at 209 (citations omitted). Further, our state supreme court has previously found the defendant\u2019s argument that the jury charge deprived him of a unanimous jury verdict to be without merit. <em>State v. Sims, </em>45 S.W.3d 1, 18 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 956, 122 S.Ct. 357, 151 L.Ed.2d 270 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">B. (i)(5) Aggravator \u2014 Failing to Meaningfully Narrow Pool</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">The defendant argues that the (i)(5) ag-gravator, either alone or combined with the (i)(7) aggravator, fails to meaningfully narrow the class of death eligible defendants. The Tennessee Supreme Court has rejected this argument. <em>See Terry v. State, </em>46 S.W.3d 147, 159 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1023, 122 S.Ct. 553, 151 L.Ed.2d 428 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">[Deleted: C. (i)(5) and (i)(7) Aggrava-tors \u2014 Vicarious Application]</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">XVI. DEFENDANT\u2019S PRIOR ARREST</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The defendant next asserts the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial when, during the sentencing phase, the state improperly asked a defense witness about the defendant\u2019s \u201cprior arrest.\u201d The defendant presented his sister\u2019s testimony concerning his relationship with his family. On cross-examination, the state asked the defendant\u2019s sister whether she was aware of the defendant\u2019s prior arrest. The trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question and answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">Although we have difficulty understanding why a prosecutor would ask such a question in the penalty phase of a capital trial without prior court approval, we fail to find any resulting prejudice in light of the trial court\u2019s prompt curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">XVII. PREJUDICIAL INFORMATION REACHING THE JURY</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">A. List of Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">The defendant argues that the trial court improperly read to the jury all the possible aggravating circumstances during jury selection and not just the two relied upon by the state. The record reflects that the trial court did recite to the venire during the jury selection process the entire list of available statutory aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">It is error for the trial court to instruct the jury on inapplicable aggravating circumstances. <em>State v. Blanton, </em>975 S.W.2d 269, 281(Tenn.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1180, 119 S.Ct. 1118, 143 L.Ed.2d 113 (1999). However, the entire list of aggravating circumstances was not submitted to the jury as part of the instructions prior to deliberations. It was simply part of the explanatory portion of the trial court\u2019s discussion with the venire. At the close of the proof at the sentencing phase, the jury was properly instructed only as to the two aggravating factors relied upon by the state. This issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">B. Use of Especially Aggravated Kidnapping to Enhance Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b543-20\">The defendant complains that the trial court permitted the prosecution to improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>erly suggest that the felony murder aggra-vator, which was based upon the underlying especially aggravated kidnapping, should be given extra weight against any mitigators. Specifically, the defendant cites to the state\u2019s argument, \u201cYou\u2019ve already come to this determination that there was, indeed, an especially aggravated kidnapping and that there was, indeed, a murder. The other one is the heinous, atrocious, and cruel.\u201d This argument is misplaced. The prosecution was merely reiterating to the jury that they had found during the guilt phase the elements of especially aggravated kidnapping, the underlying felony in the (i)(7) aggravator.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The defendant also argues that the use of the same \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to the victim to enhance kidnapping to especially aggravated kidnapping and to apply the (i)(7) aggravator was \u201cdouble counting,\u201d which violated double jeopardy. Initially, we note that the felony murder aggravator is triggered by a murder in perpetration of a \u201ckidnapping\u201d; it is not required to be an \u201cespecially aggravated kidnapping.\u201d <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39 \u2014 13\u2014204(i)(7). Regardless, there is no double jeopardy violation. <em>See State v. Stout, </em>46 S.W.3d 689, 706 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 998, 122 S.Ct. 471, 151 L.Ed.2d 386 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">C. Failure to Limit the State\u2019s Aggra-vators to (i)(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The defendant asserts that the trial court improperly permitted the state to rely upon two aggravating circumstances after defense counsel had detrimentally relied upon the state\u2019s opening argument of the penalty phase indicating it was relying upon only the (i)(5) aggravator. The state indeed only mentioned the \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d aggravator in its opening statement. However, prior to the defendant\u2019s proof, the trial court heard argument on this issue and ruled the state was not limited to only one aggravating factor. It further noted the state had given proper notice of both aggravators. We agree with this ruling and discern no undue prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">XVIII. PROHIBITION FROM CONSIDERING MITIGATING EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">The defendant contends the trial court unconstitutionally prevented the sentencing jury from considering relevant mitigating evidence by excluding consideration of evidence of the defendant\u2019s character and record.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">A. Instruction to Jury Regarding Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">The defendant complains of the following instruction regarding consideration of mitigating evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">Any other mitigating factor which is raised by the evidence produced by either the prosecution or defense at either the guilt or sentencing hearing; that is, you shall consider any aspect of the circumstances of the offense favorable to the defendant which is supported by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">The defendant asserts that by failing to instruct the jury that it may also consider \u201cany aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record,\u201d this instruction erroneously limited the jury to mitigating evidence related to the circumstances of the offense, and, in effect, the jury was instructed not to consider any evidence related to the defendant\u2019s character or record. The language suggested by the defendant is in the pattern jury instruction but was inadvertently omitted by the trial court. <em>See </em>T.P.I.\u2014 CRIM. 7.04(c) (4th ed.1995); see also <em>id. </em>(7th ed.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">A jury instruction on mitigating circumstances may be found \u201cprejudicially erro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>neons\u201d only if \u201c \u2018it fails to fairly submit the legal issues or if it misleads the jury as to the applicable law.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Reid, </em>91 S.W.3d 247, app. at 308 (Tenn.2002) (quoting <em>State v. Hodges, </em>944 S.W.2d 346, 352 (Tenn.), cert. <em>denied, </em>522 U.S. 999, 118 S.Ct. 567, 139 L.Ed.2d 407 (1997)). In the instant case, we conclude that the instructions provided by the trial court when viewed in their entirety fairly submitted to the jury the legal issues. Accordingly, the omission in the trial court\u2019s instruction did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">B. Burden of Proving Mitigators</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">The defendant asserts the failure to instruct the jury that he did not have the burden of proof as to any mitigating factors was prejudicial. The jurors were instructed that the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt any aggravating factor. They were further instructed there was no requirement for unanimity with respect to any particular' mitigating factor. Upon reading the instructions as a whole, we fail to conclude the alleged omission misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">C. Closing Argument by the State</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">The defendant next objects to a portion of the state\u2019s closing argument during which the prosecutor asserted it was \u201cpatently offensive\u201d to argue that the defendant\u2019s life should be spared because of his children and that such a plea was equally offensive in view of the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. These statements were made during the state\u2019s rebuttal closing following the defendant\u2019s plea for mercy based upon his family support and potential for rehabilitation. The trial court cautioned the prosecutor after the defense objected to these statements. The trial court further instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">Ladies and Gentlemen, let me say to you that the appearance, or lack of appearance, on behalf of Mr. Robinson of any remorse is not a factor for you to consider in determining what the punishment in the case should be....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-12\">Lack of remorse is not a statutory aggravating circumstance, and it is not proper rebuttal because the defendant did not argue his remorse as a mitigating factor. However, the jury is presumed to follow the curative instruction of the trial court. <em>State v. Butler, </em>880 S.W.2d 395, 399 (Tenn.Crim.App.1994). Accordingly, although the prosecutor erred, such error is harmless in light of the curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-13\">D.Trial Court\u2019s Limitation on the Defendant\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">The defendant complains he was prevented from presenting evidence of his innocence at the penalty phase by virtue of an <em>in limine </em>order. Specifically, the defendant refers to the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding his statement given outside the presence of the jury at the beginning of the sentencing phase. During this jury-out hearing, the defendant asserted he was wrongfully convicted. He also stated he did not receive a fair trial due to the admission of improper testimony, which the jury did not disregard. He further alluded to various instances of misconduct by a particular juror and improper removal of evidence from the courtroom by the prosecutor. In response to these statements, the trial court made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-14\">I\u2019m not going to allow him to testify about the entire case in front of the jury, whether he, if he wants to testify he got a fair trial, or didn\u2019t get a fair trial and on all these other statements he wants to make. That may be proper, but I\u2019m not going to allow him to get up there to' attack a particular juror, so that\u2019s the basis for my decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The defendant subsequently testified but made no reference to the alleged unfairness of his trial. The defendant has cited no authority indicating a defendant has the right to testify that he did not receive a fair trial and verbally attack jurors. Nor do we find such attacks to be proper residual doubt testimony. \u201cResidual doubt evidence\u201d generally consists of proof at the sentencing phase indicating the defendant did not commit the offense, notwithstanding the guilty verdict. <em>State v. McKinney, </em>74 S.W.3d 291, 307 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 926, 123 S.Ct. 321, 154 L.Ed.2d 219 (2002); <em>State v. Hartman, </em>42 S.W.3d 44, 55-56 (Tenn.2001). Although the defendant had the right to proclaim his innocence, we are unable to conclude that he was prevented from doing so by virtue of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">E. Other Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The defendant asserts numerous errors during the penalty phase regarding closing arguments and the jury instructions which related to mitigating circumstances. We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s assertions and find the defendant is not entitled to relief on any of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">XIX.ADMISSION OF PHOTOGRAPH DURING PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting a photograph depicting a detailed and close-up view of the gruesome wounds to the victim\u2019s face during the penalty phase. Although the trial court refused to admit the photograph at the guilt phase, the court permitted its introduction at the penalty phase, advising the jury to consider it only for the purpose of determining whether the crime was heinous, atrocious, cruel, or constituted torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Photographs depicting a victim\u2019s injuries have been held admissible to establish torture or serious physical abuse under aggravating circumstance (i)(5). <em>See, e.g., State v. Smith, </em>893 S.W.2d 908, 924 (Tenn.1994) (photographs depicting the victim\u2019s body, including one of the slash wounds to the neck, which was \u201cundeniably gruesome,\u201d were relevant to prove that the killing was \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d and were admissible for that purpose), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 829, 116 S.Ct. 99, 133 L.Ed.2d 53 (1995). The photograph in question accurately depicts the nature and severity of the injuries inflicted upon the victim. This evidence was relevant to the state\u2019s proof of the \u201cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d aggravating circumstance. The decision to admit this photograph was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">XX.PROSECUTOR\u2019S ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">The defendant complains the state attempted to suggest the defendant intended to obliterate the victim\u2019s identity despite the fact there was no evidence to that effect, and the trial court repeatedly instructed the state not to do so. The defendant references the following argument of the state: \u201cThis was an extortion of his whole identity. His whole face, his identity. The aggravator we\u2019ve proven is that there was a felony involved and that this was heinous, atrocious, and cruel.\u201d We discern no error regarding this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">XXI.JURY INSTRUCTIONS DURING SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">The defendant asserts the written verdict form misstated the law and allowed the jury to impose the death penalty without requiring the state to prove the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. At issue is that portion of the charge setting forth the requirements au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>thorizing a sentence of death. The trial court quoted the pattern jury charge verbatim. <em>See </em>T.P.I. \u2014 CRIM. 7.04(e) (4th ed.1995); <em>see also id. </em>(7th ed.2002) (containing identical language). We are unable to conclude this charge misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The defendant further contends the trial court erred by failing to define the \u201cknowing\u201d <em>mens rea </em>required for the felony murder aggravator. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 39 \u2014 13\u2014204(i) (7). If the court erred, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">[Deleted: XXII. EXISTENCE OF AGGRAVATING FACTORS)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">[Deleted: XXIII. PROSECUTORIAL INCONSISTENCIES AND THE DEATH PENALTY]</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">[Deleted: <em>XXIV. APPRENDI V. NEW JERSEY}</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">XXV. THIRTEENTH JUROR-PENALTY PHASE</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">The defendant argues that the trial court, acting in its capacity as \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(f), should have granted a new sentencing hearing since the jury\u2019s death verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence. As previously indicated in this opinion, the trial court expressly approved the verdict as thirteenth juror in its order overruling the motion for new trial. The order specifically referred to the convictions as well as the penalty of death. This issue lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">XXVI. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE TENNESSEE DEATH PENALTY STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">The defendant contends our death penalty statute is unconstitutional. The Tennessee death penalty statute has been upheld repeatedly. <em>See, e.g., State v. Reid, </em>91 S.W.3d 247, app. at 312-14 (Tenn.2002); <em>State v. Hines, </em>919 S.W.2d 573, 582 (Tenn.1995), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>519 U.S. 847, 117 S.Ct. 133, 136 L.Ed.2d 82 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The defendant also argues death by lethal injection is unconstitutional. While the Tennessee Supreme Court has not expressly addressed this issue, <em>see State v. Suttles, </em>30 S.W.3d 252, 264 (Tenn.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 967, 121 S.Ct. 401, 148 L.Ed.2d 310 (2000), such challenges have been rejected by other courts. <em>See Poland v. Stewart, </em>117 F.3d 1094, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>523 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 1533, 140 L.Ed.2d 683 (1998); <em>State v. Webb, </em>252 Conn. 128, 750 A.2d 448, 458, <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 835, 121 S.Ct. 93, 148 L.Ed.2d 53 (2000); and <em>State v. Hinchey, </em>181 Ariz. 307, 890 P.2d 602, 610, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 993, 116 S.Ct. 528, 133 L.Ed.2d 434 (1995). We likewise conclude that lethal injection is not constitutionally prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">[Deleted: XXVII.

Thus, this case need not be remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further consideration, and we have considered all the issues raised by the defendant as well as the mandatory statutory review issues and have concluded the convictions and sentences should be affirmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">. In <em>Bums </em>this Court indicated the trial court should provide a jury instruction on solicitation at the new trial, even though the offense had been completed. However, this portion of <em>Bums </em>has been clarified in the later cases of <em>Ely </em>and <em>Marcum. </em>These cases plainly explain that instructions are not required on either solicitation or attempt where the evidence clearly establishes completion of the charged offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\">. We note in this regard that the skull was not introduced into evidence and therefore was never given to the jury for inspection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\">. To establish unfair prejudice, the defendant points out that a juror experienced a migraine headache during Dr. Deering testimony and was excused from the jury after medical personnel examined her. The defendant\u2019s assertion is without merit. We agree with and set out below the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">In regard to the juror referred to by the Defendant, she experienced a migraine headache and requested Darvocet (an extremely powerful painkiller available only by prescription) for her pain. The requested medicine was unavailable to the Court, and after being examined by a doctor who confirmed that the juror did indeed have a migraine, the juror was dismissed due to the fact that the doctor stated it would take approximately two to three hours for the migraine to subside. The juror in no way, shape or form indicated or in any way implied that the skull contributed to the onslaught of her condition. The juror had obviously experienced migraine headaches before, given that she normally took Darvo-cet to control these headaches. The Defendant has offered no proof whatsoever that the demonstration of the skull had any connection to the juror\u2019s migraine. The Defendant does however, make much of the fact that this juror wrote the word \"pain\u201d on her notepad, and asserts that she held it up for other jurors to see, and that this action prejudiced the jury. The actions of this juror were made known to this Court during trial. This Court questioned two jurors in regard to this incident. One juror stated that she had not seen any such note. Another juror testified that she had seen it, stating, \u201cIt said, pain. P-A-I-N. Her head was hurting real bad. And she just wrote pain on it and held it up.\u201d It is obvious to this Court that the word pain was in reference to the migraine, and that the members of the jury who saw this note also understood the reference. Accordingly, this Court finds that the probative value of the skull was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. This issue is without merit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b510-5\">. Exhibit 8 depicts the injury to the victim\u2019s buttocks. Exhibit 9 depicts the injury to the victim's back.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">. The appeal in this case has been delayed because the record was lost and had to be reconstructed and because unopposed motions requesting extensions have been granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. <em>See, e.g., Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153-54, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b514-5\">. Having so concluded, we need not and do not consider the State\u2019s assertion that, even if such Due Process claims exist, such claims should be raised in a post-conviction petition not on appeal and the State's assertion that the Court of Criminal Appeals erred in adopting and applying the analytical framework articulated by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, based upon our finding, we reject the defendant's assertion that the prosecution failed to disclose affirmative exculpatory evidence that Phillips was the highest ranking gang member and that Phillips was ultimately responsible for the murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\">. The defendant also challenged the consecutive sentences imposed for his especially aggravated kidnapping conviction. In this Court, the defendant filed a letter of supplemental authority relying upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to support his challenge. The defendant argues that pursuant to <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi, </em>he was entitled to a jury trial on the factors supporting consecutive sentencing. The State did not respond. The record reflects that the defendant did not rely upon <em>Apprendi </em>in the trial court or in the Court of Criminal Appeals in support of this claim, nor did he argue in the lower courts that a jury had to make the consecutive sentencing findings. We note that several courts have rejected the defendant\u2019s contention and held that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Apprendi </em>do not apply to the decision to impose consecutive sentences. <em>See People v. Sykes, </em>120 Cal.App.4th 1331, 16 Cal.Rptr.3d 317, 327 (2 Dist.2004) (citing cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\">.

Apparently, the Court of Criminal Appeals addressed this issue in the interest of judicial economy. Under most circumstances, appellate courts should refrain from conducting a comparative proportionality review if the capital case is being reversed and remanded for a new trial or a new sentencing hearing. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bondurant, </em>4 S.W.3d 662, 675 (Tenn.1999); <em>Carter, </em>988 S.W.2d at 153.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\">.

Davis, </em>141 S.W.3d 600, 632 (Tenn.2004) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Berry, </em>141 S.W.3d 549, 590 (Tenn.2004) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Holton, </em>126 S.W.3d 845, 872 (Tenn.2004) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Davidson, </em>121 S.W.3d 600, 629-36 (Tenn.2003) (Birch, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Carter, </em>114 S.W.3d 895, 910-11 (Tenn.2003) (Birch, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Reid, </em>91 S.W.3d 247, 288-89 (Tenn.2002) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Austin, </em>87 S.W.3d 447, 467-68 (Tenn.2002) (Birch, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Stevens, </em>78 S.W.3d 817, 852 (Tenn.2002) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. McKinney, </em>74 S.W.3d 291, 320-22 (Tenn.2002) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Bane, </em>57 S.W.3d 411, 431-32 (Tenn.2001) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Stout, </em>46 S.W.3d 689, 720 (Tenn.2001) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>Terry v. State, </em>46 S.W.3d 147, 167 (Tenn.2001) (Birch, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Sims, </em>45 S.W.3d 1, 23-24 (Tenn.2001) (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting); <em>State v. Keen, </em>31 S.W.3d 196, 233-34 (Tenn.2000) (Birch, J., dissenting). As previously discussed, I believe that the three basic problems with the current proportionality analysis are that: (1) the proportionality test is overbroad,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) the pool of cases used for comparison is inadequate,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) review is too subjective.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I have previously discussed, in depth, my perception that these flaws undermine the reliability of the current proportionality protocol. <em>See State v. Godsey, </em>60 S.W.3d at 793-800 (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting). I continue to adhere to my view that the current comparative proportionality protocol is woefully inadequate to protect defendants from the arbitrary or disproportionate imposition of the death penalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">But beyond the foregoing, which addresses proportionality review in general, the number of participants in this offense and the wide disparity in the sentences imposed in this case invite a yet more specific scrutiny. Of the four others pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ecuted for this offense, only Robinson received the death penalty. Prentiss Phillips was convicted of first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping and received sentences of life without parole for the murder, plus twenty-five years, respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Phillips, </em>76 S.W.3d 1 (Tenn.Crim.App.2001), <em>perm. app. denied </em>(Tenn.2001). Antonio Jackson was convicted of facilitation of first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping and received sentences of twenty-five years on each of those offenses, to be served consecutively. <em>See State v. Jackson, </em>52 S.W.3d 661 (Tenn.Crim.App.2001), <em>perm. app. denied </em>(Tenn.2001). Kevin Wilkins\u2019 conviction for first-degree murder (and life without parole sentence) was reversed on appeal for insufficient evidence, leaving him with a single conviction for especially aggravated kidnapping, although it is evident from the testimony in this record that he was the person who actually fired the fatal shots into Vernon Green\u2019s body. <em>See State v. Kevin Wilkins, </em>No. W1999-01462-CCA-MR3-CD, 2000 WL 1229156 (Tenn.Crim.App. at Jackson, Aug. 18, 2000), <em>perm. app. denied </em>(Tenn.2001).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Of course, a death sentence for one defendant is not rendered arbitrary, excessive or disproportionate merely because another defendant in the same case has received a sentence less than death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But here, the arbitrary nature of the sentencing process becomes strikingly manifest. Thus, I am constrained to wholeheartedly agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Criminal Appeals \u2014 that no rational basis exists to distinguish Robinson\u2019s sentence of death from the lesser sentences imposed upon the other defendants. Accordingly, I deem Robinson\u2019s sentence to be arbitrary, excessive, and disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">In light of the foregoing, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion that affirms the imposition of the death penalty upon Gregory Robinson and concur in the affirmance of his convictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-4\">. I have urged adopting a protocol in which each case would be compared to factually similar cases in which <em>either </em>a life sentence or capital punishment was imposed to determine whether the case is more consistent with \"life\u201d cases or \"death\u201d cases. <em>See State v. McKinney, </em>74 S.W.3d at 321 (Birch, J., concurring and dissenting). The current protocol allows a finding proportionality if the case is similar to existing <em>death penalty </em>cases. In other words, a case is disproportionate only if the case under review \"is plainly lacking in circumstances consistent with those in similar cases in which the <em>death penalty </em>has been imposed.\u201d <em>Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 665 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\">. In my view, excluding from comparison that group of cases in which the State did not seek the death penalty, or in which no capital sentencing hearing was held, frustrates any meaningful comparison for proportionality purposes. <em>See Bland, </em>958 S.W.2d at 679 (Birch, J., dissenting). This case, in particular, is a prime example of the arbitrariness of this protocol.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b548-11\">. As I stated in my concurring/dissenting opinion in <em>State v. Godsey, </em>\"[t]he scope of the analysis employed by the majority appears to be rather amorphous and undefined \u2014 expanding, contracting, and shifting as the analysis moves from case to case.\u201d 60 S.W.3d 759, 797 (Tenn.2001)(Birch, J., concurring and dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-12\">. I also note that in a recent study on the costs and the consequences of the death penalty conducted by the State Comptroller, one of the conclusions was that prosecutors across the state are inconsistent in their pursuit of the death penalty, a fact that also contributes to arbitrariness in the imposition of the death penalty. <em>See </em>John G. Morgan, Comptroller of the Treasury, <em>Tennessee's Death Penalty: Costs and Consequences </em>13 (July 2004), <em>available at www.comptrol-ler.state.tn.us/orea/reports.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b549-5\">. As noted by the Court of Criminal Appeals in its unredacted opinion, the State also sought the death penalty against <em>Phillips, </em>making it a prime case for comparison, even under the standards of <em>Bland. State v. Gregory Robinson, </em>No. W2001-01299-CCA-R3-DD at pp. 52-53, 2003 WL 21946735 (Tenn.Crim.App. at Jackson, Aug. 13, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">. The disposition of Jarvis Shipp's case is unknown, although there is evidence in the record that he was testifying against this defendant in the hope of receiving a favorable plea bargain, presumably for something more favorable than the death penalty. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 518-520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"A3\"><em>.See, e.g., State v. Burns, </em>979 S.W.2d 276, 285 (Tenn.1998); <em>State v. Cauthern, </em>967 S.W.2d 726, 741 (Tenn.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
