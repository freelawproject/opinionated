Samstag, alleging violations of the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility. The matter was referred to Judge Audrey E. Melbourne of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule BV10. At the hearing before Judge Melbourne, evidence was adduced showing that the Supreme Court of California disbarred Samstag, effective March 19, 1982, for having wilfully misappropriated the approximate sum of $30,000 entrusted to him in a fiduciary capacity and for having wilfully misappropriated to his own use and purpose the additional sum of $7,500</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Maryland Rule BV10 e 1 provides that \"[a] final adjudication by a judicial tribunal in a disciplinary proceeding that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct is conclusive proof of the misconduct in the hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule.\u201d Bar Counsel\u2019s petition for disciplinary action asserted that Samstag\u2019s misconduct violated DR 1-102(A)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Melbourne concluded in her findings that Bar Counsel\u2019s charges were established by the evidence. Samstag did not file any exceptions to Judge Melbourne\u2019s findings. Bar Counsel has recommended that Samstag be disbarred, there being no compelling extenuating circumstances shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">After carefully considering the matter we conclude that the appropriate sanction for Samstag\u2019s misconduct is disbarment. <em>See Attorney Griev.
