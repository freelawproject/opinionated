Vol., 1982 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 3-828 (b), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which provides, \"A juvenile court record pertaining to a child is confidential and its contents may not be divulged, by subpoena or otherwise, except by order of the court upon good cause shown.\u201d The term \"court\u201d is defined in \u00a7 3-801 (i) as to Montgomery County, from whence comes this case, as meaning \"the District Court sitting as the juvenile court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Robert G. was charged in Montgomery County with first degree murder, first degree sex offense and related offenses arising out of a single incident. The State sought a court order authorizing it to review Robert G\u2019s juvenile court record prior to making its decision as to whether to ask the death penalty for the offense. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 412 (b) requires the State, if it intends to seek the death sentence for first degree murder, to notify \"the person in writing at least 30 days prior to trial\u201d of such fact and to advise that person \"of each aggravating circumstance upon which it intendfs] to rely .. ..\u201d Aggravating circumstances are as set forth in Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In <em>Murphy v. Yates, </em>276 Md. 475, 495, 348 A.2d 837 (1975), Judge Singley referred for the Court to the State\u2019s attorney\u2019s \"most awesome discretionary power: to determine whether or not to prosecute.\u201d Obviously, whether or not to seek the death penalty is an even more awesome power. It was for the purpose of determining whether the death penalty should be sought that the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County asked that the juvenile court record in question be disclosed to him. The trial judge said in determining to make the material available to the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\"There is a great deal of material in [Robert G\u2019s] file. This member of the court is personally familiar with [Robert G.] and probably most of his prior record. ... [T]he court is generally aware that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>a rather extensive juvenile court record as well, in the legal sense, as well as a great deal of evaluative materials, probation reports, (unclear word) investigations and so forth, that make up [Robert G\u2019s] file. That I\u2019m sure are and have been of assistance to Defense counsel and would be of some assistance to the State. The court is going to order the release of the records to the State\u2019s Attorney. I, feel that this should be done for two reasons. First of all the \u2014 the being a major offense I don\u2019t want this to be considered a precedent for any serious charge, I\u2019ll have to determine what constitutes a sufficiently serious charge in future cases but clearly the charges here are of major proportions. And I feel that the \u2014 it is in the interest of the community, in the interest of the public to give the State the same advantage in determining matters that are in the file and the weight to be accorded them and the use to be made of them, the same advantage as has already been given to Defense counsel in this case. Limiting it to the facts of this case of course. The State has some decisions to make. And there of course is the proceeding before the State\u2019s Attorney wherein the determination be made whether to seek the death penalty, and I feel the State should in that circumstance alone be, be able to have the same material available to it in making its determination and responding to Defense counsel as would the Defense counsel in presenting matters in mitigation. I don\u2019t mean to sound naive, the State has alluded to it, that there is some of this material in here that may well be beneficial to [Robert G.] and make the difference between what the State decides to do and what it decides not to do. Clearly in my view some of this material may be beneficial to him in the sentencing aspect if he is convicted of any or all of these offenses. But of course that would be as I read it automatically accessible to parole and probation in any event. That is not really part of my deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>initiation. But I do find that good cause has been shown and the need for this material to be available to the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Robert G. immediately appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted his petition for a writ of certiorari prior to argument in that court. The cause was argued before us on April 4, 1983. At that time we issued a per curiam order affirming the judgment of the District Court of Maryland, Montgomery County, for reasons to be stated in an opinion to be filed later and directed that the mandate should issue forthwith. We now state our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Robert G. points out that one of the purposes of the juvenile subtitle is, as set forth in \u00a7 3-802 (a) (2), \"[t]o remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior ...He also says that \u00a7 3-802 (b) states that the \"subtitle shall be liberally construed to effectuate these purposes.\u201d All parties concede that the only exception to the required confidentiality of juvenile records which could be applicable to this proceeding would be if there has been \"good cause shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>623 (5th ed. 1979), defines good cause as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\"Substantial reason, one that affords a legal excuse. Legally sufficient ground or reason. Phrase 'good cause\u2019 depends upon circumstances of individual case, and finding of its existence lies largely in discretion of officer or court to which decision is committed.. .. 'Good cause\u2019 is a relative and highly abstract term, and its meaning must be determined not only by verbal context of statute in which term is employed but also by context of action and procedures involved in type of case presented.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">There are no prior Maryland cases arising under this statute. However, this Court has considered the term \"good cause\u201d in a variety of contexts. Our view of \"good cause\u201d has been as stated by <em>Black. </em>Without exception we have applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing action by a trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">One of our most recent cases is <em>Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 456 A.2d 29, <em>cert. denied, </em>U.S. , 103 S.Ct. 2114 (1983). At issue there was the exclusion of a defendant\u2019s only alibi witness whose identity had not been disclosed prior to trial as required by Maryland Rule 741. Rule 741 g provides that \"[ujpon motion and for good cause shown, the court may order that specified disclosures be restricted.\u201d The rule also allows the trial court to \"strike the testimony to which the undisclosed matter relates . . . [or] prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the matter not disclosed. . . .\u201d We held that \"good cause\u201d depends upon facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In <em>Mathias v. State, </em>284 Md. 22, 394 A.2d 292 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>441 U.S. 906 (1979), we addressed the issue of an attempt on the part of an accused on the morning of trial to change his election of a court trial to that of a jury trial. What was then Rule 741 provided that a trial court might, \"in its discretion and for good cause shown, at any time prior to the trial permit the accused to change his election.\u201d We said there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\"Precisely what is meant by an abuse of discretion seems not to have been articulated by this Court. However, some bench marks are to be found. For example, in <em>Washington, B. &amp; A. R. R. </em>v. <em>Kimmey, </em>141 Md. 243, 250, 118 A. 648 (1922), relative to the discretion to be exercised in considering a motion for a new trial, Judge Urner said for our predecessors, 'A discretion could not be characterized as sound which wholly disregarded evidence by which its exercise should have been aided.\u2019 In <em>Horton v. Horton, </em>157 Md. 127, 133, 145 A. 355 (1929), concerning the discretion of orphans\u2019 couijts in the case of intestacy to grant letters to a child or to the husband or widow, as the case might be, the Court said, '[I]t means that the court shall actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>exercise a discretion, and that it shall make its choice after considering the relative merits and fitness of the applicants, and their respective claims to consideration, and not that it may act without regard to such consideration, solely at its pleasure or caprice.\u2019 In <em>Lee v. State, </em>161 Md. 430, 157 A. 723 (1931), Chief Judge Bond said for the Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">'The meaning of discretionary power in a trial court, and the rules governing review of discretionary orders on appeal, have often been stated in vague, loose terms which furnish no exact guidance; but for the purposes of this case it seems to us sufficient to observe only that the judgment and discretion must be exercised in solving the exact problem of the law, upon all the considerations which properly enter into the problem, and form it. For instance, the discretion being for the solution of the problem arising from the circumstances of each case as it is presented, it has been held that the court could not dispose of all cases alike by a previous general rule. <em>Union Bank v. Ridgely, </em>1 H. &amp; G. 324, 407 [(1827)].\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 441.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">284 Md. at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In <em>Stanford v. District Title Insur., </em>260 Md. 550, 273 A.2d 190 (1971), appellee requested and was granted a dismissal for lack of prosecution pursuant to Rule 530. Plaintiff appealed. Rule 530 c at that time provided that the trial court \"for good cause shown\u201d might suspend the operation of the rule upon such terms as the court may prescribe. In the discussion for the Court, Judge Digges said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\"The decision to permit the redemption of a cause lost through delay involves subtle judgment, requiring the trial judge to balance the individual litigant\u2019s right to ultimately have his day in court against the public\u2019s paramount interest in insuring that all citizens can obtain a prompt resolution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>conflicts while they still remain current. The primary focus of his inquiry should be on diligence and whether there has been a sufficient amount of it during an eighteen month period of inaction for the court to affirmatively conclude that the case should not be automatically dismissed. That decision, whatever it may be, rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge and we will only invade his province on appeal in extreme cases of clear abuse. <em>Tydon v. Spong, </em>[237 Md. 107,] 110 [, 205 A.2d 220 (1964)].\u201d 260 Md. at 555.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The Court relied upon <em>Stanford </em>in <em>Langrall, Muir &amp; Nopp\u2019r v. Gladding, </em>282 Md. 397, 384 A.2d 737 (1978), a case also dealing with automatic dismissal under Rule 530. Judge Cole said for the Court there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">\"We placed the responsibility on the trial judge to weigh and balance the rights, interests, and reasons of the parties in light of the public demand for prompt resolution of litigation when inactivity characterized a cause of action. We suggested that the trial judge, on the scene, will have a perception and understanding of the legal environment in which the case is temporarily mired. Therefore, he was vested with the discretion to be exercised consistent with the spirit of the law while subserving the ends of justice and fairness to the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>400-01.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-8\"><em>Webb v. Chevy Chase Cars, Inc., </em>259 Md. 284, 269 A.2d 810 (1970), concerned Rule 526 which provides a \"trial shall not be postponed or delayed by reason of incompletion of proceedings under Chapter 400 (Depositions and Discovery) except upon motion by any party and notice to all other parties, for good cause shown.\u201d Webb\u2019s lawyer took a deposition on November 6 knowing that the trial was set for December 1. The transcript of the deposition ran only eleven pages but the attorney did not provide for it to be ready for use at the trial. Webb argued on appeal that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>should have granted him a continuance. Chief Judge Hammond there said for the Court, \"Judge Mathias did not abuse his discretion in deciding that good cause for continuance had not been shown.\u201d 259 Md. at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Rule 420 provides that a trial court \"may, upon motion by any party and notice to all other parties, for good cause shown, order such party to submit to a mental or physical or blood examination,\u201d etc., whenever \"the mental or physical condition or the blood relationship of a party or of an agent or a person in the custody or under the legal control of a party [ ] is material to any matter involved in any action.\u201d <em>Hutzell v. Boyer, </em>252 Md. 227, 249 A.2d 449 (1969), among other things, concerned an attempt to obtain a second physical examination of the plaintiff. Judge Finan said for the Court that we found \"no abuse of the court\u2019s discretion in refusing to order the second examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">In <em>Kay Const. Co. </em>v. <em>County Council, </em>227 Md. 479, 177 A.2d 694 (1962), the issue was whether \"good cause\u201d existed sufficient to allow the District Council to reconsider a zoning resolution. Judge Sybert said for the Court there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">\"The Zoning Ordinance does not define what conditions must be met to establish 'good cause shown\u2019. While it may not be possible to state an all-embracing definition of that phrase, it is possible to ascertain its general meaning by an examination of some of the cases where the problem of applying it has arisen. What will measure up to a showing of 'good cause\u2019 in a particular case will depend upon the circumstances of that case.\u201d 227 Md. at 484-85.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">At another point in the opinion the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\"The Ordinance, by requiring that 'good cause\u2019 be shown as a necessary condition to the granting by the Council of a petition for reconsideration, has in effect grafted upon that agency a limitation which exists in regard to quasi-judicial bodies even in the absence of statute. It permits the Council to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>a petition for reconsideration only where there appears to be a substantial reason for doing so, as defined in the cases cited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Cases from other jurisdictions are consistent with what we have quoted from Maryland. <em>See, e.g., Jager v. State, </em>537 P.2d 1100 (Alaska 1975) (Regulation promulgated by the Public Utilities Commission provided that a formal investigation would not be instituted on complaint \"except for good cause shown to the commission\u2019s satisfaction by the complainant.\u201d); <em>State v. Churchill, </em>82 Ariz. 375, 380, 313 P.2d 753 (1957) (Statute provided for dismissal of prosecutions if a defendant was not brought to trial within sixty days \"unless good cause to the contrary is shown by affidavit ....\u201d The court said, <em>\"Good cause </em>means substantial reason, that is, one that affords a legal excuse.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); <em>Sanchez v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., </em>20 Cal. 3d 55, 70, 569 P.2d 740, 141 Cal. Rptr. 146 (1977) (One issue was whether the claimant refused proffered employment for \"good cause.\u201d The court said, quoting <em>Syrek v. California Unemployment Appeals Insurance Board, </em>54 Cal. 2d 519, 529, 354 P.2d 625, 7 Cal. Rptr. 97 (1960), \" '[T]he term \"good cause\u201d as used in the statute means an adequate cause, a cause that comports with the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Code and with other laws.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>People, </em>136 Colo. 581, 586, 319 P.2d 983 (1957) (The case involved prosecution for failure to support minor children. At issue was whether this failure was, in the words of the statute, \"owing to physical incapacity or other good cause.\u201d The court said, \" 'Good cause\u2019 is defined as a substantial or legal cause as distinguished from an assumed or imaginary pretense [, citing cases].\u201d); <em>State v. Estencion, </em>63 Hawaii 264, 267, 625 P.2d 1040 (1981) (The issue before the court was whether the trial court abused its discretion in finding that there was an absence of \"good cause\u201d under a Hawaii rule pertaining to trial delay. The court said, \"Under Rule 48(c)(8), a general 'good cause\u2019 ground is provided to take care of <em>unanticipated </em>circumstances. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added by the Hawaii court.) The court went on to say, \"As a general rule, 'good cause\u2019 means a substantial reason; one that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>affords a legal excuse [, citing cases].\u201d); <em>Fong v.

The court held that good cause existed to allow a prosecutor to examine the juvenile records of a defendant\u2019s crucial alibi witness. The court noted \"that the Prosecutor\u2019s ultimate purpose is to resolve the issue of a juvenile\u2019s competency as a key alibi witness.\u201d 70 N.J. at 485. The court held that good cause was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We believe that when a prosecutor is faced with the awesome duty of deciding whether or not to seek the death penalty he is entitled to all pertinent information in public records which might have a bearing on the exercise of his discretion. The juvenile record of the accused certainly could have a direct bearing upon the exercise of that discretion. Hence, we find no error on the part of the trial judge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
