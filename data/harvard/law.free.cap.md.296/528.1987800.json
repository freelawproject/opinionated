Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 21 (c) (4) bars a deceased employee\u2019s dependents from receiving compensation in Maryland merely because unrelated claimants also asserting that they were dependents of the deceased received an award under the workmen\u2019s compensation law of a foreign jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Ernest John Grass, Jr., was a truck driver employed by Ryder Truck Lines, Inc. (Ryder) at its place of business in Hagerstown, Maryland. On August 23, 1979, while operating his employer\u2019s vehicle in Virginia, he was killed in an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. At the time of his death, Grass lived in Maryland and maintained a home with Donna Kennedy, Ginger Kennedy (the minor child of Ernest Grass, Jr., and Donna Kennedy) and Stephen Kennedy (the minor child of Donna Kennedy and her former husband, Charles Kennedy). However, at this same time, he had a lawful wife, Domenica Grass, and a minor daughter, Teresa Grass, who resided in Florida. Ernest Grass contributed to the support of his wife and their daughter but apparently fully supported Donna, Ginger and Stephen Kennedy at their home in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Donna Kennedy filed claims before the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission on behalf of Ginger Kennedy on October 25,1979, on her own behalf on January 11, 1980, and added the name of Stephen Kennedy as a claimant before the Commission on August 8, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">On December 5, 1979, Domenica Grass and her daughter filed for survivors\u2019 benefits with the Industrial Accident Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Donna Kennedy, through counsel, had notice of the Virginia proceeding but elected not to participate therein. The Virginia Commission rendered an award to Domenica Grass and Teresa Grass of survivors\u2019 benefits of $199.00 per week for 500 weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Thereafter, Domenica Grass and Teresa Grass filed a claim with the Maryland Commission alleging total dependency. Both the Grass and Kennedy claims were heard by the Maryland Commission on August 8,1980, at which time Ryder challenged the Kennedy claim of total dependency and sought credit for the sum granted on the Grass claim in the Virginia proceeding, which was to be paid by its Virginia workmen\u2019s compensation insurer. Ryder ultimately raised Section 21 (c) (4) of Article 101 as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">On December 24,1980, the Maryland Commission passed its award in favor of the Kennedys at a rate of $220.00 per week; denied any compensation to Domenica Grass and her daughter; and disallowed any credit for the sums paid under the Grass award from the Virginia Commission. Ryder appealed to the Circuit Court for Washington County which affirmed. Ryder then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals but we granted certiorari prior to consideration by that court to consider the important and novel question presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Ryder contends that because Domenica Grass and her daughter recovered as total dependents of the deceased in Virginia, Donna Kennedy and her two children should not also be able to recover as total dependents in Maryland. However, because the Virginia and Maryland statutes differ markedly in their treatment of claimants, both the Grasses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>and Kennedys have been able to recover as full dependents of the decedent in Virginia and Maryland, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Virginia workmen\u2019s compensation statute provides that a wife who has not abandoned her husband and is actually dependent upon him is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent. <em>See </em>Va. Code \u00a7 65.1-66(1) (1950, 1980 Repl. Vol.); <em>Caudle-Hyatt, Inc. v. Mixon, </em>220 Va. 495, 260 S.E.2d 193 (1979). The decedent\u2019s child also is conclusively presumed to be his dependent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Persons not conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent may only recover by demonstrating their actual dependency. <em>See </em>Va. Code \u00a7 65.1-67 (1950, 1980 Repl. Vol.); <em>see generally Glassco v. Glassco, </em>195 Va. 239, 77 S.E.2d 843 (1953); <em>Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. Place, </em>150 Va. 562, 143 S.E. 756 (1928). Generally, dependents of the deceased employee are entitled to compensation equal to two thirds of his average weekly wages (with a maximum of 100%, and a minimum of 25%, of the Commonwealth\u2019s average weekly wage) for a period of four hundred weeks. However, persons conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent under \u00a7 65.1-66 (1), (2) and (3) of the Virginia Code are entitled to compensation at the same rate for five hundred weeks. <em>See </em>Va. Code \u00a7 65.1-65 (1950, 1983 Cum. Supp.). Under normal circumstances there is no provision for payments to extend past this time if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>employee\u2019s dependents cannot become self-supporting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If more than one person is wholly dependent, then death benefits must be divided among them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither the statute nor case law clarifies precisely how the award is to be divided. However, it is obvious that if the Kennedys had proceeded in Virginia they would have had to demonstrate their total dependency upon the deceased employee and then share the award with Domenica and Teresa Grass, who only received partial support from the deceased, yet under Virginia law were conclusively presumed to be totally dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">In Maryland, dependency is the decisive factor in determining who will receive a compensation award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Persons determined to be wholly dependent are entitled to receive payments at the rate of two thirds of the deceased employee\u2019s average weekly wages (not to exceed 100% of the state average weekly wage, nor be less than $25 per week unless the employee\u2019s actual wages were less) to continue during total dependency, but not to exceed $45,000. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957,1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 36 (8) (a). After this sum has been exhausted, a surviving wife or husband who remains wholly dependent may continue to receive payments at the same rate. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Section 36 (8) (d) also provides that payments to dependent children shall continue until the child is eighteen years of age, unless the child is attending school on a full-time basis wherein such payments shall continue for a period not in excess of five years. Benefits may also continue for a child beyond the age of eighteen when said child is wholly dependent and incapable of self-support by reason of mental or physical disability or other sufficient reason as determined by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>In Maryland, a spouse only receiving partial support would be a partial dependent, entitled to weekly payments not to exceed $17,500. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957,1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 36 (8) (b). If there are both wholly and partly dependent persons, the Commission is responsible for apportioning the compensation award among these claimants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Thus, under the law of Maryland or Virginia alone Ryder or its Virginia insurer would have had to pay no more than two thirds of Mr. Grass\u2019s average weekly wages. Ryder\u2019s main thrust is that because Domenica Grass and her daughter recovered almost $100,000 in Virginia as dependents of Ernest Grass, the Kennedys should be barred in Maryland from recovery as total dependents. Ryder maintains that to require it to pay employee\u2019s dependents again would be double recovery, precluded by \u00a7 21 (c) (4) of Article 101.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The pertinent part of that section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">If an employee or the dependents of an employee shall receive compensation or damages under the laws of any other state, nothing herein contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>shall be construed so as to permit a total compensation for the same injury greater than is provided for in this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We have repeated time and again that the cardinal principle of statutory construction is to determine the legislative intent. To do this we look first to the language in the statute. If it is clear, then we need look no further. <em>See Utt v. State, </em>293 Md. 271, 443 A.2d 582 (1982); <em>Vallario v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>290 Md. 2, 426 A.2d 1384 (1981); <em>Briggs v.

White, </em>235 Md. 212, 201 A.2d 358 (1964). If it is unclear and ambiguous, we seek other aids in uncovering the legislative intent or in recognizing the legislative purpose. <em>See Bledsoe v. Bledsoe, </em>294 Md. 183, 448 A.2d 353 (1982); <em>Briggs v. State, supra; State v. Berry, supra; Brown v. Brown, </em>287 Md. 273, 412 A.2d 396 (1980); <em>Fairchild v. Maritime Air Serv., </em>274 Md. 181, 333 A.2d 313 (1975); <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 224 A.2d 677 (1966); <em>Walker v.

Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 209 A.2d 582 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In our view, the language is ambiguous because it does-not clearly indicate whether the dependent receiving an award in a foreign state must be the same dependent in this State or may be a different and unrelated dependent before the operation of the statute is triggered. Therefore, we must look further for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Initially, we note that the history of the statute is not helpful. This language has been included in the workmen\u2019s compensation statute, essentially unchanged and without legislative comment, since its original introduction in 1922,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>and has not been the subject of construction by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">However, in our cases we have developed certain principles to be followed in construing provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation law. We have said that all sections of the workmen\u2019s compensation law must be read and considered together in arriving at the true intent of the legislature, <em>Howard Contr. Co. </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>184 Md. 503, 41 A.2d 494 (1945); that in construing a compensation statute, \"the purpose of the whole act must be borne in mind, and such construction be given as will effectuate the intent and spirit of the act, unless that construction is plainly denied by the language used,\u201d <em>Monumental Printing Co. v. Edell, </em>163 Md. 551, 555, 164 A. 171 (1933), <em>quoted in State v. Richardson, </em>233 Md. 534, 541, 197 A.2d 428 (1964); that the Act \"should be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes,\u201d <em>Howard Co. Ass\u2019n, Retard. Cit. v. Walls, </em>288 Md. 526, 530, 418 A.2d 1210 (1980); <em>see also Wiley Mfg. Co. v. Wilson, </em>280 Md. 200, 373 A.2d. 613 (1977); <em>Superior Builders, Inc. v. Brown, </em>208 Md. 539, 119 A.2d 376 (1956); <em>Beth.-Sp. Pt. Shipy\u2019d v. Hempfield, </em>206 Md. 589, 112 A.2d 488 (1955); <em>Beth.-Fair. Shipyard v. Rosenthal, </em>185 Md. 416, 45 A.2d 79 (1945); <em>Kraushar v. Construction Corp., </em>180 Md. 486, 25 A.2d 439 (1942); and that where there is ambiguity in the provision, the uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant, <em>see Beth.-Fair. Shipyard v. Rosenthal, supra; Kraushar v. Construction Corp., supra; Lisowsky v. White, 177 </em>Md. 377, 9 A.2d 599 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Consistent with these guidelines, we note that the Act contains sections suggesting that it should be construed to favor recovery for the employee or his dependents. Section 63, \"Construction of article,\u201d provides: \"The rule that statutes in derogation of the common law are to be strictly construed shall have no application to this article; but this article shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>its general purpose.\u201d The Preamble to Article 101 identifies this general purpose \u2014 to provide for \"sure and certain relief' for workmen ... and their families and dependents....\u201d Section 64 (a) presumes, \"in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary: (a) That the claim comes within the provisions of this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Having noted the general purpose of the Act, we turn now to examine this specific part of \u00a7 21 (c) (4) to determine its purpose. The language \"nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to permit a total compensation for the same injury greater than is provided for in this article\u201d certainly limits a claimant\u2019s ability to recover in Maryland under some circumstances. To this extent the section departs from the broad remedial purpose of the article. However, the provision does not necessarily suggest a sweeping departure but rather, a qualifying circumstance, designed to prevent claimants from being unjustly enriched by an application of the article\u2019s benevolent purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The circumstance occurs when an employee or the dependents of an employee receive compensation or damages under the laws of another state for the same injury and applies for or receives compensation in this State. Thus, the real question is to whom the phrase \"the dependents\u201d refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">It seems to us that \"the dependents\u201d refers to the person or persons who received and shared a certain amount of money as support from the employee at the time of his death. Thus, an employee, as in the instant case, might have more than one dependent or set of dependents, differing in entitlement by the extent of support provided by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Furthermore, as we see it, this provision is designed to prevent the same dependents from recovering in another state compensation which when added to compensation awarded in this State is greater than the total compensation allowed by the Maryland Compensation Article for the same injury. Therefore, for this part of \u00a7 21 (c) (4) to apply a dependent would have to have received an award in a sister-state before the prohibition of the statute could be invoked, in which case that dependent\u2019s (or that set of depen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>dents\u2019) recovery would be limited to an amount not greater than the total compensation provided for the same injury under Article 101. We note that while the ultimate effect of this provision may limit the amount of money the employer-insurer is required to pay out, its primary purpose is to control the amount of compensation a dependent (or set of dependents) is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Applying this reasoning to the facts of the instant case dictates a clear, sound and logical conclusion. Donna Kennedy and her children have neither received, nor even sought compensation in any other jurisdiction. Domenica Grass and her daughter elected to proceed in the State of Virginia where, under that State\u2019s statute, being the lawful wife and daughter of the deceased employee, they were presumed to be totally dependent, though in fact they were only partially dependent. Donna and her children had no control over this election to proceed under Virginia law and were under no compulsion to intercede in that proceeding. The Kennedys were free to choose to proceed in a jurisdiction more favorable to them, which they did. To hold that Domenica and Teresa Grass\u2019s receipt of compensation under the laws of Virginia could bar Donna and her children from recovering in Maryland would in effect make the laws of Virginia supreme and binding in this State. They are not the same dependents and \u00a7 21 (c) (4) does not apply. To adopt the argument advanced by Ryder would drain the life out of the Maryland statute and deprive the Kennedys of their entitlement as Maryland residents. We cannot conclude the legislature intended such an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 21 (c) (4) prohibits the same dependent who recovers a compensation award in a foreign state from recovering total compensation in Maryland for the same injury greater than is provided in Article 101 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">We further believe that an example of the correct application of \u00a7 21 (c) (4) is the denial to Domenica Grass and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>daughter of a partial dependency award in Maryland when they had received an award of total compensation in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">\n<em>Judgment of Circuit Court for Washington County affirmed.
