More particularly, the question is whether an administrative agency appeal board\u2019s order remanding a case to a hearing examiner for further proceedings constitutes a final decision that entitles a party to immediate judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">On 22 November 1978, the petitioner, Maryland Commission on Human Relations (Commission), filed a complaint, <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 9 (b), against the respondent, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (B G &amp; E), alleging that B G &amp; E\u2019s policy of refusing to hire the spouse of an employee constituted discrimination based upon marital status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> B G &amp; E denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that its policy was discriminatory, asserting that it was merely a component of a general \"anti-nepotism policy\u201d that precluded the hiring of all close relatives of employees,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was based upon relational status, not marital status. In addition, B G &amp; E asserted as a defense that even if its policy were discriminatory, business necessity would justify its existence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The Commission issued a \"Written Finding,\u201d <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol., 1982 Cum.Supp.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 10 (a), (b), &amp; (c), that there was \"probable cause\u201d to believe that B G &amp; E \"discriminates against potential employees in the area of hiring, on the basis of marital status, in violation of Article 49B of the Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d An agreement for the elimination of the alleged discriminatory acts was not reached, and the case was transferred to a Hearing Examiner, <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 11 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">After oral argument, the Hearing Examiner, in a written opinion, found that B G &amp; E\u2019s policy of refusing to hire the spouse of an employee did not constitute \u00e1 discriminatory act because \"the anti-nepotism policy considered herein is not one concerning itself with marital status, but is based directly and solely on a relational status to a present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>employee....\u201d Having found no discriminatory act, the Hearing Examiner indicated that the question whether \"business necessity\u201d constituted a defense did not need to be determined. The Hearing Examiner entered an order dismissing the complaint, <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 11 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">The Commission appealed to an Appeal Board of Commissioners (Appeal Board), <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol., 1982 Cum.Supp.), Art. 49B, \u00a7 3 (d). In a written opinion, the Appeal Board indicated that the only issue before it was whether B G &amp; E\u2019s policy of refusing to hire the spouse of an employee was \"violative of Article 49B of the Maryland Code Annotated, in that it is a discriminatory act on the basis of marital status.\u201d The Appeal Board found that that policy was \"a violation of Article 49B of the Annotated Code of Maryland in that it discriminates against potential employees in the area of hiring on the basis of marital status.\u201d On 18 November 1980, the Appeal Board issued a written order remanding the case to the Hearing Examiner \"to determine whether the respondent\u2019s 'close relative policy\u2019 is justified as a matter of business necessity within the intendment of Article 49B, Section 16 (g).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Before a further hearing had been held by a Hearing Examiner, B G &amp; E filed an appeal to the Baltimore City Court (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City), <em>see </em>Md. Code (1957, 1982 Repl. Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7\u00a7 244 (a) &amp; 255 (a) of the Administrative Procedure Act; Md. Rules B1 &amp; B2. There, it raised for the first time, among other things, the contention that the Commission had violated the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 14.03.01.09A (2) (d) requiring that a complaint be authorized by four commissioners.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commission moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the Appeal Board\u2019s 18 November 1980 order remanding the case to the Hearing Examiner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>was not final and, therefore, that B G &amp; E had not exhausted its administrative remedies. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In a written opinion, the trial court found, among other things, that the Commission had violated COMAR 14.03.01.09A (2) (d) because only three commissioners had authorized the complaint. On 22 January 1982, the trial court entered an order remanding the case to the Commission. The Commission filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. While that appeal was pending, the Commission filed a petition for a writ of certiorari that we granted before consideration by the Court of Special Appeals. We shall vacate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">This Court has firmly adhered to the principle that statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies must ordinarily be pursued and exhausted. This principle is not only a requirement of our case law, it is a policy embodied in various enactments of the General Assembly. <em>See, e.g., Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations </em>v. <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 592, 457 A.2d 1146, 1149 (1983); <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations </em>v. <em>Mass Transit Admin., </em>294 Md. 225, 230-31, 449 A.2d 385, 387-88 (1982). The rationale underlying this principle was stated in <em>Soley v. State of Maryland Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526, 356 A.2d 254, 257 (1976). There, this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\"The decisions of an administrative agency are often of a discretionary nature, and frequently require an expertise which the agency can bring to bear in sifting the information presented to it. The agency should be afforded the initial opportunity to exercise that discretion and to apply that expertise. Furthermore, to permit interruption for purposes of judicial intervention at various stages of the administrative process might well undermine the very efficiency which the Legislature intended to achieve in the first instance. Lastly, the courts might be called upon to decide issues which perhaps would never arise if the prescribed administrative remedies were followed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">To exhaust administrative remedies, ordinarily a party must pursue the prescribed administrative procedure to its conclusion and await its final outcome. <em>E.g., Aircraft &amp; Diesel Equip. Corp. v. Hirsch, </em>331 U.S. 752, 767, 67 S.Ct. 1493, 1500 (1947); <em>Steuart Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Comm\u2019rs, St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>38 Md.App. 381, 390, 381 A.2d 1174, 1180 (1978); see 73 C.J.S. <em>Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure </em>\u00a7 41b (1951). Generally, a party can resort to a court only when there is a final order in the administrative proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Kay Constr. Co. v. County Council for Montgomery County, </em>227 Md. 479, 489-90, 177 A.2d 694, 700 (1962); <em>Celanese Corp. v. Bartlett, </em>200 Md. 397, 409, 90 A.2d 208, 214 (1952); <em>Big Vein Coal Co. v. Leasure, </em>192 Md. 435, 437, 64 A.2d 563, 564 (1949). This principle too is not only a requirement of our case law, it is a policy embodied in various enactments of the General Assembly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.), Art. 41, \u00a7 255(a), of the Administrative Procedure Act, applicable here <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is such an enactment. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">\"Right to review. \u2014 Any party aggrieved by a <em>final decision </em>in a contested case, whether such decision is affirmative or negative in form, is entitled to judicial review thereof under this subtitle.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Thus, the basic question here is whether, under the Administrative Procedure Act, an administrative agency appeal board\u2019s order remanding a case to a hearing examiner constitutes a \"final decision\u201d entitling the parties to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">This Court has frequently characterized a final order of a court as a judicial determination that concludes the rights of parties or denies them means of further prosecuting or defending their rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceedings. <em>E.g., Highfield Water Co. v. Washington County Sanitary Dist., </em>295 Md. 410, 415, 456 A.2d 371,373 (1983); <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 5-6, 432 A.2d 1319, 1322 (1981). Thus, this Court has established the general principle that an order of a court is final and appealable when it determines or concludes the rights of the parties and leaves nothing further for the court to do. Applying this general principle, this Court has repeatedly held that a trial court\u2019s order remanding a case to an administrative agency constitutes a final order for the purpose of further judicial review. <em>E.g., Brown v. Baer, </em>291 Md. 377, 386, 435 A.2d 96, 100 (1981); <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 6, 432 A.2d at 1322; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Department of Pub. Safety &amp; Correctional Servs. v. LeVan, </em>288 Md. 533, 544, 419 A.2d 1052, 1057 (1980). Thus in <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 6, 432 A.2d 1319, 1322-23 (1981), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">\"When a court remands a proceeding to an administrative agency, the matter reverts to the processes of the agency, and there is nothing further for the court to do. Such an order is an appealable final order because it terminates the judicial proceeding and denies the parties means of further prosecuting or defending their rights in the judicial proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We are persuaded that the same general principle should apply in determining whether the order of an administrative agency constitutes a \"final decision\u201d entitling a party to immediate judicial review. Although Maryland courts have considered whether certain particular administrative determinations are final actions entitling parties to judicial review, the characteristics of a \"final\u201d administrative action have seldom been described. <em>E.g., Kay Constr. Co., </em>227 Md. at 490, 177 A.2d at 700 (resolution of County Council granting reconsideration of a zoning classification is not a final order); <em>Celanese Corp., </em>200 Md. at 409, 90 A.2d at 214 (decision of the Employment Security Board that \"if otherwise eligible, she is entitled to benefits\u201d is not a final decision); <em>Big Vein Coal Co., </em>192 Md. at 437, 64 A.2d at 564 (order of the State Industrial Accident Commission allowing claimant to amend claim is not a final order). On some few occasions, this Court has indicated that a party is entitled to judicial review of an administrative action if that action disposes of the matter. <em>E.g., Furley v. Warren-Ehret Co., </em>195 Md. 339, 345, 73 A.2d 497, 499 (1949); <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Co. v. Goslin, </em>163 Md. 74, 78, 160 A. 804, 806 (1932); <em>see, e.g., Williams </em>v. <em>McHugh, </em>51 Md.App. 570, 573, 444 A.2d 475, 477 (1982). Thus, in <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Co. v. Goslin, </em>163 Md. 74, 78, 160 A. 804, 806 (1932), this Court, construing a statute providing for judicial review of an administrative agency decision, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>\"But the appeal allowed by the statute, Code, art. 101, sec. 56, as amended by Acts 1927, ch. 587, is not from the findings or opinion of the commission but from its 'decision.\u2019 And <em>by \u2019decision\u2019 is obviously meant the order by which it disposes of the case. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In addition, on some few occasions, the Court of Special Appeals has recognized that a party is entitled to judicial review of an administrative action if that action determines the party\u2019s rights under the agency\u2019s governing statute. <em>E.g., Williams, </em>51 Md.App. at 573, 444 A.2d at 477; <em>Great American Ins. Co. v. Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. 326, 332, 364 A.2d 95, 99 (1976); <em>Flying \u201dA\u201d Service Station </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>17 Md.App. 477, 480-81, 302 A.2d 650, 653 (1973). Thus, in <em>Flying \u201dA\u201d Service Station v. Jordan, </em>17 Md.App. 477, 480-81, 302 A.2d 650, 653 (1973), the Court of Special Appeals in construing a statute providing for judicial review of an administrative agency decision said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\"A decision of the Commission which an aggrieved party is entitled to have reviewed by a court must be an <em>operative order which has the effect of granting or denying some benef\u00edt under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation law. </em>Most often, such a decision is reached by giving effect to multiple findings, but it is the ultimate decision or order, not each individual finding, which is the basis for judicial review. Obviously, in a review of the correctness of a decision or order, each finding that contributed to the final result is examined, and one incorrect finding may make the result incorrect. <em>But the appeal is from the result, rather than from each of its separate elements.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">While Maryland courts have seldom described the attributes of a final administrative action, the United States Supreme Court has frequently articulated the primary characteristics to be considered in determining whether an agency\u2019s action is final for purposes of judicial review. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>long ago as 1927, in <em>United States v. Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad Co., </em>273 U.S. 299, 309-10, 47 S.Ct. 413, 414 (1927), Justice Brandeis, writing for the majority, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiW\">\"The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from doing anything; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege, or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier\u2019s existing or future status or condition; which does not determine any right or obligation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Subsequently, in <em>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., </em>333 U.S. 103, 112-13, 68 S.Ct. 431, 437 (1948), that Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\"[A]dministrative orders are not reviewable unless and until they impose an obligation, deny a right or fix some legal relationship as a consummation of the administrative process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">More recently, in <em>Port of Boston Marine Terminal Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, </em>400 U.S. 62, 71, 91 S.Ct. 203, 209 (1970), Justice Marshall, writing for the majority, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\"[T]he relevant considerations in determining finality are whether the process of administrative decisionmaking has reached a stage where judicial review will not disrupt the orderly process of [administrative] adjudication and whether rights or obligations have been determined or legal consequences will flow from the agency action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">\"Here there was no possible disruption of the administrative process; there was nothing else for the Commission to do.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Most recently, in <em>Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Oil Company of California, </em>449 U.S. 232, 243, 101 S.Ct. 488, 495 (1980), that Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\"In sum, the Commission\u2019s issuance of a complaint averring reason to believe that Socal was violating the Act is not a definitive ruling or regulation. It had no legal force or practical effect upon Socal\u2019s daily business other than the disruptions that accompany any major litigation. And immediate judicial review would serve neither efficiency nor enforcement of the Act. These pragmatic considerations counsel against the conclusion that the issuance of the complaint was 'final agency action.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">All of these cases lead to the conclusion that ordinarily the action of an administrative agency, like the order of a court, is final if it determines or concludes the rights of the parties, or if it denies the parties means of further prosecuting or defending their rights and interests in the subject matter in proceedings before the agency, thus leaving nothing further for the agency to do. Courts in other jurisdictions that have considered the precise question here have applied this general principle and have held that an administrative agency appeal board\u2019s order of remand to a hearing examiner is not final because further agency proceedings are required in order to determine the rights of the parties. <em>See Noranda Aluminum, Inc. v.

We too shall apply the general principle that an administrative agency\u2019s action is final if it determines the rights of the parties and leaves nothing further for the agency to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Here, the Appeal Board found that B G &amp; E\u2019s policy of refusing to hire the spouse of an employee violated Art. 49B. However, although Art. 49B, \u00a7 16 (a) (1) provides that it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against a person on the basis of marital status, the Commission has agreed for the purposes of this case that under Art. 49B, \u00a7 16 (g) (1), such discrimination is lawful if required by \"business necessity.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, the Appeal Board\u2019s finding of a violation of Art. 49B does not necessarily constitute a finding that B G &amp; E had engaged in an unlawful discriminatory act.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">The Appeal Board explicitly delineated the nature of the purported \"violation\u201d of Art. 49B when it said that B G &amp; E \"discriminates against potential employees in the area of hiring on the basis of marital status.\u201d Additionally, the Appeal Board\u2019s order remanded the case to the Hearing Examiner to determine whether B G &amp; E\u2019s policy was justified by \"business necessity.\u201d When read in context, it is clear that, notwithstanding the use of the word \"violation,\u201d the Appeal Board found nothing more than that B G &amp; E had engaged in a discriminatory act. It did not determine whether that discriminatory act was unlawful. That issue was left unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Moreover, the Appeal Board\u2019s order did not command B G &amp; E to do or refrain from doing anything; did not grant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>deny any benefit to which B G &amp; E was entitled under the law; did not subject B G &amp; E to any liability, civil or criminal; and did not change B G &amp; E\u2019s existing or future status. Indeed, no legal consequence of any kind flowed from the Appeal Board\u2019s order. In short, the Appeal Board\u2019s order did not determine or conclude B G &amp; E\u2019s rights and obligations. Those rights and obligations will not be determined until there has been further agency action. Manifestly, the Appeal Board\u2019s order did not dispose of the matter. The administrative proceeding was not terminated and B G &amp; E was not denied the means of further prosecuting and defending its rights in the administrative proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Under the present circumstances, the Appeal Board\u2019s order remanding the case to a Hearing Examiner was not a final decision entitling B G &amp; E to immediate judicial review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This result is consonant with the rationale underlying the principle requiring the exhaustion of statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies. The Commission is afforded the initial opportunity to determine whether the discriminatory act is required by business necessity and is, therefore, lawful \u2014 an issue that involves questions of fact and law requiring the application of agency expertise. In addition, the efficiency of the unconsummated administrative process is not undermined by premature judicial interruption. Finally, waiting for the Commission to determine whether B G &amp; E\u2019s discriminatory act is required by business necessity and is, therefore, lawful, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>avoids the necessity of a judicial determination of issues that might not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We now hold that the order of the Appeal Board remanding the case to a Hearing Examiner for further proceedings was not a final decision that entitles B G &amp; E to immediate judicial review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the trial court and shall remand the case to that court with instructions to dismiss B G &amp; E\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Baltimore City Court (now the Circuit Court for Baltimore City) vacated.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\n<em>Case remanded to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City with instructions to dismiss.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by respondent.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-11\">.

Art. 49B, \u00a7 16 (g) does not explicitly provide that it is not an unlawful employment practice to hire on the basis of marital status if marital status is a qualification reasonably necessary to the occupation or business. In this case, the Commission has not raised the question whether \"business necessity\u201d is a defense to a charge of marital status discrimination. Rather, it has agreed that, for the purpose of this case, a showing of business necessity would excuse such discrimination. Under these circumstances, the question whether under Art. 49B, \u00a7 16 (g) (1) a showing of business necessity constitutes a defense to a charge of marital status discrimination is not considered here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\">. We note that B G &amp; E contends that \"the Commission\u2019s own rules [COMAR 14.03.01.08F] recognize that any decision of the Appeal Board to affirm, reverse or modify the Hearing Examiner\u2019s provisional order constitutes a final decision and order which is subject to judicial review.\u201d Thus, B G &amp; E asserts that COMAR 14.03.01.08F characterizes any decision or order of the Appeal Board as a \"final decision\u201d within the scope of Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a). COMAR 14.03.01.08F provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">\"F. Decision and Order. The Appeal Board <em>may affirm, reverse, or modify </em>the provisional order in accordance with the standards as set forth in Article 41, \u00a7 255 (g), Annotated Code of Maryland, and shall issue the <em>appropriate final decision and order </em>which shall set forth a concise statement of the conclusions reached upon each contested issue on appeal.

In essence, B G &amp; E asserts that COMAR 14.03.01.08F constitutes an administrative interpretation of the words \"final decision\u201d appearing in Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a) as encompassing any decision or order of the Appeal Board. While an administrative interpretation of statute is entitled to some weight, it is not binding upon the courts. Comptroller of the Treasury v. John C. Louis Co., 285 Md. 527, 543, 404 A.2d 1045, 1055 (1979). This Court has here determined that the Appeal Board\u2019s remand order was not a final appealable decision because it neither determined B G &amp; E\u2019s rights nor terminated the administrative proceeding. It, therefore, lacked the characteristics necessary for finality. An administrative agency cannot by rule transform an order that lacks the characteristics necessary for finality into a final appealable decision within the scope of Art. 41, \u00a7 255 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b105-16\">. We note that B G &amp; E, relying upon <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 285, 418 A.2d 1155, 1161 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 1083, 101 S.Ct. 869 (1981), alternatively contends that, even if there is no final decision here, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply because the issues decided by the trial court did not involve or require agency expertise. B G &amp; E\u2019s reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">Ordinarily, when questions concern the application and interpretation of an agency\u2019s governing statute and rules, none of the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies apply. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 295 Md. at 596, 457 A.2d at 1151; Mass Transit Admin., 294 Md. at 232-33,449 A.2d at 388-89. Here, all of the questions decided by the trial court concerned alleged procedural violations of the Commission\u2019s governing statute and rules and, therefore, involved the application and interpretation of the statute and rules. Under these circumstances, none of the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of statutorily prescribed administrative and judicial remedies apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
