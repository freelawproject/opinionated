For reasons to follow below, we shall affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">The genesis of the present controversy occurred in 1979 when the appellee, Mary Alice Clark, mother of the five minor children who are the subject of appellant\u2019s petition, contacted the appellant for services. Homemaker service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>was provided and marriage counseling recommended, although Mr. Clark had allegedly already deserted the family. Subsequently, in 1980, the children were removed from the home pursuant to an order from the juvenile court and placed in foster care. After two years in such placement elapsed,, the instant petition was filed based on Maryland Code (1957, 1981 Repl. Vol.), Article 16, \u00a7 75.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a hearing, the chancellor dismissed the petition on two grounds: (1) the presumption of best interests of the children provided in the statute was unconstitutional, and (2) the appellant had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the parental rights of Mrs. Clark should be terminated as being in the best interests of the children. An appeal to the Court of Special Appeals was taken by the Department; wb granted certiorari prior to consideration by that court to determine issues of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The appellant has raised four issues before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-5\">\" 1. Whether the two year presumption contained in Maryland\u2019s adoption law (Md. Ann. Code Art. 16, \u00a7 76(c) is constitutional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">2. Whether the Chancellor erred in failing to apply the test of the best interest of the child to these proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">3. Whether the Chancellor erred in failing to consider all of the factors required to be considered by Maryland Annotated Code, Art. 16, \u00a7 76(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">4. Whether the Chancellor\u2019s failure to appoint counsel to represent the children requires a remand of the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">Section 76 of Article 16, Md. Code (1957, 1981 Repl. Vol., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>1982 Cum. Supp.),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> effective July 1, 1982, and thus controlling this case which was heard and ruled upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>thereafter, is a comprehensive statutory scheme governing adoptions or guardianship of minors when the consent of the natural parents has not been obtained. As can be seen, the legislature has provided in sub-section (a) that the court may grant a decree if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that termination of the natural parents\u2019 rights is in the child\u2019s best interest and that one or more of certain designated circumstances exist. By sub-section (c), however, the legislature provided that when a child has been under continuous foster care in the custody of a child placement agency for at least two years (as here), the court <em>shall </em>presume that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to award to that child placement agency a decree granting guardianship, without the consent of the parents. Thus the requirement of \"clear and convincing evidence\u201d has been eliminated, the effect being that upon the mere showing of the two-year period of continuous foster care the \"best interests of the child\u201d is presumed and the decree should be granted, or, said another way, the legislature has provided that the presumption supplies the \"clear and convincing evidence\u201d requirement of sub-section (a) unless overcome by evidence to the contrary offered by the parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The chancellor found sub-section (c) of \u00a7 76 unconstitutional on the authority of <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). In that case, the Supreme Court held that before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process required that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence; it therefore-concluded that New York\u2019s \"fair preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard prescribed by its Family Court Act for the termination of parental rights denied the parents due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">In his Memorandum Opinion filed in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the chancellor quoted extensively from <em>Santosky </em>and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\"Based upon the Court\u2019s interpretation of the law decided in <em>Santosky, </em>which this Court is duly bound to follow, Sec. 76 (c) of Art. 16 is not constitutional. (Santosky holds that in a case to terminate parental rights on a permanent basis, the minimum standard of proof to satisfy due process must be by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-6\">The statutory presumption created by Art. 16, Sec. 76 (c) fails to meet the minimum standard \u2014 clear and convincing evidence \u2014 mandated under the <em>Santosky </em>holding. Therefore, the court holds that Art. 16, Sec. 76 (c) is unconstitutional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The appellant asserts that \"[t]he Chancellor\u2019s reliance on <em>Santosky </em>was misplaced\u201d as that case \"does not prohibit the use of presumptions in cases involving the termination of parental rights.\u201d Relying on <em>Mobile, Jackson, &amp; Kansas City Railroad v. Turnipseed, </em>219 U.S. 35, 43, 31 S.Ct. 136, 138, 55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>L.Ed. 78, 80 (1910), appellant contends that a presumption is constitutional when there is \"some rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed\u201d and that this standard is met in Art. 16, \u00a7 76 (c) because \"it is highly probable that it is in the best interest of a child who has been in foster care for over two continuous years to have parental rights terminated in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d (Footnote in appellant\u2019s brief omitted). Moreover, appellant urges us to uphold the constitutionality of the presumption in \u00a7 76 (c) on the basis of <em>Keeney v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>43 Md. App. 688, 406 A.2d 955 (1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 748 (1980), wherein the Court of Special-Appeals held that the predecessor to \u00a7 76 (c) (i.e., Code (1957, 1981 Repl. Vol.), Art. 16, \u00a7 75) did not offend either equal protection or due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Appellee, on the other hand, contends that the chancellor correctly relied on <em>Santosky </em>and that \u00a7 76 (c) is unconstitutionally violative of the due process clause in that it fails to specify a standard of proof. Alternatively, appellee argues that \u00a7 76 (c) places an unconstitutional burden of proof upon the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In our view, the instant case does not have the problem that was raised in <em>Santosky </em>since the Maryland statute requires clear and convincing evidence. The problem here simply is whether the legislature may satisfy the due process rights of Mrs. Clark by providing, by presumption, the clear and convincing proof needed to warrant termination of her parental rights to raise her children. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In <em>Santosky, </em>the Supreme Court clearly reaffirmed its earlier holdings that \"freedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 455 U.S. at 753, 102 S.Ct. at 1394, 71 L.Ed.2d at 606 (numerous citations omitted). That is to say that, in such instances, the parents are entitled to due process and that due process requires that permanent termination of the parents\u2019 right to the care, custody and management of their child will not be granted except upon clear and convincing evidence. Furthermore, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Court has held that a State statutory evidentiary presumption may not be inconsistent with a matter of federal constitutional law. <em>See New York Times Company v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 283-84, 84 S.Ct. 710, 727-29, 11 L.Ed.2d 686, 708-09 (1964). Nor can the creation of a statutory presumption be a means of escape from constitutional restrictions. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>219 U.S. 219, 239, 31 S.Ct. 145, 150-51, 55 L.Ed. 191, 200 (1911).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">In the instant case, the legislature, while requiring clear and convincing evidence that termination is in the best interests of the child, has provided that such standard shall be presumed when the child has been in foster care for two or more continuous years, thus relieving the State of any further burden of proof. In our view, a parents\u2019 right to procedural due process is violated by such presumption. Accordingly, we hold that sub-section (c) of \u00a7 76, Art. 16, is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Subsequent to holding \u00a7 76 (c) unconstitutional, the chancellor proceeded to \"consider whether the Department of Social Services is entitled to the relief it seeks under any alternative theory.\u201d Specifically, the chancellor considered the petition and relief sought in terms of sub-sections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 76. See note 2 herein. After going through the various provisions of these sub-sections and giving an in-depth analysis of the facts of the instant case, the chancellor concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">\"The efforts made by the Department of Social Services, in light of the drastic relief it seeks \u2014 to terminate her parental rights forever \u2014 were too little and too late. * * * The Court is not persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that the Department has met its burden of proof. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>In the words of <em>Santosky, </em>the factfinding does not purport \u2014 and is not intended \u2014 to balance the child\u2019s interest in a normal family home against the parents\u2019 interest in raising the child. Nor does it purport to determine whether the natural parent or the foster parents would provide the better home. Rather, the factfinding hearing pits the State directly against the parent. The State alleges here that the natural parent is at fault. In order to find for the Department of Social Services at this time, the Court must find that Mrs. Clark is unfit to raise her own children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Appellant argues that the chancellor erroneously applied a standard of parental fitness rather than the best interests of the child. We find this argument to be without merit. It is well established, and \u00a7 76 makes it very clear, that when the State seeks to terminate parental rights without the consent of the parents, the matter should be determined on the basis of what is in the best interest of the child. <em>See, e.g., Shetler v. Fink, </em>231 Md. 302, 306-07, 190 A.2d 76, 78 (1963); <em>Winter v. Director, </em>217 Md. 391, 395-96, 143 A.2d 81, 84 (1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 912, 79 S.Ct. 242, 3 L.Ed.2d 233 (1958). We believe the chancellor correctly considered the best interests of the children in reaching his decision. Throughout his Memorandum Opinion, the chancellor made numerous references to this standard. Appellant has taken one statement out of a 13 page Memorandum Opinion and, on the basis of that statement, argues the chancellor applied the wrong standard. In fact, in the very next sentence, the chancellor pointed out that \"[t]he indefinite continuation of the <em>status quo </em>is clearly not in the best interest of the five Clark children. * * * \u201d Accordingly, we find no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellant next argues that the chancellor erred in not considering all the factors contained in \u00a7 76 (b) with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to his alternative rulings. We agree. Although, as we stated above, the chancellor gave an in-depth analysis of the facts as related to the provisions of the statute, we observe that no mention was made of sub-sections (b) (3) or (b) (4). We believe that, upon remand, the chancellor should make findings of fact as to each item listed in (b) so that a reviewing court will be able to properly perform its function.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Appellant\u2019s final argument is that the chancellor erred in not appointing counsel to represent the Clark children pursuant to Code (1957,1981 Repl. Vol., 1982 Cum. Supp.), Art. 16, \u00a7 77B (a) (4),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, therefore, the case should be remanded for further proceedings. Although appellee agrees that the Code mandates appointment of counsel for the children, she contends that the error in this instance was harmless. Appellee asserts that because all the witnesses were extensively cross-examined, it is unlikely that any further evidence could be adduced by counsel appointed to represent the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">We agree with appellant and, accordingly, shall remand this case to the Circuit Court for Washington County because of the failure of the chancellor to comply with \u00a7 77B (a) (4). This section requires the appointment of separate counsel to represent the person who is the subject of the instant proceeding which is one for the involuntary termination of parental rights. While the record does not reflect that this requirement was brought to the chancellor\u2019s attention, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>we observe that the very persons for whom the statute was designed are too young to have raised the issue. In our view, the statute is mandatory and its violation requires us to remand the case as we cannot say that the children here were not prejudiced by the lack of an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed in part; remanded to the Circuit Court for Washington County for further proceedings consistent with this opinion; costs to be paid by the appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-13\">.
