Gordon Loetz, Sr., the president and owner of Columbia Marketing Corporation, for the purchase of a restaurant franchise. Pursuant to this agreement, in October 1977, Rezapolvi paid Loetz a total of $13,622 as a deposit. According to the uncontradicted testimony, after Loetz failed to find a location for the franchise within 30 days, as provided by the contract, and after Loetz raised the price of the franchise from $40,000 to $100,000, Rezapolvi requested that Loetz return his deposit. On December 1, 1977, Loetz personally delivered to Rezapolvi a check in the amount of $13,622. The check was drawn on Columbia Marketing\u2019s account with the First National Bank of Maryland. The check was signed by Stanley E. Lloyd, an employee of Columbia Marketing, whose signature was not an \"authorized\u201d signature for the Columbia Marketing account. Accompanying the check was the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">\"December 1, 1977</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">Kamal Relapolvi [sic]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">Inclosed [sic] you will find our check for $13,622.00 which represents your deposit for an Old Western Chicken 'N\u2019 Chips Restaurant. I am returning your deposit at your request. Mrs. Merhadi will be purchasing an Old Western Chicken 'N\u2019 Chips Restaurant this evening. This cancellation is contingent upon Mrs. Merhadi\u2019s participation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">Sincerely yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">/s/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">R. Gordon Loetz, Sr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-13\">President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-14\">RGL/pd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQv\">end: check\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The next morning, Friday, December 2, 1977, Rezapolvi brought the Columbia Marketing check to First National\u2019s branch in Bethesda, Maryland, where he endorsed the check in blank and exchanged it and a one dollar service charge for a cashier\u2019s check payable to himself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before issuing the cashier\u2019s check, the head teller checked Rezapolvi\u2019s identification, and determined that there was no stop payment order on Columbia Marketing\u2019s check and that Columbia Marketing\u2019s account contained sufficient funds to cover its check. The teller then placed a hold on those funds so that they could not be paid out on other items. The teller did not follow standard procedure and ascertain whether the Columbia Marketing check contained an authorized signature. Rezapolvi then deposited the cashier\u2019s check in his account at the American Security and Trust Company bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">On Monday, December 5, 1977, Loetz, apparently unaware that the Columbia Marketing check had already been paid by a cashier\u2019s check, sent his secretary to First National\u2019s branch in Columbia, Maryland, for the purpose of placing a stop payment order on the Columbia Marketing check. Someone at First National\u2019s branch in Columbia contacted the manager of First National\u2019s Bethesda branch, Frances Manus, because the Bethesda branch had placed a hold on Columbia Marketing\u2019s funds in its account. Manus testified that she then contacted Loetz who stated that Columbia Marketing\u2019s check could not properly have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>paid because of insufficient funds. After being informed that Columbia Marketing had sufficient funds, Loetz replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">\"Well, you ... still couldn\u2019t have [properly cashed the check] . . . because someone else signed the check. I didn\u2019t sign the check. I <em>had someone else sign the check </em>... I did intend to come into the Branch and give you new signature cards with this new person\u2019s [Stanley Lloyd\u2019s] signature and resolutions but there was a meeting and we just, you know, didn\u2019t get around to it.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">When Manus attempted to pursue the matter with Loetz, he responded, \"Well, you know, I can\u2019t do anything about it... . I had someone else sign the check and you\u2019re the one that gave the money.\u201d Manus thereupon issued a stop payment order on the cashier\u2019s check and released the hold on Columbia Marketing\u2019s account.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A few days later, Rezapolvi received a telephone call from American Security and Trust Company informing him that First National had stopped payment on the cashier\u2019s check and that Rezapolvi could retrieve the cashier\u2019s check from an American Security and Trust Company office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Subsequently, Rezapolvi telephoned Loetz and requested another check. Loetz replied, \"Don\u2019t talk to me. I cancelled your contract, and I gave you a check. This is between you and your bank.... You got your check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7Q\">In November 1979, Rezapolvi commenced this action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking damages from First National for its dishonor of its cashier\u2019s check. After a trial by the court, judgment was entered in favor of First National. Rezapolvi appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to a decision by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Preliminarily, it should be emphasized that two separate negotiable instruments are involved in this case \u2014 the Columbia Marketing check and First National\u2019s cashier\u2019s check. Furthermore, the parties to the checks differ with the exception of the plaintiff, Rezapolvi. Before turning to First National\u2019s specific argument as to why it was entitled to dishonor the cashier\u2019s check, we shall discuss more generally both negotiable instruments, dealing first with the Columbia Marketing check and second with the cashier\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The first instrument in this case, the Columbia Marketing check, was accepted and paid prior to Columbia Marketing\u2019s attempted stop payment order. Although acceptance and payment are normally viewed as separate events, if a check has been paid it has clearly been accepted. First National accepted and paid the Columbia Marketing check when it issued its cashier\u2019s check in return for the Columbia Marketing check. The issuance of the cashier\u2019s check represented both a promise to pay the Columbia Marketing check and payment of the check. <em>See Citizens &amp; Southern Nat. Bank v. </em>Youngblood, 135 Ga.App. 638, 219 S.E.2d 172, 173 (1975); <em>Page v. Holmes-Darst Coal Co., </em>269 Mich. 159, 162-165, 256 N.W. 840 (1934); <em>Friends in Need Society v. Peterson, </em>9 S.W.2d 1110, 1111 (Tex. Civ. App. 1928). 2 <em>Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code, Commercial Paper, </em>\u00a7 12.16[1] (W. Willier &amp; F. Hart ed. 1982); <em>Brady on Bank Checks, </em>\u00a7 4.8 (H. Bailey 5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Furthermore, contrary to the assertion in First National\u2019s brief, the later nonpayment of the cashier\u2019s check did not change the fact that the Columbia Marketing check had been paid. \"A holder who accepts a bank instrument on which the bank is obligor, such as a cashier\u2019s check or a bank draft, has ... been paid whether or not the bank instrument is ever paid.\u201d 2 <em>Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Commercial Paper, supra, </em>at \u00a7 12.16[1], <em>See </em>\u00a7 4-213 of the Uniform Commercial Code, Maryland Code (1975), \u00a7 4-213 of the Commercial Law Article, and Official Comment point 2 (Final payment does not depend on whether bank\u2019s remittance draft was itself paid).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also Brady on Bank Checks, supra, </em>at \u00a7 4-8. Under \u00a7 3-802 (1), \"[ujnless otherwise agreed where an instrument is taken for an underlying obligation (a) the obligation is pro tanto discharged if a bank is drawer, maker or acceptor of the instrument and there is no recourse on the instrument against the underlying obligor.\u201d When First National issued its cashier\u2019s check in exchange for the Columbia Marketing check, Columbia Marketing\u2019s obligation as drawer of its check was pro tanto discharged, and Rezapolvi would not be able to recover from Columbia Marketing on its check to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The traditional definition of a cashier\u2019s check has been set forth in a multitude of cases, both prior to and after the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code. One leading opinion stated it as follows <em>(State of Pa. v. Curtiss Nat. Bank of Miami Springs, Fla., </em>427 F.2d 395, 398 (5th Cir. 1970)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\"A cashier\u2019s check is defined as a bill of exchange drawn by a bank upon itself and accepted in advance by the act of its issuance and not subject to countermand by either its purchaser or the issuing bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">A recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, holding that a bank was not entitled to dishonor its own cashier\u2019s check, and that the timeliness under the Uniform Commercial Code of the dishonor notice was immaterial, said <em>(Swiss Credit Bank v. Virginia Nat. Bank-Fairfax, </em>538 F.2d 587, 588 (4th Cir. 1976)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>\"We see no need to reach the question of timeliness of the notice of dishonor. A cashier\u2019s check is a bill of exchange drawn by a bank upon itself. It is accepted in advance by the act of its issuance, and it cannot be dishonored by the issuing bank because of an indebtedness to it of one of its customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Also a \"cashier\u2019s check, purchased for adequate consideration, unlike an ordinary check, stands on its own foundation as an independent, unconditional and primary obligation of the Bank.\u201d <em>State of Pa. v. Curtiss Nat. Bank of Miami Springs, Fla., supra, </em>427 F.2d at 400. \"[T]he general rule [is] that the act of issuing a cashier\u2019s check <em>binds </em>the issuing bank to pay the instrument and the bank is not allowed to stop payment on it.\u201d <em>Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. v. Farmers Nat. Bank, Etc., </em>624 F.2d 105, 109-110 (10th Cir. 1980). <em>See, e.g., TPO Incorporated v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., </em>487 F.2d 131, 135 (3d Cir. 1973); <em>Banco Ganadero y Agricola v. Soc. Nat. Bk., Cleve., </em>418 F.Supp. 520, 523 (N.D. Ohio 1976); <em>Kaufman v. Chase Manhattan Bank, National Ass\u2019n, </em>370 F.Supp. 276, 278 (S.D.N.Y. 1973); <em>Gillespie v. Riley Management Corporation, </em>59 Ill.2d 211, 319 N.E.2d 753, 756 (1974); <em>Louis Falcigno Enterprises </em>v. <em>Mass. Bank, </em>14 Mass.App. 92, 436 N.E.2d 993 (1982); <em>Thompson Poultry v. First Nat. Bank of York, </em>199 Neb. 8, 255 N.W.2d 856, 858 (1977); <em>Santos v.

Giordano, </em>111 N.J.Super. 347, 268 A.2d 327, 328-329 (1970); <em>Dziurak v. Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., </em>44 N.Y.2d 776, 377 N.E.2d 474, 406 N.Y.S.2d 30, 31 (1978); <em>Wertz </em>v. <em>Richardson Heights Bank And Trust, </em>495 S.W.2d 572, 574 (Tex. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Moreover, courts have recognized and given effect to the public perception of a cashier\u2019s check. According to one court, \"[a] cashier\u2019s check circulates in the commercial world as the equivalent of cash.... People accept a cashier\u2019s check as a substitute for cash because the bank stands behind it, rather than an individual.\u201d <em>National Newark &amp; Essex Bank </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>v. Giordano, supra, </em>268 A.2d at 329. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has pointed to \"the strong considerations of public policy favoring negotiability and reliability of cashier\u2019s checks.\u201d <em>TPO Incorporated v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., supra, </em>487 F.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Although the traditional view is that a cashier\u2019s check is a draft or a bill of exchange drawn by the bank upon itself, there has been some disagreement by a few authorities concerning the classification of a cashier\u2019s check under the Uniform Commercial Code. While Article 3 of the Code, governing negotiable instruments, fails to even mention the term \"cashier\u2019s check,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> some recent authorities classify a cashier\u2019s check as a note because of \u00a7 3-118 (a) which states that \"[a] draft drawn on the drawer is effective as a note.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, whether we label a cashier\u2019s check as a note or a draft is unimportant in the instant case because \u00a7 3-413 imposes equivalent obligations on the maker of a note, the acceptor of a draft and the drawer of a draft (once the draft has been dishonored).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\"\u00a7 3-413. Contract of maker, drawer and acceptor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">(1) The maker or acceptor engages that he will pay the instrument according to its tenor at the time of his engagement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">(2) The drawer engages that upon dishonor of the draft and any necessary notice of dishonor or protest he will pay the amount of the draft to the holder or to any indorser who takes it up. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Thus, regardless of whether First National\u2019s cashier\u2019s check is classified as a draft or a note, First National generally had the duty to honor the check. <em>See </em>6E <em>Bender\u2019s Uniform Commercial Code, Reporter-Digest, </em>\u00a7 4-403 (A8., comment 1) (W. Willier &amp; F. Hart ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Despite the language in some opinions suggesting that a bank may never dishonor its cashier\u2019s check,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>recognized that a bank may do so under very limited conditions. These are where the holder has dealt with the bank in connection with the transaction or is not a holder in due course, <em>and </em>where the cashier\u2019s check was obtained by fraud upon the bank or, under certain circumstances, where there was no consideration given to the bank for the instrument. <em>See generally Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. v. Farmers Nat. Bank, supra, </em>624 F.2d at 110; <em>Matter of Johnson, </em>552 F.2d 1072, 1078 n. 5 (4th Cir. 1977); <em>TPO Incorporated v.

Mass. Bank, supra, </em>436 N.E.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Against this background, we shall now address First National\u2019s argument as to why it was entitled to dishonor its cashier\u2019s check. The bank contends that the \"unauthorized\u201d signature on the Columbia Marketing check rendered it not properly payable and that, for this reason, the Columbia Marketing check furnished no consideration for the cashier\u2019s check. This argument must be rejected for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\"><em>First, </em>there simply was no unauthorized signature for purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 1-201 (43) states that an \" '[unauthorized signature or indorsement\u2019 means one made without actual, implied or apparent authority, and includes a forgery.\u201d In <em>Taylor v. Equitable Trust Co., </em>269 Md. 149, 156, 304 A.2d 838 (1973), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>this Court, citing \u00a7 1-201 (43), pointed out that where the authority to sign an Instrument was expressly given by a principal to an agent, or implied, or based on apparent authority, the signature was not an unauthorized one under the Uniform Commercial Code. The rule was the same before the adoption of the Code. <em>Trust Co. v. Subscribers, Etc., </em>150 Md. 470, 475-476, 133 A. 319 (1926); <em>Building Association v. Fisher, </em>140 Md. 666, 670, 118 A. 164 (1922) (stating that \"the signature of any party to a negotiable instrument may be made by 'a duly authorized agent,\u2019 that no particular form of appointment is necessary, and that 'the authority of the agent may be established as in other cases of agency\u2019\u201d). In the instant case, the evidence is uncontradicted that Loetz, the president and owner of Columbia Marketing, expressly authorized an employee to sign the Columbia Marketing check; in fact, he <em>directed </em>the employee to sign the check. While First National may have been entitled to decline payment of the Columbia Marketing check because the employee\u2019s name was not yet included on the signature card, the signature was nevertheless expressly authorized by the drawer. The Columbia Marketing check, which the bank paid, did not contain an unauthorized signature in light of \u00a7 1-201 (43).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Second, </em>even if the agent\u2019s signature on the Columbia Marketing check had initially been unauthorized, Columbia Marketing clearly ratified the signature and would be estopped from asserting a lack of authority. A signature, although initially unauthorized, may be ratified by one with the power to sign, or the latter may be precluded from denying authority. <em>Taylor v. Equitable Trust Co., supra, </em>269 Md. at 159-162; <em>Williams v. Johnson, </em>261 Md. 463, 467-468, 276 A.2d 95 (1971); <em>Martin Co. v. Fidelity Bank, </em>218 Md. 28, 32, 145 A.2d 267 (1958); <em>Union Trust Co. v. Soble, </em>192 Md. 427, 431, 64 A.2d 744 (1949); <em>Trust Co. v. Subscribers, Etc., supra, </em>150 Md. at 475-476. Under \u00a7 3-404, an unauthorized signature is operative as the signature of an authorized person if the latter ratifies it or is precluded from denying it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and such ratification is \"for all purposes of this title.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The uncontradicted testimony at trial concerning Loetz\u2019s conduct and statements, along with the letter accompanying the Columbia Marketing check, conclusively shows that Loetz ratified the signature of his employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Third, </em>if we assume arguendo that the signature on the Columbia Marketing check was initially unauthorized and was not ratified, such lack of authority would not aid First National in this case. Under the rule of <em>Price v. Neal, </em>3 Burr. 1354 (1762), as codified in \u00a7 3-417 (1) (b), a drawee who pays an instrument with an unauthorized signature is bound on his acceptance or payment unless the person presenting the instrument knew that the signature was unauthorized.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \"[A] drawee of a draft is presumed to know the signature of his customer, the drawer.\u201d Official Comment to \u00a7 3-417, point 4. As previously discussed, First National paid the Columbia Marketing check when it issued its cashier\u2019s check. It is also clear that Rezapolvi had no knowledge that Stanley Lloyd\u2019s signature might have been unauthorized at the time Rezapolvi presented the Columbia Marketing check. Thus, under <em>Price </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>First National cannot avail itself of the defense of failure of consideration on the ground that the Columbia Marketing check contained an unauthorized signature that rendered it not properly payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">Alternatively, First National asserts that even if it is liable on the cashier\u2019s check, it is entitled to recoup from Rezapolvi an equal amount of money under \u00a7 4-407 (c) of the Uniform Commercial Code. That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\"\u00a7 4-407. Payor Bank\u2019s Right to Subrogation on Improper Payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">If a payor bank has paid an item over the stop-payment order of the drawer or maker or otherwise under circumstances giving a basis for objection by the drawer or maker, to prevent unjust enrichment and only to the extent necessary to prevent loss to the bank by reason of its payment of the item, the payor bank shall be subrogated to the rights</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(a) Of any holder in due course on the item against the drawer or maker; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">(b) Of the payee or any other holder of the item against the drawer or maker either on the item or under the transaction out of which the item arose; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">(c) Of the drawer or maker against the payee or any other holder of the item with respect to the transaction out of which the item arose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">To come within \u00a7 4-407, First National must show that it paid the Columbia Marketing check either in spite of a timely stop payment order or \"under circumstances giving a basis for objection\u201d by Columbia Marketing. In addition, First National must show that Columbia Marketing had a valid claim against the payee Rezapolvi.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Section 4-407 affords no basis for recoupment because the bank neither paid the Columbia Marketing check over a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>stop-payment order nor paid it under circumstances giving a basis for objection by the drawer. First National does not dispute the fact that no stop payment order had been received when the Columbia Marketing check was paid. It claims, however, that the alleged unauthorized signature furnished the drawer with a valid ground for objection to the bank\u2019s payment of the Columbia Marketing check. But, for the reasons set forth in Part II above, Columbia Marketing had no valid basis for objecting to the payment of its check signed by an employee at the direction of its president and owner. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 3-406 (negligence of drawer or maker contributing to unauthorized signature); Note, <em>Forgeries and Material Alterations: Allocation of Risks Under the Uniform Commercial Code, </em>50 B.U.L. Rev. 536, 543-551 (1970).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, First National was not entitled to dishonor its cashier\u2019s check payable to Rezapolvi; nor was First National entitled to subrogation under \u00a7 4-407 (c). We therefore hold that Rezapolvi is entitled to damages because of First National\u2019s dishonor of its cashier\u2019s check.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Case remanded to that Court for a determination of the appellant\u2019s damages and the entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\n<em>Appellee to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\">. The testimony at trial conflicted as to the conversation accompanying this transaction. Rezapolvi testified that he initially had asked the teller to cash the Columbia check, that the teller had obtained approval to cash it, that the teller was handing Rezapolvi the proceeds when she inquired whether he would prefer a cashier\u2019s check, to which he responded, \"As long as the cashier check is cash money, it\u2019s all right with me,\u201d and that the teller thereupon issued a cashier\u2019s check, charging Rezapolvi a one dollar service charge. According to the teller, Rezapolvi did not ask her to cash the Columbia check but rather asked her to issue a cashier\u2019s check therefor. The trial court did not expressly or impliedly resolve this conflicting testimony in its findings of fact or decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b51-7\">. From the testimony at trial it seems that Columbia Marketing thereafter closed its account at First National, leaving no money in the bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b51-8\">. First National has not returned either the Columbia Marketing check or the one dollar fee it had charged for its cashier\u2019s check to Rezapolvi. It is unclear from the testimony whether First National tendered the Columbia Marketing check to Rezapolvi after it dishonored its cashier\u2019s check.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b53-8\">.

Section 3-118(a) arose from \u00a7 17(5) of the Negotiable Instruments Law. Section 17(5) provided that \"[wjhere the instrument is so ambiguous that there is doubt whether it is a bill or a note, the holder may treat it as either at his election.\u201d The provision was enacted for the benefit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>holder to permit the holder to resort to those provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law most advantageous to his position. <em>See </em>Funk v. Babbit, 156 Ill. 408, 41 N.E. 166 (1895). The Official Comment to \u00a7 3-118, poiht 2, indicates that the Code drafters intended to retain this advantage for the holder: \"The language of the original Section 17 (5) is changed to make clear that the provision is not limited to ambiguities of phrasing, but extends to any case where the form of the instrument leaves its character as a draft or a note in doubt.\u201d Thus, if it is beneficial the holder may choose to treat the instrument as a note, <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7 3-409 (1) (\"Draft not an assignment\u201d) or as a draft, <em>see, e.g., </em>\u00a7 3-410 (1). <em>See </em>Taylor v. Equitable Trust Co., 269 Md. 149, 156, 304 A.2d 838 (1973) (treating cashier\u2019s check as note for purposes of that case); <em>see also </em>Santos v.

Ct. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">Some of these cases, after pointing out that a cashier\u2019s check is accepted upon issuance, have relied on \u00a7 4-303 of the Uniform Commercial Code to conclude that the acceptance absolutely precludes a later dishonor by the bank. <em>See, e.g., </em>National Newark &amp; Essex Bank v. Giordano, <em>supra, </em>268 A.2d at 329. In our view, however, this reliance is misplaced. Section 4-303 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">\"(1) Any knowledge, notice or stop-order received by, legal process served upon or setoff exercised by a payor bank, whether or not effective under other rules of law to terminate, suspend or modify the bank\u2019s right or duty to pay an item or to charge its customer\u2019s account for the item, comes too late to so terminate, suspend or modify such right or duty if the knowledge, notice, stop-order or legal process is received or served and a reasonable time for the bank to act thereon expires or the setoff is exercised after the bank has done any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\">(a) Accepted or certified the item;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">Section 4-303 has no application in this context because the section concerns a customer\u2019s right to place a stop payment order on the customer\u2019s check and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>does not concern a bank\u2019s right to dishonor its own checks. <em>See </em>TPO Incorporated v.

Whether or not Rezapolvi is a holder in due course of the cashier\u2019s check is immaterial in this case because, under \u00a7 3-305(2) (a), Rezapolvi took the instrument free from \"[a]ll defenses of any party to the instrument with whom the holder has not dealt.\u201d As Rezapolvi dealt with First National in obtaining the check, he took it subject to the bank\u2019s defenses.
