Trust Co., 274 Pa. 80; Wallize v. Wallize, 55 Pa. 242; Willard\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 327; Fosselman v. Elder, 98 Pa. 159; Sauer v. Mollinger, 138 Pa. 338; Beaumont\u2019s Est., 214 Pa. 445.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AqNl\">Mr. Justice Simpson,</author>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In the court below judgment was entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, in an action of ejectment for 1204 South Carlisle Street in the City of Philadelphia, and defendant appeals. Each party claims through Mary E. Brown, now deceased, and the only point to be decided is the true interpretation of the following paragraph of her will, when viewed in the light of such of the facts, averred in the affidavit of defense, as may properly be considered in ascertaining her intention: \u201cFourth. I give, devise and bequeath unto my friend Mary T. Warrington [defendant] now of 3518 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my real estate and property known as Nos. 1208, 10 and 12 S. Carlisle Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">It is alleged in the affidavit that, at the date of the will, and at the time of testatrix\u2019s death, she owned 1204, 1210 and 1212 S. Carlisle Street, but at neither date, nor at any other time, was she the owner of 1208 S. Carlisle Street\u2019, or of any other property in the City of Philadelphia. Her instruction to her counsel, who drew the will, was that her three properties on Carlisle Street, were to be given to defendant; through some mistake in his office, the figures 1208 were substituted for 1204; her at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tention was not called to this error, and she did not notice it, when, in his absence, she executed the will, which thereafter was always in his possession and never seen by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">It is possible, \u2014 though it is not necessary t'o decide the point, \u2014 that the averments regarding the instructions as to drawing the will, and what occurred at the time of its execution, can have no bearing on this controversy, unless it be to strengthen the presumption (if this is ever needed), that 1208 was mistakenly inserted for 1204, and testatrix did not deliberately attempt to devise a property to which she had no title. But the facts regarding the ownership of the properties, are clearly to be considered, and are of controlling effect on the question of entering or affirming this summary judgment. It is always helpful and sometimes essential, when a will is to be construed, to \u201cput ourselves in the testator\u2019s place\u201d (Shaffer\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 15), and from that standpoint \u201cconsider the will and interpret its meaning......in the light of all the circumstances by which [he] was surrounded when he made it, and by which he was probably influenced\u201d; and, having thereby reached a conclusion as to his intent, the court will not permit this \u201cto be set aside because it is not clearly expressed by his scrivener\u201d: Postlewaite\u2019s App., 68 Pa. 477; Webb v. Hitchins, 105 Pa. 91; Stambaugh\u2019s Est., 135 Pa. 585, 597; Hermann\u2019s Est., 220 Pa. 52; Wood\u2019s Est., 267 Pa. 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In the light of the foregoing facts and law, does a fair construction of this will entitle defendant to 1204 S. Carlisle Street, which, on the record as now made up, was intended to be given to her? If only the numbers of the properties are to be considered, of course her contention cannot prevail, but this is not the situation here. The gift is of <em>\u201cmy </em>real estate and property known as 1208,......S. Carlisle Street.\u201d Which then is to give way, the \u201cmy\u201d or the \u201c1208\u201d ? The answer to this question is found in the maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>After analyzing the leading cases on the subject, Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 627, 644, lays down four rules by which to determine whether or not this maxim should be applied to the facts of a particular case. The second of these rules is as follows: \u201cWhere the description contained in the will of the thing intended to be devised, ......is true in part, but not true in every particular, ......parol evidence is admissible to show what' estate was intended to pass,......provided there is a sufficient indication of intention appearing on the face of the will to justify the application of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS-\">This rule is sound in principle as well as based on authority, and, hence, applying the facts, alleged in the affidavit of defense, to the language of testatrix\u2019s will, we find \u201cthe description......of the thing intended to be devised......is true in part,\u201d for it is of <em>\u201cmy </em>real estate and property......S. Carlisle Street,\u201d but is \u201cnot true in every particular,\u201d because of the use of the number \u201c1208,\u201d and therefore, \u201cparol evidence [regarding the ownership of the Carlisle Street properties] is admissible to show what estate was intended to pass......[since] there is a sufficient indication of intention appearing on the face of the will [in the use of the \u201cmy,\u201d etc.] to justify the application of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Appellee earnestly contends, however, that our own cases antagonize this conclusion. We do not think so. In Wallize v. Wallize, 55 Pa. 242, it was sought\u2019, by parol evidence, unaided by anything appearing in the will, to add the names of omitted children; in Willard\u2019s Est., 68 Pa. 327, to add a quantity of property not included; in Robinson v. Williams, 1 W. N. C. 337, to change from a property owned by testator, which exactly fitted the devise, to another which did not; and in Sauer v. Mollinger, 138 Pa. 338, to strike from the will the name of one devisee and insert another. These cases were all properly decided, but are not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-16\">It is of no moment that the will was originally probated in New York, for this has nothing to do with ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>tions regarding its interpretation. If a paper is testamentary in character, and is properly executed, it must he probated where testator is domiciled, without determining what are the rights of distributees under it; these can only be adjudicated by the court, at the time and place appointed for the purpose, when all the parties interested have had an opportunity to be heard in regard to them: Carson\u2019s Est., 241 Pa. 117; Galli\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">The judgment of the court below is reversed, and a procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
