Rather than the hard rule which plaintiff invokes, the facts in this case and the plain intent of the agreement call for the application of the principle that, where a contract relates to the use and possession of specific property, the existence of which is necessary to the carrying out of the purpose in view, a condition is implied by law, as though written in the agreement, that the impossibility of performance, arising from the destruction of the property, without fault of either party, shall end all contractual obligations relating to the thing destroyed: for prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ciple involved, see Williston on Contracts, section 1948; 13 C. J. 643; 6 R. C. L. 1005; Lovering v. Buck Mountain Coal Co., 54 Pa. 291, 301; Ward v. Vance, 93 Pa. 499, 502; Wertz v. Klinger, 25 Pa. Superior Ct. 523, 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Plaintiff insists, however, that the rule just named cannot control the present case because the contract in question states, it is \u201cagreed between the parties hereto that, in the event of the failure of the lessor to do and perform the several acts, and to provide service, etc., as above stipulated, the lessee may and shall supply such performance in every particular at the proper cost and expense of the lessor\u201d; but his argument on this point lacks force when the provision quoted is read with the context to which it refers, for then it plainly appears that the mutual contemplation of the parties was that the \u201cbuilding,\u201d \u201capartment,\u201d or \u201cclubhouse,\u201d should continue in existence so that the services contemplated might be performed \u201ctherein,\u201d either by Greenberg or the substitute to be furnished at his expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Next, plaintiff points to the following provision in the contract, \u201cAt the expiration of the term as hereinafter provided, the lessee shall deliver up the premises in as good condition, order and repair as the same now are, reasonable wear and tear and damage by fire excepted\u201d; he claims this must be taken as excluding the idea that destruction by fire would end the agreement, and, further, that it shows no other contractual understanding or implied term relating to fire or its results was intended. We cannot so view the quoted provision, for its evident intent is to make sure the contract shall be taken out of the common-law rule requiring a tenant to redeliver the property, intact, to his landlord, at the end of the term; moreover, the provision in question plainly contemplates the building on the premises being in existence at the end of the term, and not its destruction during the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">After reading and considering the skillfully presented argument of counsel for plaintiff, and all the cases cited, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>we are not convinced of error. The contract is executory and entire in its nature; it clearly contemplates not only the continued existence of the \u201cclub\u201d or \u201crooming bouse,\u201d but \u201cservices therein\u201d to be \u201cperformed by said Isaac Greenberg,\u201d \u201cduring tbe whole of tbe prescribed term.\u201d Tbe accidental destruction of tbe building excused plaintiff from performing tbe duties required of him and likewise reciprocally discharged defendant from its obligation to pay tbe agreed consideration. In other words, tbe contract was an entire one in which defendant agreed to pay only for a unit of realized benefit, and as plaintiff, without default or waiver by defendant, was prevented from performing according to its requirements, be can recover nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Tbe assignment of error is overruled and tbe judgment is affirmed. .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
