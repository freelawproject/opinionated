S.,\u201d and the. \u201c town and county aforesaid,\u201d will support a verdict of guilty on the second count, although the defendant is acquitted on the first count.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b247-7\">Complaint by \u201c Henry H. Dean of Easton, in the county of Bristol,\u201d charging \u201c Eustis K. Clapp of Easton, in the county of Bristol,\u201d as a common seller of intoxicating liquor; with a second count for a single sale, beginning thus: \u201c And said complainant on his oath aforesaid further complains that said Eustis K. Clapp, at Easton aforesaid, in the county aforesaid,\u201d &amp;c. The defendant, being acquitted on the first count and convicted on the second in the superior court, moved in arrest of judgment, because the second count was not complete in itself, and, this motion being overruled, alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-8\"><em>C.

B.\u201d These long established forms alone, if we found nothing further, would be proof that a repeated description of the defendant need not be given, and that, by an omission thereof, no risk of a failure of the prosecution is incurred, by a failure, for any</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>reason, to sustain the first count, provided there is a verdict of guilty on either of the others; for pleadings are always evidence of the law; Buller, J., in <em>Read </em>v. Brookman, 3 T. R. 161; and books of entries are the best authorities in the absence of decided cases. Ashhurst, J., in <em>Boothman </em>v. Barry, 2 T. R. 10. There is, however, at least one adjudged case on this point. In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Fielding, </em>2 H. Bl. 131, Gould, J. \u201cremembered the case of an indictment for forgery, in which there were three counts for the forgery, and three for the utterance; in the first count the prisoner was particularly described, and the grand jury having rejected the three first counts, an objection was raised that the remaining counts described him, \u2018 the said A. B.,\u201d by reference to the first; but all the judges held that the description was good, and that the latter counts might refer to the former.\u201d In 2 Gabbett Crim. Law, 248, and in 1 Chit. Crim. Law, 250, it is stated that one count in an indictment may refer to a former count in describing the defendant as \u201c the said A. B.,\u201d to avoid repetition of the description of him in the former; and that though the former count be defective, this will not vitiate the other which refers to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We cannot doubt that the law is the same when the jury acquit the defendant on a former count, and find him guilty on that in which he is described only by reference to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The first charge in this complaint is made by Henry H. Dean of Easton, in the county of Bristol, against Eustis K. Clapp of the same Easton. The second charge (on which the defendant has been convicted by verdict) is by \u201csaid complainant\u201d against \u201c said Clapp; \u201d that is, the same Dean and the same Clapp who are described in the first charge. And we perceive no reason why the complainant may not be described by reference to a previous description in the complaint, as well as the defendant,</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
