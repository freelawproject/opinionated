Writ dated February 8th 1859. The case was submitted to the judgment of the court upon the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">On the 27th of May 1857 the plaintiff agreed in writing with the defendants to deliver all the oak timber standing on certain wood lots \u201c on board the cars of the Cheshire Railroad Company at Marlborough depot, prior to April 1st next, at six dollars a cord, payment to be made in six months after delivery.\u201d By an indorsement on this agreement, the plaintiff, on the 17th of February 1858, at the request of the defendants, agreed to delay until the 1st of April 1859 the delivery of all the timber, \" excepting what is now put on cars, being four car loads, and about ten cords at Marlborough depot, which is subject to the depot-master\u2019s order for delivery,\u201d and also \u201c about thirty five cords cut, which he agrees to put on cars at any time specified by said Winchesters,\u201d and to leave the rest standing until September 1858. The four car loads and forty five cords, the delivery of which the plaintiff did not agree to delay, were all delivered to the defendants by the 10th of May 1858, and a part of the agreed price having been paid to the plaintiff in the fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>lowing October, this action was brought to recover the balance. No part of the rest of the timber was ever delivered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-5\"><em>G.

By the supplemental agreement of 17th February 1858, the contract ceased to be an entire one, and the new contract postponing the performance of a certain portion of the original contract does not prevent the recovery for the timber that is the subject of the present action. For this timber, to the extent that it remains unpaid for, the plaintiff may recover in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
