The defendants then offered evidence that, before the date of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage and after that of their own, the property was delivered to one of them under a verbal pledge. To the admission of this evidence, under the pleadings, the plaintiff objected. But <em>Mellen, </em>C. J. admitted it; and instructed the jury that if they found such a pledge, accompanied by possession, the plaintiff could not maintain his action. The jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b131-9\"><em>D.

Under this denial they offered evidence that one of the defendants had the property in his possession by virtue of a pledge made prior to the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. This evidence was objected to, on the ground that its object was to prove <em>\u201c </em>a substantive fact in-' tended to be relied upon in avoidance of the action,\u201d and therefore it was not admissible unless the fact was \u201c set forth in clear and precise terms \u201d in the answer, according to the eighteenth section of the practice act, <em>St. </em>1852, c. 312. But we cannot thus regard its object. It does not avoid the plaintiff\u2019s allegation, but meets it, and, if believed by the jury, overthrows it. The plaintiff has taken the burden of proving title in himself; and this evidence is pertinent to that point, for it tends to show that the title was not in him.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">This question has been substantially decided in the case of <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Slocomb, </em>9 Gray, 73. That was an action of tort for a trespass upon real estate; under an answer averring the defendant\u2019s ignorance of the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, he offered evidence that the title to a portion of the close described in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was in a third person and not in the plaintiff, for the purpose of disproving the plaintiff\u2019s title and possession; and the evidence was held to be admissible. The statute makes no difference in this respect between actions of tort for trespass and actions of replevin. And though it requires that each substantive fact intended to be relied on in avoidance of the action shall be set forth, yet it also provides that no party shall be required to state evidence, or disclose the means by which he intends to prove his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
