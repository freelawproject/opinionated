Sts. <em>c. </em>114, \u00a7 10, and <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 7, a judgment of the superior court upon an answer or plea in abatement, or a motion to dismiss, is final only when it is for defect of form of process.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-10\"><em>E.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW4\">This appeal is not rightly here. The only question presented by the statement of facts arises on a plea in abatement. By the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>114, \u00a7 10, and <em>c. </em>115, \u00a7 7, the decision of a single justice is final on all questions raised by a plea in abatement, and no appeal lies to this court. In this particular, the General Statutes have not changed the law as established by <em>St. </em>1840, <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7 5 ; but have only provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>that motions to dismiss for defect of form in process shall stand on the same footing with pleas in abatement, and be finally determined by a justice of the court, without any right to appeal from or allege exceptions to his decision. <em>Willard </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>13 Gray, 475. <em>Appeal dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
