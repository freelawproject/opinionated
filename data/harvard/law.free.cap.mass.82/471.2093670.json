The parties admitted that the odd tons were to be counted, entitling her to have eighty days for loading under the charter; and submitted to the court upon these facts the question whether in calculating these eighty days Sundays and other holidays were to be included; with an agreement that if they were, judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of eighteen days\u2019 demurrage remaining unpaid; otherwise, judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>R.

But in the absence of any such evidence of intention, we must simply give a construction to the language used in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">It first provides that \u201c twelve running days for each one hundred register tons are to be allowed to the charterers for loading the ship at the islands.\u201d The meaning of this is plain, the phrase \u201c running days \u201d having a settled commercial meaning of \u201c successive \u201d or \u201c consecutive \u201d days, without regard to the question whether they were days on which work could be done or not. It is an affirmative provision, complete and unqualified. If any qualification were intended, so that certain days which would ordinarily be comprehended in the phrase \u201c running days \u201d were to be excluded, it would seem natural to introduce it in the same connection, and to say, \u201c twelve running days, except Sundays and holidays.\u201d But no such qualification is made; that branch of the sentence ends, and a proviso or limitation of the preceding proposition follows \u2014 \u201cnevertheless in no case shall the charterers have less than thirty nor more than eighty running days in all, Sundays and holidays excepted; said days to commence \u201d &amp;c. This proviso .seems to us to be predicated upon a complete description of the cases which it professes to limit. The charterers are in no case under the rule already stated, that they are to have twelve running days for each one hundred tons of the vessel\u2019s register, to have less than thirty running days, exclusive of Sundays and holidays. If the vessel were of only two hundred tons register, this would give the charterers six days more than the gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>eral allowance, beside the Sundays and holidays which might occur before its time expired. On the other hand, if the vessel were of twelve hundred tons, it should not be allowed more than eighty days beside Sundays and holidays, although this might give it much less than the one hundred and forty four running days which the general rule would allow. There is nothing in the ordinary rules of grammatical construction, which would extend the qualification found in the proviso to the first clause of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The objection is urged by the defendant, that this construction does not give force to all the language used; and that if running days were meant in the first clause, and working days in the second, those words would have been used. But the answer is suggested in another part of his argument, namely, that there may be some days, beside Sundays and holidays, which are not working days ; days on which, from the state of the weather, or from some obstacle in getting to the place of loading, or for some other cause, no cargo could be taken on board. The risk of these the charterers undertake to assume. They also take the chance of holidays, if they can have at least thirty days clear of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The probability seems to be, that to the greater part of the vessels engaged in the trade, for which this printed form of charter party was prepared, the simple rule of so many \u201c running days,\u201d in proportion to their tonnage, would be applicable. This would make a computation of holidays necessary only in the extreme cases, which the proviso was intended to meet, and this, we think, is the fair interpretation of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
