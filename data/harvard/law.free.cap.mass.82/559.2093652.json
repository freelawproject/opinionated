J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsE\">The infirmity of the plaintiff\u2019s case is that there is nothing from which the court can infer that the restriction in the deed from Downing to Boardman was inserted for the benefit of the estate now owned by the plaintiff. If it appeared that the parties to that conveyance intended to create or reserve a right in the nature of a servitude or easement in the estate granted, which should be attached to and be deemed an appurtenance of the whole of the remaining parcel belonging to the grantor, of which the plaintiff\u2019s land forms a part, then it is clear, on the principles declared in the recent decision of <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Union Railway, </em>11 Gray, 359, that the plaintiff would be entitled to insist on its enjoyment, and to enforce his rights by a remedy in equity. But there is an entire absence of any language in the deeds under which the parties claim, from which it can be fairly inferred that the restriction in the deed to the defendant against erecting his building above a certain height was intended to enure to the benefit of the estate now owned by the plaintiff. The restriction is In the most general terms, and no words are used which indicate the object of the grantor in inserting it in the deed. Nor is there any language in the deeds under which the plaintiff claims title, which refers specifically to 'this restriction, or from which any intent is shown to annex the benefit of this particular restriction to the plaintiff\u2019s estate. Generally, when such a right or privilege is reserved, the purpose intended to be accomplished by it is stated in the conveyance or can be gathered from a plan referred to therein, or from the situation of the property with reference to other land of the grantor. All parties then take with notice of the right reserved and the burden or easement imposed. But the conveyances in the present case contain no such clause, nor is there anything in the terms of the grant, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>in the circumstances surrounding the parties when it was made, to lead to an inference in favor of the claim set up by the plaintiff. For aught that appears, it might have been intended by the parties for the benefit of the grantor only so long as he remained the owner of any of the land of which that conveyed to the plaintiff originally formed a part. However this may be, it is certain that the defendant took his grant without any notice, either express or constructive, that this restriction was intended for the benefit of the plaintiff\u2019s estate. This is the material distinction between the case at bar and that of <em>Whitney Union </em>Railway, above cited. And it is vital to the rights of the parties, because, as the case stands, the plaintiff is not entitled to avail himself of the equitable principle, that the defendant has taken his estate with notice of a stipulation for the benefit of the estate now owned by the plaintiff, which in equity by accepting the grant the defendant would be bound to observe. We are therefore of opinion that the clause in the deed to the defendant, creating the restriction on the enjoyment of his estate, must be construed as a personal covenant merely with the original grantor, which the plaintiff cannot ask to have enforced in this suit. <em>Bill </em>dismissed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
