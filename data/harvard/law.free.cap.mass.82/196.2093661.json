A year afterwards the charter was amended by the legislature so as to permit the location of the corporation either at Amherst or such other place as the corporation should select; and a meeting of the original corporators was called, at which they elected twelve associates, retaining some and leaving out others of those elected before, reorganized the corporation, and located it at Worcester, where its business was afterwards carried on. <em>Held, </em>that the power of the corporators to organize was not exhausted by their first organization, but that for real or supposed errors therein they might reorganize; that if the associates originally elected acquiesced, the reorganization was valid; that the corporation as reorganized might maintain actions on agreements to subscribe certain sums for its endowment, payable to the treasurer of the, corporation, describing the institution as \u201c to be located at Amherst, as provided by the charter, or in some other suitable place, subject to the action of its legal trustees, with the consent of the general court,\u201d whether signed before or after the second organization and the location at Worcester; and that a condition of such agreements, that no subscription should be binding unless the sum of twenty thousand dollars should be subscribed before a certain date, was complied with by subscriptions to that amount, either in the same form, or <em>\u201c </em>towards its two hundred thousand dollars endowment, provided it is to be located at Worcester,\u201d although the sum last named had not been obtained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-9\">Actions of contract to recover sums of money severally subscribed by the defendants.

These actions were brought by direction of the officers chosen since the second organization.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">In September 1855 the plaintiffs bought land and buildings in Worcester, for which they paid $ 46,000, and before September 1856 they expended $ 10,000 in fitting up and furnishing the buildings, and in 1857 they built additions at a cost of $ 20,000. The subscriptions were the only means which the plaintiffs had for defraying these expenses.

By the original act and the proceedings under it the corporation was organized and established at Amherst, and could not be removed without a vote of the corporation. All the acts done at Worcester and the expenditures there were therefore unauthorized. The defendants contracted with a corporation at Amherst, and the corporation at Worcester is not a party to the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-8\">The contract of subscription is void for want of mutuality and of consideration. <em>Phillips Limerick Academy </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>11 Mass. 113. <em>Farmington Academy </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>14 Mass. 172. <em>Boutell </em>v. <em>Cowdin, </em>9 Mass. 254. <em>Bridgewater Academy </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>2 Pick. 579. <em>Hamilton College </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>2 Denio, 403, and 1 Comst. 581. <em>Ives </em>v.

The subscriptions for f18,000 should not be included in the reckoning; because they were upon a different condition, preventing the free action of the trustees in regard to the location, and requiring the institution to be absolutely located at Worcester; and because they were upon the further condition that the whole $ 20,000 should be subscribed before any part should be valid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-10\"><em>A </em>subscription, like the original one of French, to an institm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>tion \u201c to be located \u201d in the future, made after it has in fact been located, cannot be carried out so as to give each party his rights, and has no validity as a contract. <em>People\u2019s Ferry </em>v.

The location of the institute at Worcester, if legal, was no consideration for this note, or for Hockey\u2019s subscription, because it was a past or executed consideration. Chit. Con. (8th Amer. ed.) 61 &amp; note. <em>Dearborn </em>v. Bowman, 3 Met. 155.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-7\"><em>F. H. Dewey, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b210-8\">Chapman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxMQ\">The signatures of the defendants to the subscription papers declared on being admitted, the defendants object that those who prosecute this action have no right to do so under the <em>St. </em>of 1854, <em>c. </em>342, by which the institute was chartered, and the <em>St. </em>of 1855, <em>c. </em>174, by which the corporators were authorized to locate it at such place as they should select. The objection rests upon the fact that on the 6th of June 1854 the three corporators named in the first act met, together with twelve other persons whom they elected as their associates, and organized the corporation by the choice of officers; and that they afterwards proceeded to act as an organized corporation for about a year. It is contended that the power of the corporators to organize under the charter was thereby exhausted ; and therefore there could be no new organization that would be valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">It appears that in July 1855 the corporators called a meeting in a formal manner, alleging that their proceedings had thus far been informal. This meeting was held on the 24th of July, and they then organized conformably to the provisions of the Revised Statutes, and elected twelve associates, some of whom were the same that had been previously elected, and others were not. They have ever since acted under this organization, without any objection on the part of the members who were not re-elected as associates, so far as appears; they have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>and managed the property of the corporation, and this action is brought by their authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The book containing the minutes or record of the first organization and the proceedings under it exhibits great irregularities and lack of skill in conducting such matters. But whether the defects were such as to render the proceedings void, it is not necessary to determine; for we are of opinion that if the corporators and their associates, fearing that there might be some question respecting the validity or regularity of their acts, chose to reorganize, they might legally do so, and thus correct their real or supposed errors. And if some of the original associates were omitted in the new organization, and others were elected in their stead, the identity of the corporation would not thereby be changed, nor would other persons have a right to complain, if the original associates acquiesced, as they seem to have done. The franchise is not a mere naked power, as the defendants contend; it is rather a property, to be held and managed for the purposes indicated in the charter during the term for which it is granted, unless it is forfeited and taken away at an earlier period.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The second objection is that the promises of the defendants, being mere subscriptions to the funds of the institute, are without consideration, and therefore void. Subscriptions of this character have-been made the subject of litigation in many instances; and the earlier cases in our reports contain <em>dicta </em>some of which have not been sanctioned by later decisions. But in the cases of <em>Amherst Academy </em>v. Cowls, 6 Pick. 427, <em>Williams College </em>v. <em>Danforth, 12 </em>Pick. 541, and <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Page, 1 </em>Met. 565, their validity is established, and the ground of it is definitely stated. It is held that by accepting such a subscription the promisee agrees on his part with the subscribers, that he will hold and appropriate the funds subscribed in conformity with the terms and objects of the subscription, and thus mutual and independent promises are made, which constitute a legal and sufficient consideration for each other. They are thus held to rest upon a well settled principle in respect to concurrent promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>In the present cases, the defendants\u2019 promises were accepted by the plaintiffs before there was any attempt to revoke them, and the plaintiffs have established the school and maintained it to the present time. Failure of a consideration originally good is not pretended, and there exists ample power to regulate and enforce the trust assumed by the plaintiffs for the future. The location at Worcester was legal under the amended charter, and none of the defendants show any just cause on their part to complain of the expediency or propriety of this location.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>Judgments on the verdicts for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
