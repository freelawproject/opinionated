Fisher &amp; Co., of which the respondent was a member and from which he derives his title, agreed in writing to submit to the final determination and award of certain referees, mutually chosen, a claim of Leland against Fisher for damages for flowing the land now owned by the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-9\">On the same day the referees awarded that Fisher &amp; Co., their heirs, &amp;c., should pay unto Leland, his heirs, &amp;c., \u201c the sum of one hundred dollars a year, payable annually, the first payment to be paid on the first day of October next, and to continue to pay yearly the same amount as long as the dam is kept at the height it now is, and having the privilege of having flash-boards upon the dam six inches in height, and no more, unless by so doing they pay damage if any is done by increasing the height of said flash-boards.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b195-10\">On the 31st of October 1854 Leland conveyed his land to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>the complainant, \u201c the grantor however reserving unto himself and his legal representatives the right to collect, have and receive the amount due annually from Waterman A.

Fisher &amp; Co.; the owner of the estate having the right to recover to his own use all the damage which shall be occasioned to said estate by so much of the height of said dam as shall be above its present height.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-5\">After the date of the award and before this conveyance, the dam was carried away by flood; the respondent, in rebuilding it, raised it to a greater height than that established by the referees; and it is to recover damages for the increased flowing occasioned by this raising of the dam that this suit is brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-6\">It is conceded that the complaint is not brought nor prosecuted for the benefit of Leland, and the respondent contends in his answer that, under the reservation in the deed, the complainant cannot maintain a suit in his own behalf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-7\">Since the filing of the complaint the complainant has obtained a conveyance from Leland of his right to all damages which may have accrued since the 14th of July 1848, from the flowing of the land above the height established by the award, and the right to bring actions therefor in the name and to the use of complainant, together with full authority to prosecute, in his own behalf, the complaint pending against the respondent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b196-8\">If, upon the foregoing facts, the court are of opinion that this complaint can be maintained, the respondent is to be defaulted and a warrant issue; otherwise the complainant is to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-9\"><em>P.

The respondent is not by the terms of the award entitled to raise the dam to a greater height than that which is therein established; but it leaves the parties to their legal rights under the mill acts. In the conveyance of Leland to the complainant, no reservation is made of any estate, but merely of the right to receive to his own use such damages as may be recovered by a legal process. But the estate being conveyed, the process must by the statute be brought by the grantee, he being the owner of the estate. The respondent has no interest in the question whether the complainant can retain the damages to his own use, or is obliged to account to Leland for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\n<em>Respondent defaulted; warrant for a jury to issue.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
