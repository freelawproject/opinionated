This evidence was admitted, the defendant objecting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">\u201c The defendant requested the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiffs could only recover in damages the difference in value between the roof actually on the building and such a roof as the contract required; and that the plaintiffs could not recover anything beyond the fair value of such a roof as the defendant had engaged to provide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The court declined so to instruct the jury; but instructed them, that the defendant had a right, under this contract, to make tight and remedy defects in the roof as originally constructed, by any mode which did not materially change the character and durability and safety of the roof contracted for; that if they were satisfied that the roof as originally constructed did not answer the requirements of the guaranty, and could not be made to by any such mode of repairing, which ought to be reasonably satisfactory to the plaintiffs, and that the roof was so defective that the leaks caused a material and substantial annoyance and injury to the plaintiffs and their property in the prosecution of their business, they had a right to remove the same; that in such case they might recover the difference between the price or value of the roof actually constructed and that contracted for; that the plaintiffs might further recover for any inj ury to their building or their fixed machinery, or machinery stored for sale, caused by leaks, and for the interruption of their business and loss of time of their men occasioned thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-7\">\u201c The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for $ 684.48. They were directed by the presiding judge to assess separately the different items of damage, and returned that they assessed for the plaintiffs damage sustained by the interruption of their business, $ 109; for the injury to the building, $ 30; and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>injury to the machinery and personal property, $ 75.87.

But it contains a provision that must regulate the measure of damages for a breach of it. The roof, having been made, is warranted to stand well and resist the water, so that it shall make a tight roof, for the term of five years, and in default thereof, the defendant promises to make it satisfactory to the plaintiffs. Upon a breach of this agreement the plaintiffs were entitled to have a satisfactory roof made at the expense of the defendant, or to recover the amount that such a roof would cost. This is all the damage that the language of the contract contemplates. The evidence shows that the roof was composed of a newly invented substance, that had not been thoroughly tested, and that it was regarded by both parties as an experiment. This circumstance, and the amount paid for the roof, tend to confirm the idea that the defendant did not intend to guaranty the plaintiff against the more remote damages that they might be exposed to in the prosecution of their business, and injury done to articles that might be stored in the building, by reason of defects in the roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">As a general rule of damages for the breach of special contracts, that of the civil law is safe and just. \u201c In general the parties are deemed to have contemplated only the damages and interest which the creditor might suffer from the nonperformance of the obligation in respect to the particular thing which is the object of it, and not such as may have been incidentally occasioned thereby.\u201d 1 Pothier on Obligations, pt. 1, c. 2, art 3. The cases of <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, </em>9 Exch. 341, and <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>7 Cush. 516, adopt this rule in substance. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the present case, it would lead us to the same result that the language of the parties has done. If the plaintiff will remit $214.87, being the amount allowed for the three items of special damage, the verdict is to stand; otherwise, it must be set aside, and a <em>New trial granted.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
