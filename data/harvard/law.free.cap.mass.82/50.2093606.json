The defendant objected to this inquiry for any other purpose than to limit the measure of damages; but the objection was overruled, and the question allowed to be answered. The plaintiff also introduced evidence of the value of the land without the buildings in January 1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">The defendant offered evidence that since the deed of Lathrop to Howard the land had been greatly increased in value by improvements made by the plaintiff and others, independently of the buildings. But the judge excluded the evidence; refused to instruct the jury, that, \u201cin estimating the value of Mrs. Lathrop\u2019s dower, the estate was to be taken at its value when owned by Mr. Lathrop, with the increased value by natural means only; \u201d and instructed them that the plaintiff, if entitled to recover at all, was entitled to recover the sum which he had paid to procure the release of Mrs. Lathrop\u2019s right of dower, if in their judgment it was reasonably and fairly paid. A verdict was returned for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-6\"><em>N. A.

As the question is one in reference to a claim where the alleged improvements have been made by one holding under an alienation by the husband, the rule of estimating the value of the property will be to estimate the same as it was at the time of the alienation by the husband, as to its improvements by cultivation and buildings. It was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>petent, as bearing upon this question, for the defendant to introduce evidence to show that, since the execution of the deed of the husband, the premises had been greatly increased in value by improvements made thereon by the labors and expenditures of the grantee of the husband, and those holding under such grantee, upon the land itself, as well as by the buildings erected thereon. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>9 Mass. 218. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Monson &amp; Brimfield Manuf. Co. </em>3 Mason, 375. This question in a broader aspect will be found fully considered in Mr. Washburn\u2019s valuable treatise on the American Law of Real Property, Vol. I. 238. The proposed evidence tending to show that, since the deed of Wells Lathrop to Howard, the premises had been greatly increased in value by improvements and expenditures upon the land itself, as well as by erecting buildings thereon, was therefore competent, and especially so to enable the jury properly to consider the case in reference to the evidence that had been introduced into the case as to its present value.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
