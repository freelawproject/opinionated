The plaintiffs afterwards offered evidence tending to show that between that time and the time of the injury there had been no change in these dimensions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-7\">The defendants offered evidence tending to show that Mrs. Brooks was able to guide the horse during his running, and would have passed safely down the hill, but that her companion, who was an insane woman, became excited when the horse began to run, seized and obtained control of the reins, and, in spite of her remonstrances, turned the horse out of the travelled part of the way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-8\">The judge, at the defendants\u2019 request, instructed the jury as follows : \u201c The law is well settled, that if the negligence of a third person occasioned the injury, the town is not liable. If then the horse started to run away, from a cause for which the defendants were not at fault, and if a person in the vehicle, not possessing competent skill or intelligence to drive, obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the control of the reins and turned the vehicle out of the travelled path on to the rock under the excitement of fear, and such turning caused or contributed to the accident, then the plaintiffs cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">The judge, against the defendants\u2019 objection, further instructed the jury thus: \u201c But if the original cause of the accident was the fact that the horse was frightened and caused to run by a defect in the road, for which the town was liable, and the horse was a proper horse for a prudent person to drive, and properly driven, then the mere want of prudent management on the part of Mrs. Brooks or her companion, after the horse began to run, or the mere fact that she imprudently seized the reins and turned the horse from the road, would not exonerate the defendants. All that is required in such circumstances is such a degree of care and prudence as the situation of the party would naturally or probably admit, and due allowance is to be made for the natural alarm caused by such an accident. If through the fault of the town in having a defective highway, these parties were placed in an exciting and alarming situation, then the law only requires such care as is natural in such a situation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-7\"><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1R\">The objections urged to the evidence which was offered to show the width of the road at the place of the accident several months after it happened go to its weight and not to its competency. The condition of the road at the time the occurrence took place was undoubtedly the real subject of inquiry. But in those particulars in which it was proved to have remained unchanged, its subsequent condition was direct evidence bearing on its safety and convenience previously. An accurate measurement of the road from side to side, and of the width of the travelled path, is often essential to enable the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>to pass intelligently on the issue presented to them in cases similar to the one at bar; and there can be no danger in admitting evidence of such facts, although ascertained subsequently to the time when the alleged defect in the highway is said to have existed, if it is accompanied by proof that no material change has taken place which can affect the accuracy of subsequent observations. <em>Aldrich </em>v. Pelham, 1 Gray, 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The instructions given to the jury seem to have been full and for the most part correct, and well adapted to the facts in proof. But in one respect they were defective, and tended to mislead the jury in weighing the evidence bearing upon one of the essential issues in the case. The plaintiff was bound to use ordinary care as well after as before the horse began to run, in consequence of the defect in the road. She could not abandon herself to needless alarm or give up all proper control of the horse, in consequence of the peril to which she was exposed by the negligence of the defendants in omitting to keep their road in suitable repair. She was still bound to use such care as a person of ordinary prudence and discretion would exercise if placed in similar circumstances and exposed to a like danger, making due allowance for the alarm into which she and her companion were thrown by the occurrence of the accident. If such care had been used, the horse might have been kept under control so as to avoid the defect in the road. The error in the instructions was that the jury were told that \u201cthe mere want of prudent management on the part of Mrs. Brooks or her companion after the horse began to run, or the mere fact that she imprudently seized the reins and turned the horse from the road, would not exonerate the defendants.\u201d This in effect left the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff, although she was guilty of a want of ordinary care which contributed to the accident. Imprudence implies a want of due care. Being of opinion that the residue of the instructions was not sufficient to do away with the erroneous impression which the jury might well have derived from this portion of the charge, we feel compelled on this ground to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
