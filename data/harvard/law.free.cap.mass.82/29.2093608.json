Trial and conviction in the superior court, before <em>Tose, </em>J., who signed this bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b39-7\"><em>\u201c </em>The district attorney called Otis Childs as a witness, and asked him if he ever had any conversation with the defendant relative to her keeping a building on Railroad Street, in Springfield, being the place where the government contended that she had committed the offence charged in the indictment. The defendant objected to the question ; but the court allowed it to be put; and the witness testified that he did have such a conversation, and that the defendant stated that she owned the building and leased the land on which it stood, and that she kept the establishment.

We are bound to presume that the state of the other evidence, which is not reported, rendered that testimony admissible. <em>Parmenter </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>6 Gray, 510. <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>1 Zabr. 612. We must presume that there was evidence, previously or subsequently adduced, tending to connect the defendant, more or less closely, with the acts for which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>was indicted. And if there was evidence that those acts were done in the building which she told Childs that she owned and kept, then his testimony was competent, and therefore admissible, for the purpose of showing that those acts, even though done by the hands of others, were in law her acts, and that she was legally punishable for them.
