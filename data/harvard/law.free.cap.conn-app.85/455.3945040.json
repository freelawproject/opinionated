Dent, appeals from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a trial to the court, denying his request for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and damages resulting from the presence of a European birch tree within the boundaries of a view easement. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly construed the language in his deed as exempting from the view easement those trees and shrubs planted before March 1, 1956. The substitute defendants, Allen P. Lovejoy, Charles F. Lovejoy and Jennifer L. Craddock, cross appeal from that portion of the judgment granting the plaintiffs request for the same relief with respect to a grey birch clump that also exists within the boundaries of the view easement. On cross appeal, they claim that the court improperly (1) concluded that the grey birch clump was subject to the view easement, (2) failed to consider their special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>defense that the view easement was terminated by prescription, (3) awarded $8000 in damages to the plaintiff for the interference with his use and enjoyment of the view easement and (4) failed to consider the testimony of the view easement\u2019s grantor as to his intent in granting the easement. We reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The following facts are relevant to these appeals. Sometime before 1956, Irven J. Brod acquired approximately fourteen acres of waterfront property in the Riverside section of Greenwich. The property contained a single stone residence, which stood at the crest of a hill, its axis running east to west and its rear facing southward, overlooking Cos Cob Harbor, Hannah Maria Island and Long Island Sound. Also facing southward were an attached terrace and a sunken garden, from which the property sloped downward until it reached the shore of the harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In 1956, Brod subdivided the fourteen acre parcel into nine lots, only one of which was developed. The developed lot consisted of the stone residence and almost two acres of surrounding land, which included the sunken garden. At its closest point, this lot was roughly 300 feet from the shoreline. Brod conveyed this lot to William McKeehan and Priscilla McKeehan by deed dated and recorded March 1, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In that deed, Brod granted the McKeehans a view easement. The relevant provision provides: \u201cThe grantor, on behalf of himself, his heirs and assigns, hereby covenants and agrees with the grantees and their heirs and assigns as follows: 1. That no building or structure of any type or road (exclusive of driveways) and that no solid fences of any type shall be constructed or maintained on the property of the Grantor lying southerly of the above described premises and lying between the two view lines shown on the above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>described map. The grantor further covenants and agrees on behalf of himself, his heirs and assigns forever, that in the event the planting hereinafter planted within the area shown on said map lying between the two view lines shall exceed a height of six feet and in the further event that in the sole discretion of the owner of the premises herein conveyed such planting shall constitute an obstruction to the view of the waters of Mianus River, Cos Cob Harbor or Long Island Sound, such planting shall be ordered removed or trimmed or cut back by the owner of the premises herein described, provided such owner shall first have given thirty days written notice thereof to the owners of the premises upon which such obstruction shall be deemed to exist, and the owner of the premises herein described shall have the right to enter for such purposes. It is understood and agreed that the land lying between said view lines shall be deemed to include HANNAH MARIA ISLAND, only as to future structures and to future planting in excess of 12 feet in height.\u201d As explained by the trial court in its memorandum of decision, \u201c[t]he map referred to was recorded Map 3557 \u2018Property of William C. McKeehan,\u2019 which depicted . . . two \u2018view lines\u2019 extending as two radii from the back or south side of the residence out to the harbor so that the distance between the lines is seventy feet when they cross the southern boundary of the McKeehan property and approximately 220 feet as they cross the shoreline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">After conveying this lot to the McKeehans, Brod still owned the two hillside lots situated between the McKee-hans\u2019 lot and the shore, both lots having portions burdened by the view easement. In 1960, Brod conveyed one lot, located to the southwest of the McKeehans\u2019 lot, to Allen F. Lovejoy and Betty F. Lovejoy; the other lot, located to the southeast of the McKeehans\u2019 lot and adjacent to the Lovejoys\u2019, he retained for himself. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the mid-1960s, both Brod and the Lovejoys had built houses on their respective lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Some thirty years later, the plaintiff purchased the McKeehans\u2019 lot, thereby acquiring the benefit of the view easement. Shortly thereafter, he contacted the Lovejoys, who still resided at the same location, and asked them to remove or trim to a height of six feet all trees and shrubs within the boundaries of the view easement. The Lovejoys agreed to remove some and trim other plantings, but refused to do either with respect to a European birch tree, a grey birch clump and an Austrian pine tree, claiming that those plantings were exempt from the view easement because they were planted before March 1, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The plaintiff commenced this action in April, 1994, alleging, inter alia, that certain plantings on the Lovej-oys\u2019 lot, located within the boundaries of the view easement, each in excess of six feet, obstructed the view from his property of the Mianus River, Cos Cob Harbor and Long Island Sound. As remedies, the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment as to his rights under the view easement, a permanent injunction banning the Lovejoys from interfering with his rights under the view easement and money damages for the unlawful deprivation of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">By answer filed October 20,1994, the Lovejoys denied the plaintiffs material allegations and raised a number of special defenses, including termination by prescription. Before trial, Allen F. Lovejoy died, and his three children, Allen P. Lovejoy, Charles F. Lovejoy and Jennifer L. Craddock, were substituted as defendants in their capacity as executors of their father\u2019s estate and conservators of their mother\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The matter was tried to the court, and, on April 9, 2002, the court issued a memorandum of decision. The court concluded that the phrase \u201cplanting hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>planted\u201d imposed a six foot height limitation only on trees and shrubs planted after March 1, 1956. Applying this interpretation to the plantings in dispute, the court concluded that the European birch tree, having been planted before that date, was exempt from the view easement; the grey birch clump, being \u201cnew, i.e., post-1956,\u201d was not exempt from the view easement; and the Austrian pine tree, having died, was no longer a tree but a solid obstruction that was banned by the view easement. The court awarded the plaintiff $8000 in damages to compensate for the loss of enjoyment as a result of the grey birch clump\u2019s interference with the view easement. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be provided as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">THE PLAINTIFF\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly construed the language in his deed as exempting from the view easement those trees and shrubs planted before March 1, 1956.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The following additional facts are necessary to resolve the plaintiffs claim. At trial, the parties disputed the scope of the language in the view easement subjecting to the easement any \u201cplanting hereinafter planted\u201d within the view lines. The plaintiff claimed that, read in its entirety, the deed expresses a single purpose: to preserve a panoramic view of Cos Cob Harbor and Long Island Sound for the plaintiffs prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>erty. He also indicated that the word \u201chereinafter\u201d does not, according to any respectable authority, mean \u201chereafter\u201d or \u201cin the future.\u201d Conversely, the defendants, focusing on the word \u201chereinafter,\u201d argued that the language unequivocally exempts from the view easement those trees and shrubs planted before March 1, 1956. To bolster their interpretation, the defendants offered, over the plaintiffs objection, the testimony of Brod as to his intent in granting the view easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The court declined to consider Brod\u2019s testimony regarding his intent, but agreed with the defendants, nonetheless, that the view easement restricted to a height of six feet only those trees and shrubs planted after March 1, 1956. It did so for three reasons. First, the easement provision restricted only \u201cfuture planting\u201d on Hannah Maria Island. Second, the easement\u2019s essential purpose, according to the court, was to protect the view for the plaintiffs property from residential development (i.e., houses, roads and solid fences). Third, the language in the deed did not suggest that the parties contemplated any changes in the condition of the hillside, which contained one or more trees or shrubs in excess of six feet. We disagree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u201c[T]he determination of the intent behind language in a deed, considered in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, presents a question of law on which our scope of review is plenary. . . . Thus, when faced with a question regarding the construction of language in deeds, the reviewing court does not give the customary deference to the trial court\u2019s factual inferences. . . . The meaning and effect of the [language in the deed] are to be determined, not by the actual intent of the parties, but by the intent expressed in the deed, considering all its relevant provisions and reading it in the light of the surrounding circumstances .... The primary rule of interpretation ... is to gather the intention of the parties from their words, by reading, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>simply a single clause of the agreement but the entire context, and, where the meaning is doubtful, by considering such surrounding circumstances as they are presumed to have considered when their minds met.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bird Peak Road Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bird Peak Corp., </em>62 Conn. App. 551, 557, 771 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 917, 773 A.2d 943 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201c[T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract. . . . Where the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, the contract is to be given effect according to its terms. <em>A court will not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity </em>.... Similarly, any ambiguity in a contract must emanate from the language used in the contract rather than from one party\u2019s subjective perception of the terms.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tallmadge Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., </em>252 Conn. 479, 498, 746 A.2d 1277 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u201cThe fact that servitudes are intended to bind successors to interests in the land, as well as the contracting parties, and are generally intended to last for an indefinite period of time, lends increased importance to the writing because it is often the primary source of information available to a prospective purchaser of the land. The language should be interpreted to accord with the meaning an ordinary purchaser would ascribe to it in the context of the parcels of land involved. Searching for a particular- meaning adopted by the creating parties is generally inappropriate because the creating parties intended to bind and benefit successors for whom the written record will provide the primary evidence of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>servitude\u2019s meaning.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third), Property, Servitudes \u00a7 4.1, comment (d), pp. 499-500 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">With those principles in mind, we look to the disputed language in the context of the entire deed to determine whether an ambiguity exists. After prohibiting the construction of any building, structure, road or solid fence between the view lines, the easement provision provides in relevant part that \u201cin the event the <em>planting hereinafter planted </em>within the area shown on said map lying between the two view lines shall exceed a height of six feet and in the further event that in the sole discretion of the owner of the premises herein conveyed <em>such planting </em>shall constitute an obstruction to the view of the waters of Mianus River, Cos Cob Harbor or Long Island Sound, <em>such planting </em>shall be ordered removed or trimmed or cut back by the owner of the premises herein described . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the court focused primarily on the phrase \u201cplanting hereinafter planted,\u201d interpreting \u201chereinafter\u201d as a synonym for the word \u201chereafter.\u201d Acknowledging that \u201cthe word \u2018hereinafter\u2019 does not mean in the future, or even hereafter,\u201d and that, in fact, it \u201cconnotes something to follow within, e.g., coming afterward in a document,\u201d the court concluded, nevertheless, that to read \u201chereinafter\u201d in its customary sense would \u201cnecessitate essentially reading out of the view easement language the entire phrase \u2018planting hereinafter planted.\u2019 \u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">In <em>Atlantic Fish Spotters Assn. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>321 F.3d 220, 225 (1st Cir. 2003), the defendants asked the court to interpret the word \u201chereinafter\u201d in an identical manner as the defendants here: \u201c[T]he [defendants] urge that the word \u2018hereinafter\u2019 . . . should be interpreted as a synonym for the word \u2018hereafter\u2019 and thus regarded as a word of futurity.\u201d As here, \u201c[t]o justify this linguistic leap, [the defendants] note[d] the familiar canon that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>a statute should be inteipreted so as to give meaning to every word and phrase.\u201d Id. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 interpretation, stating that it was \u201cunwilling to take such liberties with the King\u2019s English. . . . Congress selected the word \u2018hereinafter,\u2019 and that word, in its universally accepted meaning, refers to that which follows <em>in the same writing. </em>The [defendants] have been unable to cite any respectable authority for the proposition that \u2018hereinafter\u2019 and \u2018hereafter\u2019 can be used synonymously. Under such circumstances, we must eliminate all reasonable interpretations of the language that Congress chose before dropping out an inconvenient syllable and twisting a word into an unfamiliar shape.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) Id., 225-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Here, it is certainly reasonable that the parties intended to use the word \u201chereinafter\u201d in its customary sense, namely, to refer to that which follows in the same provision. Indeed, after the phrase \u201cplanting hereinafter,\u201d the phrase \u201csuch planting\u201d is used twice. \u201c \u2018The word \u201csuch\u201d has been construed as a related adjective referring back to and identifying something previously spoken of and that it naturally, by grammatical usage, refers to the last precedent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>209 Conn. 191, 197, 550 A.2d 309 (1988). The last precedent to \u201csuch planting\u201d is the word \u201cplanting\u201d in the phrase \u201cplanting hereinafter.\u201d Thus, we think it not unlikely that the parties intended that the phrase \u201cplanting hereinafter\u201d refer to \u201csuch planting\u201d and that \u201csuch planting\u201d refer to those \u201cplanted within the area shown on said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>map lying between the two view lines;\u201d nor do we think it unlikely that the parties chose \u201cthis trite [word] for its broad spatial effect rather than to breach temporal barriers.\u201d <em>Atlantic Fish Spotters Assn. </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 321 F.3d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Even so, we cannot consider the word \u201chereinafter\u201d in isolation, without taking into account the rest of the deed\u2019s language. As noted previously, \u201c[t]he primary rule of interpretation ... is to gather the intention of the parties from their words, by reading, not simply a single clause of the agreement but the entire context . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bird Peak Road Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bird Peak Corp., </em>supra, 62 Conn. App. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">For three reasons, we conclude that, when read in the context of the entire deed, the word \u201chereinafter\u201d takes on its customary import. First, the easement provision explicitly restricts \u201cfuture planting\u201d only as would restrict the view of Hannah Maria Island. The provision\u2019s final sentence reads: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that the land lying between said view lines shall be deemed to include HANNAH MARIA ISLAND, <em>only as to </em>future structures and to <em>future planting </em>in excess of 12 feet in height.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The parties\u2019 specific use of the phrase \u201cfuture planting\u201d in that sentence indicates that they knew how to select language that would unequivocally exempt certain plantings from the view easement, so that their failure to do so earlier in the provision can be deemed deliberate.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Second, in the deed, the parties employed the word \u201chereinafter\u201d in its customary sense on three separate occasions. See 11 S. Williston, Contracts (4th Ed. 1999) \u00a7 32:6, p. 432 (\u201c[generally, a word used by the parties in one sense will be given the same meaning throughout the contract in the absence of countervailing reasons\u201d); cf. <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sev</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>enth BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 27, 717 A.2d 77 (1998) (\u201c[w]here the same words are used in a statute two or more times they will ordinarily be given the same meaning in each instance\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Third, read in its entirety, the easement provision conveys a single purpose: to protect the view of the Mianus River, Cos Cob Harbor and Long Island Sound. The provision explicitly prohibits the construction or maintenance of any building, structure, road or solid fence within the view lines. Further, it provides the owner of the dominant estate the right to deem a planting in excess of six feet <em>\u201can obstruction to the view of the waters of Mianus River, Cos Cob Harbor or Long Island </em>Soundand the right to enter the servient estate to trim or remove the offending planting or plantings. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">In sum, nothing in the deed\u2019s language indicates that the word \u201chereinafter\u201d should be given a special or unusual connotation. <em>See Hoffman Fuel Co. of Danbury </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>68 Conn. App. 272, 280, 789 A.2d 1149, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 918, 797 A.2d 514 (2002). Because the use of that word is unambiguous, \u201cthere is no need to apply additional rules of interpretation, for in determining the effects of a deed or a written contract where the language is fairly susceptible of but one interpretation, the inquiry is not what the parties impliedly intended but what is the intent which is expressed, and that intent must be given effect. . . . The intention of the parties, gathered from their words, is gathered not by reading a single clause of the covenant but, as we have done, by reading its entire context. ... It is only where more than one interpretation is permissible that it is necessary for this court to seek the intent of the doubtful language in the light of surrounding circumstances presumably considered by the parties.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Serafin, </em>163 Conn. 1, 10-11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>301 A.2d 238 (1972). On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the view easement unambiguously restricts to a height of six feet all trees and shrubs planted within its boundaries (except, of course, those that would block the view of Hannah Maria Island), and that the court, therefore, improperly construed the language in the deed as exempting from the view easement those trees and shrubs planted before March 1, 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">THE DEFENDANTS\u2019 CROSS APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We now address the claims that the defendants raise in their cross appeal. They first claim that the court improperly concluded that the grey birch clump is subject to the view easement. According to the defendants, although the grey birch clump began sprouting after March 1, 1956, it sprouted from the trunk of a birch tree that existed (and died) before March 1,1956. Thus, they argue, the grey birch clump is not a new tree or shrub planted after March 1, 1956, but rather an extension of the preexisting crown and root system of the original birch tree. Having already concluded in part I that the view easement applies to all plantings\u2014 regardless of their germination dates \u2014 that exist within the boundaries of the view easement, we reject the defendants\u2019 initial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The defendants next claim that the corut improperly failed to address their special defense that the view easement was terminated by prescription. The defendants indicate that the court specifically mentioned, but failed to address, this special defense in its memorandum of decision. This, they argue, warrants plain error review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u201cIt is the responsibility of the appellant to move for an articulation in order to clarify the basis of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>court\u2019s decision should such clarification be necessary for effective appellate review of the issue on appeal. ... It is, therefore, the responsibility of the appellant to move for an articulation or clarification of the record when the trial court has failed to state the basis of a decision. . . . [W]here the trial court\u2019s decision is ambiguous, unclear or incomplete, an appellant must seek an articulation ... or this court will not review the claim.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Advanced Financial Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Appraisal Services, Inc., </em>79 Conn. App. 22, 39-40, 830 A.2d 240 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Our review of the record reveals that the defendants did not file a motion for articulation asking the court to address their special defense that the view easement was terminated by prescription. Thus, although the defendants have failed to utilize the procedural vehicles available to remedy the inadequacies in the record, they urge us to resolve the deficiencies in the memorandum of decision on appeal. See id., 40. The record, however, is inadequate for review of this claim. See id.; <em>Commissioner of Public Works </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>53 Conn. App. 438, 449, 731 A.2d 749, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 923, 738 A.2d 654 (1999). Nevertheless, the defendants may prevail on this claim under the plain error doctrine if such review is affirmatively requested. See <em>Menon </em>v. <em>Dux, </em>81 Conn. App. 167, 172, 838 A.2d 1038, cert. denied, 269 Conn. 913, 852 A.2d 743 (2004). The defendants have made such a request, and we consider, therefore, whether plain error review is warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201cAs we have often stated, [p]lain <em>error </em>review is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... A party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cAn important factor in determining whether to invoke the plain error doctrine is whether the claimed error resulted] in an unreliable verdict or a miscarriage of justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>29 Conn. App. 675, 677, 617 A.2d 913 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that this case does not involve any such obvious error that \u201caffects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Menon </em>v. <em>Dux, </em>supra, 81 Conn. App. 172. \u201c[P]lain error review is more appropriately applied to unambiguous instances of impropriety; for instance, where the trial court has failed to apply a clearly relevant statute to a case.\u201d <em>Feen </em>v. <em>New England Benefit Cos., </em>81 Conn. App. 772, 778, 841 A.2d 1193, cert. denied, 269 Conn. 910, 852 A.2d 739 (2004). That is not the case here, and we thus conclude that plain error review is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">In their third claim, the defendants maintain that the court improperly awarded $8000 in damages to the plaintiff for the interference with his use and enjoyment of the view easement. The defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to prove actual damages with the requisite certainty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that the burden of proving damages is on the party claiming them. . . . When damages are claimed they are an essential element of the plaintiffs proof and must be proved with reasonable certainty. . . . Damages are recoverable only to the extent that the evidence affords a sufficient basis for estimating their amount in money with reasonable certainty. . . . Although damages often are not susceptible of exact pecuniary computation and must be left largely to the sound judgment of the trier . . . this situation does not invalidate a damage award as long as the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>afforded a basis for a reasonable estimate by the [trier] of that amount. . . . Mathematical exactitude in the proof of damages is often impossible, but the plaintiff must nevertheless provide sufficient evidence for the trier to make a fair and reasonable estimate. . . . The determination of damages involves a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lawson </em>v. <em>Whitey\u2019s Frame Shop, </em>241 Conn. 678, 689-90, 697 A.2d 1137 (1997). \u201cIn order to be entitled to more than nominal damages for [the] interference with [his view easement], [the plaintiff] was required to demonstrate at trial either the diminution in the value of [his] property because of [the] interference with [his] easement . . . the cost to return the easement to its original state ... or the difference in the value of the easement before the interference and its value after it was obstructed.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Expressway Associates II </em>v. <em>Friendly Ice Cream Corp. of Connecticut, </em>218 Conn. 474, 477, 590 A.2d 431 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Here, the court based its determination of damages primarily on the testimony and written appraisal report of Peter M. Trefny, a licensed real estate appraiser. According to the court, Trefny opined that \u201cthe loss of enjoyment as a result of a partial view obstruction could be calculated in a dollar value by estimating the percentage loss in value of the property itself resulting from an obstructed view and then applying that reduction to an estimated rental value of the house.\u201d The court noted that Trefny\u2019s \u201crental value approach may not be the best, or only, approach to valuing damages, but . . . it can provide a useful tool in that endeavor, if applied with several alterations.\u201d Applying those alterations, the court estimated that the grey birch clump \u201ccontributed to no more than 10 percent of the obstruction and, therefore, the Trefny model, as altered, would suggest damages in the amount of $6510.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The court concluded: \u201c[Reasonable people could take issue with some, if not all, of the adjustments discussed above. Nevertheless, it provides some measure of support for the court\u2019s own damages assessment which is based on hearing all the testimony, reviewing all the exhibits and the opportunity to view the scene in person. Fair, just and reasonable damages, based on the minimal, but not inconsequential, impairment of the view by the grey birch clump is in the range of $750 to $1000 annually, making allowance for the tree\u2019s growth. Therefore, the court sets damages at $750 for the first year of [the plaintiffs] ownership, and increases the amount by $50 each succeeding year so that it reaches and remains at $1000 for the year ending June, 1999, and thereafter for a total of $8000 to date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s damages award was clearly erroneous. There is certainly a basis in the record for its determination. Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the court improperly failed to consider the testimony of Brod as to his intent in granting the view easement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe meaning and effect of the reservation are to be determined, not by the actual intent of the parties, but by the intent expressed in the deed . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Ivler, </em>187 Conn. 31, 39, 450 A.2d 817 (1982). The court\u2019s decision not to consider Brod\u2019s testimony regarding his intent was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">On the plaintiffs appeal, the judgment is reversed as to the European birch tree, and the case is remanded for a hearing in damages with respect to any diminution in value of the plaintiffs land as a result of that tree\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>interference with the view easement. On the defendants\u2019 cross appeal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\"> Preliminarily, we address the defendants\u2019 argument that the provision at issue is not an easement, but rather a restrictive covenant, which \u201cmust be narrowly interpreted, as the law does not favor restrictions on the use of land.\u201d Assuming, arguendo, that the provision at issue is a restrictive covenant, the Restatement has \u201cdeparted] from the often expressed view that servitudes should be narrowly construed to favor the free use of land.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third), Property, Servitudes \u00a7 4.1, comment a, p. 497 (2000). Thus, semantics aside, the distinction between restrictive covenants and affirmative easements is immaterial in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\"> Here, the defendants cite a single dictionary that defines \u201chereinafter\u201d to mean \u201chereafter\u201d: the Cambridge Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary (2003 Ed.) \u2014 not quite the respectable authority mentioned in <em>Atlantic Fish Spotters Assn. </em>The plaintiff, to the contrary, cites Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary (College Ed. 1953), which defines \u201chereinafter\u201d as \u201cin the part after this part (of this document, speech, etc.).\u201d He also cites Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed. 1955), which defines \u201chereinafter\u201d similarly as \u201c[i]n the following part of this (writing, document, book, etc.).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\"> The court clearly stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201c[Brod\u2019s] testimony about the intent of the language of the easement has not been considered.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
