Upon arrival, Moore was confronted outside by Robert Morales, and an altercation quickly ensued. When Morales approached Moore with a knife in hand, Moore fired three gunshots. Morales died shortly thereafter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The plaintiff subsequently commenced the present wrongful death litigation. A jury trial began on April 30, 2003. At the close of evidence, the plaintiff did not submit any jury interrogatories. The plaintiff requested a jury charge predicated on the sudden emergency doctrine, which the court denied. The court instructed the jury on the plaintiffs negligence, assault and battery claims, as well as the defendants\u2019 special defenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>contributory negligence, recklessness, privileged use of force and governmental immunity. On May 9, 2003, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the defendants, and the court rendered judgment accordingly. This appeal followed. Following oral argument on the matter, this court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether the general verdict rule applies to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">We consider first the question of whether the general verdict rule is applicable. \u201c[T]he general verdict rule is a rule of appellate jurisprudence designed to further the general principle that it is the appellant\u2019s responsibility to provide a record upon which reversible error may be predicated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 364, 372, 727 A.2d 1245 (1999). \u201cUnder the general verdict rule, if a jury renders a general verdict for one party, and no party requests interrogatories, an appellate court will presume that the jury found every issue in favor of the prevailing party. . . . Thus, in a case in which the general verdict rule operates, if any ground for the verdict is proper, the verdict must stand; only if every ground is improper does the verdict fall.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 371. \u201cA party desiring to avoid the effects of the general verdict rule may elicit the specific grounds for the verdict by submitting interrogatories to the jury. Alternatively, if the action is in separate counts, a party may seek separate verdicts on each of the counts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Curry </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>225 Conn. 782, 786, 626 A.2d 719 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In the present case, the defendants\u2019 answer denied the plaintiffs allegation of negligence as set forth in the complaint. The defendants also alleged that Robert Morales\u2019 negligence was the proximate cause of his death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe defendants\u2019 denial of negligence and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>allegation of contributory negligence constitute two separate and distinct defenses, either one of which could support the jury\u2019s general verdict.\u201d <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>188 Conn. 201, 205, 449 A.2d 142 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">We repeatedly have held that when a plaintiffs claim \u201calleges a defect in the instruction that relates only to the theory of negligence, leaving the contributory negligence route untainted,\u201d the general verdict rule applies. <em>Sandow </em>v. <em>Eckstein, </em>67 Conn. App. 243, 248, 786 A.2d 1223 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 919, 791 A.2d 566 (2002); see also <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Bastarache, </em>supra, 188 Conn. 205; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>76 Conn. App. 421, 424-25, 819 A.2d 895, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 910, 826 A.2d 180 (2003); <em>D\u2019Alesandro </em>v. <em>Clare, </em>74 Conn. App. 177, 181, 812 A.2d 76 (2002). The plaintiff did not submit interrogatories to the jury, which returned a general verdict in favor of the defendants. Without interrogatories, we are not able to determine whether the juiy found for the defendants because the plaintiff failed to prove the allegations of the complaint or because the defendants prevailed on their special defense. See <em>D\u2019Alesandro </em>v. <em>Clare, </em>supra, 181. We therefore must presume that the jury found every issue in favor of the defendants. See <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Finley Associates, Inc., </em>supra, 248 Conn. 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Application of the general verdict rule precludes our review of the plaintiffs claim concerning the request for a jury charge on the sudden emergency doctrine. As the plaintiffs claim relates only to the jury\u2019s finding that the defendants were not negligent, that claim does not undermine the presumed finding of comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> The action against. Dale Demirjian, Nicholas Ricci and Thomas Flaherty, who also were named as defendants, was withdrawn. We therefore refer in this opinion to Moore and the city of Milford as the defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b239-9\"> At oral argument, the plaintiffs counsel stated that \u201cthis might be the easiest brief I ever wrote.\u201d The plaintiffs brief, however, is punctuated by numerous grammatical and typographical errors that make it difficult, at times, to discern parts of the plaintiff\u2019s argument. For example, Moore, in a span of four pages, is referred to as \u201cOfficer Moore,\u201d \u201cMr. Moore,\u201d \u201cMs. Moore,\u201d \u201cMr. Morales\u201d and \u201cOfficer Morales.\u201d We encourage counsel to review their briefs before submission to this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> The defendants also maintained affirmative defenses of privileged use of force and governmental immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
