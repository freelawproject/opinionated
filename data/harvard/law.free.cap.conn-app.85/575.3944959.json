In July, 2000, T moved from New Mexico to Connecticut to live with her cousin, M. Approximately two weeks later, T began baby-sitting for the defendant\u2019s three daughters at the defendant\u2019s home. On the morning of August 2, 2000, the defendant arrived at M\u2019s home to pick up T and to bring her to his home to babysit. At trial, T testified that the defendant told her that he was going to get some \u201cacid.\u201d T then asked if she could have some, stating that she had \u201cnever done acid before.\u201d According to T, after she and the defendant arrived at the defendant\u2019s house, he told her that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>had twelve \u201chits\u201d of \u201cacid\u201d on a strip of thin paper. T also testified that the defendant asked her if she had ever had sex before because \u201cacid made him homy, and it made sex more better, more intensified.\u201d The defendant then \u201ccut up the acid\u201d by slicing the paper into twelve strips and offered T one \u201chit.\u201d T asked the defendant to put it on her tongue because she \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [she] was doing.\u201d T ingested one piece of the paper that the defendant placed on her tongue. Approximately thirty minutes to one hour later, T began to see \u201cunusual things\u201d such as a cat singing to her and a mg waving to her. T testified that the effects of the substance she ingested lasted for several hours. In addition, T testified that the defendant told her that the paper he placed in her mouth was LSD<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that he uses the terms \u201cacid\u201d and LSD interchangeably. She also stated that the defendant told her that he would give her the LSD as payment for the hours she watched his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Later in the evening of August 2, 2000, the defendant and his wife, Janine Ritrovato, went to a movie, leaving T to watch the children. The couple returned approximately four hours later and watched a movie with T. About halfway through the movie, Janine Ritrovato went to bed, leaving the defendant and T to finish watching the movie. The defendant then asked T to go for a walk. While walking, the defendant pulled T close to him. T objected to that and walked ahead of the defendant. The defendant then grabbed T from behind and led her to a secluded spot where they engaged in vaginal intercourse. Following the incident, T and the defendant returned to the defendant\u2019s home. There, she wrote on her calendar, \u201c[M]y day! 1st Leo.\u201d T testified that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>meant that it was her first time having sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Not long after that incident, T was forced to move out of M\u2019s leased home, as the landlord had expressed concerns about T\u2019s occupancy. The defendant and his wife let T stay with them until the problem was resolved. T testified that on August 13, 2000, the defendant again forced her to have vaginal intercourse with him. The following day, T informed her mother and M that she wanted to return to New Mexico. When asked why, T told her mother that she had been \u201ctouched in a way that [she] didn\u2019t like.\u201d Later, on August 18, 2000, T told M about both incidents. After hearing T\u2019s story, M took her to the police station where T gave a statement. Eventually, T also went to Planned Parenthood of Connecticut, Inc., for a physical examination. There she spoke to counselor Janet St. Jean about the incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">After the defendant was arrested and taken into custody at his home on October 6,2000, he provided Officer Mark Pilcher of the Norwich police department with a written statement in which he stated that he had obtained LSD and given it to T on different occasions. According to the defendant\u2019s statement, which was admitted into evidence during trial, T asked him to get LSD, and he received M\u2019s permission to give it to her. The defendant\u2019s statement also contained a denial of any sexual contact with T.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Trial began on February 26, 2002. On March 13, 2002, the jury found the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the second degree, two counts of risk of injury to a child, sale of a hallucinogenic substance by a person who is not drug-dependent and sale of a controlled substance to a person younger than eighteen years of age. All of those offenses stemmed from the events of August 2, 2000. The defendant was sentenced to a term of twenty-two years imprisonment, execution sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>pended after seventeen years, and ten years of probation. On appeal, the defendant advances four arguments, which we address in turn. Additional facts will be recited as appropriate to our resolution of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The defendant\u2019s initial contention is that the state\u2019s evidence at trial was insufficient to warrant a guilty verdict on counts four, five and six.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, he argues that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance he gave T was, in fact, LSD, a hallucinogenic substance. The defendant claims that the only evidence offered to prove that the substance was LSD was his representation as such, T\u2019s description of the medium by which she ingested the substance and the effect that it had on her. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim, the principles that guide our inquiry are not novel. We construe the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict and decide whether that evidence, including the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, enabled a rational jury to conclude that the cumulative force of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number><em>Nunes, </em>260 Conn. 649, 659, 800 A.2d 1160 (2002). \u201cEach essential element of the crime charged must be established by such proof . . . and although it is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven, they may not resort to speculation and conjecture.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>181 Conn. 562, 585, 436 A.2d 33 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">With those familiar principles in mind, we turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim. Because the defendant challenges his conviction of three separate offenses, each of which required the state to prove different essential elements, we split the defendant\u2019s claim into separate arguments, examining each sequentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Sale of a Hallucinogenic Substance by a Person Who is Not Drug-Dependent</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">In count four of the information, the state charged the defendant with the crime of sale of a hallucinogenic substance by a person who is not drug-dependent, namely, LSD, in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who . . . sells . . . any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>more than twenty-five years. ...\u201d Thus, in the present case, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance the defendant gave to T actually was a hallucinogenic substance, namely, LSD. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gayle, </em>64 Conn. App. 596, 601, 781 A.2d 383 (\u201cTo prove sale of a narcotic substance [t]he state [must] prove . . . that the substance sold was a narcotic. . . . Proof of the exact nature of the substances upon which the prosecution is grounded, of course, is necessary . . . .\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 920, 782 A.2d 1248 (2001); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Baskins, </em>12 Conn. App. 313, 316, 530 A.2d 663 (to sustain burden of proving defendant sold narcotic substance, state had to prove accused sold specific drug [heroin] it accused him of selling), cert. denied, 205 Conn. 811, 532 A.2d 586 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In claiming that the evidence was insufficient, the defendant asserts that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance given to T actually was LSD.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On the basis of our review of the record, we believe there was adequate circumstantial evidence from which the jury reasonably could have inferred that the substance given to T by the defendant was LSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We begin by noting that at trial, the state introduced neither expert testimony nor any objective analysis of the substance to identify it as LSD. Rather, the state\u2019s evidence concerning the identity of the substance was entirely circumstantial. That fact alone, however, is not dispositive, because the identity of a hallucinogenic substance may be proven by circumstantial evidence. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Baskins, </em>supra, 12 Conn. App. 316 (state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>could satisfy burden of proving defendant sold narcotic substance with circumstantial evidence alone).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Although our review of decisional law reveals that the circumstantial evidence usually contemplated for the purpose of proving the identity of an illicit substance normally entails the opinion testimony of someone who is sufficiently familiar with the alleged substance, other forms of circumstantial evidence also have been admitted to prove the identification of the substance. Thus, evidence of the identify of a substance may include, but is not limited to (1) opinion testimony of a witness who couples past use and present experience with the substance in question,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) the name by which the defendant refers to the substance,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (3) testimony concerning the use of the <em>substance in question </em>and its subsequent physiological effect on the user,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (4) testimony of someone sufficiently familiar with the use of the <em>alleged substance </em>concerning the distinguishing visual characteristics of it, the way in which it is ingested and its subsequent physiological effect on the user,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (5) testimony concerning the price paid or asked for the substance<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (6) testimony concerning the way in which the transaction was carried out.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Of course, the admission of circumstantial evidence to prove the identity of a substance does not mean that that evidence alone always is sufficient proof of the identity of a substance. When circumstantial evidence is the basis for establishing the identity of the substance, whether that evidence is sufficient must be decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>on a case-by-case basis. The evidence in this instance, viewed in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, reveals that the defendant told the police and T that the substance he gave to her was LSD, that the substance was on thin paper that he cut into squares before placing it on her tongue, that she chewed and swallowed the substance, that shortly after doing so, she saw a cat singing and a rug waving to her, and that she felt the effects of the substance for several hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Thus, the jury was presented with the defendant\u2019s statement against penal interest that he gave LSD to T, T\u2019s description of the substance and its manner of transfer, and her testimony concerning her mental state shortly after she ingested the substance. The question confronting us then, is whether the jury reasonably could have inferred from that evidence that the substance given to T by the defendant was LSD. Recognizing that this precise question has yet to be answered in Connecticut, we conclude that the evidence provided an adequate evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">First, as noted, the statements by the defendant to T and to the police that the substance he gave to her was LSD were admitted properly as evidence on the issue of the identity of the substance as LSD. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cosgrove, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 587. We acknowledge that those statements alone would be insufficient to identify the substance. The defendant\u2019s statements, however, were corroborated by evidence concerning the medium by which the substance was transferred, the manner of ingestion and T\u2019s hallucinations shortly thereafter. Although we do not believe that the packaging and mode of ingestion of LSD is sufficiently within the common knowledge of jurors such that they reasonably could have inferred from that evidence that the substance was LSD, we do believe that the average layperson could have concluded from T\u2019s testimony that she was, in fact, hallucinating when she believed that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>saw a cat singing and a mg waving to her shortly after ingesting the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Finally, we note that in its instructions to the jury, the court stated: \u201cA hallucinogenic substance is defined as ... a psychodysleptic substance which asserts a confusional or disorganizing effect upon mental process or behavior, and mimics acute psychotic disturbances. Examples of such dmgs are . . . lysergic acid . . . diethylamide, commonly known as LSD.\u201d Faced with the court\u2019s definition of LSD as a hallucinogenic substance and a description of its effects, and confronted with the defendant\u2019s identification of the substance as LSD, which was corroborated by T\u2019s testimony about her mental state shortly after ingesting it, we conclude that the cumulative effect of that evidence formed an adequate evidentiary basis for the jury\u2019s determination that the substance was, in fact, LSD. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nunes, </em>supra, 260 Conn. 659-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Sale of a Controlled Substance to a Person Younger Than Eighteen Years of Age</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">The fifth count of the information charged the defendant with sale of a controlled substance to a person younger than eighteen year s of age in violation of \u00a7 21a-278a. Section 21a-278a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person . . . who violates section . . . 21a-278 ... by distributing, selling, prescribing, dispensing, offering, giving or administering any controlled substance to another person who is under eighteen years of age . . . shall be imprisoned for a term of two years . . . .\u201d Thus, to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt on that count, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, all the essential elements of the offense of selling a hallucinogenic substance in violation of \u00a7 21a-278. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Denby, </em>235 Conn. 477, 487, 668 A.2d 682 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>67 Conn. App. 643, 647, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>789 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 938, 808 A.2d 1133 (2002). Given our determination in part II A that the evidence was sufficient to prove a violation of \u00a7 2 la-278, we conclude that the state met its burden of proving the defendant guilty of violating \u00a7 21a-278a.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Risk of Injury to a Child</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The sixth count of the information charged the defendant with the crime of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (l).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Specifically, the state alleged that the defendant\u2019s giving a hallucinogenic substance to T, a child, was an act that was likely to impair her health or morals. The crime of risk of injury to a child in this case required proof beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) T was younger than sixteen years old; (2) the defendant had perpetrated an act on T; (3) the act was likely to be injurious to T\u2019s health; and (4) the defendant had a general criminal intent to perform the act. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>189 Conn. 1, 7-8, 454 A.2d 256, cert. denied, 461 U.S. 933, 103 S. Ct. 2098, 77 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1983). The parties do not dispute that T was younger than sixteen years of age or that the defendant perpetrated an act on her. Instead, the defendant argues, in essence, that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a general criminal intent to perform the act or that the act was likely to be injurious to T\u2019s health. In short, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove those essential elements because the state failed to prove that the substance the defendant gave to T was LSD. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>As noted, to establish guilt of risk of injury to a child, the state need only prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed an act that was likely to impair T\u2019s health. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>supra, 189 Conn. 7-8. As we noted in part II A, the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient for the jury to have concluded that the substance given to T by the defendant was the hallucinogen, LSD.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Thus, the jury was offered sufficient evidence that, if credited, satisfied the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">As to the element of intent, the state adduced evidence that the defendant wilfully gave T the illegal hallucinogenic substance, LSD. That evidence provided sufficient support for the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant possessed the general criminal intent to perform the act because the evidence established that the act was voluntary and demonstrated a reckless disregard of the consequences. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Davila, </em>75 Conn. App. 432, 438, 816 A.2d 673 (\u201cintent to do some act coupled with a reckless disregard of the consequences ... of that act is sufficient to find a violation of [\u00a7 53-21]\u201d [citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 264 Conn. 909, 826 A.2d 180 (2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 897, 125 S. Ct. 92, 160 L. Ed. 2d 166 (2004). From the defendant\u2019s statements to the police and to T that the substance he gave T was LSD, the jury reasonably could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that in voluntarily giving to a child a substance that the defendant believed to be a controlled substance, he acted with reckless disregard of the consequences, the impairment of T\u2019s mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Finally, with regard to the last element of the offense, the likely impairment of T\u2019s health, the state offered T\u2019s testimony that shortly after the defendant placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the substance on her tongue and she ingested the substance, she began to see \u201cunusual things\u201d such as a cat singing to her and a rug waving to her, and that she felt the effects of the substance for several hours after its consumption. That testimony was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s act of giving T the substance was likely to impair her health because it did, in fact, impair her mental health by altering her mind. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771, 695 A.2d 525 (1997) (because \u201chealth\u201d means state of being hale, sound or whole in body, mind or well-being, mental health encompassed by legislature\u2019s use of term in \u00a7 53-21), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. Romero, 269 Conn. 481, 849 A.2d 760 (2004). We therefore conclude that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is that the prosecutor overstepped his bounds during direct examination and closing argument. The claim stems from the prosecutor\u2019s purposeful elicitation of testimony regarding the credibility of the state\u2019s only eyewitness and the prosecutor\u2019s later reference to that testimony in summation. The defendant urges us to overturn his conviction because the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree. Although we believe that the prosecutor committed misconduct, that misconduct did not give rise to a deprivation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct was not preserved at trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Nonetheless, we will review it, as we do preserved claims of misconduct.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 572-75, 849 A.2d 626 (2004) (analyzing unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claim as if preserved for appellate review). In so doing, we undertake a two-pronged inquiry. See id., 572. First, we determine whether the challenged conduct was improper. See id. If we answer that question in the affirmative, we then assess whether that misconduct, when viewed in light of the entire trial, deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">To assess the validity of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first must determine whether the prosecutor engaged in misconduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>82 Conn. App. 856, 868, 848 A.2d 500, cert. granted on other grounds, 270 Conn. 908, 853 A.2d 524 (2004). The defendant maintains that on two occasions, the prosecutor improperly bolstered the credibility of the victim. Specifically, he contends that the questions the state asked a witness during direct examination were improper because the witness was asked to comment on the credibility of another witness, in this case, T. The defendant also argues that the prosecutor impermissibly emphasized the responses to those improper questions during his summation. We agree in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The following additional facts set the context for our analysis. At trial, the defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>depended almost entirely on T\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The only other evidence that the state produced that did not bear on T\u2019s credibility consisted of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police in which he stated that he gave LSD to T, but denied her claims of sexual assault. In support of T\u2019s credibility, the state provided the jury with the testimony of three constancy of accusation witnesses, including the counselor, St. Jean. St. Jean testified that she formerly was employed at Planned Parenthood of Connecticut, Inc., for three years. She farther testified that during her employment, her duties primarily consisted of counseling female patients about \u201creproductive health, rape, domestic abuse [and] pregnancy issues.\u201d St. Jean stated that in addition to attending medical assisting school where she was educated in counseling, she had completed approximately 600 hours of \u201con-the-job training\u201d in which she witnessed or conducted \u201chundreds\u201d of counseling sessions. St. Jean testified that she counseled T on August 23, 2000, and that dining that session, T told her that she had been drugged and forcibly raped on one occasion, and forcibly raped again on another occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Once defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination was completed, the state conducted its redirect examination of St. Jean, during which the prosecutor posed the following questions to which defense counsel did not object:</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: On the instance that happened . . . when she was talking to you, specifically about the second, about both instances, without going into detail on them, <em>did you find them credible?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Oh, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: <em>In your opinion as a counselor, </em>a person that\u2019s done hundreds of counseling sessions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>did you find her statements on being raped twice by that person credible?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: <em>Did you find her statements </em>that . . . force was used against her as <em>credible?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Did you have any reason to doubt what she was telling you?</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">Later, in his initial closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor stated, inter alia: \u201cSt. Jean testified that she had hundreds of hours of training, that she dealt in counseling people that were victims of sexual assault [and] <em>that when the victim came in, she was credible to her.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) The prosecutor also stated that it was the jury\u2019s job to \u201cjudge [the] facts and the credibility of the people,\u201d and that what he had argued was not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">After the parties completed their closing arguments, the court issued its general charge to the jury. The court instructed the juiy in relevant part: \u201cYou have observed the witnesses. The credibility, the believability of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters entirely within your own hands. It is for you alone to determine their credibility. . . . The credibility of the witness ... is for you to determine. . . . You should, in short, size up the witnesses, and make your own judgment as to their credibility, and decide what portion \u2014 some, all or none \u2014 of any particular witness\u2019 testimony you will believe on these principles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">Later, the court instructed the juiy that \u201cit is your duty to resolve any conflicts in the testimony and find where the truth lies. And in doing so, the credibility of the . . . witnesses is entirely within your duty as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>jurors.\u201d The court subsequently repeated that instruction two more times before concluding the charge. Finally, the jury indicated to the court that it would like to rehear the testimony of both T and St. Jean. The court subsequently allowed the jury to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">It is against that factual backdrop that we assess the defendant\u2019s claim of misconduct. We look first to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of St. Jean and then turn to the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis of that testimony during closing argument. \u201cA prosecutor may not ask any witness to comment on the credibility or veracity of another witness\u2019 testimony.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Beaulieu, </em>supra, 82 Conn. App. 869, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 706-708, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). In the present case, we note that the prosecutor did not directly ask St. Jean to comment on the credibility of T\u2019s <em>testimony, </em>but rather on the credibility of T\u2019s <em>statements during counseling. </em>That is, however, a distinction bereft of any meaningful difference. Decisional law relative to testimony concerning victim credibility makes clear that the prosecutor\u2019s questions in this instance were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In asking her \u201copinion as a counselor, a person that\u2019s done hundreds of counseling sessions,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s questioning called on St. Jean to testify as if she were a mental health expert.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is a well settled eviden-tiary precept that an expert may not testify regarding the credibility of the victim, as that determination is solely within the province of the jury.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>257 Conn. 797, 806, 778 A.2d 159 (2001) (our Supreme Court \u201crepeatedly [has] stated that an expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>may not testify regarding the credibility of a particular victim\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. Singh, supra, 259 Conn. 707, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Forrester, </em>60 F.3d 52, 63 (2d Cir. 1995) (\u201c[a]s a matter of law, the credibility of witnesses is exclusively for the determination by the jury . . . .\u201d [citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 797, our Supreme Court held that when an expert impermissibly does testify that the victim\u2019s statements were credible, that testimony may be characterized as \u201ca direct assertion that validated the truthfulness of [the victim\u2019s] testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 806. Accordingly, we believe that when the prosecutor purposefully elicited testimony that T spoke credibly during counseling with regard to the charges for which the defendant was on trial, the prosecutor essentially asked the witness to comment indirectly on the credibility of T\u2019s testimony. Such conduct is equally as improper as asking a witness to comment on the credibility of another witness\u2019 testimony. We conclude, therefore, that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of proper argument by asking St. Jean if she found credible T\u2019s statements about having been sexually assaulted and drugged.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The defendant also attacks the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s statement in initial closing argument to the jury. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor, in recapitulating St. Jean\u2019s testimony, improperly argued \u201cmatters that should not have been in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">As noted, the prosecutor stated during initial closing argument to the jury: \u201cSt. Jean testified that she had hundreds of hours of training, that she dealt in counseling [with] people that were victims of sexual assault [and] <em>that when the victim came in, she was credible to her.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) St. Jean\u2019s testimony concerning T\u2019s credibility came into evidence without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>objection. \u201cOur decisional law on prosecutorial misconduct makes clear that as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts <em>in evidence </em>and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Toccaline </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>80 Conn. App. 792, 806, 837 A.2d 849, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 907, 845 A.2d 413, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Toccaline </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>543 U.S. 854, 125 S. Ct. 301, 160 L. Ed. 2d 90 (2004). Although we are unaware of any decisional law that precludes a prosecutor from arguing a matter in evidence simply because the matter would not have been admissible had there been a proper objection, we are mindful that our Supreme Court has explicitly ruled that questions asking one witness to comment on the veracity of another witness are impermissible because they are invasive of the province of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>supra, 259 Conn. 707. In this instance, however, we need not reach the question of whether counsel\u2019s argument to the jury constituted misconduct because the claim fails under our due process analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Due Process Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Our examination of the validity of the defendant\u2019s conviction does not end with the identification of prose-cutorial impropriety. As our Supreme Court has stated: \u201c[T]he ultimate question is, in light of the conduct that we have concluded was improper, whether the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>269 Conn. 726, 756, 850 A.2d 199 (2004). In other words, we must determine \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict would have been different absent the sum total of the improprieties.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Conn. 460. \u201cThis final determination requires . . . the consideration of several factors: the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument, the severity of the misconduct, the frequency of the misconduct, the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case, the strength of the curative measures adopted and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 756. Those factors were first set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The defendant claims that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial because: (1) he did not invite the misconduct; (2) the misconduct was frequent, as it occurred during the state\u2019s redirect examination and, later, was emphasized during the state\u2019s summation and was replayed to the jury upon request; (3) the misconduct was severe because the prosecutor elicited from St. Jean, a witness the prosecutor treated as a mental health expert, an opinion regarding T\u2019s credibility; (4) the misconduct was central to the critical issue in the case: T\u2019s credibility; (5) the state\u2019s case was not strong, as it depended solely on T\u2019s credibility; and (6) the court did not employ any measures to cure the impropriety. We disagree. Even if we assume arguendo that the state\u2019s case was not strong and that the misconduct was severe and central to the critical issues in the case,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> our review of the record reveals that the fundamental fairness of the trial was not called into doubt by the prosecutor\u2019s misstep. The jury\u2019s not guilty verdict on counts seven through nine, relative to the alleged August 13, 2000 incident, shows that the court\u2019s charge mitigated any prejudice that might have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>As noted in part I, the jury acquitted the defendant of the more serious charge of sexual assault in the first degree as to the August 2, 2000 incident and acquitted him entirely as to the alleged August 13, 2000 incident. The split verdict provides ample indication that the jury was not unduly swayed by St. Jean\u2019s testimony regarding T\u2019s credibility as to both incidents or the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis of that testimony during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Additionally, as previously discussed, the court issued general instructions to the jury regarding its responsibility to assess the credibility of the witnesses. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of a showing that the juiy failed or declined to follow the court\u2019s instructions, we presume that it heeded them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 485. Here, there has been no showing that the jury failed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. To the contrary, the verdict was a strong indication that the jury did, in fact, heed the court\u2019s instruction and that its assessment of the evidence was not overborne by the prosecutor\u2019s impropriety. Consequently, we conclude that the court\u2019s instructions were adequate to ameliorate any harm that otherwise might have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. Prosecutorial misconduct did not, therefore, deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>iv</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In his third claim, the defendant argues that he was harmed by the court\u2019s preclusion of defense evidence concerning T\u2019s prior sexual conduct because he claims that such evidence would have impeached T\u2019s credibility. Specifically, the defendant claims that the court\u2019s improper preclusion of such evidence deprived him of his sixth amendment right to confront T and to present a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. T was the first witness to testify for the state. She testified on direct examination that on August 2, 2000, the defendant took her virginity. Later, the state offered, and the court admitted into evidence, a copy of T\u2019s calendar from the year 2000. That calendar bore the following entry, which was written by T on August 2, 2000: \u201c[M]y day! 1st Leo.\u201d T explained during direct examination that the entry signified that it was her first time having vaginal sexual intercourse. The court also admitted a copy of T\u2019s statement to the police in which she stated that she told the defendant she had no prior sexual experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">On the next day of trial, defense counsel filed a motion, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f, the rape shield statute, to offer evidence concerning T\u2019s prior sexual conduct.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Defense counsel sought to impeach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>T\u2019s credibility through evidence of her prior sexual conduct. According to defense counsel, because T testified during direct examination that she was a virgin prior to the first alleged sexual assault, evidence to the contrary was admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (2) because it was being offered to impeach her credibility. The court conducted a hearing on the motion, during which defense counsel offered the proposed testimony of two witnesses, fifteen year old B, who is the defendant\u2019s cousin, and Janine Ritrovato, the defendant\u2019s wife. B testified that she met T during the summer of 2000 when she was visiting the defendant\u2019s family. She further testified that during her visit, she went to an amusement park with T and the defendant\u2019s family at which time T told her that \u201cshe was not a virgin\u201d and \u201cthat when she was down in New Mexico, she had many boyfriends and six of them she had sex with.\u201d When asked by the prosecutor how she and T came to discuss the topic of sexual intercourse, B testified: \u201cWe were discussing, like, boys and teenage topics and stuff. And it kind of got to subjects like, so, are you a virgin? I was like, yeah.\u201d The prosecutor then asked B if T had specified whether she had had vaginal sex or oral sex, to which B responded that \u201c[s]he just said sexual intercourse.\u201d She then testified that as far as she knew, that could have meant oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Defense counsel then presented the proposed testimony of Janine Ritrovato. When asked by defense counsel whether \u201cthere was any incident that would indicate [that T] was not a virgin,\u201d Janine Ritrovato testified that T had \u201cmade accusations similar to what she did with [the defendant] about her stepdad.\u201d During cross-examination, Janine Ritrovato further testified that she did not know if T\u2019s prior sexual conduct involved \u201coral sex, anal sex or vaginal sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>At the conclusion of the testimony, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court based its ruling on, inter alia, its finding that the testimony of the witnesses was not credible, and the court \u201cdid not believe that there was a good faith showing that [the evidence] would indicate that there was prior sexual conduct . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court also held that the prejudicial impact of the evidence far outweighed the probative value. The defendant took exception to the court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant claims that the court incorrectly precluded testimony concerning T\u2019s prior sexual conduct. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">At the outset, we note that whether the court\u2019s exclusion of evidence entitles the defendant to a new trial requires us to resolve three questions. The first is whether the court\u2019s ruling was improper. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>267 Conn. 363, 382-85, 838 A.2d 186 (preliminarily examining propriety of trial court\u2019s ruling), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1036, 124 S. Ct. 2113, 158 L. Ed. 2d 722 (2004). Should we answer that question in the negative, we need go no further. Should we answer that question in the affirmative, the second question we must answer is whether that impropriety rose to the level of a constitutional violation. See id., 385. Should we answer that question in the affirmative as well, the third question we must answer is whether the state has demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>that the constitutional impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>267 Conn. 686, 706, 841 A.2d 1144 (2004). A negative answer to that third question would warrant a new trial. See id., 709-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Thus, in evaluating the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we begin by reviewing the court\u2019s ruling. That task requires us to decide whether the court abused its discretion in excluding the proffered evidence pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 454 (\u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">As previously noted, the court precluded the proposed testimony on the basis of its conclusion that the testimony was not credible and, therefore, that it was not probative of prior sexual activity. The court\u2019s ruling was, in effect, that because the evidence was not credible, it could not have been relevant to the issue of the T\u2019s credibility. \u201cOne fact is relevant to another fact whenever, according to the common course of events, the existence of the one, taken alone or in connection with other facts, renders the existence of the other either certain or more probable. . . . Although the trial court has wide discretion in its rulings on the relevancy of evidence ... its rulings will be reversed if the court has abused its discretion or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>220 Conn. 345, 353-54, 599 A.2d 1 (1991). Here, the court\u2019s relevancy determination was premised on its assessment that the witness\u2019 testimony lacked credibility. We give deference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>court\u2019s findings regarding the credibility of a witness\u2019 testimony because it heard and observed that testimony firsthand. See <em>Morant </em>v. <em>State, </em>68 Conn. App. 137, 159, 802 A.2d 93 (\u201c[W]e must defer to the court\u2019s findings regarding the credibility of those witnesses because it heard and observed their testimony firsthand. As a practical matter, it is inappropriate [for an appellate court] to assess credibility without having watched a witness testify, because demeanor, conduct and other factors are not fully reflected in the cold, printed record.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]), cert. denied, 260 Conn. 914, 796 A.2d 558, overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Shabazz </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 811, 830 n.13, 792 A.2d 797 (2002). Thus, we will not deem a credibility assessment by the court improper unless the record reveals that it is clearly erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>78 Conn. App. 527, 531, 827 A.2d 780, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 909, 832 A.2d 73 (2003). In the present case, our review of the record leads us to conclude that the court\u2019s assessment was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Having determined that the proposed testimony lacked credibility, the court concluded that the testimony would not contradict T\u2019s testimony regarding her virginity. Thus, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the proffered testimony. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s third claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">JURY INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that certain of the court\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly defined the term \u201clikely\u201d in \u00a7 53-21 (a) (1) and (2) as meaning <em>\u201cpossible </em>or probable,\u201d thereby diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof as to whether the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201clikely to impair\u201d T\u2019s health or morals and violating the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>of law.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) According to the defendant, the ordinary and proper meaning of the term \u201clikely\u201d is probable, and the court\u2019s definition of \u201cpossible\u201d improperly lessened its meaning for the jury. Conceding that his claim was not preserved at trial, the defendant asserts that it is reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We agree that the claim is reviewable because the record is adequate for our review, and the claim that the court incorrectly instructed the jury as to an element of a charged offense is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 487. The claim fails, however, under <em>Golding\u2019s </em>third prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Our Supreme Court addressed the exact same claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 485-95. In <em>Romero, </em>the trial court defined the term \u201clikely\u201d as meaning \u201c \u2018in all probability or <em>possibility \u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 488. That language was identical to the language used by the court in the present case. In addition, the trial court in <em>Romero </em>instructed the jury that for the state to sustain its burden, the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was \u201c <em>\u2018possible </em>or probable\u2019 \u201d that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201c \u2018would injure or weaken the child\u2019s health or morals.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. That additional instruction also was issued in this case.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Our Supreme Court concluded in <em>Romero </em>that instructing the jury that \u201clikely\u201d meant \u201cpossible\u201d was improper. Id., 489-92. In light of Romero, we conclude that the court\u2019s instruction in that regar d was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">That determination does not, however, end our inquiry. Having concluded the jury instructions were improper, we turn then to a consideration, under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by these improprieties. See id., 492. That consideration requires that we address separately each conviction of risk of injury to a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (a) (2), the facts relevant to our resolution of the issue virtually are identical to those in <em>Romero, </em>another case involving sexual assault of a child. See id., 493-94. As in <em>Romero, </em>because the jury in this instance found the defendant guilty of having sexually assaulted the victim, we find no basis for any argument that the jury could have been uncertain that such an assault did, in fact, impair the child, as alleged in the risk of injury charge. In short, on these facts, we conclude that the jury could not reasonably have been misled by the court\u2019s improper instruction as to the meaning of the term \u201clikely.\u201d See id., 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Additionally, with respect to the defendant\u2019s conviction for risk of injury to a child, in violation of \u00a7 53-21 (1), regarding the defendant\u2019s having given LSD to T, we also conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the court\u2019s instructional impropriety, when evaluated in light of the entire charge, misled the jury. We note that the court gave the jury a thorough explanation of the concept of reasonable doubt and the state\u2019s burden of proving each element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, as noted in part II C, \u00a7 53-21 (1) requires proof beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>doubt that the defendant voluntarily committed an act that was <em>likely to impair T\u2019s health, </em>and we further observed that evidence was adduced at trial that the act the defendant committed did, in fact, impair T\u2019s health. Given that evidence, we do not believe that there is any reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Finally, each time the court improperly defined the term \u201clikely\u201d as \u201cpossible,\u201d it also gave the proper definition of the term as \u201cprobable\u201d or \u201cin all probability.\u201d Those accurate instructions minimized the potential harm flowing from the court\u2019s inaccurate instructions concerning the meaning of the term \u201clikely.\u201d We therefore conclude that, viewing the record and the charge as a whole, there does not exist a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instructional improprieties. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s final claim must <em>fail.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-7\"> The defendant was acquitted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) in connection with the August 2, 2000 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b608-8\"> The defendant was acquitted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 and risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53-21 (2) in connection with the alleged August 13, 2000 incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identity may be ascertained.
