The alleged misrepresentations were made by insured in answer to the following questions contained in the application for insurance:</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">\u201c \u20185. Have you ever been an inmate of, or have you ever received treatment at an asylum, hospital, sanatorium, or cure? If yes, give date, duration, name of ailment and name of institution.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">A. \u2018Yes \u2014 appendectomy 1909 \u2014 Beth Israel Hospital \u2014 17 Days\u2014 Dr. Y. Parsonnett, M.D.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-7\">\u201cThe answer was true and it was sufficient, even though insured had been in other hospitals on other occasions. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co. </em>v. <em>Stone, 127 N. J. Eq. 97; Urback </em>v. <em>Metropolitan, 130 N. J. Law 210.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-8\">\u201c \u201811. Have you ever suffered from any ailment or disease of (a) the brain or nervous system?\u2019 A. \u2018No.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-9\">\u201cThere is no evidence that insured had ever had an ailment or disease of the brain. There is some slight evidence of trouble, with the nervous system but none that insured was aware of it. The question \u2018sought to probe the insured\u2019s mind and if he answered truthfully to the full extent of his knowledge, there was necessarily no false representation.\u2019 <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 114. N. J. Eq. 378.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-10\">\u201c \u201812 (g). Have you consulted a physician for any ailment or disease not included in your above answers?\u2019 A. \u2018No.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b147-11\">\u201c \u201813. What physician or physicians, if any, not named above, have you consulted or been treated by, within the last five years, and for what illness or ailment? If none, so state.\u2019 A. \u2018None.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-12\">\u201cInsured, who drove a truck for a wholesale cleaning and dyeing concern, carried on his usual occupations and continued in apparent good health until immediately before his death November 9th, 1937. But occasionally, during 1933\u2014 the policy was issued May 1st, 1936 \u2014 he had fainting spells. About the end of 1933, he called upon Dr. Edward M. Fine-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>silver. \u2018He wanted a check up, so I sent him over there [to the New York Hospital] for a diagnostic work up/ He was at the hospital for five days and received numerous tests. The results were all negative except for disclosing a slight nystagmus, that is, a rhythmic motion of the eyes which may be an indication of some nervous disease. Dr. Finesilver studied the findings of the New York Hospital and informed insured \u2018that they did not find anything the matter with him/ The doctor\u2019s own conclusion was that the fainting spells were caused by hysteria due to stress and strain from financial reverses. He considered that Urback\u2019s condition of health was perfectly normal. Insured died suddenly November 9th, 1937, from a hemorrhage of the brain covering. Complainant suggests that the fainting spells of 1933 were caused by a brain tumor, which finally brought about his death four or \u25a0five years later. The medical testimony indicates that this is very unlikely.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-4\">\u201cNow to revert to the questions in the application, and Urback\u2019s answers. Obviously, question 12(g) is limited to consultations about an ailment or disease. Many careful men seek a- physician yearly for an examination, in order to discover if any trouble is developing so that it may be treated in its early stages. Such a consultation is not included within the scope of this question. Question 13 is likewise limited: \u2018What physician * * * have you consulted * * * and for what illness or ailment?\u2019 Then follow blank spaces for \u2018Name and address of physicians,\u2019 \u2018Name and date of illnesses,\u2019 \u2018Results.\u2019 Urback went to Dr. Finesilver and to the New York Hospital to learn whether he had any ailment oi; disease. He was told that they found none. . He did not consult them and was not treated by them for any illness or ailment. His answers were truthful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b148-5\">\u201cLet the bill be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-6\"><em>Messrs.
