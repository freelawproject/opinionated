She is a dual beneficiary. She receives primary benefits, on her own account, as a retired worker covered under the Social Security Act (SSA). She also receives derivative benefits as the surviving spouse of a worker covered under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The SSA requires the reduction of a recipient\u2019s benefits by one dollar for every two dollars of income the recipient earns in excess of a statutorily defined exempt amount. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b). The RRA incorporates the SSA excess earnings provision by reference. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(g)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the two fifty percent offset provisions, the one in the SSA and one in the RRA, are separately applied to each of the benefits a dual beneficiary receives, income earned in excess of the exempt amount<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> will yield, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>total, a one hundred percent or a dollar-for-dollar offset.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In 1974, petitioner Burns earned $3800. The exempt amount that year was $2400. Thus, her excess earnings amounted to $1400. She reported her 1974 earnings to the Social Security Administration (Administration) and that agency deducted $744 from her social security benefits in 1976.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two years later, the Railroad Retirement Board (Board) offset $700 against petitioner Burns\u2019s 1978 railroad retirement benefits to account for her excess earnings of $1400 in 1974. AR at 31-34. Burns unsuccessfully contested the Board\u2019s action through administrative channels. <em>In re Alberta E. Burns, </em>Railroad Retirement Act Claims Appeal Docket No. 1883. As authorized by 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 231g, 355(f), she now petitions this court to review the Board\u2019s December 11, 1980, decision rejecting her claim for recovery of the $700 deducted from her 1978 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Burns sought to proceed here on behalf of a class. Our decision denying her motion for an order certifying the class and granting the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss the class element of the petition appears in a companion opinion. <em>See Burns v. United States Railroad Retirement Board, </em>701 F.2d 189 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Initially, Burns challenges the Board\u2019s offset as contrary to the intent of Congress. If the Board correctly applied its governing statute, she argues alternately, the resulting dual offset is unconstitutional because it contravenes the equal protection principle. Finally, she urges that even if her statutory interpretation and constitutional arguments fail, the Board acted impermissibly in rejecting her request for waiver of the $700 recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Petitioner Burns maintains principally that separate and independent excess earnings offsets by the Administration and the Board leave a dual beneficiary without any fruit from her labors; the dollar-for-dollar offset, she emphasizes, removes all incentive to earn more than the exempt amount. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>But the laws that entitle her to dual benefits, on their face, also exact dual offsets. Because we do not believe a court is at liberty to excise either offset or to require the Administration and Board to coordinate deductions, each taking away less than its governing statute authorizes, we cannot embrace Burns\u2019s statutory construction or constitutional arguments. Nonetheless, we disagree with the Board\u2019s disposition of this case. For the reasons stated in part III of this opinion, we reverse the determination that petitioner Burns was \u201cat fault\u201d in causing the Board to overpay her $700, and instruct the Board to decide on remand whether recovery of the overpayment should be waived under the RRA\u2019s \u201cpurpose of [the Act]\u201d or \u201cequity or good conscience\u201d standard. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231i(c) (Board shall not recover overpayment to individual who is \u201cwithout fault\u201d if recovery \u201cwould be contrary to the purpose of [the Act] . . . or would be against equity or good conscience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">I. The Earned Income Offset Provisions and Their Application to Dual Beneficiaries</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Social Security Act provides that \u201c[deductions ... shall be made from any payment or payments under this sub-chapter to which an individual is entitled ... if for such month he is charged with excess earnings, under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(b); subsection (f), in turn, states that \u201can individual\u2019s excess earnings for a taxable year shall be 50 per centum of his earnings for such year in excess of [the exempt amount],\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(f)(3). The Railroad Retirement Act, since 1954, has incorporated the SSA offset provision by reference. Social Security Amendments of 1954, Pub.L. No. 83-761, \u00a7 401(d), 68 Stat. 1052,1098. The RRA thus states that \u201c[deductions ... shall be made from any payments to which a survivor is entitled ... if for such month such survivor would be charged with excess earnings under section 403(f) of Title 42 .... \u201d 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(g)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Petitioner Burns acknowledges the literal meaning of these texts; she recognizes that \u201cboth Acts provide for an offset.\u201d Brief for Petitioner at 18. She argues, however, that the court should reject \u201cnarrow, overly-literal interpretation which contradicts the Congressional intent and purpose underlying the enactment of these statutory provisions.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 19. But a statute \u201cas complex as the Social Security Act,\u201d Dissent at 212, reflects many legislative concerns and purposes. It oversimplifies, we believe, to ascribe a sole purpose to the statutory scheme at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The vast majority of retirees covered under the SSA or the RRA receive only one federal social insurance benefit. <em>See supra </em>note 1. No doubt Congress had these single benefit retirees in view in 1972 when it revised the SSA\u2019s excess earnings formula (and, by reference, the RRA\u2019s) to reduce all benefit deductions from dollar-for-dollar to one dollar for every two. Social Security Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. No. 92-603, \u00a7 105(a)(3), 86 Stat. 1329, 1341; <em>see supra </em>note 4. The evidence is indeed \u201coverwhelming\u201d that Congress reduced the offset to encourage social security beneficiaries to work. <em>See </em>Dissent at 209-210, 213-214. However, there is no evidence that Congress envisioned but one offset for the retiree who receives two federal social insurance benefits. Rather, it appears that in. 1972, the year the fifty percent formula was spread across the board,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as in preceding years, Congress did not advert specifically to the dual beneficiary\u2019s situation when it legislated offsets for earned income. <em>See </em>Dissent at 212.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Based on the \u201csolicitude\u201d Congress showed for gainfully-employed social security annuitants, cf. Dissent at 211-212, Burns urges that the work incentive purpose motivating the 1972 offset reduction should exclude an excess earnings toll greater than fifty percent for single and dual beneficiaries alike. But the provisions Congress put in place in the two statutes express the opposite. It is treacherous to brush aside the literal meaning of those provisions and, by riveting attention on work incentive, avoid forthright recognition of another concern on the mind of Congress. That concern relates to the appropriateness of allowing a retiree to collect two federal social insurance benefits. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Congress initially prohibited RRA surviv- or annuitants from simultaneously receiving social security benefits; that restriction was repealed in 1955.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1951, the RRA was amended to eliminate dual benefits for employee annuitants; that amendment was repealed in 1954.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>D. Schreiber, Legislative History of the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Unemployment Insurance Systems 390-92 (1978) (detailed account of shifting legislative positions on allowance of multiple benefits under RRA). Payment of these dual benefits \u201cthreatened the railroad retirement system with bankruptcy by the year 1981,\u201d <em>United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 169, 101 S.Ct. 453, 456, 66 L.Ed.2d 368 (1980), and \u201cprompt[ed] Congress [in 1974] to completely revise the Railroad Retirement Act to gradually eliminate dual benefits.\u201d Dissent at 204 n. 2. <em>See supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In light of the ambivalence of Congress regarding allowance of dual benefits, and the legislature\u2019s ultimate rejection of them, we do not venture to guess how Congress would have responded had it been asked the question this case poses in 1955, when dual benefits were allowed to persons situated as is petitioner Burns, or in 1972, when the excess earnings offsets were reduced across the board to fifty percent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We note only that it can not be said with any secure support that Congress would have replied, \u201cYes, individuals who receive two benefits, like individuals who receive only one, should be subject to but one offset for nonexempt earnings.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While we offer no speculation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>as to what solution the legislature would have adopted had it specifically adverted to this case, we point out that on at least two occasions, information was placed before Congress concerning the double offset contested here.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">First, in a 1972 report to the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, the Commission on Railroad Retirement, established by Congress in 1970 to recommend changes in the financially troubled system, described the RRA\u2019s then effective \u201csurvivor beneficiaries earnings test\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">equivalent to the social security earnings test \u2014 which reduces the beneficiary\u2019s annuity by one dollar for every two earned between [the applicable amounts], thereafter on a dollar-for-dollar basis. <em>Dual beneficiaries are, of course, subject to the various social security work clauses on their dual benefits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">H.R.Doc. No. 350, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 385 (1972) (emphasis supplied). Second, in 1976, a bill introduced in the House of Representatives proposed \u201camending] the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 to provide that amounts of excess earnings with which a social security benefit is charged shall not be used in making deductions from widows\u2019 benefits under the railroad retirement system.\u201d H.R. 14153, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. (1976). The proposed amendment would have achieved through legislation what petitioner Bums asks the court to order. We agree with Burns that introduction of this bill does not indicate legislative acquiescence in the Administration\u2019s and Board\u2019s position that dual benefits attract dual offsets, see Dissent at 210 n. 19, but the proposal does suggest that at least some members of Congress were cognizant of the agencies\u2019 position.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Since we cannot divine the lawmakers\u2019 will with respect to the special and only category of retirees the instant petition describes \u2014 recipients of dual benefits \u2014 we return to the scheme Congress adopted. <em>Cf. Consumer Product Safety Commission </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980) (\u201cAbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, [statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d). The RRA authorizes petitioner Burns to retain her social security benefit in full while collecting her railroad retirement annuity in full. <em>See supra </em>note 7. Each Act calls for an identical earned income offset against benefits under that Act. Literal application of each offset provision is not readily labeled \u201ceccentric,\u201d \u201cabsurd,\u201d or \u201cunreasonable.\u201d <em>But cf. </em>Dissent at 206-208 &amp; nn. 11-13. Congress might well have considered a double offset a fitting match for a double benefit. The second offset for the dual beneficiary ameliorates the disparity in benefits received by similarly situated surviving spouses (persons covered by social insurance both on their own account and as spouses of covered workers), most of whom qualify for only one benefit. <em>See supra </em>note 1. In addition, dual recoupments, when a dual beneficiary\u2019s earned income exceeds the exempt amount, accord with the discrete character Congress still orders for the railroad retirement and social security funds. Further, there is nothing inherently arbitrary about a dollar-for-dollar offset; Congress could reasonably conclude that retired persons who earn income do not have the need fully retired persons have for replacement of pre-retirement income. In sum, while the wisdom of a dual or dollar-for-dollar offset is indeed debatable, \u201cwe think it clear that Congress could rationally choose to adopt such a course.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 781, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2474, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">We note finally that even if we agreed with petitioner Burns that Congress unquestionably would have specified a fifty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>percent solution had it focused on her situation, we would find her petition problematic. At bottom, her statutory construction argument invites the court to order adjustments of the kind appropriately left to legislative determination. <em>Cf. Califano v. Westcott, </em>443 U.S. 76, 91-93, 99 S.Ct. 2655, 2664-65, 61 L.Ed.2d 382 (1979). Questions such as these arise: Should one or the other of the two offset provisions be excised for persons situated as Burns is? Which offset, if either, would Congress have eliminated? Burns suggests, as one possible solution, a sequential rather than a simultaneous offset: first, an offset of fifty percent of her 1974 earnings over $2400 against her social security benefits, then a further offset of fifty percent against her railroad retirement benefits in the event she earned over $4800. Brief for Petitioner at 31-32. She proposes as the preferable solution forfeiture of fifty percent of her excess earnings \u201cto the two agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The precise adjustment appropriate to bring the offset provisions in line with what petitioner Burns sees as the sole design of Congress is not immediately apparent. Her invitation for court-ordered amendment of one or both of the implicated statutory subsections involves \u201cfine tuning\u201d the judiciary should not undertake, \u201cdefinitional and policy questions\u201d judges are ill-equipped to resolve. <em>Compare Califano v. Westcott, supra, </em>443 U.S. at 92, 93, 99 S.Ct. at 2664, 2665, <em>with id. </em>at 95 &amp; n. 1, 99 S.Ct. at 2666 &amp; n. 1 (Powell, J., dissenting). She cites no precedent in support of judicially-directed revision of legislation of the character in which she would have the court indulge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In sum, despite the appeal of petitioner Burns\u2019s position, we are persuaded that hers is \u201ca legislative, and not a legal, argument.\u201d <em>Schweiker v. Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 238; 101 S.Ct. 1074, 1084, 67 L.Ed.2d 186 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">II. The constitutionality of</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">DUAL OFFSETS</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Petitioner Burns asserts that separate fifty percent excess earnings offsets exacted by the Administration and the Board violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, </em>420 U.S. 636, 638 n. 2, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1228 n. 2, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975). What we have said concerning the rationality of dual offsets as a match for dual benefits essentially disposes of her Constitution-based argument. <em>See supra </em>pp. 198-199.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">The discrimination against dual beneficiaries alleged here does not rest on a characteristic, such as race or sex, triggering strict or heightened judicial scrutiny. <em>Cf. Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Insurance Co., </em>446 U.S. 142, 100 S.Ct. 1540, 64 L.Ed.2d 107 (1980) (workers\u2019 compensation scheme\u2019s gender-based discrimination violates equal protection); <em>Califano v. Goldfarb, </em>430 U.S. 199, 97 S.Ct. 1021, 51 L.Ed.2d 270 (1977) (gender-based discrimination in social security program violates equal protection). Rather, as Burns acknowledges, social legislation of this sort, when no suspect or near-suspect classification is involved, attracts a \u201csignificant presumption\u201d of constitutionality. Brief for Petitioner at 38. <em>See Schweiker v. Wilson, supra, </em>450 U.S. at 230, 101 S.Ct. at 1080. Plausible reasons support dual offsets when a federal social insurance recipient is allowed dual benefits. <em>See su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>pra </em>pp. 198-199. The \u201crational basis criterion applicable here requires no more. <em>See United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, supra, </em>449 U.S. at 179, 101 S.Ct. at 461 (\u201cWhere ... there are plausible reasons for Congress\u2019 action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, \u2018constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision,\u2019 [citation omitted] because this Court has never insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute.\u201d). Sympathy for the circumstances of a complainant, or a belief that the legislation reviewed advances unsound policy, does not permit a court to deviate from this highly deferential standard. <em>See, e.g., Califano v. Boles, </em>443 U.S. 282, 99 S.Ct. 2767, 61 L.Ed.2d 541 (1979); <em>Califano v. Jobst, </em>434 U.S. 47, 98 S.Ct. 95, 54 L.Ed.2d 228 (1977); <em>Mathews v. De Castro, </em>429 U.S. 181, 97 S.Ct. 431, 50 L.Ed.2d 389 (1976). <em>See also Yost v. Schweiker, </em>545 F.Supp. 591 (D.S.D.1982) (citing <em>Fritz </em>as controlling precedent and upholding SSA provision dictating that spouse divorced after marriage of 42 years is disqualified from receiving benefits under both SSA and RRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">III. Petitioner\u2019s request to waive recovery OF THE ASSERTED OVERPAYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"ASo\">In 1978, the Board fully recouped the asserted $700 overpayment attributed to petitioner Burns\u2019s 1974 earnings above the $2400 exempt amount. Thereafter, upon obtaining legal assistance, Burns petitioned the Board to waive recovery under section 10(c) of the Railroad Retirement Act, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">There shall be no recovery in any case m which more than the correct amount of annuities or other benefits has been paid ... to an individual ... who, in the judgment of the Board, is without fault when, in the judgment of the Board, recovery would be contrary to the purpose of [the Act] ... or would be against equity or good conscience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231i(c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Board denied the waiver request;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> it ruled that, because petitioner Burns did not report her 1974 earnings to the Board (although she did report them to the Social Security Administration), she was \u201cat fault in causing the overpayment,\u201d AR at 4, therefore she was ineligible for a waiver. We conclude that the Board\u2019s attribution of fault to Burns is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the order here on review and remand the case to the Board with instructions to grant the waiver request if the Board determines, in accordance with section 10(c), that recoupment from petitioner Burns is not impelled by the purpose of the Act or by equity or good conscience. <em>See, e.g., Hays v. Finch, </em>306 F.Supp. 115 (W.D.Pa.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">A. <em>The fault attribution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The Board acted to recoup benefits paid to Bums precisely because she reported her 1974 earnings: her report to the Social Security Administration caused that agency to recoup $744 by suspending her social security benefits for more than two months in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>1976;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> when the Administration reported those same earnings to the Board, it in turn recouped $700 two years later by suspending her survivor\u2019s annuity for four and one half months. AR at 31-34. In reviewing the Board\u2019s attribution of fault to petitioner Burns we proceed from the undisputed fact that she did not conceal her earnings.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Instead, she timely and accurately reported her earnings to the Social Security Administration, the government agency responsible for administration of her primary social insurance benefit.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Rini v. Harris, </em>615 F.2d 625 (5th Cir.1980) (fault lies with agency, not with recipient, when agency fails to provide clear, timely information concerning benefit entitlement).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The Board maintains, however, that Burns was at fault because she failed to twice report her earnings. She should have known, the Board contends, that the RRA required an offset for excess earnings separate from the social security offset, and a filing separate from the report she made to the Administration. To support its view of what Burns should have known and its consequent fault determination, the Board points to two considerations. First, in 1969, when Burns filed her application for a survivor\u2019s annuity under the RRA, she received a pamphlet instructing her, <em>inter alia, </em>to report earnings over the exempt amount. <em>See </em>Brief for Respondent App. B.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> At that time, she signed a printed form certifying that the pamphlet\u2019s contents had been explained to her and that she understood she must tell the Board of her earnings in excess of the exempt amount. <em>See </em>AR at 22. Second, in 1973, she was informed of a $26 RRA survivor\u2019s annuity overpayment occasioned by her excess earnings, <em>see </em>AR at 29; according to the Board, the 1973 notice should have alerted her to the need to report her 1974 earnings to both agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Turning first to the Board\u2019s 1973 recoupment of $26 based on petitioner Burns\u2019s receipt one year of $53.60 in annual earnings over the exempt limit<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the asserted alert to Burns is not readily discerned. Nothing in the record indicates any corresponding SSA recoupment. Nor does the 1973 overpayment notice refer to any default on Burns\u2019s part in failing to report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>earnings to the Board. AR at 29.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In short, this evidence of an alerting circumstance adequate to justify the Board\u2019s fault finding appears highly insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">While the pamphlet Burns received in 1969 did inform her of the fifty percent offset applicable under the RRA, it did not explain that the offset operated twice against a person in her situation. Rather, it simply conveyed that she would lose one dollar in benefits for every two dollars of yearly earnings above the statutory ceiling.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Social Security Administration was no more enlightening.

We therefore remand this case to the Board for expeditious determination whether, in view of petitioner Burns\u2019s satisfaction of the \u201cwithout fault\u201d criterion, waiver of recovery would be consonant with the Act\u2019s purpose or with equity or good conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">.

Both Acts contain provisions which authorize the reduction of a recipient\u2019s benefits by $1 for every $2 of the recipient\u2019s \u201cexcess earnings\u201d \u2014those earnings which exceed a statutorily defined level each year. The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) and the Social Security Administration (Administration) both interpret these excess earnings provisions to permit them to reduce a recipient\u2019s benefits for excess earnings irrespective of whether the other agency has also reduced the recipient\u2019s benefits for the same earnings. As a result, individuals, such as petitioner, who receive benefits under both Acts are subject to a $1 reduction in benefits for each $1 of excess earnings, up to the total of benefits received.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Petitioner challenges a decision of the Board affirming the determination of an appeals referee that she was overpaid $700 in Railroad Retirement benefits in 1974 as a result of excess earnings that year, and that waiver of recovery of the overpayment by the Board was not appropriate. Prior to the Board\u2019s decision, the Administration had reduced petitioner\u2019s Social Security benefits because of her excess earnings in 1974. Petitioner asserts that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the excess earnings provisions defeats the intent of Congress and violates equal protection and due process under the Fifth Amendment. Alternative<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ly, petitioner argues that the Board erred in refusing to waive recovery of the overpayment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">The excess earnings provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act have a common purpose \u2014 ensuring that benefits are only paid to persons who are truly retired, while encouraging such persons to work to supplement their benefits. As such, the provisions of the two statutes must be read <em>in pari materia </em>to effectuate this clearly articulated purpose. I find that the Board\u2019s policy with respect to reducing benefits for excess earnings is a narrow, overly-literal interpretation of the excess earnings provisions which defeats the obvious intent of Congress in amending those provisions to encourage retired persons to work by reducing their benefits by only $1 for every $2 of excess earnings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, I would reverse the Board\u2019s decision and direct the Board to pay petitioner the $700 withheld from her benefits because of her 1974 earnings. Because the majority upholds the Board\u2019s interpretation of the excess earnings provisions, at 196-199,1 respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The Railroad Retirement Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides for payment of benefits to railroad workers who have satisfied work-related requirements, as well as to certain of their dependents and survivors. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980). The program is financed by the contributions of both employers and employees and is administered by the Board, an independent agency of the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 231f. \u25a0 The Social Security Act establishes a program which provides similar benefits and is financed in a similar fashion, but is separately administered by the Administration pursuant to that Act.

Benefits under the Social Security Act are subject to a $1 deduction for every $2 of such excess earnings. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403 (1976 &amp; Supp. IV 1980).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Railroad Retirement Act also provides for a $1 deduction for each $2 of excess earnings by incorporating the excess earnings provision of the Social Security Act by reference. 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 231a(g) (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither Act explicitly indicates how deductions for excess earnings are to be made if an individual receives benefits under <em>both </em>programs. Both Acts are silent with respect to individuals in that circumstance. Nevertheless, both the Board and the Administration read the excess earnings provisions literally and reduce the benefits they administer by 50 percent of excess earnings without regard to the 50 percent reduction imposed by the other agency. As a result, persons receiving benefits under both the Railroad Retirement Act and 'the Social Security Act have 100 percent of their excess earnings recovered by the agencies, until the deduction equals the total benefit received.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">In 1974, petitioner was receiving survivors\u2019 benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act based on her deceased husband\u2019s work record, and primary benefits under the Social Security Act based on her own work record. That year she earned $3800, $1400 over the then existing statutory earnings limit of $2400.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner reported these earnings to the Administration and it deducted $744 from her benefits in 1976.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>1978, the Board notified petitioner that the Administration had informed it of her 1974 excess earnings and that, as a result of those earnings, she had been overpaid $700 in Railroad Retirement Act benefits in 1974. Accordingly, the Board deducted that amount from her benefits in 1978. Administrative Record at 31-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Petitioner administratively challenged the Board\u2019s deduction of the $700 from her benefits. The Board\u2019s Bureau of Retirement Claims rejected her appeal, and its decision was sustained by a Board appeals referee. The Board upheld the referee\u2019s findings, holding that the Railroad Retirement \u201cAct contains no exception to the earnings limitation for those individuals who are also receiving a social security benefit subject to the same limitation.\u201d In re <em>Alberta E. Burns, </em>Railroad Retirement Act Claims Appeal Docket No. 1883, 2 (U.S.R.R. Retirement Bd. Dec. 11, 1980), Administrative Record at 2, 3.

However, neither the Railroad Retirement Act nor the Social' Security Act specifies how deductions for excess earnings are to be made from individuals receiving benefits under both programs. Petitioner argues that the Board\u2019s policy of deducting 50 percent of excess earnings from a recipient\u2019s benefits irrespective of whether the Administration has also deducted 50 percent of those excess earnings \u201cis a narrow, overly-literal interpretation which contradicts the Congressional intent .... \u201d Brief for Petitioner at 19. Respondent counters that where, as here, \u201cthe statutory language is clear and unequivocal, there is no need to analyze legislative history to determine legislative intent.\u201d Brief for Respondent at 19. Thus, at the outset, it is necessary to determine the propriety of looking to legislative history for guidance as to the proper interpretation of the excess earnings provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">The function of this Court in interpreting an act of Congress \u201cis to construe the language so as to give effect to the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>United States v.

Those provisions clearly apply to individuals receiving benefits under only one Act, but <em>neither Act expressly deals with individuals receiving benefits under both Acts. </em>While it is arguably correct to assert that the excess earnings provisions indicate a $1 deduction for every $1 of excess earnings under the circumstances presented by this case, there is sufficient doubt whether Congress intended such result that resort to the legislative history of the excess earnings provisions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>determine the congressional intent is warranted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Examination of that legislative history reveals that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the excess earnings provisions is not in keeping with the \u201cspirit in which they were written and the reasons for their enactment.\u2019\u2019 <em>General Service Employee Union Local 73 v.

In 1972, in response to a proposal from the Nixon administration,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Congress adopted amendments to the Social Security Act<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which, <em>inter alia, </em>replaced the excess earnings formula with the present $1 deduction from benefits for every $2 in excess earnings. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 231, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1971); S.Rep. No. 1230, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1972), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 1972, p. 4989.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The clearly articulated purpose of this change was to encourage retired persons to work by increasing the benefits of doing so. Thus, the House Report accompanying the 1972 Amendments stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">[Y]our committee believes that the American people do not want a system which results in promoting welfare as a way of life. Your committee\u2019s deliberations, therefore, have been aimed toward providing adequate assistance to those who cannot help themselves, while at the same time <em>creating a system of assistance which will maximize the incentive and the obligation of those who are able to work to help themselves.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">H.R.Rep. No. 231, <em>supra, </em>at 2 (emphasis added), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 4990. The House Report emphasized the intent of Congress to encourage work when it discussed the rationale for changing the excess earnings provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABi\">This change would assure that the more a beneficiary works and earns, the more spendable income (that is, social security benefits plus earnings after taxes) he will have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 49, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1972, p. 5036. The Senate Report reiterated this theme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-14\">The committee agrees with the President that <em>work should be rewarded and its value to the worker </em>increased.... A number of ... provisions [including the excess earnings provision] are included in the committee bill which reflects the committee\u2019s aim of <em>increasing the benefits of working.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">S.Rep. No. 1230, <em>supra, </em>at 4 (emphasis added). Significantly, the Senate Report concluded that \u201cthere would be no $l-for-$l <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>reduction [in benefits] as undef present law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Although the explicit purpose of Congress in altering the excess earnings provision was to encourage retired persons to work, and to provide them greater rewards if they did, Congress clearly recognized that working retirees would also help relieve the financial burdens on the benefit programs. Under the prior $l-for-$l excess earnings formula, a rational person would not work because there was no incentive to do so\u2014 each dollar earned would cost a dollar of benefits, and earnings were taxed while benefits were not. To the extent that retired persons did not work, their benefit payments could not be reduced by recovering excess earnings. Congress clearly thought that more retired persons would work under the new $l-for-$2 excess earnings formula because they would be assured of realizing some net income from work earnings if their benefits were reduced because of such earnings. To the extent that retired persons do work, their benefit payments can be reduced by recovering excess earnings, thus relieving some of the financial burden on the benefit programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The Board offers no legislative history which contradicts the conclusion that the purpose of the 1972 amendments to the excess earnings provision was to encourage retired persons to work.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It merely argues that in \u201cincorporating [the excess earnings] provisions into the Railroad Retirement Act [in 1954], Congress could not have been unaware that it was subjecting widows ... who received a social security benefit in addition to their railroad retirement annuity to a double offset.\u201d Brief for Respondent at 21. I cannot agree. There is no evidence in the legislative history of the Social Security Amendments of 1954 that Congress intended to impose a double deduction on individuals receiving benefits under both Acts when it included an amendment to the Railroad Retirement Act incorporating the excess earnings provision of the Social Security Act by reference.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> There is no specific legislative history with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>respect to the incorporation by reference amendment,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> but once again in the overall legislation Congress evidenced a desire to encourage retirees to work and to increase the benefit to them of doing so<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">More importantly, in 1954, when Congress incorporated by reference the excess earnings provision of the Social Security Act into the Railroad Retirement Act, individuals such as petitioner received only the greater of the benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act or the Social Security Act to which they were entitled.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It was not until 1955 that Congress amended the Railroad Retirement Act to permit such individuals to receive both benefits. Act of Aug. 12, 1955, Pub.L. No. 84-383, \u00a7 2, 69 Stat. 715, 716. Thus, contrary to the Board\u2019s assertion, Congress in 1954 was necessarily unaware that it might be imposing double excess earnings offsets on individuals such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>as petitioner since at that time they could <em>not </em>receive dual benefits.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In my view it is apparent that Congress never considered the situation of individuals receiving benefits under both Acts when it amended the Railroad Retirement Act in 1954 to incorporate the excess earnings provision of the Social Security Act by reference, or when it amended that provision in 1972 to adopt the $l-for-$2 excess earnings formula. When considering substantial revisions to statutes as complex as the Social Security Act, Congress necessarily focuses on major policy questions, not on peripheral issues.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is a well established role of the courts to construe statutes to deal with circumstances never contemplated by the legislature<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The task of construing the excess earnings provisions with respect to the unanticipated situation presented by this case should be guided by the legislative history previously discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>C. <em>Interpretation of the Excess Earnings Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The Board urges this Court to construe the excess earnings provisions to allow it to reduce recipients\u2019 benefits for excess earnings even though the Social Security Administration also reduces their benefits for excess earnings. Against the background of congressional solicitude for working retirees revealed in the legislative history of the excess earnings provisions, I find the Board\u2019s position untenable. The Board\u2019s literal interpretation results in a $1 deduction from benefits for every $1 of excess earnings, <em>the very excess earnings formula which Congress rejected in 1972 </em>as contrary to its goal of encouraging retired persons to work and increasing the benefit to them of doing so. I simply cannot ignore the over-. whelming and uncontradicted evidence of congressional purpose found in the legislative history of the 1972 amendments.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The excess earnings provisions of the Railroad Retirement and Social Security Acts, sharing as they do a common legislative history and purpose, must be read <em>in pari materia </em>to effectuate the congressional purpose to <em>encourage </em>retired persons to work.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Reducing benefits by 100 percent of their excess earnings flies in the face of that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The explicit purpose of Congress in amending the excess earnings provisions was to encourage retirees to work. The 1972 amendment was not an isolated instance of congressional beneficence; rather, Congress had regularly demonstrated interest in liberalizing the excess earnings provisions since 1951.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Congress determined that a $1 reduction in benefits for every $2 in excess earnings would best effectuate its purpose to encourage retired individuals to work. Under these circumstances, I think it reasonable to require the Board and the Administration to coordinate their reduction of benefits for excess earnings so that recipients lose no more than $1 of benefits for every $2 in excess earnings, even if they receive benefits under both Acts.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This construction of the excess earnings provisions will further the congressional purpose by insuring that individuals receiving benefits under both Acts are encouraged to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">This conclusion is supported by a recent decision of the Fifth Circuit addressing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>similar statutory construction problem. <em>Freeman v. Harris, </em>625 F.2d 1303 (5th Cir. 1980). There, plaintiff was entitled to benefits under the Social Security Act, the Black Lung Act, and his state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Both </em>federal programs authorized the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare to reduce benefits if a recipient received state workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Secretary\u2019s policy was to fully deduct the state payments from a recipient\u2019s benefits under both Acts. As a result, plaintiff received less total benefits under the three programs than he would have received had he not applied for state benefits. The Fifth Circuit found the Secretary\u2019s policy contrary to the intent of Congress and ordered the Secretary to limit total deductions to no more than 100 percent of the state payments. <em>Id. </em>at 1305, 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The court interpreted the offset provision to have two purposes \u2014 to avoid over-replacement of workers\u2019 prior income and, more importantly, to ensure that state workers\u2019 compensation programs were the primary providers of benefits. The court noted that in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">this instance, however, both goals cannot be achieved. In essence, then, we are seeking to determine the intent of Congress as applied to a factual situation which obviously it did not foresee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1307. Finding that the Secretary\u2019s construction discouraged reliance on state compensation programs, the primary purpose of the offset provisions, the court held that that policy was contrary to the \u201cself-evident\u201d intent of Congress. <em>Id. </em>at 1306, 1308-09. In my opinion the case for rejecting the Board\u2019s interpretation of the excess earnings provisions is stronger than that which led the Fifth Circuit to reject the Secretary\u2019s policy in <em>Freeman. </em>While the Secretary\u2019s policy promoted at least one goal of Congress \u2014 to avoid over-replacement of workers\u2019 prior income \u2014 the Board has not identified, nor has my investigation revealed, any purpose of Congress advanced by the Board\u2019s literal interpretation of the excess earnings provisions.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">In 1976, the Social Security Administration withheld $744 \u2014 50 percent of petitioner\u2019s 1974 excess earnings \u2014 from her Social Security benefits. In 1978, the Railroad Retirement Board withheld an additional $700 from her Railroad Retirement benefits because of the same excess earnings. It is my conclusion that Congress intended the Board and Administration to coordinate their reductions of benefits for excess earnings so that no individual loses more than $1 in benefits for every $2 in excess earnings. Since the Administration previously reduced petitioner\u2019s Social Security benefits by 50 percent of her 1974 excess earnings, the Board erred in reducing her Railroad Retirement benefits for the same earnings. Accordingly, I would direct the Board to pay petitioner the $700 improperly withheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>from her 1978 benefits. Because the majority concludes that dual beneficiaries are subject to a $1 reduction in benefits for each $1 in excess earnings, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-5\">. Because I find for petitioner on this basis, I do not reach the constitutional and waiver issues. I express no opinion on the majority\u2019s analysis of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Petitioner also seeks to proceed on behalf of a class in this action. On that issue I concur in the separate opinion by Judge Ginsburg.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">. Prior to 1975, payment of Railroad Retirement benefits was governed by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 228a to 228z-l (1970 &amp; Supp. IV 1974). At that time, individuals entitled to benefits under both the Railroad Retirement Act and the Social Security Act could receive more benefits than individuals entitled to benefits under only a single Act. <em>United States R.R.

Consequently, there was no excess earnings provision applicable to survivors at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">In 1946, the Railroad Retirement Act was amended to include survivors\u2019 annuities analogous to those provided under the Social Security Act. Act of July 31, 1946, Pub.L. No. 79-572, \u00a7 213, 60 Stat. 722, 729 (codified as amended as 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228e (1970 &amp; Supp. IV 1974)). At that time an excess earnings provision was added to the Act. It provided for a $1 reduction in benefits for each $1 of earnings over $25 per month. <em>Id </em>at 731. The exempt amount was raised to $50 per month in 1951, Act of Oct. 30, 1951, Pub.L.

Social Security Act Amendments of 1952, Pub.L. No. 82-590, \u00a7 6(d)(2), 66 Stat. 767, 777.

Prior to 1954, the excess earnings provision of the Railroad Retirement Act was regularly amended to reflect concurrent changes in the Social Security Act provision. <em>See, e.g., </em>Social Security Act Amendments of 1952, Pub.L. No. 82-590, \u00a7 6(d)(2), 66 Stat. 767, 777. By incorporating the Social Security Act provision by reference, Congress eliminated the need to amend the Railroad Retirement Act provision to reflect changes in the Social Security Act provision, while at the same time it ensured that the excess earnings provisions of both Acts would be identical. The placing of the incorporation by reference amendment in a section titled \u201cAmendments Preserving Relationship Between Railroad Retirement and Old-Age and Survivors Insurance\u201d reflects this congressional motive.

However, the bill was never considered by the committee to which it was referred and its failure to pass simply cannot be read to reflect congressional acquiescence in the Board\u2019s interpretation of the excess earnings provisions. <em>Cf.

Thus, if the deduction was applied twice to recipients of benefits under both programs, they actually would be penalized for working because they would lose $2 in benefits for each $1 in excess earnings. There is absolutely no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended this absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">At oral argument, counsel for the Board asserted that prior to 1972 the Board and the Administration <em>did </em>enforce double deductions, with the result that persons receiving benefits under both programs lost $2 in benefits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>each $1 in excess earnings. <em>See </em>at 194-195 n. 4.

Dec. 13, 1982), demonstrates that the Board and the Administration ever recovered $2 in benefits for $1 in excess earnings from any beneficiary. I doubt that either agency had many opportunities to do so. Congress found that the prospect of losing $1 in benefits for every $1 of excess earnings discouraged retired persons from working. The likelihood of beneficiaries working would be even less if such persons would lose $2 in benefits for every $1 of excess earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"AzX\">Even if it were the longstanding practice of the agencies to recover double deductions from those receiving benefits under both programs, that circumstance would not control here.

What discussion there was of the 1954 amendment to the excess earnings provision in the congressional hearings on the Social Security Amendments of 1954 focused on the possibility of liberalizing that provision to further encourage retired persons to work. Senator Russell Long presaged the thinking of Congress in adopting the 1972 amendment to the excess earnings provision when he suggested that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKr\">it might be well to maybe deduct $5 every time the man made another $10, so that there would be a savings to the Government and at the same time the man would be encouraged to earn something for himself.... I predict that before we get to having this 27 million people over 65 years of age it is going to occur to somebody that ... we may want to encourage them to work rather than discourage it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-14\"><em>Social Security Amendments of 1954: Hearings on H.R. 9366 Before the Senate Comm, on Finance, </em>83d Cong., 2d Sess. 160-61 (1954) (remarks of Senator Russell Long).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b220-15\">.The Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, \u00a7 5(g)(2), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 228e(g)(2) (Supp. II 1952), <em>repealed by </em>Act .of Aug. 12, 1955, Pub.L.

In 1954, when Congress first incorporated the excess earnings provision of the Social Security Act into the Railroad Retirement Act, individuals entitled to benefits under both programs received no more benefits than their counterparts entitled to benefits under only one of the programs. <em>See </em>note 23 <em>supra. </em>Yet the interpretation of the excess earnings provisions followed by the Board and the Administration, and accepted by the majority, would have imposed double excess earnings offsets on individuals entitled to benefits under both programs without regard to amounts received simply because a portion of their benefits came from the Board and the balance came from the Administration. In my view, such a result is entirely unreasonable, unexplainable even by the congressional purpose suggested by the majority. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Congress intended to amend the excess earnings provisions when it amended the Railroad Retirement Act in 1955 to permit dual beneficiaries, such as petitioner, to receive full benefits under both programs. <em>See </em>S.Rep.
