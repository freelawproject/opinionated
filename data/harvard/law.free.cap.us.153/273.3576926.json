Subsequently, by leave of the court,, an amended bill was filed. In that, plaintiff claimed title to three separate tracts. The allegations as to one were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b293-14\">\u201c2. That on-the 29th day of October, 1889, the following-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>described premises were unoccupied and unappropriated lands of the United States, not mineral, and unsurveyed, to wit: Commencing at a point which is three thousand nine hundred and sixty feet west of the southeast corner of section 34, in township 21 north, of range 3 east, of the Willamette meridian, running thence north thirteen hundred and twenty feet, thence west thirteen hundred and twenty feet, thence south thirteen hundred and twenty feet, thence east thirteen hundred and twenty feet to place of beginning, and containing forty acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">\u201c 3.

The certificates of location under which these tracts were entered, being what is known as \u201c Yalentine scrip,\u201d were issued under the authority of the act of Congress of April 5, 1872, c. 89, 17 Stat. 649, entitled, \u201c An act for the relief of Thomas B.

The facts respecting this grant are thus stated by the Secretary of the Interior in a decision quoted by plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">\u201c On investigation of the facts relative to the Miranda grant, I find that on October 8, 18M, Manuel Micheltorena, Mexican governor of California, granted to Juan Miranda the place known as Kancho Arroyo San Antonio, bounded by the laguna and arroyo of the same name and the pass and estero of Petaluma, containing three square leagues, more or less.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">\u201c California was acquired from Mexico by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, arid by the eighth article of said treaty the United States stipulated to protect the property rights of all residents within the ceded territory, in the same manner that the property rights of its own citizens were protected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">\u201c This treaty did not, <em>proprio vigore, </em>operate as a confirmation of Mexican grants, but, on the contrary, being executory in character, it addressed itself to the political department of the government, and the duty devolved upon Congress of providing means for its enforcement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">\u201cCongress, therefore, by act approved March 3, 1851, established a board of land commissioners, with power to investigate the validity of said grants and titles, with right to appeal to the United States District and Supreme Courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>\u201c The Miranda grant was presented for confirmation to the board of land commissioners by Valentine, and also by the grantees of one Ortega, who was Miranda\u2019s son-in-law. These parties claimed adversely to each other, and Valentine finally withdrew his claim, intending, it is alleged, to intervene in the District Oourt. Before the case was reached for trial in said court the Supreme Oourt had rendered a decision which precluded him from asserting his title by intervention. Ortega\u2019s claim was, therefore, prosecuted by his grantees, until finally rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">\u2022 \u201c After the claim of the grantees of Ortega was rejected the lands were disposed of like other public lands, and the proceeds covered into the treasury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-6\">\u201cSubsequently, Valentine produced satisfactory evidence that the land had been lawfully granted to Miranda by the Mexican authorities and conveyed to him by mesne conveyances, and Congress passed the act granting to Valentine an amount of scrip equal to the amount of land contained in said grant.\u201d 6 Oopp\u2019s Land Owner, 28.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\">To this bill a demurrer was filed, and on October 22, 1890, a decree was entered sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill, from which decree of dismissal plaintiff brought his appeal to this court.

S. 887, and <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U. S. 1, but to endeavor to show that the decisions in those cases are inapplicable to and not controlling in the case involving lands of the character involved in this action, namely, a portion of a tract of overflowed lands, bare at low tide, on the outskirts of a bay on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Puget Sound, including over 3000 acres, and extending for about two and one-half miles in length to three miles in width, as shown by the maps of the official surveys of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, copy of which is found attached in our brief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-4\">This court will take judicial knowledge of the tide flats, otherwise designated as \u201c mud flats,\u201d lying on and adjacent to the bays and inlets of the waters of Puget Sound. <em>Peyroux </em>v. Howard, 7 Pet. 324; <em>The </em>Apollon, 9 Wheat. 362, 374; <em>United States </em>v. Lawton, 5 How. 10, 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-5\">It is respectfully submitted there is nothing whatever in this record from beginning to end to show that the land involved in this action, or any part of it, is what is commonly designated in the laws as \u201cshore\u201d or \u201ctide land\u201d bordering on a- navigable water, but on the contrary, this record fairly construed, even in the absence of any consideration of the public surveys of the United States, shows this tract to be just what it is in fact, a part of an immense area of \u201c overflowed lands,\u201d \u201c mud flats,\u201d or \u201c tide flats \u201d overflowed by high tides and bare at low tides. From the location, in King County, State of Washington, overflowed presumably by the unnavigable waters of some bay or inlet of the waters of Puget Sound. The magnitude of the area included and its shape, being 40 acres and in a solid square, precludes the supposition that it is ordinary \u201cshore\u201d or \u201ctide water lands.\u201d Furthermore, the description in the complaint, it must be borne in mind, is not \u201cthe shore,\u201d or part of \u201cthe shore,\u201d not \u201c tide lands,\u201d but \u201c a portion of the tide flats; \u201d clearly indicating that the land in question is a part of one of the many vast areas located at different points adjacent to the bays and inlets of Puget Sound, and designated on the geodetic surveys of the United States as \u201c mud flats.\u201d In other words, the description contained in the complaint, instead of meaning ordinary shore or tide lands, is equivalent to an averment of \u201c overflowed lands.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-6\">The terms \u201c shore \u201d or \u201c tide lands \u201d are synonymous. They include in their definition the shore lands lying on a navigable river or arm of the sea, covered and uncovered by the tides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and in which there is a <em>jus publicum; </em>while \u201c swamp \u201d or \u201c overflowed lands,\u201d whether made swamp or overflowed by-tide or other waters, <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>San Francisco Savings </em>Union, 136 U. S. 578\u2019, are entirely different. The averment in the complaint that these are \u201c tide flats \u201d is equivalent to an averment that they \u00e1re what are technically known in the law as \u201coverflowed lands,\u201d as contradistinguished from \u201cshore\u201d or \u201ctide lands.\u201d The averments in the complaint, taken altogether, are equivalent in description to the term \u201c overflowed lands \u201d as used in the swamp land acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">This court, in the case of <em>Shively </em>v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, unqualifiedly concedes the power of the Congress of the United States to dispose of what is known as tide lands on the shores of navigable waters in any Territory of the United States, when necessary to do so in order to perform international obligations, or to effect the improvement of such lands for the promotion and convenience of commerce with foreign nations and among the several States, or to carry out other public purposes appropriate to the objects for which the United States hold the Territory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">It is submitted that the grant under which the plaintiff claims in this case is clearly one whioh the Congress of the United States (and it is the sole judge, and its decision is not reviewable by the courts) deemed necessary \u201cin order,\u201d to use the language of Mr. Justice Gray in the opinion in <em>Shively </em>v. Bowlby, \u201c to perform international obligations,\u201d or, more properly speaking, an international obligation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-7\">By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between this country and Mexico, the United States obligated themselves to recognize all valid grants of land within the limits of -the Territory ceded, before that time, made by the governments of Mexico and Spain. <em>Botiller </em>v. Dominguez, 130 U. S. 238.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-8\">Juan Miranda was the holder of a Mexican grant called the Rancho Aroyo de San Antonio, located in the county of Sonoma and State of California, about 13,000 acres, part of which were tide flats and overflowed lands, in all respects similar to the lauds in controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-9\">It is submitted the act of April 5,1872, under which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Valentine scrip was issued, was clearly the performance, upon the part of the Congress, of an <em>\u201c </em>international obligation.\u201d It was a recognition, upon the part of the United States, of the validity of the Miranda grant, and of the rights of Miranda, the grantee thereunder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-4\">Instead, however, of giving Miranda or his grantee, Valentine, the 13,000 acres included in the Mexican grant, part of which were tide flats and overflowed land, an exchange was made, and what was deemed and determined to be, by a judicial court whose decision was affirmed by this court, an equivalent in value of the public lands of the United States was granted. . This, therefore, was not only a grant of public lands in any and all of the Territories of the United States within the power of Congress to grant, but it was clearly the <em>intention </em>of the Congress to include within its provisions every character of public lands, whether upland, tide lands, tide flats, overflowed or swamp land, not otherwise occupied or appropriated and not mineral, included in the Miranda grant. The grant being, moreover, \u2022 not a gift or donation, but an exchange of lands, or a grant, in other words, for a full and adequate consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-5\">In this view, therefore, we confidently insist that the doctrine enunciated by this court in <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>clearly supports the contention of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-6\">This court, in <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>suggests that it has not been the policy of the government to grant lands between high and low water mark to individuals piecemeal, though it is admitted that it has made and confirmed such grants when necessary to carry into effect the obligations which it has assumed by treaty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-7\">If any \u201c policy \u201d has been pursued by the Executive Department of the government on the question of tide lands in the Territory of Washington, that policy, as it appears, was to permit their survey and entry under general land laws whenever of sufficient extent and value to warrant the belief that they could be reclaimed from the sea and cultivated, and when\u00e9ver so situated that their reclamation would not injure the public right of use of waters navigable in fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The only manner from which it can be determined what the policy of a government has been in relation to any subject is to look for either legislative declarations of that policy, or executive acts from winch it could be concluded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-5\">It is notorious that there have been thousands of acres of lands lying below the line of ordinary high tide, and so returned on the government surveys, surveyed and patented under general laws in the Territory of Washington.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-6\">The reason why such lands have been so surveyed and patented is owing to the peculiar condition of things there, in the vast extent of such lands, and, the further fact that the upland is covered with an enormous growth of very heavy timber, making the work of fitting it for cultivation expensive and slow. In such circumstances, the settlers soon found that it was far cheaper to reclaim tide lands from the sea, even by the erection of extremely high and strong dikes, than to attempt to remove the existing timber on the high land, not to mention that the reclaimed tide lands formed of alluvial deposits were infinitely richer than the high land. The earliest and choicest selections of farming land under the general land laws in western Washington, were made of land lying wholly below ordinary high water mark, and to-day it is possible to pass, in an ordinary high water, on a steamer past farms protected by dikes, where the whole cultivated area of the farm lies many feet lower than the surface of the water.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-7\">It is respectfully submitted that Congress, in disposing of the public lands, has not, by any means, acted upon the theory that lands known as ordinary tide lands, between high and low water mark, on navigable waters, in Territories of the United States, were not disposable, and should be held as public highways, unless in case of some international duty or public exigency by the United States in trust for the future States. Upon the contrary, it is respectfully and confidently insisted that the instances in which Congress has acted upon the contr\u00e1ry theory, are so numerous as to constitute the rule and not the exception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b301-8\">But even admitting that it has not been the customary policy of the Executive Department to permit such lands to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>be entered under the general land laws, what is the case at', bar? The plaintiff in error is not claiming land under any general land law, but under a special grant of .Congress. He is not restricted by the act to lands subject to entry under general land laws, but the exceptions are expressly enumerated in his grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-4\">It is to be presumed that Congress knew the law, and knew that it had an unrestricted right to dispose of all the tide lands in the Territory of Washington. The mind of the legislature was upon exceptions when the grant was made, and numerous exceptions were made as to the class of lands which Yalentine was not to be permitted to take by virtue of his grant. But tide lands or lands below high water mark were not enumerated among those exceptions, and by every rule of construction of either grants, laws, or contracts \u2014 and the act of 1872 partakes of the nature of all \u2014 all classes of lands which Congress' had the power to'grant, and which were not excluded in express terms, were among those of which he was authorized to make selection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-5\">We submit, from the foregoing exposition of the law and facts, that these lands are public lands of the United States and subject, to entry under the act of March 5, 1875.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-6\"><em>Mr. Joseph E.

The lands are tide lands, covered atad uncovered by the flow and ebb of the tide, and are situated in Commencement Bay, near to the city of Tacoma. He does not claim by any grant from the State of \"Washington, nor by any act of Congress specifically granting him these lands, or in terms providing for the location of scrip upon tide lands, but insists that; although the statute under which this scrip was issued, only authorized its location upon \u201c unoccupied and unappropriated public lands,he had a right to locate it upon these tide lands, and acquire full title thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">That the title to tide lands is in the State is a proposition which has been again and again affirmed by this court, some of the earlier opinions going so far as to declare that the United States had no power to grant to individuals such lands at any time, even prior to the admission of the State and during the territorial existence. However, in the recent case of <em>Shively </em>v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1, after a careful review of the authorities, it was held that the denial in those opinions of the power of Congress to make such a grant was not strictly correct ; but it was also held that, although Congress could, it had never undertaken by general laws to dispose of such lands, and in the summing up at the close of the opinion it was stated: \u201c The United States, while they hold the country as a Territory, having all the powers both of national and of municipal government, may grant, for appropriate purposes, titles or rights in the soil below high water mark of tide waters. But they have never done so by general laws; and, unless in some case of international duty or public exigency, have acted upon the policy, as most in accordance with the interest of the people and with the object for which the Territories were acquired, of leaving the administration and disposition of the sovereign rights in'navigable waters, and in the soil under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>them, to the control of the States, respectively, when organized and admitted into the Union.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">It is unnecessary, in view of this recent examination of the question, to enter into any discussion respecting the same. It is settled that the general legislation of Congress in respect to public lands does not extend to tide lands. There is nothing in the act authorizing the Yalentine scrip, or in the circumstances which gave occasion for its passage, to make an exception to the general rule. It provided that the scrip might be located on the unoccupied and unappropriated public lands, but the term \u201c public lands \u201d does not include tide lands. As said in <em>Newhall </em>v. Sanger, 92 U. S. 761, 763: \u201cThe words \u2018public lands \u2019 are habitually used in our legislation to describe, such as are subject to sale or other disposal under general laws.\u201d See also <em>Leavenworth </em>&amp;c. <em>Railroad </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 92 U. S. 733; <em>Doolan </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>125 U. S. 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Further, in the act of February 22, 1889, c. 180, providing fof the admission of Washington, Montana, and the two Dakotas, into the Union, 25 Stat. 676, 677, among the conditions imposed was this: \u201c That the people inhabiting said proposed States do agree and declare that they forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands lying within the boundaries thereof.\u201d No one can for a moment suppose that it was the thought of Congress to change the whole policy of the government and reserve to the nation the title and control of the soil beneath the tide waters and those of navigable streams. Indeed, in the constitution of Washr ington, (art. 17, sec. 1,) there is an express assertion of the title of the State to the tide lands within its borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">That there was no intent in the Yalentine scrip act to make any exception to the general rule is evident not merely from the use of a term having such, an accepted meaning, but from the further provision that the land, \u201c if unsurveyed when taken, to conform, when surveyed, to the general system of United States land surveys,\u201d for under that general system surveys are not extended to tide lands, nor those under navigable rivers above tide water.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In <em>Barney </em>v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338, it was said : \u201c The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>United States has wisely abstained from extending (if it could extend) its survey and grants beyond the limits of high water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">But it is claimed that there is a peculiar equity attaching to the Yalentine scrip because the Miranda grant in fact embraced tide lands, and was of great value \u2014 $2,000,000 as stated in the debate in Congress. It is said by counsel that the intention of Congress, as indicated by this act, under the circumstances,, was manifestly to give Yalentine the right of selection of lands of the United States belonging to the same classes as were to be found in the Miranda grant, which he relinquished. The import of the language is precisely this, and the contract to be equal requires the construction which the language plainly means. Any other construction would be against the just intentions of the national legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">So far as respects the great value of the Miranda grant, it was that which was created by the building up of a city within its borders, and not something which inhered in the land itself. So that when Yalentine failed to secure a con-, firmation of that grant, he was not losing property which was of the value of $2,000,000 when granted by the Mexican government, but only losing the opportunity to appropriate $2,000,000 worth of value created by the labors of others upon lands to which they supposed they had title.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Further, as appears from the statement made by the Secretary of the Interior, he had lost all legal right to this land, for when a commission had been provided for investigating the validity of such claims, he presented his claim for confirmation and then withdrew it. Congress had fulfilled all obligations to him growing out of the treaty with Mexico, and when by his own act he had forfeited his legal claims to the land, it was a mere act of grace by which was given to him the right to select an equal amount of land elsewhere. If Congress had thought that it was necessary in order to do justice that he should be permitted to select an equal quantity of land of like character, it was easy to have expressed that intention. Having failed to do so, and omitted any reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u25a0to tide lands, its donation to him is to be construed as any \u25a0other grant of the government, and no unexpressed and unsuggested intention should be attributed to Congress \u2014 certainly no intention to make the people of the State of Washington, who otherwise would receive these tide lands for their general benefit, suffer by reason of his neglect to properly .assert his claim to lands in the State of California. There is, therefore, nothing in this matter of the Yalentine scrip to take the case out of the rule laid down in <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Reliance is also placed on article 17, section 2, of the constitution of the State of Washington, which reads: \u201cThe State of Washington disclaims all title in and claim to all tide, swamp, and overflowed lands patented by the United .States; provided, the same is not impeached for fraud.\u201d In respect to this it is enough to say that these lands were not patented. It is doubtless true, as said by this court in <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Starrs, </em>6 Wall. 402, 418, that \u201c the right to a patent once vested is treated by the government when dealing with the public lands, as equivalent to a patent issued.\u201d But here there was no right to a patent. The entry in the local land \u25a0office, and the receipt issued by the local land officers, were unauthorized acts, and gave no right to a patent; and it cannot be supposed that the State of Washington, when it ex- \u25a0 eluded from its claim of title lands which the government had in the due administration of its land department disposed of by a patent, meant thereby to exclude every tract for which a local land officer might wrongfully issue a receiver\u2019s receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">These are all the matters involved in this case. We see no error in the ruling of the Circuit Court, and its decree is</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
