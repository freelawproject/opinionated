S. 391, was before this court at October term, 1892, and the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court not appearing upon the face of the record, it was remanded with leave to amend. The appellant accordingly, on June 6, 1893, filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of North Dakota its amended bill of complaint, in which, after setting forth its creation and organization under and by virtue of an act of Congress approved July 2, 1864, c. 217, 13 Stat. 365, entitled, \u201c An act granting lands to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from Lake Superior to Puget\u2019s Sound on the Pacific Coast by the northern route,\u201d and certain acts and joint resolutions of Congress supplementary thereto and amendatory thereof, it was alleged that for the purposes of haying out, locating, constructing, furnishing, and maintaining a railroad and the telegraph line between the points indicated there was granted to it by Congress every alternate section of public land, not mineral, designated by odd numbers, to the amount of twenty alternate sections per mile on each side of the railroad line as the company \u2022might adopt, through the Territories of the United States, and ten alternate sections of land per mile on each side of the railroad line whenever it passed through any State, to which the United States had full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, free from preemption or all other claims at the time the line of the railroad should be definitely fixed, and the plat thereof be filed with the Commissioner of the General Land Office; that the railroad company duly accepted the terms, conditions, and impositions of said act of Congress, and that on the respective dates of May 26, 1873, and July 20, 1880, it definitely fixed the line of its railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>through certain counties in the Territory of Dakota, (now the State of North Dakota,) and filed plats thereof in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office; that the line of railroad so fixed extends opposite to and past the lands set forth and described in the schedules made a part of the bill; that prior to December 20, 1880, it had completed that portion of the railroad and telegraph line extending on, over, and along the line of definite location of the railroad, and that the President of the United States, from time to time, after the same had been examined by commissioners, had accepted the railroad and telegraph line as having been constructed and completed in all respects as required by the act of July 2, 1864, and the acts and joint resolutions supplementary and amendatory thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">The bill further alleged that the lands on each side of the railroad, and every portion thereof, were within forty miles of the company\u2019s line of road so definitely fixed; that they were public lands to which the United States had full title, not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, and no entry or application to make entry for the lands was made or was pending when the lists of definite location were filed in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office on May 26,1873, and July 20,1880; that the described lands had been surveyed by United States surveyors, and had been reported to be agricultural in their character and non-mineral; and that the lands were not, on July 2, 1864, or May 26, 1873, and July 20,1880, known as mineral lands, etc.; that the company had prior to the year 1889, in accordance with the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, duly prepared and filed lists in the United States land offices in the land districts in which the lands were situated respectively, describing the lands and claiming them as a portion enuring to it under and by virtue of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1864,- which lists were duly allowed and approved by the United States district land officers, to.whom the fees prescribed by law were paid by the company, and which were retained by the United States; that the lists of lands so filed were duly transmitted by the district land officers to the Commissioner of the General Land Office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>for his approval; that since the lists were filed and transmitted to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, the Commissioner, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, had required the company to' file in the office of the Commisr sioner, or in the office of the land office districts in which the lands were respectively situated, an affidavit made by some person acquainted with the character of the lands, setting forth and showing that the same were non-mineral, and that until such affidavits had been filed the Commissioner refused to approve the lists; that the company had not, nor had any one in its behalf, filed affidavits of persons having knowledge of the mineral or non-mineral character of the lands set out in the lists.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">The bill then proceeds to state that none of the lands described had ever been Certified or patented to the railroad company, and that neither the United States, nor any of its officers or agents, .had ever ascertained and determined what specific lands in the State of North Dakota passed to the railroad company by virtue of the act of July 2, 1864:, although the railroad company had repeatedly petitioned to have this done; that the United States and its officers had refused to certify to the company the lands described in the schedules of the bill, but held the lists suspended and unapproved upon the claim that the lands may be mineral in character, and as such excepted from the grant to the company, or that the lands may not have been free from claims or rights reserved in the grant, or that the question as to whether title to the lands had passed to the railroad company under and by virtue of the granting act, and acts amendatory thereof; that said matters were still in controversy, and pending before the commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">It is further alleged that the railroad company had no other right, title, claim, interest, property, or possession in or to any of the lands or premises described in the bill except such right, title, claim, interest, property, or possession as it may have obtained under and by virtue of the acts- and resolutions of Congress, and its compliance with the conditions thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">It is then averred that on March 7, 1889, the legislature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the Territory of Dakota passed an act, which was duly approved by the governor of the Territory, entitled \u201cAn act providing for the levy and collection of taxes upon the property of railroad companies in this Territory,\u201d in and by which it was, among other things, enacted and provided: \u201cIn lieu of any and all other taxes upon any railroads, except railroads operated by horse power, within this Territory, or upon the equipment, appurtenances, or appendages thereof, or upon any other property situated within this Territory belonging to the corporation owning or operating such railroads, upon the capital stock, or business transactions of said railroad company, there shall hereafter be paid into the treasury of this Territory an amount equal to a percentage of all the gross earnings of the corporation owning or operating such railroad arising from the operation of such railroad as shall be situated within this Territory, both upon territorial and interstate traffic, in case the railroad company owning or operating such line shall accept and become subject to this act as hereinafter provided,\u201d Laws of Dakota, 1889, c: 107, p. 134; that the railroad company did, within thirty days after the passage of this act, by resolution of its board of directors, attested by its secretary, filed with the secretary of the Territory of Dakota, accept and become subject to the provisions of the act of March 7, 1889; that within thirty days of its passage the railroad company, as required by the act, prepared and filed with the treasurer of the Territory, in the manner required by the provisions of chapter 99 of the Session Laws of the Territory for the year 1883, an account of the gross earnings of the company, both territorial and interstate, for the years 1886 and 1887, and paid into the treasury the entire amount of taxes claimed by the Territory on local and interstate earnings remaining unpaid at the time of filing such account for said years, such payment being as follows, to wit: For the last half of the year 1886, $38,095.31; for the year 1887, $65,585.46. Such sums so paid, as provided for in the territorial act of March 7, 1889, were percentages computed entirely upon gross earnings of the company derived from domestic business, the percentage for the same years computed upon the gross earnings derived from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>interstate business having been previously paid by the company as required by the provisions of the territorial act of 1883.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">It was also alleged that, at the same time, the company paid into the treasury of the Territory one-half of the entire amount due for the year 1888, amounting to $46,937.09, and that before August 15, 1889, it had paid the remainder of the amount due for the year 1888; that the sums so paid into the treasury for the year 1888 were percentages computed upon the gross earnings of the company for that year, derived from both domestic and interstate business, the former amounting to $11,446.78 and the latter to $82,427.40, and it was alleged that all the percentages derived from interstate business so paid into the treasury were not due from the company, except by virtue of the act of March 7, 1889, and the company\u2019s acceptance thereof, and that they were paid as a consideration for the exemption from taxation provided for by that act, and for no other reason.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">It is then charged that, notwithstanding the premises, in the year 1889 the county auditors for the counties of Kidder, Stutsman, Kichland, and McLean, under the authority of the laws of the Territory of Dakota, had assessed the company\u2019s lands situate in their respective counties for purposes of county taxation, and that they had advertised the lands as described in the schedules to the bill, for sale, and were about to wrongfully sell the same for the non-payment of taxes so levied, together with penalties and costs, and to issue certificates of sale for the same in the form prescribed by the laws of North Dakota, and unless restrained by the order of the court they would sell the lands, and issue certificates of sale thereafter, whereby the rights of the railroad company in and to the lands would be irreparably injured, and lead to a multiplicity of suits concerning the title thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\">It was further claimed on the part of the railroad company that the taxes' so assessed and levied upon the lands were a cloud upon the title of the railroad company thereto; that if sold and certificates were issued to the purchaser, such certificates would constitute a cloud upon the title of the company in and to the lands so sold; that the counties were bankrupt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>and that if the railroad company should pay the taxes and then bring an action against them to recover the amount thereof, it would require a multiplicity of suits, and such judgments as might be recovered would be worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-4\">The bill further averred that the amount of the taxes levied upon the lands, together with the costs and penalties claimed by the county auditors to have accrued thereon, and for which the lands had been advertised for sale, and were about to be sold, w.ere as follows: Upon the lands in Kidder County, $12,820.67; upon the lands in Stutsman County, $8863.39; upon the lands in Richland County, $4094.37; and upon the lands in .McLean County, $4048.17 \u2014 the amount of such tax, penalty, and cost upon each tract of land being particularly shown in the 'schedules attached to the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\">The prayer of the bill was to the effect that the county assessments and taxes so levied upon the lands of the railroad company might be' declared illegal and void, and a cloud upon the title of the company, and thaf the defendants, and each of them, their deputies and successors in office, be restrained from selling or attempting to sell the lands or any portion thereof, or from issuing tax certificates therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-6\">The defendants appeared and demurred to the amended bill on the ground that, according to the showing made therein, the plaintiff was not entitled to the relief sought. The Circuit Court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the bill on the ground that the act of 1889 was void, because it violated the organic act, which provided that the legislative assembly of the Territory shall not make any discrimination in taxing different kinds of property, but all property subject to taxation shall be taxed in proportion to its value; secondly, that the bill was without equity in failing to allege payment or tender of the gross earnings tax for the year 1889. 47 Red. Rep. 681.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-7\">Rro.m this judgment the railroad company appealed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and that court, desiring instructions upon certain questions presented by the assignments of error filed in the cause, certified to this court various propositions of law, as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>whether the railroad company acquired such title to the odd-numbered sections of land within the place limits of the grant of July 2, 1864, which were not mineral, and which, at the dates of the grant and of the filing of the map, of definite location in the office of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, were not reserved, sold, granted, or otherwise appropriated, as to render them' taxable before being patented and certified to the railroad company; whether the company was taxable on such lands by the Territories after the filing of the map of definite location of its railroad, and full compliance with the terms and conditions of the granting act, while the United States refused to patent and certify such lands to the company ; whether chapter 107 of the Laws of Dakota for 1889, being an act entitled \u201c An act providing for the levying and collection of taxes upon the properties of railroad companies in this Territory,\u201d approved March 7, 1889, was void as a regulation of interstate commerce; whether the act of March 7, 1889, was in conflict with the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and with the organic law of the Territory, as an attempt to exempt from taxation the lands granted by the act of July 2, 1864; whether the act of March 7, 1889, should be construed as granting ail exemption for the year 1889, or to be in force and effect only after the year 1890. The eighth and remaining question certified is as follows: \u201cIs said bill without equity because of the failure to aver that the. complainant has tendered or paid the \u2018gross earnings tax\u2019 for the year 1889; and is said complainant entitled to the equitable relief prayed without first tendering or paying such tax ? \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-4\"><em>Mr. F. M. </em>Dudley, for appellant, with regard to this eighth question said:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">Is said bill without equity because of the failure to aver that the complainant has tendered or paid the \u201cgross earnings tax\u201d for the year 1889; and is said complainant entitled to the equitable relief prayed without first tendering or paying such tax <em>%</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>I. In the discussion of the propositions arising under this question, the constitutionality of the \u201cgross earnings law\u201d is, necessarily, conceded, b.ut while admitting the constitutionality of the exemption, appellees deny the right of the company to claim the benefit thereof until the gross earnings percentage money is paid. It is an attempt to apply the familiar rule that he who seeks equity must do equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">The limitation of the rule is that the amount to be paid as a condition precedent to invoking the aid of a court of equity is the amount conceded to be due, or what can be seen to be due on the face of the bill, or be shown by affidavits, whether conceded or not. The State is not to be tied up as to that of which there is no contest, by lumping it with that which is really contested. <em>State Railroad Tax Cases, </em>92 U. S. 575, 617.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">II. The exemption from assessment and levy of taxes in the ordinary manner, made by the \u201c gross earnings law,\u201d did not depend upon the payment of the three per centum of the gross earnings in the first instance, but upon the filing with the secretary of the Territory of a resolution adopted by the railroad company and attested by its secretary, accepting the provisions of the act and subjecting the corporation to its terms. Immediately upon such action being taken by a railroad company which had qualified itself to accept the act by filing an account of the earnings under the act of 1883, and paying all percentages then due upon both interstate and territorial earnings as claimed by the Territory' the exemption became effective. The liability of the railroad company to pay the percentage upon its gross earnings, by virtue of its. acceptance of the act, rather than the actual payment, was the consideration upon which the exemption became effective.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-7\">By the \u201c gross earnings act \u201d the Territory was given a lien upon the railroad of the company, and upon all property, estate, or effects' of the company, real or mixed, to secure the payment of the per centum, and such lien took precedence of all demands, decrees, and judgments against said company. By the fourth section of the act, the territorial treasurer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>authorized to distrain and sell sufficient property to pay the amount due from the corporation in case of its failure to pay such amount when due, or within thirty days thereafter. This remedy, given in the \u201c gross earnings act \u201d itself, was an exclusive remedy. And since the exemption by the \u201c gross earnings act\u201d is necessarily perfect upon the acceptance of the act, and nearly a year prior to the time when .the first payment of the per centum is required, and is founded, not upon the actual payment, but upon the liability to pay, it is evident that the failure to make such payment cannot be a more material factor in considering appellant\u2019s equitable right to an injunc-. tion restraining the sale than it would where the ground of exemption is the interest of the government in the lands. The material question is the exemption. If that exist the ground upon which it is founded, so long as it is not the actual payment of the per centum, is immaterial. Conceding the exemption, the right to the equitable relief cannot be questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-4\">Since the failure to pay the \u201c gross earnings \u201d per centum would not give the counties the right to tax these lands as other lands are taxed, it is not essential to negative such failure in the bill of complaint; and no inference can be drawn from the absence of an averment, that no such payment has been made; and that portion of the opinion of the Circuit Court, holding that there is no equity in complainant\u2019s bill, is founded upon an assumed fact that is not' in the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">III. There was, and is, no \u201cgross earnings\u201d percentage due, and there is no one authorized to receive such money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">Long prior to the time any payments became due under the act for the year 1889, it was repealed. No part of the \u201c gross earnings\u201d percentage for 1889 became payable until 1890, as \u25a0prior to that time no report of the gross earnings of the company for that year could be made. Prior to that time, and on October 1, 1889, the constitution of the State of North Dakota was adopted. Under this constitution, November 2, 1889, North Dakota was declared admitted to the Union by proclamation of the President. 26 Stat. 1518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-7\">It is apparent from the provisions of this constitution which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>are printed in the margin <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the power to pass a gross earnings law exempting the lands granted to the company was withheld from the legislature. The gross earnings law of 1889 was therefore repealed by the adoption of the constitution, as repugnant to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">The law is well settled that when a statute is repealed it must be considered (except as to transactions passed and closed) as if it had never existed. The authority of an officer to act thereunder terminates with the. repeal, unless the right so to act is especially saved in the repealing act. Where a statute requires a certain tax to be collected and the act is repealed before the collection is made, or the tax due, the right to make such collection is gone. <em>Bleidorn </em>v. <em>Abel, </em>6 Iowa, 5; <em>Van Inwagen </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>61 Illinois, 31; <em>The Marion Township Road Co. </em>v. <em>Sleeth, 53 </em>Indiana, 35; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>101 Penn.

A valuable consideration for the exemption from taxation was, in fact, given by the railroad company and accepted and retained by the State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">The gross earnings law of 1889 is an oifer on the part of the Territory to make a contract with any railroad company by the terms of which the company obligates itself to pay to the Territory a certain percentage of the company\u2019s gross earnings, and the Territory, in consideration of such obligation, agrees to exempt from any and all other taxation the property of the company. The tax law of 1883, which was in force prior to that, was accepted by the Northern Pacific Company, and taxes were paid in accordance with it up to 1887. By the second section of the act of Congress of July 2, 1864, incorporating complainant, it is provided that <em>\u201c </em>the right of way shall be exempt from taxation within the Territories of the United States.\u201d This exemption from taxation includes all buildings,\u2019 superstructures, etc., that were attached to the soil of such right of way. <em>Northern Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Carland, </em>5 Montana, 146. Under the. provisions of the act of Congress approved July 15, 1870, 16 Stat. 291, the lands granted to the Northern Pacific Railroad Company could not be taxed until the company had* paid <em>\u201c </em>into the treasury of the United States the cost of surveying, selecting and conveying\u201d the lands granted to the company. The railroad company did not, prior to 1887, pay such fees upon lands owned by it, and hence its lands were not taxable. <em>Northern Pacific Railroad </em>v. <em>Traill County, </em>115 U. S. 600. In 1887 its lands became taxable, under the operation of the act of July 10, 1886, c. 764, 24 Stat. 143.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-6\"><em>Mr. Edgar W: Camp, </em>(with whom was <em>Mr. 8.

The payment of this percentage was to be made at designated dates in each year, and penalties were imposed upon the companies failing to comply with the provisions of the law as to the making of returns of earnings and paying the percentages imposed by the act. The moneys so received and collected were to be apportioned between the Territory and the several counties through which the railroads respectively ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">This act of 1883 left the railroad companies no choice as to whether they would pay the designated percentage on their gross earnings, or remain subject to taxation upon their property in the ordinary method. It was compulsory upon them. It is not material to the present case to consider whether this act was constitutional or not; it was repealed by the act of the legislature approved January 29, 1889. Now, it is shown by the bill that at the time the act of 1883 was repealed the appellant was in default of the payment of the percentages due upon its gross earnings for the years 1886, 1887, and 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">On March 7, 1889, the legislature of the Territory of Dakota passed the act, entitled \u201c An act providing for the levy and collection of taxes upon property of railroad companies in this Territory,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which went into force and effect immediately after its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>This act is by its terms nothing but a tax law, and while it adopted the same rule of percentages on the gross earnings as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>is provided in the act of 1883, it differed from that act in not being compulsory upon the railroad companies, for it left to</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>them the election as to which of two modes of taxation they should accept or submit to.- It practically gave to the rail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>road companies the choice of having their property taxed as other property in the Territory, by assessment and levy, or of taking the benefits of the act upon the terms and conditions provided therein. It was, by section 7, made a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the acceptance of the act that <em>\u201c </em>any railroad company assessed under chapter 99 of the Laws of 1883 shall, within thirty days after the passage of this act, pay into the territorial treasury the full amount of the taxes and interest due under the assessments under said laws of 1883, including taxes on both territorial and interstate earnings,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>before the} can avail themselves of the provisions of this act.\u201d It was further provided that any company failing to strictly comply with the provisions of the act within the time provided should be immediately subject to assessment and taxation upon its property in the same manner as the property of individuals was assessed and taxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">The companies accepting the benefits of the act were not only to pay arrearages under the law of 1883, but were also to pay a percentage of gross earnings for the current year of 1889, it being provided that <em>\u201c </em>if such acceptance was filed on or before the 15th day of February in any year such companies should pay one-half of said amount on said 15th day of February and the balance on the 15th day of August next following. Should acceptance be filed before the 15th day of August and after the 15tb day of February in any year, then an amount equal to three per centum of such account shall be paid in full on or before the 15th day of August in each year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">It is shown by the bill that the appellant accepted the provisions and benefits of the act within thirty days after March 7, 1889, and it thereby became liable to pay the required percentage on its gross earnings on or before the 15th day of August, 1889. It is also shown by the bill that within, thirty days after the passage of the act it paid the arrearages of percentages on its gross earnings accruing under the act of 1883, for the years 1886, 1887, and 1888; but it is not alleged that it made payment, or tender of payment, of the percentage on its gross earnings for the year 1889, or any portion thereof, although by the express provisions of the act a percentage on a portion of such gross earnings was due and payable on the 15th day of August, 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The moneys to be received and collected by the territorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u25a0treasurer under this act from the railroad companies which .accepted its provisions were to be apportioned between the Territory and the several counties, respectively, through which the railroads run, or in which the companies had lands subject to taxation, in the manner pointed out in section 6 of the act. The several counties, whose auditors are made defendants in the present case, were therefore interested in the gross earnings tax, which, the appellant was required to pay for the year 1889 in lieu of all other ordinary taxes upon its'property.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The gross earnings act remained in force until November \u25a02, 1889, when it was repealed by the repugnant provisions \u00a1contained in the constitution of the State of North Dakota, .as adopted and approved by Congress, and the claim is now made by the appellant that this repeal relieves it from liability to pay any percentage on its gross earnings for the year 1889, or any part thereof, because the same was not payable \u2022until after 1890; and that it was not liable to assessment and taxation on its property because it had accepted the provisions \u2022of the gross earnings act of 1889.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">This contention, if correct, would relieve the appellant from .any burden in the way of taxation for the year 1889, but such .a claim as this cannot possibly be sustained. The act of March 7, 1889, clearly intended that the gross earnings tax, therein provided for, as to all companies which would accept its provisions, should supply revenue for the Territory and \u00a1the counties for the year 1889. It is equally clear from the whole act, as a tax law, that the railroad company had to pay the required percentage on its gross earnings for that year, and that such percentage was payable in part on the 15th \u2022day of August in that year. It is not therefore correct to jsay that no part of the gross earnings were payable until 1890; but, if that were not the case, having' accepted the \u25a0provisions of that act and thus becoming liable to pay the designated percentage of its gross earnings in lieu of taxes for the \u25a0year 1889, that liability would not be discharged by the subsequent repeal of the gross earnings act of 1889. If the company was released from the gross earnings tax by the repeal of the act its property immediately became subject to assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and taxation in the manner provided for the assessment and taxation of property of individuals in the Territory, and it would not vitiate any such assessment made on the part of the counties that happened to be made prior t.o the repeal of the act of 1889. Such assessment would remain in full force and effect after the repeal of the act, and until satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">It is next contended by the appellant that its payment of arrearages, claimed to be due under the act of 1883, was a consideration for the exemption of its property from taxation for the year 1889. This position cannot be sustained, for, by the terms of the act of 1889, the payment of those arrearages was simply a condition upon which the railroad company was allowed to accept the benefits of that act, which was not an act exempting the property of the railroad company from taxation, but merely substituted one mode of taxation for another upon the terms and conditions specified. One of the terms on which the railroad was allowed to accept the gross earnings tax, in lieu of the ordinary tax upon its property, was that it should pay the arrearages which the Territory \u2022claimed under the act of 1883. No exemption from taxation for the year 1889 was contemplated. The railroads accepting the act were required to pay the gross earnings tax for that year in addition to such arrearages. It cannot, therefore, be properly claimed that the payment of these arrearages constituted a consideration for any exemption from taxation, or that such payment raised any equity on the part of the appellant against the payment of taxes for 1889, whether such taxes were imposed in the shape of a percentage on the ..gross earnings for that year, or in the shape of the ordinary .assessment upon its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">There is nothing in the allegations of the bill showing affirmatively that the company did not possess the equitable title or ownership in the lands described and assessed. Nor do the averments of the bill negative the fact that the appellant was properly chargeable with taxes on the lands coming within the grant of July 2, 1864, and within the limits of the line of definite location of its road. Payment of the gross \u2022earnings tax, imposed by the act of 1889, would have dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>charged all claims for taxes upon the company\u2019s lands for that year, but no ground is shown by the bill for releasing the appellant from the payment of either the percentage tax on its gross earnings, or from the payment of the assessments upon its lands made by the county auditors. By section 7 of the act of 1889, its failure to promptly and strictly comply with the provisions thereof, and pay all sums therein provided to be paid, subjected the company to assessment and taxation in the same manner as individuals. It did not comply with the provisions of the act in paying the percentage of gross earnings due on the 15th day of August, 1889, and thereupon its property became liable to assessment and taxation as the property of individuals in the several counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Being liable to pay either the percentage on gross earnings in accordance with the provisions of the act of 1889, or the tax upon its lands, as other property of like character was assessed, the appellant was not entitled to any relief in a court of equity by injunction without payment or tender of what was due under one or the other of these modes of taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In <em>State Railroad Tax Cases, </em>92 U. S. 575, 616, 617, the rule is established that before an injunction will be granted in such cases as the present, a party must pay or tender what can be seen to be due on the face of the bill, and, speaking for the court in that case, Mr. Justice Miller said that the duty of making such a tender or payment before any injunction will be allowed is laid down \u201c as a rule to govern the courts of the United States in their action in such cases.\u201d This rule was repeated in <em>National Bank </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>103 U. S. 732, 733, where it was treated as a fatal objection to the bill that there was no offer to pay any sum as a tax which the party ought to pay, and, again speaking for this court, Mr. Justice Miller there said: \u201c\u00a5e have announced more than once that it is the established rule of this court that no one can be permitted to go into a court of equity to enjoin the collection of a tax, until he has shown himself .entitled to the aid of the court by paying so much of the tax assessed against him as it can be plainly seen he ought to pay,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Applying this rule to the present case, it is clear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>appellant\u2019s bill was properly dismissed for failing to pay, or tender to pay, taxes which he ought to have paid on its property, or, in lieu thereof, a percentage of its gross earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Our response, therefore, to the eighth question certified is, that the bill was without equity, because of the failure to aver that the plaintiff had tendered or paid the gross earnings percentage for the year 1889, (or the tax assessed by the county auditors,) and was' not entitled to the equitable relief prayed without first tendering or paying such taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>The answer of\" the court to that question will accordmgl/y he certified to the Circuit Cowrt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-7\">Mb.
