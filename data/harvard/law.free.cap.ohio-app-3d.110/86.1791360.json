Bryant, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Sheila Frank appeals from the judgment of the Allen County Court of Common Pleas affirming the decision and order by the Allen County Department of Human Services, Hearing Authority, to disqualify Frank from participation in the food stamp program for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Appellant, Sheila Frank, was the head of a food stamp assistance group consisting of appellant, her husband, daughter and stepson. On January 8, 1993, appellant met with representatives of the Allen County Department of Human Services (\u201cagency\u201d) as part of the benefit application process. At this meeting, the agency explained appellant\u2019s reporting obligations in a video presentation and a personal interview with appellant\u2019s caseworker. Among these obligations was the duty to report, within ten days, income from any source. In her application for assistance, appellant stated that her husband, Carl, was an unemployed member of the assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">On February 14, 1994, appellant reapplied to the food stamp program. The application contained the question, \u201cIs anyone in your household employed?\u201d Frank answered, \u201cNo.\u201d Appellant was again informed of her reporting obligations and the penalty for failing to report family income.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>On February 11, 1994, the agency received information that appellant\u2019s husband was employed by The Lima News and by Richard Hill, appellant\u2019s landlord. The Lima News reported that Mr. Frank began employment in October 1993 and earned $480 per month. Richard Hill attested that he paid Mr. Frank gross earnings for the month of January 1994 in the amount of $142.50. The agency determined that Ms. Frank\u2019s failure to report her husband\u2019s employment resulted in an overissuance in the amount of $190.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">On January 13, 1995, the agency notified appellant that an administrative disqualification hearing was scheduled for February 2, 1995 to consider the allegation that appellant committed an intentional program violation by failing to report her husband\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">On March 13,1995, the hearing officer recommended that appellant be found to have committed an intentional program violation due to her failure to report her husband\u2019s employment. Further, the hearing officer recommended that appellant be disqualified from participation in the food stamp program for a period of six months. The hearing authority accepted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation and issued a final administrative decision and order disqualifying appellant. On October 4, 1995, the Allen County Court of Common Pleas affirmed the agency\u2019s decision. It is from this judgment that Sheila Frank appeals, citing two assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">In her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the court erred when it ruled that the agency need not show her state of mind to prove an intentional program violation. The standards for determining whether an individual has committed an intentional program violation are provided by Section 273.16(c), Title 7, C.F.R.:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">\u201c[I]ntentional Program violations shall consist of having intentionally: (1) Made a false or misleading statement, or misrepresented, concealed or withheld facts, or (2) committed any act that constitutes a violation of the Food Stamp Act, the Food Stamp Program Regulations, or any State statute relating to the use, presentation, transfer, acquisition, receipt or possession of food stamp coupons or ATP\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Appellant argues that according to <em>Smith v. Dept. of Health &amp; Rehab. Serv. </em>(Fla.1988), 522 So.2d 956, documentary evidence alone is insufficient to establish intent. While we disagree with appellant\u2019s interpretation of <em>Smith, </em>we note that the case not only lacks persuasive authority in this jurisdiction but can be factually distinguished from the case sub judice. <em>Smith </em>is distinguishable since the Ohio Department of Human Services presented more than documentary evidence to support its claims against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>Review of the record indicates that the evidence supporting the hearing officer\u2019s finding was clear and convincing. Not only did Mr. Lamb, the agency\u2019s representative, testify regarding the application process and the rights and responsibilities explained to aid recipients, appellant testified that these rights and responsibilities were explained to her and that she was aware of the duty to report family income. Further, she admitted, she knew that since she signed the rights and responsibilities form, she was obligated to notify the agency of her husband\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The documentary evidence and appellant\u2019s own testimony prove that appellant understood her obligation to report her husband\u2019s income, yet she failed to fulfill this obligation. We find this evidence is sufficient to prove that appellant intentionally \u201cmade a false or misleading statement, or misrepresented, concealed or withheld facts\u201d from the Ohio Department of Human Services. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that the lower court did not consider the certain portions of the administrative record when it affirmed the agency\u2019s order. R.C. 119.12 requires the common pleas court to review the entire administrative record before reaching a decision. After a review of the record, we find no evidence that the common pleas court did not fulfill this requirement. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Having overruled appellant\u2019s two assignments of error, we affirm the decision of the Allen County Court of Common Pleas affirming the agency\u2019s order disqualifying appellant from the food stamp program for a period of six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-9\">Hadley, P.J., and Evans, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
