Appellant, James E. Pulfer, is appealing the trial court\u2019s finding that it was in the best interest of the minor child, Donna Pulfer, Jr., to permit appellee Donna J. Pulfer to move from Delphos to Lima, Ohio. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The facts of this case are as follows. Appellee and appellant are the parents of the minor child. Following their divorce, the Pulfers entered into a shared parenting agreement concerning the child, on November 3, 1994. The agreement provided that their daughter would reside with her mother. Further, the agreement also provided that neither party \u201cshall move more than five miles outside the city of Delphos or outside the state of Ohio without the prior written approval of the Allen County Court of Common Pleas or approval pursuant to arbitration.\u201d The shared parenting agreement also provided for arbitration as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u201c[Bjefore resorting to any court action to resolve disputes as to their respective rights and responsibilities under this agreement, [the parties] shall seek arbitration pursuant to O.R.C. [Chapter] 2711 in an effort to resolve any disputes that they are unable to resolve between themselves without the aid of a third party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">On January 11, 1995, appellee filed a notice of intent to relocate with the Allen County Court of Common Pleas. On January 18, 1995, appellee moved from Delphos to Lima with the child. On that same date, appellant filed objections to appellee\u2019s intention to relocate. Subsequently, the matter was set for a hearing before a referee. At the hearing, appellant requested that the matter be referred to arbitration pursuant to the terms of the shared parenting agreement. The referee refused and evidence was taken as to whether appellee\u2019s move was in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>On April 14,1995, the referee issued a report and recommendation finding that appellee\u2019s relocation from Delphos to Lima was in the best interest of her daughter. On May 1, 1995, appellant filed objections to the referee\u2019s report, on the ground that the matter should have been referred to arbitration. On June 30, 1995, the trial court held that appellant\u2019s objections to the referee\u2019s report were untimely filed, and therefore, would not be considered. The trial court also issued an order adopting the referee\u2019s report and recommendations finding that appellee\u2019s move was in the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">It is from this judgment that appellant raises the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u201cAssignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u201cThe court erred in denying the defendant the opportunity to have his Objections to the Report of the Referee determined on the merits. Further, the court abused its discretion in not granting the defendant\u2019s Motion to Vacate or issue Alternative Order based on all the surrounding facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s numerous motions for stays and in not referring the issues before the court to an arbitrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">As his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that, because his objections were filed seventeen days after the referee\u2019s report was filed, they were untimely. Former Civ.R. 53(E)(2)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provided that a party may file objections to a referee\u2019s report \u201cwithin fourteen days of the filing of the report.\u201d However, appellant argues that Civ.R. 6(E) automatically added three days to the fourteen-day response time.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Civ.R. 6(E), known as the \u201cthree-day mail rule,\u201d provides for an additional three days response time as follows: \u201cWhenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, three days shall be added to the prescribed period.\u201d However, we do not find that the three-day mail rule extends the time within which a party may file objections to a referee\u2019s report. Civ.R. 53(E)(2) gives the party the right to object to a referee\u2019s report \u201cwithin fourteen days of the <em>filing </em>of the report.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because Civ.R. 53(E)(2) provides for the fourteen days to begin to run on the date the report is filed, we find that Civ.R. 6(E) is not applicable. <em>Hucke v. Hucke </em>(Aug. 31, 1990), Montgomery App. No. 11882, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>unreported, 1990 WL 125700. Therefore, appellant\u2019s objections to the referee\u2019s report were untimely filed pursuant to former Civ.R. 53(E)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Appellee argues that because appellant\u2019s objections were untimely, he is prevented from assigning them as error on appeal. However, untimely filed objections do not prevent this court from reviewing a trial court\u2019s adoption of a referee\u2019s conclusions of law under former<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Civ.R. 53. On appeal, former Civ.R. 53(E)(6) does not require written objections in order for an appellate court to review issues of law decided by a referee. Former Civ.R. 53(E)(6) only prohibits an assignment of error as to a \u201ctrial court\u2019s adoption of a referee\u2019s <em>finding of fact </em>unless an objection to that finding is contained in that party\u2019s written objections to the referee\u2019s report.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellant argues that the hearing before the referee was improper on the ground that the matter should have been referred to arbitration. This objection raises a question of law and shall be considered by this court. Accordingly, the first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">As the second assignment of error, appellant argues that, pursuant to the terms of a shared parenting agreement, the issue of appellee\u2019s relocation should have been submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The shared parenting agreement provides for the parties to submit their disputes to arbitration as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u201cIn an effort to maintain the Plan and Agreement of Shared Parenting for the benefit and best interests of their minor child(ren), the parties agree that before resorting to any court action to resolve disputes as to their respective rights and responsibilities under this agreement, <em>they shall seek arbitration pursuant to ORC [Chapter] 2711 in an effort to resolve any disputes that they are unable to resolve between themselves without the aid of a third party\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Although the shared parenting agreement provides for arbitration of disputes including a parent\u2019s relocation, certain issues are not arbitrable as a matter of law. A dispute over a parent\u2019s relocation is part of the larger issue of the custody of a minor child. Therefore, this court must next determine whether matters of child custody can be made the subject of arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">In <em>Kelm v. Kelm </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 26, 623 N.E.2d 39, paragraph one of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \u201cmatters of temporary or permanent spousal and/or child <em>support </em>may, by mutual consent of the marriage partners, be made subject to an agreement to arbitrate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The <em>Kelm </em>court quoted the seminal case of <em>Faherty v. Faherty </em>(1984), 97 N.J. 99, 108-109, 477 A.2d 1257, 1262-1263, as follows: \u201c \u2018We do not agree with those who fear that by allowing parents to agree to arbitrate child <em>support, </em>we are interfering with the judicial protection of the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Kelm, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 30, 623 N.E.2d at 420. However, the <em>Kelm </em>court did not address the issue of whether child <em>custody, </em>as opposed to child <em>support, </em>may be subject to arbitration. This court\u2019s review of Ohio case law shows that no court has addressed the issue whether arbitration of child custody is lawful. Thus, this is a case of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In determining whether matters of child custody are arbitrable, we must keep in mind that under the doctrine of <em>parens patriae </em>courts have a duty to protect the best interests of children. Courts outside Ohio have held that, in matters of child support, arbitration does not destroy the court\u2019s traditional role as <em>parens patriae. </em>See <em>Masters v. Masters </em>(1986), 201 Conn. 50, 67, 513 A.2d 104, 112 (listing courts outside Ohio that have held. that child support disputes are arbitrable). However, states outside Ohio have been less comfortable with the notion of arbitrating matters of child custody. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Nestel v. Nestel </em>(1972), 38 A.D.2d 942, 943, 331 N.Y.S.2d 241, 243, the court held that matters involving child custody may not be referred to arbitration. The <em>Nestel </em>court held that child custody, as opposed to child support, involved \u201cthe delicate balancing of the factors composing the best interests of a child,\u201d a determination that could only be made by a trial court. <em>Id. </em>Further, because \u201cdeterminations of custody go to the very core of the child\u2019s welfare and best interests\u201d most states prohibit arbitration of child custody disputes. <em>Masters, </em>201 Conn, at 67, 513 A.2d at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">This court is also concerned about the limited judicial review of arbitration awards if child custody issues are deemed arbitrable. In <em>Nester v. Nester </em>(May 23, 1995), Franklin App. Nos. 94APF\u00d39-1359 and 94APF09-1360, unreported, 1995 WL 318737, the court summarized the limited scope of review allowed a trial court in reviewing an arbitrator\u2019s decision as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\u201cWhen parties agree to submit their dispute to binding arbitration, they agree to accept the result regardless of its legal or factual accuracy. Binding arbitration precludes judicial review unless the arbitrator was corrupt or committed gross procedural improprieties. In addressing a R.C. 2711.10 motion to vacate, a reviewing court is precluded from inquiry into the validity of the legal and/or factual determinations of the arbitrator unless there is a clear showing of fraud, corruption, misconduct and/or excessive or imperfectly executed authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u201cAppellate review of arbitration proceedings is further confined to an evaluation of the order issued by the court of common pleas pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2711.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u201cIn addressing a R.C. 2711.11 motion to modify or correct, the substantive merits of the original arbitration award are not reviewable on appeal, absent evidence of material mistake or extensive impropriety.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The <em>Kelm </em>court held that, although trial courts have a limited scope of review, trial courts do have the authority to use their contempt powers to ensure that arbitration of child <em>support </em>issues is accomplished in an \u201cexpeditious, efficient, and reasonable manner.\u201d <em>Kelm, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 30, 623 N.E.2d at 42. However, given the complex nature of matters of child <em>custody, </em>we do not find that a court could sufficiently protect the best interests of the child through its contempt powers. Therefore, we hold that matters of child custody may only be decided by the trial court and are not subject to arbitration despite any agreement entered into by the parties. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Upon consideration whereof, the judgment of the Allen County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. This case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. It is ordered that appellant pay the costs of this appeal as provided for under App.R. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b129-8\">Melvin L.
