Appellant greeted Bentz with the following declaratory statement: \u201cI\u2019m tired of being your victim and I\u2019m not going to be your victim anymore. I think you are a real sicko. I think you are a sick son-of-a-bitch.\u201d Bentz did not respond to this outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In addition to the fence separating appellant and Bentz, there was also a considerable distance between them as well. This distance was estimated by various witnesses as being between thirty to forty feet or one hundred to one hundred fifty feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On April 22, 1994, Bentz swore out two complaints against appellant. One complaint was for aggravated menacing in violation of R.C. 2903.21, a misdemean- or of the first degree. The second complaint was for disorderly conduct in violation of R.C. 2917.11, a minor misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Upon motion of the state, the complaint for disorderly conduct was dismissed without prejudice on May 6, 1994. Shortly thereafter on July 6, 1994, however, the trial court granted the state leave to amend the charge of aggravated menacing to a charge of disorderly conduct. The amended complaint was filed by the state on the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">On July 8, 1994, the county court tried appellant on the amended disorderly conduct charge. By judgment entry filed August 12, 1994, the court found appellant guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of R.C. 2917.11(A)(2). The court also explicitly found appellant \u201cnot to have violated other subdivisions of Revised Code 2917.11.\u201d Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal on September 6, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Prior to considering the merits of this appeal, we note that appellee has failed to file a brief or otherwise make an appearance in this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">App.R. 18(C) provides that if an appellee fails to timely file its brief, the court, in ruling on the appeal, may accept the appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>issues as correct and reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment as long as appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Under certain circumstances, an appellate court may need to consider all or part of a trial court\u2019s record in such a matter. <em>Bell v. Horton </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 824, 669 N.E.2d 546; <em>State v. Middleton </em>(1993), 85 Ohio App.3d 403, 409, 619 N.E.2d 1113, 1117; <em>Fuller v. Fuller </em>(1972), 32 Ohio App.2d 303, 304-305, 61 O.O.2d 400, 400-401, 290 N.E.2d 852, 853. However, it is also within an appellate court\u2019s discretion to reverse a judgment based solely on a consideration of appellant\u2019s brief. <em>State v. Grimes </em>(1984), 17 Ohio App.3d 71, 71-72, 17 OBR 126, 126-127, 477 N.E.2d 1219, 1220-1221; <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Potts </em>(1986), 28 Ohio App.3d 93, 95-96, 28 OBR 136, 138, 502 N.E.2d 255, 257-258; <em>Helmeci v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 172, 174, 598 N.E.2d 1294, 1295-1296. Here, we accept appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In her sole assignment of error, appellant argues that the evidence relied upon by the trial court was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction for disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(A)(2). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Supreme Court of Ohio has clearly defined an appellate court\u2019s duty when called upon to review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492. Specifically, the appellate court must examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Appellant was convicted of violating R.C. 2917.11(A)(2), which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">\u201cNo person shall recklessly cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to another, by doing any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">\u201c(2) Making unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture, or display, or communicating unwarranted and grossly abusive language to any person[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">In response to such statutes, the Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized that criminal statutes that are capable of punishing spoken words are unconstitutional unless construed to be inapplicable to speech protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. <em>Cincinnati v. Karlan </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 107, 109, 68 O.O.2d 62, 64, 314 N.E.2d 162, 164. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Thus, the court held that a person could not be punished under Cincinnati\u2019s disorderly conduct ordinance for speaking boisterous, rude or insulting words, even if intended to annoy another, unless the words by their very utterance inflicted injury or were likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus. Such injurious or provocative language is considered \u201cfighting words\u201d and its utterance can be punished as a criminal act. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The Supreme Court later followed <em>Karlan </em>and specifically applied its holding to Ohio\u2019s disorderly conduct statute. <em>State v. Hoffman </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St.2d 129, 11 O.O.3d 298, 387 N.E.2d 239. That is, a person may not be punished under R.C. 2917.11(A)(2) for making an offensively coarse utterance or communicating unwarranted and grossly abusive language unless the words spoken are likely, by their very utterance, to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We note that several appellate courts have reversed disorderly conduct convictions for defendants that have used language that was patently more offensive than the \u201csick son-of-a-bitch\u201d epithet uttered by appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, this court reversed the conviction under R.C. 2917.11(A)(2) of a restaurant customer who spoke to his waitress in the following manner: \u201cI ain\u2019t eating this fucking shit, it\u2019s got hair in it,\u201d and \u2018Well, you fucking work here don\u2019t you,\u201d and \u201cDo you think I give a fuck about your feelings?\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1990), 64 Ohio App.3d 357, 359, 581 N.E.2d 619, 619-620. We reasoned that, although obviously offensive, the customer\u2019s words did not constitute threats to anyone or seem likely to cause the average person to breach the peace. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The Hamilton County Court of Appeals also reversed a disorderly conduct conviction under R.C. 2917.11(A)(2) in <em>State v. Hampton </em>(1990), 66 Ohio App.3d 30, 583 N.E.2d 400. In that case, the defendant approached a police officer and said, \u201cjust because you\u2019ve got a f-\u2014 badge you think you can f\u2014 with people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 583 N.E.2d at 401, fn. 1. The defendant continued to say, \u201cf\u2014 you and your gun, money talks so I\u2019ll walk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The appellate court held that the evidence failed to establish that the defendant\u2019s words were likely to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 583 N.E.2d at 401. Therefore, the trial court erred as matter of law in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>finding that all the elements of the alleged offense had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">By comparison, appellate courts have sustained disorderly conduct convictions under the following circumstances. In <em>State v. Baker </em>(Sept. 19, 1989), Marion App. Nos. 9-88-8 and 9-88-9, unreported, 1989 WL 108685, the court upheld a conviction when the defendant pointed at an off-duty deputy and stated, \u201cif I catch you outside or on the streets, your ass is grass.\u201d Similarly, the court in <em>State v. Freewalt </em>(June 30, 1988), Auglaize App. No. 2-87-11, unreported, 1988 WL 72400, upheld the conviction of a defendant who approached a patrolman threatening to \u201ckick ass,\u201d because the court was satisfied that such speech had progressed beyond the point of constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The facts presently before this court are plainly distinguishable from the circumstances presented in <em>Baker </em>and <em>Freewalt. </em>In both of those cases, the defendants used language that expressed an immediate desire to inflict bodily harm upon the listeners. Such utterances are likely to provoke an average person to commit a retaliatory breach of the peace. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, the appellant merely expressed an opinion, without any threat of present or future violence. Such a statement does not constitute \u201cfighting words\u201d and is thus protected speech under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Therefore, after an examination of the evidence, as established by appellant\u2019s brief and construed in a light most favorable to the state, a rational trier of fact could not have found that all of the essential elements of the crime of disorderly conduct were proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jenks, swpra. </em>We believe the state failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish that the words spoken by appellant were likely, by their very utterance, to inflict injury or provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. Absent proof of this essential element of the alleged offense, appellant\u2019s conviction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error. The decision of the trial court is reversed and appellant is discharged from further prosecution concerning this charge against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-10\">Peter B. Abele, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b198-11\">Stephenson, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-12\">. As background and for reasons immaterial to this appeal, appellant filed a motion to disqualify the Meigs County Prosecuting Attorney on May 4, 1994. This motion was sustained on May 6, 1994 and a special prosecutor was appointed by the trial court. The special prosecutor\u2019s appointment \"shall terminate upon completion of this case.\u201d The remainder of appellant's prosecution, including the trial, was handled by the special prosecutor. On October 26, 1994 (after appellant had filed her notice of appeal) the special prosecutor moved the trial court for permission to withdraw and \"no longer be obligated in this case either in appeal or otherwise.\u201d The trial court granted such permission on the same day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">.

Welch </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 47, 48, 7 O.O.3d 128, 128, 372 N.E.2d 346, 347, in which Justice Herbert, concurring, noted that the defendant's use of the phrase \u201cyou son of a bitch\u201d was likely to provoke the average person to an immediate breach of the peace because \"such disparagement of one's mother and other ancestral roots constitutes fighting words within the meaning of the present state of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b198-12\">Stephenson, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ark\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">I concur in the judgment and opinion, but write separately <em>in </em>order to emphasize that my concurrence is based solely on the state of the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Judge Harsha\u2019s analysis of the law.
