This court dismisses her appeal because the order from which she has attempted to appeal was not a \u201cfinal appealable order\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On September 8, 1993, the Summit County Common Pleas Court, Domestic Relations Division, issued a divorce decree terminating the marriage of Vivian and George Koroshazi. As part of the divorce decree, the court allocated sole parental rights and responsibilities over the parties\u2019 children to Ms. Koroshazi, and ordered Mr. Koroshazi to pay $760 per month in child support. During May 1995, Mr. Koroshazi moved the domestic relations court for an order reducing his child support obligation and making him the permanent residential parent of the minor children. The matter was referred to a referee, who recommended that Mr. Koroshazi\u2019s child support obligation be decreased. The referee recommended that the remaining custody matter be referred to Family Court Services. The trial court adopted the referee\u2019s recommendations on July 3, 1995, and stayed the enforcement of the order pending filing of objections by Ms. Koroshazi. On September 8, 1995, the trial court overruled Ms. Koroshazi\u2019s objections and ordered that the previously granted stay be released. Ms. Koroshazi attempted to appeal that order to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Under Section 3(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, this court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from judgments or \u201cfinal orders.\u201d R.C. 2505.02 defines \u201cfinal orders\u201d as (1) \u201c[a]n order that affects a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment\u201d or (2) \u201can order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding.\u201d In this case, the order from which Ms. Koroshazi attempted to appeal did not determine the action because it did not adjudicate all the issues raised by Mr. Koroshazi. When the domestic relations court adopted the referee\u2019s recommendations, it ordered that Mr. Koroshazi\u2019s child support obligation be decreased. It also, however, referred the remaining custody issue to Family Court Services and scheduled a \u201ccustody status hearing.\u201d Inasmuch as the custody issue remains unresolved, the order from which Ms. Koroshazi has attempted to appeal did not determine the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Nor did the reduction of Mr. Koroshazi\u2019s child support obligation affect a substantial right in a special proceeding. In <em>Polikoff v. Adam </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 100, 616 N.E.2d 213, the Ohio Supreme Court established a new standard for determining what constitutes a special proceeding. In adopting this new standard, the Supreme Court overruled the \u201cbalancing test\u201d it had previously established in <em>Amato v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 253, 21 O.O.3d 158, 423 N.E.2d 452, and substituted in its place the \u201cclassical view\u201d of special proceedings. Gitlin, Special Proceedings in Ohio: What is the Ohio Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>Court Doing with the Final Judgment Rule? (1993), 41 Cleve.St.L.Rev. 537, 564. The Supreme Court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">\u201cOrders that are entered in actions that were recognized at common law or in equity and were not specially created by statute are not orders entered in special proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.\u201d <em>Polikoff, </em>67 Ohio St.3d 100, 616 N.E.2d 213, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Thus, to qualify as a special proceeding, the action must be one that was not recognized at common law or in equity and the purported special proceeding must statutorily specify the \u201cstep-by-step procedures to be utilized.\u201d 41 Cleve. StL.Rev. at 560, quoting <em>Tilberry v. Body </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 117, 122, 24 OBR 308, 312-313, 493 N.E.2d 954, 958-959 (Douglas, J., dissenting). See, also, <em>Haskins v. Haskins </em>(1995), 104 Ohio App.3d 58, 60, 660 N.E.2d 1260, 1261-1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The Ohio Supreme Court recently determined that a divorce and the ancillary claims for custody were \u201cspecial statutory proceedings.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Papp v. James </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 373, 379, 632 N.E.2d 889, 894-895. An order entered in such a proceeding that affects a substantial right, therefore, would qualify as a final appealable order under R.C. 2505.02. In this case, however, the order modifying Mr. Koroshazi\u2019s child support obligation did not affect a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">An order affects a substantial right if, in the absence of an immediate appeal, one of the parties would be foreclosed from appropriate relief in the future. <em>Bell v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 60, 63, 616 N.E.2d 181, 183-184, modified by <em>Moskovitz v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 638, 635 N.E.2d 331. There has been no showing that Ms. Koroshazi would be denied the ability to obtain effective relief by being required to raise her argument that the domestic relations court incorrectly reduced her former husband\u2019s child support obligation after that court determines whether there should be a change in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">The order from which Ms. Koroshazi has attempted to appeal was not a final appealable order. Accordingly, her appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b674-12\">Reece, P.J., and Slaby, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
