The underlying action in the trial court involved appeals to the trial court by Kerry Ford, Inc. and Williams Ford Sales, Inc., from a decision of the OMVB, finding that good cause had been established to permit Ford Motor Company to relocate R.S. Ford to the Kings Auto Mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">OMVB asserts that it is a proper party to this appeal based upon the language of R.C. 4517.58, which provides in part that upon the decision of the Motor Vehicles Dealer Board in a protest action, \u201cany person adversely affected by the decision may appeal in the manner provided by sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code.\u201d OMVB argues that this court\u2019s entry striking its brief \u201cwas based upon the mistaken premise that the Motor Vehicle Dealers Board is not a party to the appeal\u201d and further asserts that this court\u2019s action \u201chas the effect of a determination that an administrative entity has no interest in upholding its own administrative orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The issue presented by OMVB is whether an administrative agency, acting in the role of an impartial decisionmaker, has standing as a party from an appeal of its own order.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">While an administrative agency is granted the statutory right, pursuant to R.C. 119.12, to appeal questions of law relating to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency, in general, \u201can administrative agency has no partisan interests in its decisions.\u201d <em>Miller v. Unemp. Comp. Bur. </em>(1954), 160 Ohio St. 561, 563, 52 O.O. 451, 452, 117 N.E.2d 427, 428. \u201cOnly in a very few cases has the General Assembly given the right to a board to be a \u2018referee\u2019 and a \u2018litigant\u2019 at the same time.\u201d <em>In re Highland Holiday Subdivision </em>(1971), 27 Ohio App.2d 237, 238, 56 O.O.2d 404, 405, 273 N.E.2d 903, 905. \u201cA \u2018real party in interest\u2019 has been defined, among other ways, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>as \u2018a party who is benefited or injured by a judgment in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beaver Excavating Co. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 20, 21, 603 N.E.2d 426, 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The Ohio Supreme Court has, under limited circumstances, held that an administrative agency may participate as a party in appellate review of its decisions. <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation &amp; Developmental Disabilities v. Professionals Guild of Ohio </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 147, 545 N.E.2d 1260. In <em>Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Mental Retardation, </em>the court held that the State Employees Relation Board (\u201cSERB\u201d) may participate as a party in appellate review of its decisions. The court reasoned that SERB, \u201cin addition to its quasi-judicial function, is given enforcement powers by R.C. Chapter 4117.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 545 N.E.2d at 1268. The court made clear, however, that its decision did not stand for the proposition that SERB was a necessary or indispensable party or that it should participate in every review proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In <em>DiCillo &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Chester Zoning Bd. of Appeals </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 302, 49 O.O. 135, 109 N.E.2d 8, a township zoning board of appeals sought to appeal from a judgment of a trial court which had reversed the decision of the board, based upon statutory language providing that \u201c \u2018[a]ny person adversely affected by a decision of a township board of zoning appeals may appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 49 O.O. at 136, 109 N.E.2d at 10. The court in <em>DiCillo </em>rejected the board\u2019s contention that the board was a proper party to an appeal from the board\u2019s decision, noting that the legislature contemplated that \u201cthe board should be as disinterested in deciding matters brought before it as a court should be.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 49 O.O. at 136,109 N.E.2d at 10. The court further held:</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">\u201cIt has been argued that the function of the board is to represent the interests of the public; and that, therefore, it must, if those interests are to be protected, be allowed to have an interest adverse to the appellee in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">\u201cAdmittedly, the board does represent the interest that the public has in having appeals correctly heard and decided and in having proper authorizations on such appeals for variances from the terms of the zoning resolution. However, it does not follow that the board or any of its members as such may become partisans when one of its decisions is questioned on an appeal to a court. Sufficient partisan representation of any interest of the public in warding off appellate attacks on the decisions of the board can be furnished either by the administrative officer, from whose decision an appeal to the board is authorized by statute, or by \u2018any person aggrieved or by any officer of the township [other than members of the board as such] affected by any decision of the administrative officer.\u2019 If no one appeals to the board from a decision of an administrative officer, then the decision of the administrative officer stands. If a proper party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>does appeal, than a party so appealing is in a position which should enable satisfactory representation of interests of the public which may be adversely affected by the decision made by the administrative officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305-306, 49 O.O. at 136-137,109 N.E.2d at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">As noted above, in the present case, the underlying action involved a dispute between a franchisor and two of its franchisees over the relocation of a car dealership. The franchisees, pursuant to statute (R.C. 4517.50), filed protests to the franchisor\u2019s proposal. The role of the OMVB in the action, as a quasi-judicial body, was to render an impartial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">We are cognizant that the trial court, in dismissing the franchisees\u2019 appeal, did not base its decision on whether the order of the OMVB was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence; rather, the trial court dismissed this action based upon its holding that application of R.C. 4517.50, 4517.51, 4517.57 and 4517.58 to the present action would be an unconstitutional retroactive application of law, <em>i.e., </em>the court found that franchise agreements executed prior to March 14, 1980, the date the statutes became effective, are exempt from application of the statutes. Thus, as acknowledged by OMVB in its brief submitted on appeal, the trial court\u2019s decision is not adverse to the ruling of the OMVB as it relates to this particular protest; instead, it is asserted by OMVB, the decision of the trial court would have a detrimental effect on its authority to adequately address protest actions in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Even assuming that OMVB could, under certain circumstances, be a party to an appeal of its own decision, OMVB has failed to persuade this court that the proper parties to this appeal, the franchisor and franchisees, will not adequately represent the public\u2019s interest or that the OMVB\u2019s participation is necessary or indispensable to the resolution of this matter. In sum, there is no indication that the issues raised by the OMVB in its brief, which was stricken by this court, will not be adequately addressed by the actual adverse parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Accordingly, OMVB\u2019s motion for reconsideration of this court\u2019s entry, striking OMVB\u2019s brief from the file, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-10\">John C. Young and Petree, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
