(\u201cAdore\u201d) appeals from summary judgment entered in favor of the Ohio State Boxing Commission (\u201cthe commission\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">The facts are not in dispute. Adore, a Michigan corporation, promotes \u201cToughman Contests\u201d in several states. In a \u201cToughman Contest,\u201d the contestants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> who have no prior professional boxing experience, punch and kick each other for up to three one-minute rounds. They wear boxing gloves and other protective equipment such as headgear and foot protectors. The contest is a single elimination tournament, with prizes as high as $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">Adore planned and advertised a \u201cToughman Contest\u201d that was to take place at a Cuyahoga Falls location. It did not obtain a license from the commission. The commission filed for an injunction prohibiting Adore from holding the contest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>The trial court granted a temporary restraining order, which was later vacated at the parties\u2019 request. Both sides moved for summary judgment; the trial court granted the commission\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Adore appeals, assigning two errors; we consider these assigned errors together:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">I. \u201cThe lower court erred in holding that a \u2018Toughman Contest\u2019 is a \u2018prize fight,\u2019 \u2018boxing match\u2019 or \u2018exhibition\u2019 as set forth in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3773.32, thus subject to the auspices of the Ohio State Boxing Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">II. \u201cR.C. \u00a7 3773.32 applies only to boxing and \u2018kickboxing\u2019 is not encompassed in the definition of \u2018boxing,\u2019 under this statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment, an appellate court applies the same standard used by the trial court. <em>Cooperider v. Peterseim </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 476, 478, 659 N.E.2d 882, 884. Summary judgment under Civ.R. 56(C) is proper if \u201c(1) no genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party, that conclusion is adverse to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Ferreri </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 587, 589, 639 N.E.2d 1189, 1192; see, also, <em>Temple v. Wean United, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274. Because only legal questions exist, no special deference is to be afforded the trial court upon review of an entry of summary judgment. <em>Tyler v. Kelley </em>(1994), 98 Ohio App.3d 444, 446, 648 N.E.2d 881, 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">R.C. 3773.32 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">\u201cNo person shall promote, sponsor, or conduct any prize fight or public boxing match or exhibition unless such person is licensed under section 3773.36, secures a permit to conduct the match or exhibition under section 3773.38, and otherwise complies with sections 3773.31 to 3773.57 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">Adore argues that its \u201cToughman Contest\u201d is not a \u201cprize fight\u201d or a \u201cboxing match or exhibition\u201d under the statute. It analogizes the contest to kick boxing, which, it argues, is distinct from boxing. It contends that it should not be required to comply -with R.C. Chapter 3773.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">The Ohio Revised Code does not define \u201cprize fight,\u201d \u201cboxing,\u201d or \u201ckick boxing.\u201d Therefore, we must read these words in their context and construe them according to their common use and rules of grammar. R.C. 1.42; <em>State ex </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>rel. Chavis v. Sycamore City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 26, 30, 641 N.E.2d 188, 193. We cannot ignore the words used by the statute, nor may we add words intended to reach a desired result. <em>E. Ohio Gas Co. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 363, 365, 575 N.E.2d 132, 133-134.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">\u201cBoxing\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he sport of fighting with the fists.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (1981) 158. A \u201cprize fight\u201d is a \u201cmatch fought between professional boxers for money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1042. \u201cKick boxing\u201d has been defined as a \u201cform of boxing incorporating elements of karate, esp. kicking with bare feet.\u201d The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (1993) 1485.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">No Ohio appellate courts have considered whether the \u201cToughman Contest\u201d is a boxing match or a prize fight. The only Ohio case that is substantively relevant to the case <em>subjudice </em>is <em>Seville v. State </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 117, 30 N.E. 621. In <em>Seville, </em>which concerned a criminal sanction for engaging in a prize fight, the court noted that the term \u201cprize fight\u201d has no technical legal meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 131, 30 N.E. at 622. One of the defendant\u2019s arguments was that the lower court should have admitted evidence that the fight was actually conducted under the rules of a \u201cglove contest.\u201d The court rejected this argument, stating that the name given to the contest by its participants or by its rules was not determinative of whether the contest was a prize fight. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 30 N.E. at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The trial court found that the \u201cToughman Contest\u201d constitutes a \u201cprize fight\u201d and a \u201cboxing match or exhibition.\u201d We agree. Boxers hit each other with their fists, which are covered with padded gloves, while they move around a boxing ring. A referee, panel of judges, and timekeeper supervise a boxing match. The activity continues for a number of predetermined rounds or until a winner is declared. All of these facts are also true of the \u201cToughman Contest.\u201d Although contest participants wear additional protective equipment and may kick each other, these additional elements do not sufficiently distinguish the contests from boxing for purposes of the statute. As for Adore\u2019s argument that \u201cToughman Contests\u201d are analogous to kick boxing, we note that the term \u201ckick boxing\u201d is defined as a \u201cform of boxing.\u201d Moreover, calling the contest \u201ckick boxing\u201d or a \u201cToughman Contest\u201d does not remove it from the scope of R.C. 3773.32. The trial court, therefore, did not err by granting summary judgment for the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Adore\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-10\">Quillin, P.J., and Baird, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\">. One news clipping attached to the commission\u2019s complaint states that the contestants go by such names as \u201cKiller,\u201d \u201cPsycho,\u201d \"Stomper,\u201d and \"The Cobra.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-13\"><em>. </em>Perhaps the most significant mandate of this chapter is R.C. 3773.54\u2019s requirement that the commission receive five percent of the gross proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
