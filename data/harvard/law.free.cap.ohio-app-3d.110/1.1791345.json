Appellant assigns the following errors:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">\u201cI. The court of common pleas erred in holding that SERB\u2019S \u2018directive granting motion to dismiss\u2019 was proper despite the court\u2019s determination that \u2018SERB erred in dismissing the University\u2019s petition on the authority of Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F).\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">\u201cII. The court of common pleas erred in finding that Section 4(A) of Am.Sub. S.B. No. 133, 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 336, 367, deprived SERB of jurisdiction to consider the University\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u201cIII. The court of common pleas erred in affirming SERB\u2019S \u2018directive granting motion to dismiss\u2019 where SERB sought remand for further proceedings in accordance with Ohio law.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">\u201cIV. The court of common pleas erred in failing to address and failing to find that the SEA waived its right to file a motion to dismiss the university\u2019s petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">On March 18, 1994, appellant filed a \u201cPetition for Clarification of Bargaining Unit\u201d (\u201cpetition\u201d). The petition indicates that the deemed certified unit, described to include full-service faculty' members, is represented by appellee, Shawnee Education Association (\u201cSEA\u201d). The petition in particular requests that \u201cSERB clarify that department chairpersons are not properly included in the bargaining unit. The 1990-1993 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the SEA and [appellant] improperly called for department chairs to be part of the unit as of June, 1992. Neither the SEA nor [appellant] requested that SERB certify such a bargaining unit. Therefore, department chairs are not properly in the unit. Furthermore, department chairs should not be included in the unit as they are supervisors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">SEA responded on March 28, 1994, with a motion to dismiss appellant\u2019s petition. SEA asserted that appellant\u2019s petition was \u201cdeficient on its face and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>in violation of the rules of this board, in that it is filed only by one party, it concerns a deemed certified unit, and it contains no allegation that the current unit contains the combination proscribed by R.C. 4117.06(D),\u201d as required under Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Following full briefing on the matter, SERB issued a directive granting SEA\u2019s motion to dismiss. Relying on Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F), SERB determined that appellant\u2019s petition lacked the necessary allegation that the unit contained a combination of employees prohibited by division (D) of R.C. 4117.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Appellant, on July 22, 1994, filed an appeal with the common pleas court, asserting that SERB misapplied R.C. Chapter 4117 in rejecting appellant\u2019s petition. On July 27, 1994, the Supreme Court decided <em>Ohio Council 8, Am. Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., AFL-CIO v. Cincinnati </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 677, 635 N.E.2d 361 <em>(\u201cOhio Council </em>8\u201d), the syllabus of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u201cOhio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) is in clear conflict with Section 4(A) of Am.Sub. S.B. No. 133 (140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 336, 367) and is, therefore, invalid. Pursuant to Section 4(A), adjustments or alterations to deemed certified collective bargaining units are not permitted until challenged by another employee organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">As a result of that decision, the common pleas court concluded that SERB had improperly dismissed appellant\u2019s petition on the basis of Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Nonetheless, the common pleas court concluded that under Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 (\u201cSection 4(A)\u201d), SERB properly dismissed appellant\u2019s petition because Section 4(A) \u201cdeprived SERB of jurisdiction to consider [appellant\u2019s] petition. Section 4(A) forbids adjustments or alterations to deemed certified collective bargaining units absent a challenge by and subsequent certification of a rival employee organization. [Appellant] is not a rival employee organization.\u201d As a result, the common pleas court concluded that SERB\u2019S directive granting SEA\u2019s motion to dismiss was supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence and was in accordance with law; it therefore affirmed the directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>On appeal to this court, both parties rely on <em>Ohio Council 8 </em>to support their positions. In <em>Ohio Council 8, </em>the city of Cincinnati filed with SERB five separate petitions for clarification of a bargaining unit represented by Ohio Council 8 and Locals 190, 228, 240, 250, 1543 and 319 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (\u201cAFSCME\u201d). Prior to filing the petitions, and dating back to November 1, 1958, the city of Cincinnati and AFSCME had been governed by a series of written collective bargaining agreements. One of the petitions filed by the city of Cincinnati sought to exclude from the bargaining unit nine employees classified as water-works guards.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The Supreme Court determined that Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) conflicted with Section 4(A), as the rule \u201cwould allow SERB to entertain employer petitions to adjust or alter deemed certified collective bargaining units that violate the prohibitions of R.C. 4117.06(D) regarding composition of units, irrespective of whether exclusive representation is challenged by another employee organization.\u201d <em>Id., </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 680, 635 N.E.2d at 363. Pointing to the language of Section 4(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court noted that by operation of Section 4(A), deemed certified units, existing at the time of the enactment of R.C. Chapter 4117, were preserved in their original, pre-Act form, and public employers have been required to pursue bargaining relationships with the exclusive representatives of these units as if there had been a SERB-certified election and designation of bargaining unit. <em>Id. </em>at 681-682, 635 N.E.2d at 363-365. Concluding that Section 4(A) \u201cwas clearly designed to maintain the status quo in those public sector employer/employee collective bargaining relationships antedating April 1, 1984,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 682, 635 N.E.2d at 364, the court held that Section 4(A) requires that deemed certified bargaining units recognized before April 1, 1984 continue indefinitely unless challenged by a rival organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Ohio Council 8, </em>appellant strongly urges that .the changes it seeks to have clarified occurred after April 1, 1984, and more specifically through the 1990-1993 collective bargaining agreement -with SEA. Thus, it contends that, under the syllabus of <em>Ohio Council 8, </em>its collective bargaining agreement with SEA constitutes an impermissible adjustment or alteration to a deemed certified collective bargaining unit organization, which SERB is obligated to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Relying on the same case, SEA contends that appellant\u2019s petition, as the petitions in <em>Ohio Council 8, </em>is one seeking clarification. Because the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Court rejected the petitions for clarification as an illegal challenge to a deemed certified unit in <em>Ohio Council 8, </em>SEA contends that under that decision, appellant\u2019s petition for clarification is barred by Section 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">Since oral argument in this case, the Supreme Court in <em>State ex rel. Brecksville Edn. Assn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 665, 660 N.E.2d 1199, revisited Section 4(A), and held that Section 4(A) of the Act \u201cdoes not deprive the State Employment Relations Board of jurisdiction to consider a petition jointly filed by an employer and an exclusive bargaining representative requesting SERB to amend the composition of a deemed certified bargaining unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">In distinguishing <em>Ohio Council 8, </em>the court noted that Section 4(A) \u201cdoes not expressly protect the <em>composition </em>of the bargaining unit. Section 4(A) provides that the deemed certified unit shall remain deemed certified until challenged by another organization.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 670, 660 N.E.2d at 1203. Thus, the court concluded that \u201c[tjhough it is reasonable to conclude * * * that the General Assembly intended to protect preexisting collective bargaining relationships from unilateral attack by employers, it does not necessarily follow that the General Assembly intended to forever freeze the composition of units extant on October 6,1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 660 N.E.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Neither <em>Ohio Council 8 </em>nor <em>Brecksville </em>directly addresses the circumstances alleged in appellant\u2019s petition. <em>Ohio Council 8 </em>addressed a preexisting unit whose composition apparently had not changed; <em>Brecksville </em>addressed a joint petition regarding a deemed certified unit whose composition changed after the enactment of R.C. Chapter 4117. Because the factual underpinnings of a case may determine whether SERB has jurisdiction to consider a petition for clarification, we, as was the common pleas court, are at a severe disadvantage in attempting to apply <em>Ohio Council 8 </em>or <em>Brecksville </em>here, as SERB dismissed appellant\u2019s petition without developing the facts. Indeed, as SEA aptly points out, appellant\u2019s extensive recitation of the facts is unsupported in the record, due to the summary nature of SERB\u2019S proceedings so far.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Given Brecksville\u2019s clarification that Section 4(A) is not an absolute bar to SERB\u2019S jurisdiction over petitions for clarification regarding deemed certified bargaining units, the lack of a factual record precludes a definitive ruling on SERB\u2019S jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s petition. Moreover, because courts are to \u201caccord due deference to SERB\u2019S interpretation of R.C. Chapter 4117,\u201d <em>Lorain City Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 260, 533 N.E.2d 264, 267, SERB appropriately first should consider its own jurisdiction under the facts as developed. Indeed, the Supreme Court has expressed its reluctance to have this court interpret in the first instance different provisions of R.C. Chapter 4117. <em>Ohio Council 8, Am.Fedn. of State, Cty. &amp; Mun. Emp., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>AFL-CIO v. Summit Cty. Child Support Enforcement Agency </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 488, 628 N.E.2d 1361.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Given all of the foregoing factors, we are compelled to conclude that the trial court erred in addressing the applicability of Section 4(A) to the petition for clarification; rather, the common pleas court should have allowed SERB the opportunity to determine whether it had jurisdiction to consider the petition for clarification under Section 4(A), after developing the necessary facts to enable it to render such a determination. As a result, we sustain appellant\u2019s first assignment of error to the limited extent indicated in this decision; that disposition renders the remaining assigned errors moot at this time. We remand this matter to the common pleas court with instructions to return the matter to SERB so that it may consider its jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s petition for clarification, given the language of Section 4(A) and the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ohio Council 8 </em>and <em>Brecksville.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-7\">Tyack and Strausbaugh, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b40-8\">Dean Strausbaugh, J., retired, of the Tenth Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\">.
