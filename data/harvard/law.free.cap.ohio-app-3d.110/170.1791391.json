Mayberry, Wood County Prosecuting Attorney, in direct contempt of court. Appellant sets forth the following two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">\u201cFirst Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">\u201cThe actions of contemnor-appellant Alan R. Mayberry, Wood County Prosecuting Attorney, were not contempt of court, and the trial court abused its discretion in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">\u201cSecond Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">\u201cThe imposition of punishment for direct contempt of court thirty-three days after the finding of contempt violates both the statutory requirement as well as the inherent power of the court to summarily punish a person guilty of such alleged direct contempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">The facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. While prosecuting a case on behalf of the state of Ohio, appellant was held in contempt of court by the trial judge when the trial judge held that appellant had intentionally violated a previous order against repetitious and cumulative testimony of police officers who had interviewed the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the conclusion of the trial, a penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>hearing was conducted, which resulted in the imposition of a $100 fine. This appeal was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The law is settled in Ohio that the power of the court to determine contempt is inherent, <em>Zakany v. Zakany </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 192, 9 OBR 505, 459 N.E.2d 870, and within its sound discretion, <em>State v. Christon </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 471, 589 N.E.2d 53; <em>Hughes v. Hughes </em>(1991), 72 Ohio App.3d 286, 594 N.E.2d 653. However, to uphold a contempt, the record must affirmatively show that the conduct constituted an imminent threat to the administration of justice. <em>State v. Conliff </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 185, 15 O.O.3d 309, 401 N.E.2d 469. To constitute contempt, the alleged misbehavior must require immediate punishment to preserve the court\u2019s authority, take place in the presence of the judge and obstruct the administration of justice by delaying, hindering or influencing a pending case. <em>In re Lands </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 589, 33 O.O. 80, 67 N.E.2d 433; <em>State v. Treon </em>(App.1963), 91 Ohio Law Abs. 229, 240, 188 N.E.2d 308, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Because the fine was to punish appellant, the contempt was criminal. <em>State v. Kilbane </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 201, 15 O.O.3d 221, 400 N.E.2d 386. To be found in direct criminal contempt of court, a person must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Brown v. Executive 200, Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 250, 251, 18 O.O.3d 446, 447, 416 N.E.2d 610, 611-612. \u201c[A]n appellate court reviewing a conviction for contempt may <em>not </em>assume, in the absence of record evidence to the contrary, that the action of the lower court was correct and lawful.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) State v. Treon </em>(App.1963), 91 Ohio Law Abs. at 241-242, 188 N.E.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Therefore, the issue for this court to determine is whether the record affirmatively shows that appellant\u2019s conduct obstructed the administration of justice and required immediate punishment to preserve the authority of the court. Such a determination requires this court to weigh the duty that appellant, as a prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tor, owes to his client, the state, against the duty that appellant owes to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">After a thorough review of Ohio case law, this court has not found a case in which a prosecutor was held in criminal contempt under similar facts and circumstances.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In numerous cases, appellate courts have reversed judgments of criminal contempt because of consideration of an attorney\u2019s professional responsibilities to his/her client. In <em>In re Sherlock </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 204, 525 N.E.2d 512, the appellate court reversed a contempt judgment, concluding that an attorney should not have been required to violate her duty to her client as the price of avoiding punishment of contempt. In paragraph two of the syllabus, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cWhere a trial court denies a continuance in a criminal trial and, as a consequence, defense counsel refuses to participate in the trial for fear that the defendant would receive ineffective assistance of counsel and that counsel would be in violation of DR 6-101(A)(2) and 7-101(A)(3), the court may commit error under the circumstances of the particular case in finding defense counsel in contempt and in imposing a fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In <em>State v. Gasen </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 191, 2 O.O.3d 156, 356 N.E.2d 505, the trial court summarily appointed two attorneys to represent indigent defendants whom the trial court knew were already represented by competent counsel; the appointed counsel were unprepared to offer effective representation. The trial court held the appointed counsel in contempt of court for refusal to represent the defendants. The appellate court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cWe hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law in refusing to recognize the appellants\u2019 responsibilities under the Code of Professional Responsibility and conclude accordingly that the finding of contempt rendered below is contrary to law. Such finding being contrary to law, it is the order of this court that the judgment of the Hamilton County Municipal Court be reversed and the appellants discharged herewith.\u201d 48 Ohio App.2d at 195-196, 2 0.0.3d at 158-159, 356 N.E.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In <em>In re Contempt of Rossman </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 730, 734, 613 N.E.2d 241, 243-244, the appellate court reversed a judgment of criminal contempt and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u201cThe facts of this case are more similar to the facts of <em>Saltzman [State v. Saltzman </em>(Oct. 9,1980), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 41863 and 41864, unreported] where contempt was reversed, than to <em>Heben [Cleveland v. Heben </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 568, 599 N.E.2d 766], <em>McGinty [In re McGinty </em>(1986), 30 Ohio App.3d 219, 30 OBR 377, 507 N.E.2d 441], or <em>Wilson [State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 312, 59 O.O.2d 379, 285 N.E.2d 38] where contempts were affirmed. In this case, the court objected to a question posed by Rossman to an individual juror, which was the same question which had been posed by the judge to the jurors as a group. Rossman subsequently explained that the question posed to the group was not sufficient for him to determine individual biases and to exercise his preemptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\u201cAlthough the judge characterized Rossman\u2019s statements as argument, the record reflects that Rossman\u2019s conduct was neither disrespectful nor disruptive, and that his intention was to protect his client\u2019s interests by making objections on the record. His statements consisted of courteous requests to preserve objections or have a sidebar conference. The record does not reflect that he impugned the judge or the judicial process, that he made a scene, as in <em>Heben </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>or that he intended to delay the proceedings. The record creates reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s conduct obstructed the administration of justice. Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In <em>State v. Saltzman </em>(Oct. 9, 1980), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 41863 and 41864, unreported, two public defenders had been held in direct contempt of court. The appellate court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\u201cIn the case of both attorneys, it appears from the transcript of the pretrial proceedings that they showed no disrespect to the Court or hindered the administration of justice. Hubbard and Saltzman were trying only to protect the interests of their client.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u201cIn connection with the voir dire of the prospective jurors, it is true that Saltzman extensively questioned them as to their willingness to believe police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>officers. Credibility of police officers was an issue in Roger Widner\u2019s case and a subject upon which all counsel involved in the voir dire questioned the jurors. The record fails to reveal Saltzman was seeking to condition the jurors not to believe police officers, was cross-examining them or annoyed them by standing too close to the jury rail as reported in the trial judge\u2019s statement of facts. Nor is the subject of the bench conferences held during Voir dire\u2019 in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u201cHubbard sought to include in the record the reasons for his request for a mistrial and his objections to having to defend Roger Widner himself without Saltzman\u2019s assistance when so ordered by the Court. The Court did not allow Hubbard to make a record; the dialogue between Hubbard and the trial judge showed no disrespect for the Court. DR 7-106(A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility provides in pertinent part: \u2018A lawyer shall not disregard * * * a standing rule of a tribunal or a ruling of a tribunal made in the course of a proceeding, but he may take appropriate steps in good faith to test the validity of such rule or ruling.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u201cWithout being allowed to place in the record how his client was prejudiced it would be difficult, if not impossible, to test the validity of the rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u201cAfter Hubbard was found in contempt of court, Saltzman was elevated to the position of sole defense counsel. Her request to make a phone call and statement that she could not proceed similarly did not demonstrate any disrespect for the Court. Rather she was only attempting to protect her client\u2019s interest as she apparently was prepared only to have a limited role in her client\u2019s defense and was not prepared to conduct the entire defense without any forewarning. See <em>State v. Gasen </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 191 [2 O.O.3d 156, 356 N.E.2d 505].</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">\u201cThe situation here is not analogous to that in <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 312 [59 O.O.2d 379, 285 N.E.2d 38], relied upon by appellee. In that case the attorney unnecessarily repeated objections, requests for examination and for the maintenance of the record when the Court had not disallowed maintenance of the record; further, the attorney constantly disregarded the Court\u2019s orders to sit down. Such conduct amounted to disrespect for the Court, disruption of quiet and order in conduct of the Court\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">\u201cWe find no such disrespect in Hubbard\u2019s and Saltzman\u2019s action and no disruption of the pre-trial proceedings. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt of court was unwarranted in the case of both attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">These cases demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, appellate courts have reversed judgments of criminal contempt because of consideration of the professional responsibilities owed to his or her client by an attorney. Although these cases involved defense attorneys, there is no reason to apply a different standard to a prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number> As a prosecutor, appellant had a professional responsibility to the state to prepare and present sufficient evidence to sustain the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. A judgment of acquittal will result if insufficient evidence is presented to sustain the state\u2019s burden. A judgment of acquittal is a final verdict within the meaning of R.C. 2945.67(A) and is not appealable by the state as a matter of right or by leave to appeal pursuant to that statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State v. Keeton </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 379, 18 OBR 434, 481 N.E.2d 629, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Yates v. Montgomery Cty. Court of Appeals </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 30, 512 N.E.2d 343, syllabus. Thus, the trial court\u2019s order prohibiting \u201crepetitious testimony\u201d placed appellant in an untenable position: he either had to violate his professional responsibility to his client, the state, and present a case which, in his professional judgment and evaluation, was less than sufficient to sustain its burden of proof, or violate his duty and responsibility, as an officer of the court, to obey its order prohibiting \u201crepetitious testimony.\u201d As the court stated in <em>In re Sherlock, </em>37 Ohio App.3d at 213, 525 N.E.2d at 520-521, an attorney should not be required to violate his duty to his client as the price of avoiding punishment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">This court finds that the record does not reflect that appellant impugned the judge or the judicial process, that he was disrespectful to the court, or that he intended to delay the proceedings. The record creates reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s conduct obstructed the administration of justice. Consequently, under the circumstances of this case, the trial court\u2019s finding of contempt of court was unwarranted. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found well taken. The second assignment of error is rendered moot as a consequence of this court\u2019s ruling on the first assignment of error and is, therefore, not well taken. The judgment of contempt is reversed. Costs of this appeal are assessed to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Although we have reversed the judgment of contempt under the particular circumstances of this case, attorneys should heed the following admonition set forth in <em>State v. Gasen </em>48 Ohio App.2d at 195-196, 2 O.O.3d at 158-159, 356 N.E.2d at 508, fn., with which this court agrees:</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u201c[A] caveat is in order: this Court should not be understood as holding that an attorney may necessarily avoid the consequences of a refusal to obey a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>order of a trial court simply because his understanding of his personal or professional duties may differ from that of the court. <em>State, ex rel. Shroder, v. Shay, </em>3 N.P. (N.S.) 657 [16 Ohio Dec. 446]. <em>An officer of the court must always be held to disobey such instructions at his peril, and must understand that his justification for doing so unit be subjected to the closest scrutiny and will be sustained only where it may be fairly, concluded that no other course was reasonably available to him, as here. </em>Where, for example, complete relief from unjustified, unreasonable, or illegal orders may be accorded the aggrieved parties (whether counsel, his clients, or both) upon direct appeal, we take it that the burden would be heavy indeed to sustain a refusal to obey.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><em>\u201cThe overriding obligation of the trial judge to superintend the business of his court in a lawful and expeditious manner, and to control and direct the officers of the court toward the accomplishment of that end, requires that he be given substantial discretion in the governance of proceedings before him, </em>a discretion which is always subject to review for prejudicial abuse. With the existing pressures of time and numbers at every level of courts, it is difficult to conceive that the system may be made to function under any other rule. <em>Our discussion today should not be taken to represent any retreat from adherence to that principle.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b212-7\">Handwork, Glasser and Sherck, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-17\">.
