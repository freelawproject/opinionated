The two other defendants pleaded guilty to Count I. The appellant was adjudged guilty by the jury of both counts. The appeal is from the judgment and order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">At the trial both of the codefendants testified for the prosecution. Defendants\u2019 testimony in effect was a denial of any connection with the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">As recited in appellant\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">\" The trial court committed prejudicial and reversible error in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">\u201c(1) Permitting respondent to cross-examine defendant beyond the scope of the direct examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">\u201c (2) Permitting improper impeachment of appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-16\">\u201c(3) Permitting respondent\u2019s witnesses to testify as to conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-17\">\u201c(4) Limiting appellant\u2019s cross-examination of respondent\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-18\">\u201c (5) Excluding competent and relevant evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-19\">Item 1 relates to defendant\u2019s bank account and certain checks. No prejudicial error resulted in connection with this examination. On the contrary, defendant explained the bank account and checks and the cross-examination was not \u201cbeyond the scope of the direct examination. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b705-20\">As to Item 2, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-21\">\u201cQ. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsvE\">' \u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that on the 6th day of December, 1946, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>in the Superior Court of Oakland, you pleaded guilty to burglary ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">\u201cMr. Garber: Objected to, your Honor, being incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\" The Court : Objection will be overruled. You may answer the question. A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Appellant argues, \u2018 \u2018 In the instant appeal, appellant denied that he was ever convicted of a felony. No record to the contrary was ever produced. Nevertheless, the court permitted the District Attorney, over appellant's objection, to question appellant about a specific offense, without producing any evidence that such offense was a felony. It is submitted that such action on the part of the District Attorney was contrary to the law and was highly prejudicial and constituted prejudicial and reversible error. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The record does not reveal whether the burglary referred to was a felony or misdemeanor. The above, as copied- from the reporter\u2019s transcript, is the-only reference to the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Obviously the court\u2019s ruling on the objection was correct. If the burglary referred to was in fact a misdemeanor it was defendant\u2019s privilege to reveal it, in which circumstances a motion to strike and a request that the\u2019 court instruct the jury to disregard the incident would have been in order. In the circumstances appellant is in no position to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The other three contentions are highly technical. There is no merit to number 3, and as to number 4 the rules of cross-examination were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">As to number 5, the exclusion of the cheek and so-called note. They were excluded because of the lack of an adequate foundation. The so-called note was in Japanese and was not translated. The record supports the trial judge\u2019s rulings with regard to these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The record reveals no prejudicial errors. The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">White, P. J., and Ashburn, J. pro tern.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 5, 1956.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-15\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
