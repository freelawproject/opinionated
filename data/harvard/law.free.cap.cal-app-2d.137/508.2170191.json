On June 11th, the signed stipulation was received by plaintiff\u2019s attorney with a covering letter from defendants\u2019 counsel. The stipulation was filed June 18, 1954, and on the same day, pursuant thereto, the cause was so set for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">September 22, 1954, there being no appearance on behalf of defendants, plaintiff\u2019s attorney phoned the office of defendants\u2019 attorney and \u201cspoke to one who represented herself to be a secretary and also to another person who stated he was an associate of\u201d defendants\u2019 attorney; and said persons told him that defendants\u2019 attorney \u201cwas out of town and that his secretary was away on vacation.\u201d He informed the presiding judge of said conversations and the action was then transferred to Department 15 for trial. Plaintiff was sworn and testified and judgment was rendered in favor of Martine G. Etchepare as plaintiff and cross-defendant. Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tember 28, 1954, judgment was filed providing \u201cthat plaintiff do have and recover from defendants the sum of $5,250.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">September 27th, the day before it was signed and filed, plaintiff\u2019s attorney mailed to defendants\u2019 attorney a copy of the judgment prepared by him. The judgment was entered on October 5, 1954, and notice of entry of judgment was mailed to defendants\u2019 attorney on October 6, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">March 31,1955, notice of motion to set aside judgment under section 473, Code of Civil Procedure, was served and filed. The motion specifies that the judgment was entered through the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, and excusable neglect of defendants and cross-complainants\u2019 counsel, and is based upon the answer and cross-complaint and \u201cthe affidavit of J. Howard Sullivan\u201d filed therewith, and upon all the records and files in the above entitled action.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The affidavit of defendants\u2019 said attorney filed with said notice of motion is the only basis in the record on the instant appeal upon which relief under section 473 could have been granted. The relevant portions thereof are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW0\">\u201c. . . that on the 17th day of September, 1954, your affiant called the Calendar Clerk of Department 1 for the purpose of determining whether the trial of the above entitled matter was on the Master Calendar of Department 1 on September 22, 1954 at which time he was informed that there was no Stipulation there and that the earliest date for trial would be December 22, 1954, which date had been reserved for this matter . . . that because of the information given to him by the Calendar Clerk, which evidently was erroneous, your affiant did leave town for a period of two weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">&lt;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201cThat plaintiff and cross-defendant did not serve a Notice of Trial pursuant to C.C.P. 594 on defendants and cross-complainants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-11\">\u2018 \u2018 The court may, upon such terms as may be just, relieve a party . . . from a judgment . . . taken against him through his mistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7473.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">In the instant action, defendants\u2019 attorney had signed a stipulation for trial on September 22d, and had sent it to plaintiff\u2019s attorney for filing. He had thereby waived his right to notice of trial under Code of Civil Procedure, section 594. He knew the date of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">According to his affidavit, on the 17th of September, five days before the stipulated trial date, he telephoned the calen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>dar clerk and was misinformed. Then, without checking the file or docket in the clerk\u2019s office, without telephoning plaintiff\u2019s attorney regarding the filing of the stipulation or the chances of going to trial, and without any arrangement for trial on the 22d or for a continuance, he \u201cleft town for two weeks. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The burden of proving excusable neglect is upon the defendant who must establish his thesis by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(Bruskey </em>v. <em>Bruskey, </em>4 Cal.App.2d 472, 479 [41 P.2d 203]; <em>Caton </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>131 Cal.App.2d 451, 458 [280 P.2d 876].)  To decide whether the burden has been met in this respect is the duty of the trial court and an order granting or denying a motion to vacate a judgment will not be reversed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is clearly shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">In <em>Shearman </em>v. <em>Jorgensen, </em>106 Cal.483 [39 P. 863], where defendant\u2019s attorney prepared an answer and then, through inadvertence, filed it in his own office instead of filing it in court, the order vacating the default judgment was reversed and, at page 485, it was said: \u201cInadvertence in the abstract is no plea upon which to set aside a default ... if the inadvertence is wholly inexcusable, as if it arises from gross negligence, the court will not look upon it kindly, and will have none of it.\u201d <em>(Benjamin </em>v. <em>Dalmo Mfg. Co., </em>31 Cal.2d 523, 528 [190 P.2d 593].) Defendants and their attorneys must be guided by the rules of legal procedure in the conduct of a lawsuit. <em>(Caton </em>v. <em>Caton, </em>131 Cal.App.2d 451, 458 [280 P.2d 876].)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The record on the instant appeal fails to show any abuse of discretion in denying appellants\u2019 motion to vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The portion of the affidavit of defendants\u2019 attorney not quoted above expresses his excuses for his delay of five and a half months before seeking relief under section 473. Since his failure to appear at the trial was held not to have been the result of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise or excusable neglect,\u201d the reason for the subsequent delay is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
