J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvG\">The petitioner herein seeks to restrain the respondent, superior court, from trying him under an information charging him with violation of section 502 of the Vehicle Code, with a prior conviction. The matter presents in general the same issues discussed in <em>Muns </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>in which an opinion was this day filed <em>(ante, </em>p. 728 [290 P.2d 951]). The docket entries in the instant case were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">\u201cDec. 10 Complaint filed charging a misdemeanor. Defendant was arrested\u2014and released on $211.00 bail, for appearance on Dec. 17, 1954 at 10 A. M.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">\u201cDec. 17 Defendant, through his Atty. Ray Manwell, entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a jury trial, Atty. Manwell stated he would waive time limitations. <em>\"</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-12\">\u201cJan. 10 Prior thereto, to wit, on June 15, 1953 said Defendant was convicted in Justice Court, Oroville Twp., County of Butte, of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">\u201cAn amended complaint, signed by Captain Nick Frandrup, Yuba City Police Force is now on file in this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>\u201cPreliminary examination is hereby set for January 13, 1955 at 4 P. M. Ray Manwell, Atty. for Defendant duly notified. <em>\"</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-5\">\u201cJan. 13 Preliminary came on at 4 P. M. John Hauek Dist. Atty. represented the People\u2014Atty. Ray Manwell represented the Defendant\u2014Hollan Jones was sworn in as Reporter. Prior to preliminary the Original Complaint filed on Dec. 10, 1954, was dismissed on motion of Dist. Atty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">\u201cThrough Atty. Manwell, Atty. for Defendant, the preliminary was waived and the Defendant was ordered held to answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201cBail to remain the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">\u201cBail transferred to Co. Clerk Ck. <em>\u00a7226.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">We think this record also, just as we held in <em>Muns </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>when properly construed, shows that the second pleading was filed with the permission of the court. Unlike the second pleading filed in <em>Muns </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>the second pleading filed herein was not entitled as an \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d on its face. The cover sheet however, contained the descriptive words \u201cAmended Complaint\u201d and there was considerable discussion as to whether it bore that designation when filed. We think the point immaterial and will assume that it did not. However, it was designated in the docket entry as an amended complaint and we think it was proffered, received and filed as such and constituted a properly filed amended complaint. It, therefore, superseded the original complaint and, as we held in <em>Muns </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>the order thereafter made purporting to \u201cdismiss\u201d the \u201coriginal complaint\u201d was a nullity. Defendant, having been properly held to answer, is triable in the respondent court upon the charges contained in the amended pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">The alternative writ heretofore issued is discharged. The peremptory writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Peek, J., and Schottky, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Petitioner\u2019s application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 8, 1956.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
