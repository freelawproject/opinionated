J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8y\">Plaintiff was awarded judgment for personal injuries and property damages incurred in a collision of plaintiff\u2019s automobile with one owned by one of the defendants and driven by the other defendant, his minor son. After service of summons on the minor defendant, who was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>over 14 years old, and no appearance by him, on plaintiff\u2019s motion Richard P. B. Tyson was appointed guardian <em>ad litem </em>of said minor defendant. Tyson's motion to be relieved of the guardianship was opposed by plaintiff and denied by the court. Pie appeared and defended. No appeal has been taken from the judgment. It is not in the record on the instant appeal, nor does the date of its entry appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">A minute order, made February 24, entered February 28, 1955, and reading as follows: \u201cIn the matter of the manner or method of paying the fee of the Guardian ad Litem herein, heretofore fixed in the sum of $225.00 on January 20, 1955, plaintiff is ordered to pay said fees as follows: $50.00 forthwith, $50 on March 15, 1955, and the balance on or before April 1, 1955,\u201d is the order from which the instant appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">On March 4, 1955, the guardian <em>ad lit era\u2019s </em>motion to tax costs was heard and, pursuant to stipulation between the parties in open court, a $25 fee for an expert witness was stricken therefrom and \u201cfees of Guardian ad Litem in the sum of $225.00\u201d was added to plaintiff\u2019s cost bill. The court then made its order to that effect and correcting the judgment theretofore entered so that plaintiff\u2019s costs taxed therein be $283.20 instead of $83.20. Written order was made and filed March 9, 1955, and entered March 28, 1955. No appeal has been taken from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Respondent\u2019s contention is that, when plaintiff moved on March 4th that his cost bill and the judgment be amended to include the fee required to be paid by him under the provisions of the minute order of February 24th, he sought and accepted the only benefit that could accrue to him under that order, and thereby he waived his right to appeal therefrom. There having* been no appeal from the judgment as corrected to include the amount of such fee, it is obvious that, if the minute order from which the instant appeal was taken should be reversed, plaintiff\u2019s said judgment would then include $225 costs not paid by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">We agree, for slightly different reasons, that appellant has estopped himself to appeal from the order of February 24th. When he relied upon it as a basis for procuring the inclusion in his cost bill and judgment of a recognition of a right to collect the guardian\u2019s fee from defendant he precluded himself from thereafter taking an inconsistent position and denying his obligation to pay the taxed item.  To quote <em>Schulze </em>v. <em>Schulze, </em>121 Cal.App.2d 75, 83 [262 P.2d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>646] : \u201cThe defendant may not play fast and loose with the court in this fashion. He cannot in one breath say the judgment is valid,\u2014obtain relief thereby; and in the next, say it is invalid. . . . One to whom two inconsistent courses of action are open and who elects to pursue one of them is afterward precluded from pursuing the other.\u201d And to quote from <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Hammarberg, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 872, 879 [230 P.2d 399] : \u201cThese two positions are entirely inconsistent. The courts will not recognize or tolerate such tactics. A party cannot thus \u2018blow hot and cold.\u2019 <em>(McDanels </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co., </em>1 Cal.App.2d 454, 459 [35 P.2d 394, 36 P.2d 829] ; <em>Chaquette </em>v. <em>Ortet, </em>60 Cal. 594, 600.) The courts would be impotent indeed if they were compelled to approve such duplicity. Under elementary principles, even if the point were sound, which it is not, Hammarberg has waived or is estopped from successfully urging it.\u201d  By his motion to have the $225 included in his memorandum of costs and in the judgment as corrected, plaintiff effectively waived his right to appeal from the minute order requiring him to pay the fee of the guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Appellant\u2019s statement in his Reply Brief that \u201c. . . if the court\u2019s order should be reversed ... he would not even hope to support any attempt to collect it from respondent\u201d does not alter the situation. <em>(Schubert </em>v. <em>Reich, </em>36 Cal.2d 298, 300 [223 P.2d 242].)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Because appellant\u2019s right to prosecute this appeal had been waived, we have not considered the questions raised by him as to the court\u2019s right to assess the fees due the guardian <em>ad litem </em>of a minor defendant (possibly insolvent and whereabouts unknown) against a successful plaintiff, at whose instance the guardian was appointed and retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Doran, J., and Ashburn, J. pro tern.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 30, 1955, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 1, 1956.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-11\"> Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
