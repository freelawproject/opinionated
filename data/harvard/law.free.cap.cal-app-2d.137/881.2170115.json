The notice of appeal is from an order \u201cdismissing\u201d the defendant\u2019s said motion. The minute order shows the \u25a0 motion was \u201cdenied\u201d not \u201cdismissed\u201d but we shall disregard this misstatement in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">\u2022The defendant was convicted of violating section 41.07 of Ordinance 77000 (resorting) of the city of Los Angeles, and of section 647, subdivision 5, of the Penal Code. He was granted probation on condition (a) that he serve 30 days in the county jail, and (b) that he commit no similar offense and be a law-abiding citizen. The term of his probation was three years. This probationary period expired without any charge being filed that he had violated the terms of his probation. Thereafter he moved to set aside the verdicts of guilty, enter a plea of not guilty, and dismiss the accusations as provided in Penal Code, section 1203.4. The appellant, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1955), 134 Cal.App.2d 140 [285 P.2d 74], claims that he is entitled to such an order as a matter of right. We do not agree, for he has not brought himself within the requirements of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The notice of motion did not state any grounds for the motion as required by rule 49 of the Los Angeles Municipal Court (p. 15, Rules of the Municipal Courts, County of Los Angeles), which reads in part: \u201cWhenever notice of a motion is given, the notice shall specify the grounds of the motion ...\u201d The importance of this omission is that Penal Code, section 1203.4, entitles a defendant to a dismissal only if he has \u201cfulfilled the conditions of his probation.\u201d One of the conditions of his probation was \u201cDefendant to commit ho similar offense and be a law abiding citizen.\u201d In his notice of motion, the defendant did not state that he had \u201cfulfilled the conditions of his probation.\u201d The rule in question was not waived; in fact, the court stated, \u201cLet the record show the motion is denied solely upon the ground that the defendant has not stated any grounds for his motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Even more important is the fact that the defendant did not: offer any evidence that he had fulfilled the conditions of his probation. While the record shows that no claim of violation of probation was filed against him during his probationary period, yet that is a very different thing from a showing that he had committed no violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">The defendant was .the moving party, and the burden of proving that he had fulfilled the conditions of his probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>was upon him. Code of Civil Procedure, section 1869, provides: \u201cEach party must prove his own affirmative allegations. Evidence need not be given in support of a negative allegation, except when such negative allegation is an essential part of the statement of the right or title on which the cause of action or defense is founded, nor even in such case when the allegation is a denial of the existence of a document, the custody of which belongs to the opposite party.\u201d Code of Civil Procedure, section 1981, provides: \" The party holding the affirmative of the issues must produce the evidence to prove it; therefore, the burden of proof lies on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side.\u201d Penal Code, section 1102, provides: \u201cThe rules of evidence in civil actions are applicable also to criminal actions, except as otherwise provided in this code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Appellant argues that, even though he has the burden of proof, the presumption of innocence and the presumption that the law has been obeyed, are sufficient to compel the court to grant his motion to dismiss. He overlooks the presumptions which operate in respondent\u2019s favor, i.e. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subd. 5), \u201cThat evidence wilfully suppressed would be adverse if produced\u201d; and Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, subd. 6, \u2018 \u2018 That higher evidence would be adverse from inferior being produced.\u201d Appellant could have filed an affidavit or could have testified to facts showing that he had complied with all the conditions of probation, but he suppressed such evidence. The court was entitled to presume it would have been adverse to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">This court held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Minter </em>(1946), 73 Cal.App.2d Supp. 994, 996 [167 P.2d 11], that presumptions are evidence. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Agnew </em>(1940), 16 Cal.2d 655 [107 P.2d 601], the court said at page 662, quoting with approval <em>People </em>v. <em>Le Doux </em>(1909), 155 Cal. 535, 553 [102 P. 517] : \u201cAll presumptions are evidence. Conclusive presumptions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1961, 1962) are not overcome by the presumption of innocence, nor are many disputable presumptions so overcome.\u201d 18 Cal.Jur.2d 536: \u201cA disputable presumption, when called into operation, has the effect of evidence establishing a prima facie case, and operates to shift the burden of introducing evidence. But such a presumption is merely evidence in the case, having no greater or different effect than the testimony of witnesses, and it in no degree changes the rule as to the burden of proof in the sense of the burden of producing a preponderance of evidence. It is still for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>the party having the affirmative of the issue, on the whole evidence, to prove it by a preponderance; the burden is not on the party against whom the presumption operates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In the case at bar we, therefore, have presumptions which operate on each side and we are faced with the familiar proposition that the trial judge decided the motion on conflicting evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">Shaw, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b906-7\">BISHOP, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsK-\">I concur, without approval or disapproval of the proposition that the situation calls for an application of the presumptions of subdivisions 5 and 6 of section 1963. One of the conditions of probation was that the defendant was to serve 30 days in the county jail. The defendant made no showing that this condition of his probation had been fulfilled. His motion (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1003) was properly denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
