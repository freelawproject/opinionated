Appellees sued appellant in a justice court for work and labor performed in 1903, and there obtained a judgment. On appeal to the Superior Court the cause was submitted to the court for trial. Upon the hearing the court found the issues for appellees and entered a judgment against appellant for the sum of $90.50 and costs. This app\u00e9al was then perfected.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-10\" pgmap=\"465\">D. B.

The rule is that in order to take advantage, on appeal, of an improper ruling of the court made during the trial, which does not relate to the pleadings, or does not appear on the face of the judgment, such ruling, with the exception thereto, must be preserved in the bill of exceptions. Martin v. Foulke, 114 Ill., 206; C. &amp; E. I. Ry. Co. v. Schmitz, 211 Ill., 454. We cannot consider the exception to the finding of the court contained in the common law record. Salomon v. Ellison, 102 Ill. App., 419.</p> <p id=\"b466-5\" pgmap=\"466\">The amount endorsed upon the justice summons in this case pursuant to section 20, chapter 79, R. S. Hurd, is $78. Such an endorsement has the same office and effect in a justice court as has the ad damnum in a declaration in a court of record. Each limits the judgment to the amount claimed and interest thereon. The judgment in this case is $90.50. But the error is a technical one, which, if called to the attention of the court on the trial could then have been corrected. This was not done, and thus the court was permitted unwittingly to enter a judgment in an amount largely exceeding the ad damnum on the summons. It is too late to raise this point for the first time in this court. Metropolitan A. Ass\u2019n v. Froiland, 161 Ill., 40; Prairie S. L. Ass\u2019n v. Gorrie, 167 Ill., 419; Wheatley, Buck &amp; Co. v. Savings Bank, 167 Ill., 484; Doubet v. Peoria S. L. &amp; T. Co., 93 Ill. App., 637.</p> <p id=\"b466-6\" pgmap=\"466\">It is unnecessary for us to pass upon the motion to strike the bill of exceptions from the files.</p> <p id=\"b466-7\" pgmap=\"466\">The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b466-8\" pgmap=\"466\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
