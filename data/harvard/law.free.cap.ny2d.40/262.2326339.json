Two beatings within five years are sufficient to establish cruel and inhuman treatment pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 170 of the Domestic Relations Law. <em>(Hessen v Hessen, </em>33 NY2d 406; <em>Rios v Rios, </em>34 AD2d 325, 29 NY2d 840; <em>Cinquemani v Cinquemani, </em>42 AD2d 851; <em>Wenderlich v Wenderlich, </em>34 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>AD2d 726; <em>Melville v Melville, </em>29 AD2d 970; <em>Schapiro v Schapiro, </em>27 AD2d 667; <em>Barnier v Barnier, </em>43 AD2d 568.) II. An indigent wife is entitled to alimony from an employed husband. <em>(Phillips v Phillips, </em>1 AD2d 393, 2 NY2d 742; <em>Kover v Kover, </em>29 NY2d 408; <em>Berlin v Berlin, </em>36 AD2d 763; <em>Dulber v Dulber, </em>29 NY2d 408.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-4\">No appearance for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b291-5\">Gabrielli, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqCM\">In this matrimonial action, plaintiff wife sued for divorce on grounds of \"cruel and inhuman treatment\u201d (Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 170, subd [1]),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> alleging that, within the four-year period of their marriage, her husband had beaten her twice by repeatedly striking her with his hands and causing bruises and black and blue marks on her face, head and body. The first alleged beating occurred just after the parties were married in 1970. Following the second beating in 1974, plaintiff obtained an order of protection from the Family Court at which time she was compelled to move out of the marital residence for fear of her life. Plaintiff testified that her husband frightened and harassed her and made her \"very nervous\u201d to the point of rendering her unable to work. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, the Trial Judge dismissed the complaint, holding that, as a matter of law, two beatings within a four-year period were insufficient grounds for a judgment of divorce. He noted that the wife might have grounds for divorce based upon \"constructive abandonment\u201d (Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 170, subd [2]) but that the action would not accrue until a year of separation had elapsed. We conclude that the Trial Judge erred in dismissing the complaint as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">This case involves more than a single act of violence resulting from momentary anger, \"transient discord\u201d or mere incompatibility (see <em>Johnson v Johnson, </em>43 AD2d 842, affd 36 NY2d 667; <em>Rios v Rios, </em>34 AD2d 325, affd 29 NY2d 840; <em>Hessen v Hessen, </em>33 NY2d 406, 410-411; Single Act as Basis of Divorce or Separation on Grounds of Cruelty, Ann., 7 ALR3d 761). Rather, there is testimony as to two fierce beatings within the brief four-year period of this marriage (cf. <em>Hessen v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Hessen, supra, </em>pp 411-412), the last of such severity that the Family Court-deemed it necessary to grant the wife an order of protection. Even one beating constitutes more than a single act of violence when it is composed of repeated and prolonged acts of physical abuse. Despite his dismissal of the complaint, the Trial Judge found that the wife \"had to flee the [marital] premises for her life and obtain an order of protection.\u201d As we noted in <em>Hessen v Hessen (supra, </em>p 411), \"[objective proof of physical or mental injury to the complainant spouse would certainly be a decisive basis for granting the divorce\u201d. The plaintiff in this case has made out a prima facie case that it would be \"unsafe or improper\u201d for her to cohabit with defendant <em>(Johnson v Johnson, supra; Hessen v Hessen, supra, </em>pp 409-410; <em>Barnier v Barnier, </em>43 AD2d 568). She testified that she was frightened and harassed by defendant who made her \"too nervous to work\u201d, thus raising the issue of harm to her mental as well as physical well being (see <em>Johnson v Johnson, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">As noted in the dissenting opinion at the Appellate Division, it would serve no purpose to require plaintiff to delay her action for divorce until the statutory period for \"constructive abandonment\u201d had elapsed (Domestic Relations Law, \u00a7 170, subd [2]), as suggested by the Trial Judge. It would be pointless to allow this obviously defunct marriage to be needlessly prolonged in light of the evidence of physical abuse and its effect on the physical and mental well being of the plaintiff (see 1 Foster &amp; Freed, Law and the Family, \u00a7 6:11, p 296).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed and the matter remitted for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Chief Judge Breitel and Judges Jasen, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Cooke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">Order reversed, without costs, and a new trial granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> Subdivision (1) of section 170 of the Domestic Relations Law provides that an action for divorce may be maintained on the ground of \"[t]he cruel and inhuman treatment of the plaintiff by the defendant such that the conduct of the defendant so endangers the physical or mental well being of the plaintiff as renders it unsafe or improper for the plaintiff to cohabit with the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
