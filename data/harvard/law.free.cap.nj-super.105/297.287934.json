As to the oral admissions, the voluntariness of these was not challenged by defendant at the trial either by objection addressed to that point or by testimony, although he did testify the written confession was procured by coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> 2. As to the written confession, we find the trial judge by clear implication found the confession voluntary before submitting the issue anew to the jury. <em>Cf. State v. </em>LaPierre, 39 <em>N. J. </em>156, 163 (1963). The trial judge was experienced and undoubtedly was aware of the New Jersey requirement of an initial finding of voluntariness by the judge \u2014 he undoubtedly abstained from statement of the finding on the record because the jury was present, having heard the proofs, as the New Jersey practice then permitted, and still does unless defendant objects. See State <em>v. Broxton, </em>49 <em>N. J. </em>373, 386 (1967). Defendant\u2019s counsel made no point of an absence of such a statement, undoubtedly being satisfied the judge had so ruled implicitly. The case cannot be remanded for an express finding, as was done in <em>State v. LaPierre, supra, </em>because the trial judge has since retired. The fact that the hearing took place in the presence of the jury does not impair any constitutional right of the defendant, no objection having been raised at the trial. <em>Pinto v. Pierce, </em>389 <em>U. S. </em>31, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>192, 19 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>31 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">3. The contention that the evidence did not in fact justify a finding that the confession was voluntary is without merit. In any event, the point is available only on appeal, not by post-conviction procedure. <em>R. R. </em>3:10A-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>4. The argument that the Sex Offender Act denies due process because of absence of a trial-type hearing on the diagnostic report was held without merit in our recent decision in <em>State v. </em>Blanford, 105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>56 <em>(App. Div. </em>1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">5. The contention that defendant was denied a fair hearing in the post-conviction court because denied an adjournment to obtain witnesses is without merit. The further contention that a named witness testified at trial against him without being sworn or subjected to cross-examination is without foundation in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">6. Defendant contends that the report of the diagnostic center was defective in that it does not show a determination from clinical findings that the offender\u2019s conduct was \u201ccharacterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior,\u201d as required by <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:164-5. See <em>State v. </em>Berrios, 91 <em>N. J. Super. </em>444 <em>(App. Div. </em>1966). We find substance in this complaint. While at one point the report states that \u201cthe history of unprovoked attacks suggest the possibility of repetition of such behavior,\u201d and at another, \u201cI consider him capable of continuing similar types of assaults,\u201d the psychological section of the report states : \u201cThere is no indication of repetitive or compulsive sexual trends.\u201d In terms of the statutory criterion, the report must be considered ambiguous, to say the least. The mere conclusion in the report that the defendant comes under the act will not suffice. That conclusion is not a substitute for the finding of the statutory criterion stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We conclude that the diagnostic center should be required now to state definitely and unqualifiedly, and on the basis of the clinical findings originally reported, whether, as of the date of the 1964 examination, defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior.\u201d If the conclusion is in the affirmative the commitment will stand; if in the negative the defendant will be remanded for resentence in the ordinary course, attended by counsel. In our view, the clinical findings first made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>would be consistent with either an affirmative or negative conclusion. Defendant has already had (at sentencing) a court hearing on the adequacy of the findings to justify institutional commitment. See <em>State v. Wingler, </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>161, 179 (1957). All we find lacking is a definitive conclusion in respect of the statutory criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Subject to the remand for the limited purpose stated, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
