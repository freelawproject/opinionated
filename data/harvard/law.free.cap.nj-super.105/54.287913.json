Winslow, </em>97 <em>N. J. Super. </em>238, 244) <em>(Law Div. </em>1968) that there was an adjudication that Joy Downs could not have recovered in an action against Rosemary Di Ionno. However, we find it unnecessary to express any opinion on this question because it is immaterial whether or not there could have been such a recovery. The fact of the matter is that Di lonno\u2019s carrier did settle Downs\u2019 claim aganist Di Ionno for $1,400. The Eund was entitled to the benefit of that settlement even if it be a fact that Downs could not have prevailed in an action against Di Ionno. <em>Cf. Shebell v. Strelecki, </em>104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>139 <em>(App. Div. </em>1969). Since the Downs judgment against Winslow was less than the $1,400 paid to Downs by Di lonno\u2019s carrier, the Eund owes Downs nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Reversed.
