A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AD-\">In a suit by plaintiff Snug Harbor Realty Co. against defendants the First National Bank of Toms River, N. J., and The Trust Company of Ocean County, the trial court, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case and after noting that plaintiff voluntarily abandoned its direct cause of action against the trust company, granted the motion of defendant First National and entered judgment in its favor against plaintiff. The latter appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-12\">The matter is before us on an \u201cAgreed Statement in Lieu of Record\u201d which reveals the following basic facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">Snug Harbor, a construction company, maintained a system under which parties asserting claims against it would submit invoices which were then given to its superintendent, Joseph Magee, for investigation. It was Magee\u2019s responsibility to make the necessary inspection and, upon being satisfied that the alleged work was done or materials furnished, to initial the invoices and forward them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>company\u2019s bookkeeper for verification of the contract obligations and the preparation of checks payable to the claimants. Checks drawn on First National were then signed by the company\u2019s authorized official. Certain checks were picked up by Magee for delivery to the respective payees who authorized the \u201cpick-up.\u201d Between January 10, 1964 and August 13, 1965, Magee converted to his own personal use 133 checks, totaling $27,516.27, by forging the endorsements of the payees and cashing the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">The trial court found as a matter of law that a provision of the Uniform Commercial Code was \u201cdispositive\u201d and, accordingly, that the bank should be relieved of any liability to plaintiff. The pertinent section of the Code, <em>N. J. S. </em>12A :3-405 (1) (c), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201c(1) An indorsement by any person in the name of a named payee is effective if * * * (c) an agent or employee of the maker or drawer has supplied him with the name of the payee intending the latter to have no such interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">We find, in the circumstances here presented, that plaintiff proved a <em>primet facie </em>case and that the cited Code provision is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Magee, an unfaithful employee of the construction company, did not supply to his employer \u201cthe name of the payee intending the latter to have no such interest.\u201d To the contrary, the payees were <em>bona fide </em>creditors of the company who had respectively submitted their invoices for work performed or materials furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">It is thus plain that judgment was improvidently entered. The matter should proceed to a plenary hearing for a judicial determination of the merits of plaintiff\u2019s complaint in light of any defenses appropriately raised by the defendant bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Since there will he a new trial, we deem it advisable to briefly comment upon a collateral issue raised in defendant\u2019s brief. It is argued that the trial judge erred in excluding the testimony of a lay witness as incompetent to give an opinion as to an alleged forgery. We find nothing in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>agreed statement of facts to indicate an abuse of judicial discretion. In <em>Storm v. Hansen, </em>41 <em>N. J. Super. </em>249, 254 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), there were distinguishing circumstances, but our observation in that case is here pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cOpinions as to the genuiness o\u00ed handwriting are, at best, weak and unsatisfactory evidence and we believe such proofs should be received only from one whose qualifications have been established strictly in accordance with our precedents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">See <em>Rule of Evidence </em>56 (1). <em>Cf. Morrone v. Morrone, </em>44 <em>N. J. Super. </em>305, 312 <em>(App. Div. </em>1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Reversed and remanded for new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
