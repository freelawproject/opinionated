He also appeals from the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\"> We agree with the trial court that since both Mathis and Eantozzi acknowledged that drivers using the Hudson County Boulevard stop at the nearest corner when the lights on the Boulevard are red against them \u2014 a practice which both said they followed \u2014 that practice was appropriately a factor to be considered by the jury in determining the issue of negligence. Accordingly, we find no merit in the claim that it was error to admit testimony as to such custom and usage. 2 <em>Restatement, Torts 2d, </em>\u00a7 295A, <em>p. </em>62 (1965); 2 <em>Harper and James, The Law of Torts, </em>977 <em>et seq. </em>(1956); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Annotation, \u201cCustom or practice of drivers of motor vehicles as affecting question of negligence,\u201d 172 <em>A.

Nor was there prejudicial error, in the circumstances here present, to permit evidence of the custom even though it had not been specifically pleaded. See 38 <em>Am. Jur., Negligence, </em>\u00a7 267, <em>p. </em>957 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">We have examined the trial judge\u2019s charge and, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, find no error therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
