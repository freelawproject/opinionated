Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">Our examination of the evidence in the case satisfies us that the record fully supports the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusion that the two space leasing agreements between plaintiff and APs Cozy Inn. Inc. (Al\u2019s Inn), and plaintiff\u2019s right thereunder, terminated upon the sale of the latter\u2019s tavern business to Rose <em>&amp; </em>Harry James, Inc. (James Inc.). We affirm that conclusion essentially for the reasons stated by Judge Matthews.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>That determination is dispositive not only of the claim asserted by plaintiff against Al\u2019s Inn bnt also of its claim against the other defendants and results in an affirmance of the judgment as to all defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We therefore deem it unnecessary to deal with the questions involving the bulk sale provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code <em>(N. J. S. 12A </em>:6-101, <em>et </em>seq.) discussed in the opinion below except to make the following observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">1. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint was that following the sale of the tavern by Al\u2019s Inn to James Inc., Al\u2019s Inn \u201cfailed or refused to provide space for plaintiff\u2019s music [and cigarette vending] machine [s] at the location [s] set forth in its agreement [s] with plaintiff, or any other location as a result of which plaintiff has suffered damages.\u201d Since the claims thus asserted are based on events occurring after the transfer, plaintiff\u2019s status is not that of a \u201ccreditor\u201d entitled to the benefits of the bulk sale provisions of the Code. See <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:6-109(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\"> 2. The holder of a plenary retail consumption license is not only authorized to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises but also to sell any alcoholic beverages in original containers for consumption off the premises. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>33:1-12. Whether or not a sale of a particular tavern business is subject to the bulk sale provisions of the Code will depend on whether its \u201cprincipal business\u201d is the sale of packaged beverages for off-premises consumption. See <em>N. J. S. </em>12A:6-102(3) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">\u201cThe enterprises subject to this Chapter are all those whose principal business is the sale of merchandise from stock, including those who manufacture what they sell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
