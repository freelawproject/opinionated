Among other things, defendant argues the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the seized evidence. We conclude the closely regulated business exception permitted a warrantless administrative inspection of certain areas of the tractor trailer, but the search turned unlawful when it progressed into unregulated areas without the exigent circumstances required by <em>State v. Pena-Flores, </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>6, 28, 965 A.2d 114 (2009). We reverse the order denying the suppression of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>evidence and, as a result, vacate the judgment of conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The record reveals that at approximately 8:30 a.m. on January 28, 2007, Trooper Michael Budrewicz stopped a tractor trailer driven by defendant on Interstate Highway 78 in Greenwich Township. Trooper Budrewicz was suspicious because it appeared there was tampering with the vehicle USDOT number;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when he entered the number into his computer, it did not correspond with the company name on the side of the vehicle. Trooper Budrewicz activated his sirens and directed defendant to pull over.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Shortly after Trooper Budrewicz exited his vehicle, defendant emerged from the cab, nervously waving his keys and requesting the Trooper to look inside the trailer. The Trooper signaled defendant to remain inside the cab.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Once defendant was back inside the cab, Trooper Budrewicz approached the driver\u2019s side door to speak with him. As he stepped up on the running board, the Trooper could feel it was extremely cold inside the cab, as it was outside, and the windows were noticeably foggy, yet it did not appear defendant was using the heat or defroster. In addition, Trooper Budrewicz detected an \u201coverwhelming\u201d odor of air fresheners and counted roughly twenty of them hanging throughout the cab.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He also observed that defendant appeared nervous and, when asked for his driving documents, defendant turned the truck radio up \u201cextremely loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>After fumbling with his paperwork for a few seconds, defendant provided his driver\u2019s license, social security card, permanent residence card, and log book,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but was unable to produce a bill of lading. According to Trooper Budrewiez, defendant was the first of approximately 2,000 truck drivers he had stopped who could not produce a bill of lading. Trooper Budrewiez returned to his cruiser and began reviewing defendant\u2019s paperwork but, once again, defendant exited the cab and tried to approach. The Trooper again ordered defendant to remain in his vehicle and defendant complied. The log book indicated defendant had driven more than fourteen consecutive hours of drive time without taking at least ten hours of rest in violation of federal regulations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At this point, based on defendant\u2019s \u201cnervousness,\u201d \u201cthe ridiculous odors of air freshener,\u201d defendant\u2019s repeated attempts to exit the cab, defendant\u2019s eagerness \u201cto show ... the trailer,\u201d and the irregularities in the log book, Trooper Budrewiez decided to perform a North American Standard Level II safety inspection of defendant\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Trooper Budrewiez began his Level II inspection by sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the cab and checking the safety belts. He testified that, upon entering the cab, and apparently no longer affected by the overwhelming air freshener odor that had raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>his suspicions, the Trooper \u201cvery quick[ly]\u201d smelled \u201ca strong odor of raw marijuana\u201d coming from the sleeper cabin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He entered the sleeper cabin, \u201clooked back toward the sleeper bunk,\u201d and then into \u201cthe closet that didn\u2019t have a door on it.\u201d Inside the closet, Trooper Budrewicz found a black duffel bag and \u201cstuck [his] nose down to the black duffel ba[g] without even touching it,\u201d whereupon, according to his testimony, he could smell marijuana inside.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Trooper Budrewicz opened the bag and found twenty to twenty-five hermetically sealed freezer bags filled with what appeared to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">After making this discovery, the Trooper arrested defendant, advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> searched him for contraband, and radioed for backup. When backup arrived, Trooper Budrewicz performed a second warrantless search of the vehicle, finding inside the same closet another duffel bag and what was referred to as a rectangular \u201cgenesis box.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He also found two more bags on top of and underneath defendant\u2019s bed. All of these containers held what appeared to be marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The truck was impounded and defendant was transported back to State Police Barracks to be processed. Trooper Mike DelRio read defendant his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, but did not interrogate him, asking only for defendant\u2019s personal information, such as his name, date of birth, residence, and occupation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as Trooper DelRio requested this information, defendant volunteered that the marijuana in the sleeper cabin was placed there by a man he met in Florida. Defendant also told Trooper DelRio he agreed to transport the bags to Connecticut in exchange for $6,000; defendant did not admit he knew the bags were filled with marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Chemical lab tests confirmed the substance seized from defendant\u2019s truck was marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Defendant was indicted for first-degree possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-5(a)(l); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5(b)(10)(a); second-degree conspiracy to possess marijuana with the intent to distribute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:5-2; <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-5(b)(10)(a); and fourth-degree possession of marijuana, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:35-10(a)(3). Before trial, defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from the sleeper cabin. Following a four-day hearing, the trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for reasons set forth in a written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Defendant was tried before a jury over the course of six days in March and April 2008 and found guilty on all counts. The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s post-trial motions. At sentencing, the judge merged the convictions and imposed a ten-year prison term with a four-year period of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Defendant appealed, arguing, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>THE DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT TO BE FREE FROM UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES AS GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ART. I, PAR. <em>1 </em>OF THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION WAS VIOLATED BY THE UNLAWFUL SEARCH AND SEIZURE OF THE PERSONAL PROPERTY CONTAINED IN A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Defendant raised numerous other issues. Because we agree defendant\u2019s suppression motion should have been granted, we need not reach the other issues posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Under both the federal and state constitutions, a warrant-less search is presumptively invalid unless it \u201c \u2018falls within one of the few well-delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pineiro, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>13, 19, 853 A.2d 887 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Maryland, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>471, 482, 771 A.2d 1220 (2001)). Because of our strong preference for warrants issued by impartial magistrates, the State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a warrantless search falls within an established exception. <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 246, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion, the trial judge found defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated because the warrantless search was permitted either by the closely regulated business exception or by the presence of probable cause based upon the Trooper\u2019s assertion that he smelled marijuana in the sleeper cabin.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">For the reasons that follow, we reverse. The Trooper was lawfully permitted to conduct an administrative inspection of the vehicle based on the closely regulated business exception. However, the warrantless search became impermissible once it exceeded the \u201cspatial scope\u201d authorized by regulation. <em>State v. Hewitt, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 386, 947 A.2d 674 (App.Div.2008). Accordingly, we hold that the Trooper was not lawfully permitted to exceed the scope of the administrative inspection absent a warrant or compliance with the standards recently outlined in <em>Pena-Flores </em>regarding motor vehicle searches. There, the Court canvassed the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>law that had developed over decades, 198 <em>N.J. </em>at 21-28, 965 A.2d 114, and concluded that a warrantless motor vehicle search is permitted only when the stop is unexpected, the police possess probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime, and exigent circumstances make it impracticable to seek a warrant, <em>id. </em>at 28, 965 A.2d 114. Although the first two elements were found here, the record does not support a finding of exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The closely regulated business exception has \u201cgenerally been applied to businesses with a \u2018long tradition of close government supervision.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Transit PBA Local 304 v. N.J. Transit Corp., </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>531, 546, 701 A.2d 1243 (1997) (quoting <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 <em>U.S. </em>307, 313, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>1816, 1821, 56 L.Ed.2d 305, 312 (1978)). It is based on the understanding that individuals engaged in pervasively regulated enterprises have a diminished expectation of privacy in their affairs. <em>New York v. Burger, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>691, 700, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2636, 2644, 96 L.Ed.2d 601, 612 (1987); <em>Donovan v. Dewey, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>594, 598-99, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2534, 2538, 69 L.Ed.2d 262, 268-69 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Warrantless inspections of closely regulated businesses, however, must be reasonable. <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 545\u201446, 701 A.2d 1243. The test for reasonableness was announced in <em>Burger, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 702-03, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2646, 96 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 614, and later adopted by our Supreme Court, <em>N.J. Transit, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 545-46, 701 A.2d 1243. In these instances, the State must demonstrate: (1) the existence of a regulatory scheme supported by a substantial government interest; (2) the warrantless inspection will further the regulatory scheme; and (3) the individual received notice of the inspection, and the search was limited in time, place, and scope. <em>Burger, supra, </em>482 <em>U.S. </em>at 702-03, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2646, 96 L.Ed.2d at 614. Ultimately, \u201c[w]hether a search has been conducted in an unreasonable manner is a matter to be determined in the light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>In re Martin, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>295, 314 n. 9, 447 A.2d 1290 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In determining whether a business is closely regulated, the focus falls on \u201cthe pervasiveness and regularity of the ... regulation\u201d and its effect on a business owner\u2019s expectation of privacy. <em>Donovan, supra, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>at 606, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2542, 69 L.Ed.2d at 273. We recently held that the commercial trucking industry is closely regulated, <em>State v. Hewitt, supra, </em>400 <em>N.J.Swper. </em>at 385, 947 A.2d 674, as has every federal court that has considered this issue, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 968 n. 5 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>545 F.3d 1195, 1201-02 (9th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 <em>S.Ct. </em>1383, 173 L.Ed.2d 636 (2009); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>518 F.3d 740, 751 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Castelo, </em>415 F.3d 407, 410 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>363 F.3d 788, 794 (8th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Maldonado, </em>356 F.3d 130, 135 (1st Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Dominguez-Prieto, </em>923 F.2d 464, 468 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 <em>U.S. </em>936, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2063, 114 L.Ed.2d 468 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">For decades, tractor trailers have been subject to extensive federal regulation. <em>See </em>49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7\u00a7 300-399; <em>see also NJ.S.A. </em>39:5B-32; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:60-2.1. These regulations govern a vast array of topics, including, among other things: hours of service, 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 395; necessary parts and accessories, 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 393; driver qualifications, 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 391; record retention, 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 379; and licensing, 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 383. The regulations also purport to authorize warrantless roadside inspections of commercial vehicles to ensure compliance with safety standards. 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 396.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">These regulations contain specifications for sleeper cabins. For example, the regulations contain length, width, and shape requirements for the sleeper cabin and demand that the cabin have at least two access points so that emergency exits are not unduly hindered. 49 <em>C.F.R </em>\u00a7 393.76. The regulations impose bedding requirements and provide that all sleeper cabins not contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>within the driver compartment must contain communication devices between the sleeper cabin and the cockpit. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, truckers may reasonably anticipate administrative inspections for the purpose of ensuring compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We recently considered the application of the <em>Burger </em>test to an administrative inspection. In <em>Hewitt, </em>police stopped a truck for a safety inspection during which an officer suspected the trailer contained a hidden compartment. 400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 381-82, 947 A.2d 674. With a density meter the officer determined the existence of a hidden compartment and with a fiber optic scope he peered inside it. <em>Id. </em>at 382, 947 A.2d 674. The officer was thus able to observe within the hidden compartment a large number of cellophane wrapped packages, which he believed contained contraband. <em>Ibid. </em>The defendant was placed under arrest and his truck impounded; the officers opened the hidden compartment and searched the boxes within, all without first obtaining a warrant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">In upholding the search, we relied upon the closely regulated industry exception and concluded \u201c[t]he administrative regulations under which the search was conducted authorize inspection of every part of the trailer to verily proper securing of the cargo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 947 A.2d 674. We found no reason to give the hidden compartment any enhanced privacy treatment because safety issues could arise from improperly secured cargo within the secret chamber. <em>Ibid. </em>And, although the officer had \u201cacknowledged that his purpose in searching the hidden compartment was to determine whether it contained criminal contraband,\u201d we held an officer\u2019s intent will not invalidate an otherwise permissible administrative search. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 947 A.2d 674. Thus, like our federal counterparts, we have upheld warrantless administrative inspections of the trailer portion of the vehicle. <em>See Steed, supra, </em>548 F.3d at 966-75; <em>Maldonado, supra, </em>356 <em>F.</em>3d at 134-36; <em>United States v. Vasquez-Castillo, </em>258 F.3d 1207, 1210-13 (10th Cir.2001); <em>Dominguez-Prieto, supra, </em>923 F.2d at 467-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The circumstances presented here differ because the Trooper\u2019s search was not concerned with the trailer portion of the vehicle, but focused instead on the sleeper cabin and, even more specifically, a closet within the sleeper cabin and closed containers within that closet. These areas were certainly more private than a cargo hold or, as in <em>Hewitt, </em>a secret compartment attached to a cargo hold. <em>Accord United States v. Knight, </em>306 F.3d 534, 535 (8th Cir.2002) (concluding that the closely regulated business exception does not permit the opening of a truck driver\u2019s briefcase without a warrant during an administrative inspection).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Few cases have considered whether the scope of an administrative inspection could lawfully encompass a search of a tractor trailer\u2019s sleeper cabin. In <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez, supra, </em>363 F.3d at 791-92, the defendant\u2019s tractor trailer was stopped by police who then performed a Level II safety inspection during which one officer entered the sleeper cabin. When the officer observed the beds did not have proper restraints, he opened the storage compartment underneath to see whether the restraints had fallen into a storage compartment. <em>Id. </em>at 792. Inside one of the storage compartments, the officer found sealed packages containing marijuana. <em>Ibid. </em>In finding this search to be reasonable, the court of appeals held the officer was acting within the scope of the administrative inspection when he entered the sleeper cabin to check for safety restraints. <em>Id. </em>at 794. And, because the officer reasonably believed the belts might have fallen into the storage compartment beneath the bed, the court of appeals sustained as reasonable the search for the belts in those compartments. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">New Jersey certainly has an interest in guaranteeing the safety of drivers on its roadways and, to that end, warrantless administrative inspections further that interest by ensuring that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the largest vehicles on our roads are safe for transit and in compliance with established regulations. We thus conclude the Trooper was entitled to conduct an administrative inspection of defendant\u2019s vehicle pursuant to applicable regulations and the purposes for which those regulations were adopted. Ultimately, the legitimacy of a warrantless administrative inspection \u201cis a matter to be determined in the light of the circumstances of the particular case.\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 314 n. 9, 447 A.2d 1290. In deferring to the trial judge\u2019s findings, we conclude that the Level II inspection was permitted and authorized entry into the sleeper cabin since the federal regulations extend that far.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">However, the regulations do not encompass closets or personal belongings located inside a sleeper cabin and, as a result, the closely regulated business exception cannot form the basis for a warrantless search into those areas. Even if we assume Trooper Budrewiez entered the sleeper cabin for the purpose of conducting a safety check, as in <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez, supra, </em>363 F.3d at 791-94, the search inside the cabin\u2019s closet and the opening of the baggage within that closet exceeded the letter and intent of the regulations applicable to sleeper cabins. In short, the search of the cabin\u2019s closet exceeded \u201cthe spatial scope\u201d of the administrative inspection. <em>Hewitt, supra, </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 386, 947 A.2d 674. Unlike the officer\u2019s search of the sleeper cabin in <em>Mendoza-Gonzalez, </em>the search here came untethered from the authority to conduct the administrative inspection because there was no regulatory reason for the Trooper\u2019s search in defendant\u2019s closet or the duffel bag therein. To be lawful, the search into the closet and the duffel bag required some other constitutional underpinning.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The State argues that even if the closely regulated business exception did not give Trooper Budrewiez the right to search through defendant\u2019s closet and containers within that closet, the warrantless search may be upheld because the Trooper obtained sufficient information during the administrative inspection to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>probable cause to search the closet and its contents. That is, the State argues that where the boundaries of the administrative inspection ended probable cause began, and that probable cause was formed when the Trooper detected a strong odor of unbumt marijuana. <em>See, e.g., State v. Nishina, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>502, 515-16, 816 A.2d 153 (2003). This fact, along with the suspicious nature of the cab\u2019s many air fresheners, defendant\u2019s nervous and furtive conduct, and the irregularities in defendant\u2019s log book, according to the State, permitted the continued warrantless search. We reject this contention because it is based on a misunderstanding of the elements necessary to permit a lawful warrantless motor vehicle search.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Our Supreme Court recently held in <em>Pena-Flores </em>that \u201cthe warrantless search of an automobile in New Jersey is permissible where (1) the stop is unexpected; (2) the police have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime; and (3) exigent circumstances exist under which it is impracticable to obtain a warrant.\u201d 198 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 965 A.2d 114. There is no dispute about the first two prongs. The stop was unexpected, and we assume the Trooper\u2019s detection of an odor of unburnt marijuana supported the finding of probable cause.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>State, however, failed to demonstrate the presence of exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">When considering whether an exigency existed to permit a warrantless search, a variety of factors must be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">the time of day; the location of the stop; the nature of the neighborhood; the unfolding of the events establishing probable cause; the ratio of officers to suspects; the existence of confederates who know the location of the car and could remove it or its contents; whether the arrest was observed by passersby who could tamper with the car or its contents; whether it would be safe to leave the car unguarded and, if not, whether the delay that would be caused by obtaining a warrant would place the officers or the evidence at risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 29, 965 A.2d 114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The State had the burden of demonstrating exigent circumstances, <em>id. </em>at 25, 965 A.2d 114, and its failure in this regard is revealed by the Trooper\u2019s testimony. During cross-examination at the suppression hearing, Trooper Budrewicz admitted defendant\u2019s vehicle was incapable of being moved because he was in possession of defendant\u2019s keys; common sense strongly suggested it was not likely another person with another set of keys was in the vicinity. In addition, the Trooper admitted he could have had the vehicle towed to a safe location while he applied for a warrant prior to conducting a search beyond the scope of the administrative inspection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-9\">Q: But you could have towed [the truck] to Perryville station, secured it there, and gotten a warrant, or you could have left it there, or called a detective, or called the [prosecutor\u2019s] office and said I\u2019ve got probable cause to search this thing, get me a warrant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-10\">A: I could have done that but I had plain smell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">And, when asked why he decided to search instead of first obtaining a warrant, the officer insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t need a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>with probable cause.\u201d Again, <em>Pena-Flores </em>requires more than probable cause; exigent circumstances are also required.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The State argues that an exigency existed because of \u201cthe time of day, the remote location of the stop, the number of Troopers at the scene, the discrepancy between the DOT number and the company name on the side of the track, as well as lack of information regarding a second driver and the owner of the truck.\u201d These contentions are wanting; indeed, they actually support defendant\u2019s position. For example, the track was stopped at 8:30 a.m., a time of day that would have made it much easier to seek a warrant than if these events occurred late at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Likewise, the track was stopped on an interstate highway. Although there were likely other vehicles then passing by, the circumstances are not similar to those where a vehicle is stopped in a high crime neighborhood where the accused\u2019s confederates or others hostile to police might congregate and pose a threat. <em>See, e.g., State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>657, 674, 751 A.2d 92 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">There was also no proof that the Trooper was outnumbered. The only persons present during the administrative inspection and the search into the sleeper cabin were the Trooper and defendant; the Trooper did not testify that he felt endangered by the one-to-one ratio of officer-to-suspect or that backup was unavailable. To the contrary, he felt no need to call for backup until after the initial search and after defendant was arrested. And there was no suggestion of a concern that evidence would be lost if the vehicle were left at that location to be searched at a later time although, again, the Trooper testified that nothing prevented the towing of the track to a secure location.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">To summarize, we uphold the administrative inspection of the vehicle\u2019s cab as well as the Trooper\u2019s entry into the sleeper cabin for the purpose of ensuring compliance with federal regulations. We conclude, however, that the permissible administrative inspection could not validly reach into the closet of the sleeper cabin or the duffel bag found in that closet. At that moment, the search exceeded the lawful spatial scope of the administrative inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In deferring to the trial judge\u2019s finding that the Trooper was able to smell raw marijuana in the sleeper cabin, we agree probable cause existed to search further into the sleeper cabin. However, in applying the requirements of <em>Pena-Flores, </em>mere proof of an unexpected vehicle stop and probable cause did not permit a warrantless search beyond the limits of the administrative inspection in the absence of exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">As a result, the evidence seized from the closet in the vehicle\u2019s cabin and the additional evidence seized without a warrant thereafter could not be lawfully used against defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Reversed and remanded for the entry of an order suppressing evidence and for the conducting of a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> Federal regulations require that all commercial vehicles operating in interstate commerce \"register with the [Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration] and receive a USDOT number,\u201d 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 385.301, which must be displayed on the exterior of the commercial vehicle, 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 390.21(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> The Trooper testified that \"[t]he first thing\" he noticed after ascending the running board was \"a pungent smell\u2014a pungent odor of air freshener coming out, overwhelming.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> A tracker\u2019s log book is a catalog of important information about the trip, including gas expenditures and drive time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\"><em> </em>Trooper Budrewiez also later determined defendant's gas receipts did not match the gas expenditure listings in the log book.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> State and federal regulations permit random warrantless safety inspections of commercial vehicles. <em>See </em>49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 31142; 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 396.9, 396.17; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:5B-32; <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:60-2.1.

The search was found reasonable not because of the closely regulated business exception but because defendant consented to the search. <em>Id. </em>at 1205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b262-6\"> In accepting that probable cause existed, a fact defendant does not dispute, we assume the judge found the Trooper credible even though the judge never expressly said that. The judge also never resolved questions surrounding the alleged existence of the slit-open Ziploc bag, despite its significant impact on the Trooper\u2019s credibility. The judge only stated in his written decision on this point the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">[The Trooper\u2019s] testimony indicated that when he opened one of the duffle [sic] bags, one of the shrink-wrapped interior bags had a[t]ear which could have accounted for the strong smell of marijuana. There were several smaller, shrink-wrapped bags inside each of the duffel bags.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">This [c]ourt points out that upon examination of all the bags by the lab technician, none were reported as having a tear. However, the lab technician did testify that he opened each bag to weigh the contents, and would subsequently place tape over the openings which he had made. It is very possible that in the process, tape would cover any tear that may have already been in one of the packages before that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>What the Trooper\u2019s testimony \u201cindicated\u201d does not make it so unless the judge found that testimony credible and, as we have noted, the judge did not say whether he found the Trooper's testimony credible. And the judge also recognized that the lab technician was unable to support the Trooper\u2019s testimony about the open bag. In addition, the judge did not say whether he found the lab technician credible, and offered only a \"possible\u201d explanation for the lack of support for the Trooper\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> The State seems to argue that the smell of marijuana was proof of exigent circumstances, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>Birkenmeier, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>552, 563, 888 A.2d 1283 (2006). There, police made a stop of a vehicle based on a confidential tip that the defendant would be making a large marijuana delivery in Long Branch at a particular time. <em>Id. </em>at 555, 888 A.2d 1283. Events unfolded as forecasted by the informant. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 888 A.2d 1283. When the defendant's vehicle was stopped on its way to Long Branch, an officer saw a laundry tote bag on the seat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>next to defendant and smelled \u201ca very strong odor of marijuana.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court stated that in \"[ajpplying the case-by-case analysis required by <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Dunlap[,][185 </em>N.<em>J. </em>543, 888 A.2d 1278 (2006)] and <em>Cooke </em>here, there is no doubt that [the officer\u2019s] observation of the laundry tote bag on the front passenger\u2019s seat of defendant's car and detection of 'a very strong odor of marijuana' sufficed to provide the probable cause and exigent circumstances needed____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563, 888 A.2d 1283. This statement hardly supports the argument that the smell of marijuana creates exigent circumstances. The <em>Pena-Flores </em>Court, in listing the many types of things that may be relevant to determining ihe presence of exigent circumstances, did not mention the odor of <em>marijuana. </em>198 <em>N.J. at </em>29, 965 A.2d 114. And it is difficult to accept the State's suggestion that the Court in <em>Birkenmeier </em>intended to find an exigency from circumstances that relate only to probable cause, particularly in a case in which the presence of exigent circumstances was not at issue. 185 <em>N.J. </em>at 563 n. 2, 888 A.2d 1283 (observing in a footnote that followed the sentence quoted above that \"[d]efendant never challenged whether exigent circumstances existed in order to trigger the automobile exception\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
