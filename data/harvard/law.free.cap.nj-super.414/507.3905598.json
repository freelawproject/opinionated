We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">Plaintiffs amended complaint, filed June 11, 2003, alleged that between September 1973 and August 1976, he was administered \u201cfive doses of Orimune trivalent vaccine,\u201d an oral polio vaccine, at the offices of his pediatrician in Pennsylvania. The complaint further alleged that American manufactured the Orimune vaccine that \u201ccaused cancer in plaintiff____\u201d The complaint named Cyan-amid, \u201can owned subsidiary of\u2019 American, and Lederle \u201ca wholly-owned division\u201d of American and/or Cyanamid, as defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Plaintiff contended that Orimune \u201cwas improperly manufactured and ... contained contaminants, including ... SV40,\u201d a simian virus. Plaintiff alleged that defendants \u201cmanufactured [the vaccine] without complying with the regulatory mandate and/or [their] report and application for the licensing of Orimune.\u201d Plaintiff sought damages, claiming that Orimune caused him to develop \u201can SV40 cancerous brain tumor.\u201d Defendants filed an answer generally denying plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Also in 2003, plaintiff filed a claim in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, naming the United States as defendant, and seeking relief under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2671-80. Plaintiffs</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">claim ... rest[ed] on the argument that the United States government negligently licensed Lederle to produce Orimune and to release it to the public.

United States, </em>571 F.Supp.2d 615, 616 (E.D.Pa.2007), <em>aff'd, </em>292 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>170 (3d Cir.2008).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In January 2007, the federal district court commenced a bench trial on plaintiffs complaint. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In June 2007, defendants moved in this ease for summary judgment, essentially arguing that plaintiff had failed to identify Orimune as the specific oral polio vaccine that was administered to him decades earlier. In July, before the motion was argued, the federal district court issued its decision. The judge concluded that \u201c[p]laintiff[ ] ha[d] failed to demonstrate ... that SV40 causes cancer ... in humans.\u201d <em>Gannon, supra, </em>571 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 640. Because \u201c[p]laintiff[ ] ... failed to meet [his] burden on the dispositive issues of general and specific causation[,]\u201d the judge entered judgment \u201cin favor of the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 641. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Defendants then supplemented their pending motion for summary judgment in this case by forwarding a copy of the federal district court\u2019s decision to the motion judge. Defendants argued that \u201c[plursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, [p]laintiff[ ] [was] precluded ... from relitigating the issues of causation on which the federal court ha[d] now ruled against [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">On February 14, 2008, the motion judge granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on two grounds. He concluded that \u201cplaintiff! ] \u25a0.. failed to establish a prima facie case as to product identification\u201d because he could not identify who manufactured the vaccine that allegedly caused his cancer. The judge additionally determined that \u201cplaintiff!] [was] precluded from re[ jlitigating all issues that were previously litigated and decided by the Federal Court____\u201d Since general and specific causation were issues decided by that court, the motion judge concluded that plaintiff was collaterally estopped in the present case from litigating those issues again. He dismissed plaintiffs complaint; this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Plaintiff first contends that the judge erred in granting summary judgment to defendants based upon the purported failure to identify their product as the vaccine that caused his cancer. He argues, in essence, that the record contained sufficient evidence such that an issue of disputed fact existed as to the identification of the vaccine administered to him, and, therefore, summary judgment should have been denied. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">When reviewing a grant of \u201csummary judgment, we [employ] the same standard[s] ... [used] by the motion judge.\u201d <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hillside Bottling Co., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 230, 903 A.2d 513 (App.Div.) (citation omitted), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>104, 912 A.2d 1264 (2006). In conducting our review of the motion record, we accord plaintiff the benefit of all the favorable evidence and inferences. <em>See R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins.

Dr. Bender\u2019s office manager was his daughter, Helen. By the time this litigation was filed, both had died and the office files could not be located.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s mother kept an \u201cImmunization and Health Record\u201d (the form). It indicated that plaintiff had received five doses of polio vaccine at Dr. Bender\u2019s office on specific dates between 1973 and 1976. The form was pre-printed and bore Lederle\u2019s name and corporate logo. Under a column denoting \u201cActive Immunizations\u201d was a line listing \u201cPoliomyelitis Vaccine\u201d and three possible vaccine types: \u201cPoliovirus Vaccine, Live[;] Oral, Sabin Strains[;] Orimune\u00ae Trivalent.\u201d Five dates were handwritten in five boxes immediately to the right of this line signifying the dates that plaintiffs first through fifth doses of polio vaccine were adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tered. The form also indicated that plaintiff received a combined vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertusis (DPT) on the same dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Other lines appear on the form for \u201cChest X-ray,\u201d \u201cTuberculin Tests,\u201d and \u201cOther,\u201d under a column denoted as \u201cScreening and Diagnostic Tests.\u201d The following appears below the \u201cTuberculin Tests\u201d line: \u201cTINE TEST\u00ae (Eosenthal Lederle)\u201d; \u201cMantoux Test\u201d; and \u201cOther.\u201d Handwritten next to the Tine test line was a date, \u201c9/20/76,\u201d and the notation, \u201cNeg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Defendants produced a certification from David M. Standiford, who claimed to be district sales manager of the Philadelphia area between 1968 and 1979. Standiford identified the form as a \u201cpromotional\u201d item given to doctors by his sales force, and it \u201cw[as] not intended to be a doctor\u2019s official vaccination record.\u201d Indeed, immediately above Lederle\u2019s name and logo, the form provides that it \u201cw[ould] be useful at school registration time,\u201d or \u201cif you move,\u201d so that it could be \u201cshown ... to your new doctor.\u201d Standiford urged his sales representatives to distribute the forms \u201cwhether the particular doctor purchased Lederle products\u201d or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Standiford identified Frank Blence as the Lederle sales representative who handled the Upper Darby area; Blence had since died. Standiford also recalled that \u201cthere was intense competition among manufacturers to sell vaccines, including oral polio vaccine[s]\u201d during the 1970s. In his deposition, Standiford identified Lederle as the manufacturer of the Tine test for tuberculosis. He also testified that companies other than Lederle made a combined DPT vaccine at the time; but, he could not identify either Wyeth or Pfizer as one of those companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Dr. Bender\u2019s nurse, Mary Alexander, certified that she would administer the vaccine the doctor prescribed, and it would be noted on the patient\u2019s chart. Alexander claimed that the form was \u201cnot the standard medical form that [sh]e used internally in ... [the] office[,]\u201d and that it may have been plaintiffs own personal \u201cvaccine booklet, ... kept by [his] parents as proof of vaccinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>for their child\u2019s school registration.\u201d In the office on the day of their visit, Helen would \u201crecord the vaceination[s] that [the patient] had received in the ... vaccine booklet____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">During deposition, Alexander identified Helen\u2019s handwriting on the form, including the dates plaintiff received his polio vaccines. Alexander \u201cd[id] not know what brand or brands of oral polio vaccine we[re] used in ... [Dr.] Bender\u2019s office to vaccinate patients in the 1970s[,]\u201d and.\u201cc[ould not] identify based on [the form] what brand or brands of oral polio vaccine\u201d plaintiff received.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">In his written decision granting summary judgment, the motion judge concluded that \u201cthe only evidence that plaintiff[] e[ould] point to\u201d regarding product identification was the form. He then framed the question presented as follows: \u201cThe issue is whether the [form\u2019s] reference to \u2018Orimune\u2019 ... established that [plaintiff] received Orimune manufactured by Lederle rather than Wyeth\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s oral polio vaccine.\u201d The judge further noted that the depositions of Alexander and Standiford \u201cprovided reasonable explanations for the lack of identification as to the vaccine administered to ... plaintiff____\u201d He concluded that plaintiff \u201cf[ound] no evidence to rebut ... defendants\u2019] contention\u201d that he \u201cfailed to establish a prima facie case as to product identification____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">We agree with plaintiff that in assessing the record on the issue of product identification, the judge misapplied the standard for summary judgment. Under that standard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYh\">a determination whether there exists a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d of material fact that precludes summary judgment requires the motion judge to consider whether the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, are sufficient to permit a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged disputed issue in favor of the non-moving party. The judge\u2019s function is not himself [or herself] to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\"><em>[Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146 (alteration in original) (quotations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Only \u201c[i]f there exists a single, unavoidable resolution of the alleged disputed issue of fact,\u201d in this ease, whether plaintiff was administered Orimune, is \u201cthat issue ... insufficient to constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of material fact for purposes of <em>Rule </em>4:46-2.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We initially note that defendants never introduced any proof to support the proposition that plaintiff was administered an oral polio vaccine manufactured by either Wyeth or Pfizer. Indeed, in his written decision, the judge stated as undisputed facts that Wyeth was only licensed to sell oral polio vaccine from 1964 to 1974, and, that from 1966 to 1976, Wyeth purchased its vaccine from Pfizer, which also sold its vaccine \u201cindependently\u201d during that time. The motion judge had earlier ordered counsel for Pfizer to search all records for evidence regarding any contact between the company and Dr. Bender.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Counsel advised the judge that no such records existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">It is reasonable to infer from the form, as well as from Standiford\u2019s certification and deposition testimony, that Dr. Bender administered a Tine test, which was only manufactured by defendants, to plaintiff shortly before he received his fifth and final polio vaccination. Additionally, on the same dates that plaintiff received his polio vaccinations, Dr. Bender administered DPT vaccinations to plaintiff, and that the combined DPT vaccination was manufactured at the time by defendants, but not by either Wyeth or Pfizer. Although defendants have denied having any records of sales to Dr. Bender, a reasonable inference may be drawn that Lederle, or its representative, Blence, indeed had contact with the pediatrician\u2019s offices because the form, bearing Lederle\u2019s name and corporate logo and stamped with Dr. Bender\u2019s name, was in plaintiffs mother\u2019s possession. Two specific Lederle products\u2014the Tine test and Orimune\u2014are the only copyrighted products that are named on the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The issue was not, as the motion judge characterized it, whether plaintiff \u201cestablished that [he] received Orimune manufactured by Lederle rather than Wyeth\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s oral polio vaccine.\u201d Instead, properly characterized under <em>Brill\u2019s </em>standard, the issue was whether defendants had marshaled sufficient proof such that there was \u201ca single, unavoidable resolution of the alleged disputed issue of fact\u201d in their favor, or stated another way, whether \u201ca rational factfinder\u201d viewing the above evidence in a \u201clight most favorable to [plaintiff]\u201d could conclude that he received Orimune from Dr. Bender. <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We believe, based upon the evidence detailed above, that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that plaintiff received Orimune from Dr. Bender. Summary judgment on the issue of product identification, therefore, should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">The motion judge additionally granted summary judgment by concluding plaintiff was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of causation in this ease because he \u201chad a full and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate the issue in federal court, and the district court judge \u201cfound the testimony insufficient to preclude entry of judgment on the causation issue[].\u201d Plaintiff contends that the motion judge improperly accorded preclusive effect to the federal district court\u2019s decision, arguing that: 1) collateral estoppel should not apply to \u201crelitigation of an issue in a second proceeding where the burden of persuasion was heavier on that issue in the first proceeding than it would be in the second proceeding\u201d; 2) the motion judge erroneously applied the doctrine based solely on the district court\u2019s opinion, and without regard to the record in this litigation or the fact that neither side in this case had identified their experts for trial; and 3) under all the circumstances presented, application of the doctrine was inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>We begin by reviewing the federal district court\u2019s decision. In that case, after the testimony of plaintiffs causation expert, and that of three defense experts, the federal judge considered the government\u2019s \u201c[mjotion pursuant to <em>\\F.R.C.P.] </em>52(c) for Judgment on Partial Findings as to causation; whether SV40 causes human medulloblastomas and whether it caused [plaintiffs] medulloblastoma.\u201d <em>Gannon, supra, </em>571 F.Supp.2d at 617. Rejecting a number of procedural arguments advanced by plaintiff, the judge concluded that \u201c[p]laintiff[ ] w[as] fully heard on the causation issues. [His] only evidence on these issues came from [his] expert, Dr. Adi Gazdar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The federal judge noted that Gazdar\u2019s opinion\u2014\u201cSV40 played a causal role in the development of [plaintifffs medulloblastoma\u201d\u2014 was based solely \u201con his view of the biological evidence,\u201d because Gazdar conceded in his testimony \u201cthat \u2018the current epidemiology evidence does not support the conclusion that SV40 causes human cancer, let alone medulloblastoma.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622 (quotation omitted). Citing testimony from experts on both sides of the case, the judge further found that \u201c[e]pidemiology is the core discipline used to determine whether an infectious disease agent causes cancer in humans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623 (citation omitted). The judge found that \u201c[n]o virus has ever been determined to cause human cancer without both supporting epidemiological and biological evidence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">In other words, epidemiological and biological evidence are key components to all well-recognized scientific frameworks that examine causation of human diseases. If either epidemiological or biological evidence fails to support a causal connection or is otherwise inconclusive, one cannot conclude with any degree of certainty that a pathogen such as a virus is the cause of a disease such as human cancer. <em>[Id. </em>at 624 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The federal judge continued by examining Gazdar\u2019s biological evidence regarding causation, noting that \u201c[t]he only tests that ... Gazdar conducted to determine whether SV40 was the specific cause of [plaintiffj\u2019s medulloblastoma were ... tests to detect the presence of SV40 DNA in [plaintiffj\u2019s tumor tissue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. The judge found that \u201cGazdar was unable to point to any method<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ology by which the mere detection of SV40 DNA in a tumor is enough to prove specific causation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After examining the specific methodology used, the judge further found that \u201cGazdar\u2019s conclusion that he detected SV40 DNA in [plaintiff]\u2019s tumor ... fails to meet the scientific standards in this field and is inherently unreliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The judge contrasted Gazdar\u2019s testimony with that of the government\u2019s experts, all of whom</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">relied upon the established scientific framework that relies on both epidemiological and biological evidence in determining causality.

Before us, \u201cthey assert[ed] entitlement to summary judgment because no reasonable jury could conclude either that [the plaintiffl\u2019s vaccine contained SV40 or that SV40 causes human cancer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 917 A.2d 286. Noting the favorable inferences to which plaintiff was entitled at that stage of the litigation, <em>id. </em>at 150, 917 A.2d 286 (citing <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146), we affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of summary judgment, holding,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">Regarding the link between SV40 and [the plaintiffl\u2019s tumor, ... one of [the] plaintiff[\u2019]s experts reports finding SV40 in [the plaintiff\u2019s tumor, which is sufficient to establish a jury question, even if the epidemiological evidence on the causation question generally is equivocal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\"><em>[Rivard, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 151, 917 A.2d 286.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-11\"><em>See also Glastetter v.

He carefully assessed Gazdar\u2019s methodology, including the process by which he determined SV40 DNA was actually present in plaintiff\u2019s tumor. He concluded that the methodology was flawed, and possibly resulted in tainted samples. In the end, the district court judge found Gazdar\u2019s biological evidence to be \u201cinherently unreliable.\u201d A careful review of the opinion does not lead to a conclusion that the district court judge imposed a heavier burden of proof upon plaintiff. We therefore must reject plaintiffs argument in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Nevertheless, we are compelled to reverse the grant of summary judgment to defendants and remand the matter for further proceedings. We do so because the motion record as presented to the judge, and in turn, the appellate record as presented to us, do not permit consideration of whether \u201c[o]ther compelling circumstances make it appropriate that [plaintiff] be permitted to relitigate the issue.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>\u00a7 29(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The commentary to \u00a7 29 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>j. <em>Other circumstances. </em>The circumstances specified in this Section are illustrative rather than definitive of those that may be considered in determining application of issue preclusion. Important among such other circumstances is the disclosure that the prior determination was plainly wrong or that new evidence has become available that could likely lead to a different result. It is unnecessary that the party seeking to avoid preclusion show, as he must in seeking to set aside a judgment, that the evidence could not have been discovered with due diligence; the question is not whether a prior determination should be set aside but whether it should be treated as conclusive for further purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">Illustration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">9. C engages in conduct resulting in damage to the property of A and B that is stored in the same location. In A\u2019s action against C for damages, a key witness for C on the issue of C\u2019s negligence is unavailable. Judgment is for A. In B\u2019s subsequent action for his damage, C may be permitted to relitigate the issue of negligence upon a showing that the witness can be available at trial of the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">As noted above, defendants supplemented their original summary judgment motion, based on product identification, by simply forwarding the federal district court\u2019s decision to the judge. Plaintiff properly points out that defendants\u2019 motion was made without citation to the record that actually exists in this litigation. He notes by example, therefore, that the motion judge did not evaluate plaintiff\u2019s expert reports. Indeed, plaintiff asserts, and defendants have not denied, that experts have not yet been identified by the parties. Certainly the record before us does not allow our independent review of the proof plaintiff intends to marshal in this litigation to prove the essential issue of causation; perhaps it will be the same evidence he used in the federal district court case. Or, plaintiff may have conducted new tests that do not pose the issue of tainted results or he may have developed additional evidence of causation. The point is, the motion judge never considered the issue and we are not in any position to evaluate the adequacy of plaintiffs proof because the appellate record is bare in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The lack of a motion record in this ease also does not permit us to consider another reason why collateral estoppel may or may not equitably apply in this ease. <em>The Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>\u00a7 29(4) provides that collateral estoppel should not apply between different parties when \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>determination relied on as preclusive was itself inconsistent with another determination of the same issue----\u201d Neither party dis-</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">cussed this exception in their briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The commentary to \u00a7 29(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">f. <em>Inconsistent prior determination. </em>Giving a prior determination of an issue conclusive effect in subsequent litigation is justified not merely as avoiding further costs of litigation but also by underlying confidence that the result reached is substantially correct. Where a determination relied on as preclusive is itself inconsistent with some other adjudication of the same issue, that confidence is generally unwarranted. <em>The inference, rather, is that the outcomes may have been based on equally reasonable resolutions of doubt as to the probative strength of the evidence or the appropriate application of a legal rule to the evidence. </em>That such a doubtful determination has been given effect in the action in which it was reached does not require that it be given effect against the party in litigation against another adversary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The commentators of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, </em>cited the case of <em>State Farm, Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Century Home Components, Inc., 275 Or. </em>97, 550 P.2d 1185 (1976), as illustrative of this principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">In that case, inconsistent jury verdicts had been reached on various claims brought by a number of plaintiffs alleging that fire damage to their property was caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 1187. The plaintiff in the current litigation, not a party in any prior litigation against- the defendant, sought to utilize prior adjudications of negligence as preclusive proof against the defendant in its case. <em>Id. </em>at 1187-88. Concluding that estoppel should not apply, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">Those courts and commentators which have considered the question are in virtually unanimous agreement that where outstanding determinations are actually inconsistent on the matter sought to be precluded, it would be patently unfair to estop a party by the judgment it lost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">[W]here there are extant determinations that are inconsistent on the matter in issue, it is a strong indication that the application of collateral estoppel would work an injustice.

There, the plaintiff sued the defendant drug manufacturer alleging that its product, DES, used by her mother during pregnancy, caused the development of her cancer. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 549 A.2d 437.

But, in setting forth their limitations on the use of collateral estoppel in general, the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a728 and 29 make no distinction between offensive or defensive collateral estoppel. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, </em>\u00a7 29, Reporter\u2019s Notes: \u00a7 88, Tent.

And, in particular, the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments </em>makes no distinction in recognizing that issue preclusion is inappropriate when there are inconsistencies between prior determinations of the issue sought to be precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The motion judge in this case was also the motion judge whose decision we affirmed in <em>Rivard; his </em>decision in that case is part of the appellate record.

To that extent, that determination is inconsistent with the determination made by the federal district court on the issue of causation.
