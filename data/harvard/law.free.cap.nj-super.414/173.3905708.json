Martino and Melissa Boos<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from a $1,000,000 jury verdict following a verbal threshold, damages-only trial. The primary question on appeal is whether clearly inappropriate statements about the defense made by plaintiffs counsel in his opening statement and summation warrant a new trial. Those statements included derisive comments about defendants, their counsel, and their expert witnesses, as well as counsel\u2019s request that the jury \u201csend a message\u201d through its verdict. Because we conclude that counsel\u2019s conduct infected the jury\u2019s verdict, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">On August 2, 2004, plaintiff Barbara Szczeeina<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and defendant Joseph J. Martino were the drivers of two cars involved in a three-car accident. She and her passenger son, David Johnson, filed separate lawsuits seeking damages for personal injuries sustained in the accident. At the non-binding arbitration involving plaintiffs claim, Martino was found one hundred percent responsible for the accident, and plaintiff was awarded $65,000. Martino filed a request for a trial de novo. After both remaining defendants stipulated to liability, the two cases were tried simultaneously on the issue of damages, including the verbal threshold. During deliberations, Johnson settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Plaintiff was fifty-six years old at the time of the accident. She alleged injuries to her left hand and neck, as well as injuries to her back for which she received numerous epidural injections. Defendants argued that her hand and neck complaints had resolved before trial, and that plaintiffs back pain was neither permanent nor related to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The primary contested issue at trial was whether there was a causal relationship between plaintiffs alleged back pain and the accident. In support of their position that it was not, defendants pointed to the fact that there was no documented complaint by plaintiff about back pain until many months after the accident. Plaintiff complained of back pain at a visit with her chiropractor on March 16, 2005, and first mentioned back pain to her orthopedist on September 2, 2005. Defendants also pointed to the facts that, on the night of the accident, no x-rays of plaintiffs back were taken in the hospital, and the hospital records do not mention back problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Defendants pointed to the testimony of plaintiffs pain management specialist, Dr. Lipsky, that there were arthritic changes in her back. Plaintiff first saw Dr. Lipsky on March 16, 2005, but he did not treat her between May 2005 and November 2006. In November 2006, plaintiff received three epidural injections. In January 2007, plaintiff experienced a different type of back pain. Dr. Lipsky testified that the later-occurring low back pain was \u201crelated more to the facet joints and the inflammatory changes around the epidural space and less to inflammation of the nerve root\u201d and that plaintiff had \u201cless referred pain to the leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Plaintiff contended that at the hospital she complained about back pain, and that someone \u201cwrote something down,\u201d but she did not know \u201cwhat they wrote down.\u201d Plaintiff testified that at her first visit with her orthopedist she told him about her back pain, but she speculated that he never wrote it down because she thought \u201che was more concerned with [her] hand and he was in the process of moving his offices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>On December 11, 2008, the jury returned a verdict of $1,000,000 in favor of plaintiff, unanimously finding that the accident proximately caused her injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 6, 2009, the trial judge denied defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial or, alternatively, for a remittitur. Defendants argued, among other things, that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and was improperly affected by the comments made by plaintiffs counsel during opening and closing arguments. In denying the motion, the judge found that \u201c[wjhile counsel may have made a few comments that should not be encouraged, there is no indication that these few comments prejudiced defendants to such an extent that they are entitled to a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">On appeal, defendants contend that plaintiffs counsel overstepped the bounds of appropriate trial advocacy which, they contend, led to an unjust result. They also argue that plaintiff failed to prove a permanent injury as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, that the damage award was excessive, that a remittitur was warranted, and that the trial judge erred by not amending the judgment to remove Boos as a liable defendant because she had no involvement in causing the accident and there' was no agency. Finally, defendants contend that the trial court erred by not granting the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">We begin our analysis by focusing on the statements made by plaintiffs counsel. In addition to being excessively argumentative, his opening statement attacked the integrity of defendants, defense counsel and the defense witnesses. Even more inappropriately, plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the jury to \u201csend a message\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to accept that the paid agreers, the spin doctors[,] are trying to get [defendants] off the hook.\u201d His summation, which can appropriately contain argument to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>was inappropriate in this case because it continued additional inflammatory attacks on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u201cThe fundamental purpose of opening statements is \u2018 \u201cto do no more than inform the jury in a general way of the nature of the action and the basic factual hypothesis projected, so that they may be better prepared to understand the evidence.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Amaru v. Stratton, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 15, 506 A.2d 1225 (App.Div.1985) (quoting <em>Passaic Valley Sewerage Comm\u2019rs v. Geo. M. Brewster &amp; Son, Inc., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>595, 605, 161 A.2d 503 (1960) (quoting <em>Farkas v. Middlesex County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders, </em>49 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 367-68, 139 A.2d 779 (App.Div.1958))). Counsel \u201cmust be summary and succinct\u201d and \u201c[njothing must be said which the lawyer knows cannot in fact be proved or is legally inadmissible.\u201d <em>Passaic Valley, supra, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 161 A.2d 503 (citing <em>Paxton v. Misiuk, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 20, 148 A.2d 217 (App.Div.1959), <em>aff'd, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>453, 170 A.2d 16 (1961); <em>Shafer v. H.B. Thomas Co., </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 26, 146 A.2d 483 (App.Div.1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In addition, it is improper for an attorney to make derisive statements about parties, their counsel, or their witnesses. In <em>Rodd v. Raritan Radiologic Associates, P.A., </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>154, 171-72, 860 A.2d 1003 (App.Div.2004), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">Although attorneys are given broad latitude in summation, they may not use disparaging language to discredit the opposing party, or witness, <em>Henker v. Preybylowski, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>513, 518-19, 524 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1987); <em>Geler v. Akawie, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 470-71, 818 A.2d 402 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>223, 827 A.2d 290 (2003), or accuse a party\u2019s attorney of wanting the jury to evaluate the evidence unfairly, of trying to deceive the jury, or of deliberately distorting the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\"><em>Rodd </em>was a medical malpractice case in which the plaintiffs counsel argued in summation \u201cthat [the] defendant missed the evidence of cancer because he eared more about \u2018making money1 and living \u2018the good life\u2019____\u201d <em>Rodd, supra, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 171, 860 A.2d 1003. The plaintiffs counsel continued by \u201cdisparaging defendant\u2019s expert, who, he maintained, argued \u2018a little bit more like a lawyer than a doctor\u2019 and was \u2018a professional witness\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>who \u2018adjusted] his testimony for every case.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThese comments remained uncorrected by the trial judge.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The <em>Rodd </em>court found these comments were \u201cunduly harsh and amounted to an attack on defendant\u2019s character and his witness\u2019s integrity.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThey occupy no rightful place in proper commentary on the evidence and the credibility of testimony. They are not to be repeated on retrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 860 A.2d 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In <em>Geler, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 467, 818 A.2d 402, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">We have likewise held that \u201c[a]n attack by counsel upon a litigant\u2019s character or morals, when they are not in issue, is a particularly reprehensible type of impropriety.\u201d <em>Paxton v. Misiuk, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 22, 148 A.2d 217 (App.Div.1959), aff<em>'d, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>453, 170 A.2d 16 (1961). Nor can parties and witnesses be made the target of invective and derogation. <em>Henker, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518-19, 524 A.2d 455. Reasoned analysis of the evidence and the credibility of testimony is one thing; wholesale disparagement through an unrestricted deluge of epithets is another. <em>Ibid. See also Tabor v. O\u2019Grady, </em>59 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 340\u201441, 157 A.2d 701 (App.Div.1960), <em>mod. on other grounds, </em>61 <em>N.J.Super. </em>446, 161 A.2d 267 (App.Div.1960). This is so, because of the tendency of such comments \u201cto instill in the minds of the jury impressions not founded upon the evidence.\u201d <em>Botta [v. Brunner], </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>[82,] 98, 138 A.2d 713 [(1958)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In <em>Geler, </em>the plaintiffs counsel \u201cfilled his closing argument with derisive and derogatory comments regarding defendants, their counsel, their witnesses and their evidence in general.\u201d <em>Geler, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 468, 818 A.2d 402. The defendants\u2019 case was described as \u201cdesigned \u2018[t]o confuse, to muddle, put up smoke screens\u2019 ... designed to throw the jury \u2018off track.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">In <em>Henker, supra, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 518, 524 A.2d 455, the \u201c[plaintiffs\u2019 attorney used defendant\u2019s attorney as a target of repeated invectives.\u201d He accused the defendant\u2019s attorney of \u201cwanting the jury to evaluate the evidence unfairly, of trying to deceive the jury, of deliberately distorting the evidence, of playing \u2018a game\u2019____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In reversing the jury\u2019s verdict and remanding for a new trial we observed: \u201cPerhaps none of these comments standing alone is out of bounds, but taken together they represent a deliberate effort by plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to have the jurors see themselves as destroyers of evil forces, personified by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>and his attorney, that have been depriving his clients of justice.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">In <em>Jackowitz v. Lang, </em>408 <em>N.J.Super. </em>495, 508, 975 A.2d 531 (App.Div.2009), we considered the propriety of \u201csend a message\u201d arguments in a verbal threshold, damages-only trial. In that case, a jury awarded the plaintiff $50,000 in compensatory damages, a motion for a new trial was granted, and the new trial resulted in a verdict of no cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 502-03, 975 A.2d 531. In affirming, we concluded \u201cthat the use of the \u2018sending a message\u2019 argument is inappropriate in a civil ease where the only issue is compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 975 A.2d 531. \u201cThe caselaw informs us that the use of a \u2018send a message\u2019 argument is clearly inappropriate in criminal cases, may be inappropriate in punitive damage cases and is clearly inappropriate in civil compensatory damage cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 975 A.2d 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Here, it was inappropriate to ask the jury to \u201csend a message\u201d that \u201c[wje\u2019re not going to accept that the paid agreers, the spin doctors[J are trying to get you off the hook.\u201d Plaintiffs counsel repeatedly overstepped the bounds of permissible comment. He said the defense \u201cgame plan\u201d was to have a spokesman,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defense lawyer, get \u201cspin doctors\u201d and pay them to blame plaintiff and \u201cmuddy up the waters.\u201d Counsel referred to \u201cspin doctors\u201d thirty-eight times, said \u201cpaid agreers\u201d on four occasions, called defense counsel \u201cspokesman\u201d thirteen times, used the term \u201cgame plan\u201d on seven occasions, referred to the medical defense witnesses as a \u201ctag team\u201d and \u201chired guns,\u201d and accused them of intentionally muddying up the waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">To put the impropriety of counsel\u2019s conduct in context, we quote at length from his opening and closing statements. Counsel made the following remarks during his opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>You know, years ago there was a television show, there was a guy there, Flip Wilson. ... And what was Flip Wilson\u2019s famous line? \u201cThe devil made me do it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">Well, since that started on television, think about what\u2019s happened in society. We\u2019ve got now people who don\u2019t want to accept responsibility for what they\u2019ve done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">Plaxieo Burris ... goes into [a] nightclub. He\u2019s got a gun with him ... he shoots his leg____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">He\u2019s not licensed to carry a firearm. He broke the rules. He\u2019s not supposed to carry a firearm in New York. He broke the rules____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">But what\u2019s the first thing that happens? ... He\u2019s got to get himself a spokesman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-10\">Responsibility, is he accepting responsibility? The devil made me do it. What\u2019s he do? He gets a spokesman, the American way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-11\">So what we have [here], we have Mr. Martino, what\u2019s he do? He gets himself a spokesman____ [H]e\u2019s got [d]efense counsel____ He\u2019s a spokesman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-12\">[P]eople in Hollywood, oh, my God a spokesman for Britney Spears, a spokesman for Paris Hilton. Everybody has got spokesmen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-13\">So in this lawsuit we have [a] spokesman. You\u2019ve got to figure out how we are going to deal with this. Well, what are we dealing with? Mr. Martino broke the rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-14\">He\u2019s not turning around and saying I caused the collision, these people got hurt, I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-15\">So we\u2019ve got to figure out a way for Mr. Martino\u2014let\u2019s deflect this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-16\">What do we do about this? Well, you know, spokesmen go out and the spokesmen turn around and\u2014new phrase. What do they do? They get spin doctors____ They turn around and they\u2019ve got to go to the spin room____ And they\u2019ve got to spin it the way it makes it look best for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-19\">So okay, what does Mr. Martino need? He needs spin doctors. And literally they go out and they get spin doctors. They\u2019ve got some folks that are going to come and they\u2019re going to try tell you to spin this</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-20\">So how do we spin this says Mr. Martino. Let\u2019s spin it, so that we have our spokesman get some spin doctors who get some doctors to come in and try to explain this away. This can be our game plan. This could work for us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>So let\u2019s see. We\u2019ve got Dr. Goldstone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">[H]e has himself down as a consultant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">So the first conductor in the game plan is well let\u2019s get Dr. Goldstone____ He\u2019s only a [d]efense spin doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">[During a particular period, plaintiff is] getting what\u2019s called the conservative treatment. So the spin doctors, how do we play with this? Ah-hah. I know what we can do____ Let\u2019s muddy up the waters a bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">So now we start, and we\u2019ve got the water clouding up, and we\u2019ve got the spin doctor working on it, so we got\u2014hmm, let\u2019s make it so it\u2019s not clear. Let\u2019s do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">So we have Goldstone. What\u2019s the spin? Ah, let\u2019s shift the blame____ So we got him [Goldstone] trying to muddy the water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">So we\u2019re down to the situation where you\u2019ve got the spin doctor with [his] game plan. You\u2019ve got the spin doctor Goldstone, okay, so you know what we need? We need to get another doctor here. And they go through their list and they find Dr. Willner. Dr. Willner is listed as Bergen Neurology Consultants. You know what consultants are, right? Paid agreers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">So he\u2019s going to get in here and he says well, you know, she could bend 90 degrees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">But the spin doctor has to turn around and make that into something nefarious, something wrong, something that she\u2019s a malingerer or something. So he\u2019s going to come in and he\u2019s going to turn around. And they come up with a plan with him, the neurologist, the nerve doctor. How do we spin this, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-14\">So let\u2019s spin it. Spin it some more. Oh, my gosh. Look at this. We\u2019ve got it spun around.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-15\">What\u2019s the spin doctor going to say about somebody who complains? Think about it. What\u2014if you were there and you\u2019re the spin doctor you\u2019re going to turn around and say hmm, she exaggerates. She\u2019s exaggerating the significance and permanency of her injuries that she\u2019s had to her lower back. Again it\u2019s getting darker and darker____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">Do you get the picture now? The spin doctors turn around and say yeah, I caused the accident, but I didn\u2019t cause these injuries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-17\">So our spin doctors ... all they\u2019re trying to do is muddy up the water____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>So what do we do? You know, we better get another spin doctor. The next spin doctor is ... Dr. Noble____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">He\u2019s paid\u2014I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019s retained to come and spin this [reading the Aims].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">The [d]efense has gotten a spokesman and the [d]efense spokesman goes and gets spin doctors. And now they have taken something that should be crystal clear and they\u2019re spinning it to create doubt in your mind. They\u2019re spinning it----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">So what do we have? We\u2019ve got the spin doctors coming in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">We know who caused the accident because they already admitted it----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">But you know what? He doesn\u2019t want to accept the responsibility---- They\u2019ve gone too far. They\u2019ve got their spokesman to get their spin doctors. The bottom line is Mr. Martino broke the rules. He doesn\u2019t want to accept the responsibility.... He has his lawyers figure out how to try to get him out of the responsibility. They get the spin doctors in here. And Mr. Martino broke the rules. He\u2019s found a bunch of agreers to put the blame on [plaintiff].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">[W]e\u2019re going to ask you to send a message to him that says, [plaintiff], we agree that people are responsible for what they do, that people have to bear responsibility for their actions. We\u2019re not going to accept the devil made me do it. We\u2019re not going to accept that the paid agreers, the spin doctors are trying to get you off the hook. We\u2019re going to ask you to send a message and send that message loud and clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">In addition, plaintiffs counsel said the following in summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-14\">[I]f you remember, awhile ago we had told you what was going <em>to </em>happen, what they were going to do and that they were going to try to cloud the issues____ I told you it was coming____ Mr. Martino decided that he was going to defend this case in the manner that was chosen by ... getting a spokesman or a handler____ And the folks over at [defense counsel\u2019s] office ... they come in and they say, \u201cHmm, we\u2019re going to get ourselves a known quantity.\u201d ...

And integral to their game plan was to get these agree-ers on their side____ [TJhey\u2019re playing a game with this.

Keep on having folks come in here and say that this is degenerative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">[B]e careful when you\u2019re going through your deliberations that you don\u2019t turn into the types of agree-ers who have the callousness to obfuscate what the truth is____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We note that at trial defense counsel made no objections to the portions of the opening statement and summation about which defendants now complain on appeal. Where defense counsel has not objected, we generally will not reverse unless plain error is shown. <em>Rule </em>2:10-2 reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">Any error or omission shall be disregarded by the appellate court unless it is of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result, but the appellate court may, in the interests of justice, notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial or appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The possibility of an unjust result must be sufficient \u201cto raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Despite the failure to object, we cannot simply overlook the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, who unwarrantedly and inappropriately accused the entire defense of spinning the evidence. The conduct was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Our careful review of the record leads us to the conclusion that the egregious nature of counsel\u2019s conduct, occurring in a case in which there was a real question as to whether plaintiffs back injuries were caused by the accident and in which treatment was relatively conservative, raises, at the very least, a reasonable doubt as to whether the jury\u2019s million-dollar verdict resulted from the misconduct rather than from the merits of the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>though we base our decision on the overall misconduct, counsel\u2019s invitation to the jury to \u201csend a message\u201d is particularly troubling. While we are cognizant of the fact that the trial judge gave the usual cautionary instructions to the jury about the arguments of counsel, we are firmly of the view that the pervasive nature of the misconduct here was not cured by those admonitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial judge had an affirmative duty to intervene on his own initiative. It is the responsibility of the judge to ensure that a fair trial is received by the parties, notwithstanding that counsel fails to object. <em>Hitchman v. Nagy, </em>382 <em>N.J.Super. </em>433, 453, 889 A.2d 1066 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>600, 897 A.2d 1056 (2006). As we said in <em>Hitchman, </em>\u201c[o]ur courts have long rejected the arbitrary and artificial methods of the pure adversary system of litigation which regards the lawyers as players and the judge as a mere umpire whose only duty is to determine whether infractions of the rules of the game have been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451, 889 A.2d 1066 (internal quotations omitted). We should not be understood to imply that a trial judge should interfere generally with trial tactics employed by counsel when there is no objection. We appreciate the importance of letting the attorneys \u201ctry their own cases.\u201d However, when counsel engages in patently inappropriate conduct, such as derisive statements and other invectives aimed at opposing parties, counsel or witnesses, or when there is an inappropriate request to \u201csend a message,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial judge should act before the situation reaches the point at which an unjust result is likely or even possible. Attorneys who engage in this type of conduct risk losing a favorable jury verdict, even if there is no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Because we reverse and remand for a new trial on the basis of the inappropriate arguments made by plaintiffs counsel, we do not reach the other arguments made by defendants on appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b203-10\"> Defendant PV Holding Corp. was dismissed prior to trial and is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-11\"> Plaintiff Michael Szczeeina only filed a per quod claim.
