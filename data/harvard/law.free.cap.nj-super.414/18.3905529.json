Defendant Amanda Gallagher moved from New Jersey to Washington in the middle of 2007 and soon thereafter began a romantic relationship with Jacobs. This relationship resulted in the conception of a child, who was born in Washington in June 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">The parties had a tumultuous relationship, which resulted in them filing domestic violence complaints against each other in Washington. There is no need to describe those proceedings except insofar as they relate to custody of their child.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">On March 5, 2009, Jacobs filed a petition for a parenting plan in the Superior Court of Washington. That same day, the court entered an order restraining Gallagher from removing the parties\u2019 child from Washington. Thereafter, the court entered an order for a temporary parenting plan providing for custody and parenting time with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Within a short time after entry of this order, Jacobs and Gallagher reconciled, and on April 20, 2009, the Washington Superior Court dismissed the temporary parenting plan without prejudice. However, less than a month later, on May 17, 2009, Gallagher left Washington with the parties\u2019 child without Jacobs\u2019s consent and moved back to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">The day after she arrived in New Jersey, Gallagher filed a domestic violence complaint against Jacobs which, among other things, sought temporary custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">Two days later, on May 20, 2009, Jacobs moved in Washington Superior Court for an order reinstating the temporary parenting plan he had voluntarily dismissed when he and Gallagher reconciled. The Washington court denied Jacobs\u2019s motion and directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>him to file a petition for a new plan. On June 15, 2009, Jacobs filed a petition in Washington for a new parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Meanwhile, back in New Jersey, Gallagher\u2019s mother and sister, plaintiffs Debra and Amy Dalessio, filed this action against Jacobs and Gallagher seeking custody of the child. Plaintiffs alleged that Jacobs had a \u201clong history of abuse and violence\u201d and had \u201cthreatened ... Gallagher\u2019s life on several occasions.\u201d They also alleged that Gallagher was unable to take care of the child \u201cdue to legal issues!,]\u201d which apparently referred to Gallagher\u2019s incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On June 9, 2009, the Family Part, invoking emergency jurisdiction, entered an order granting temporary custody of the child to the Dalessios, with Gallagher\u2019s consent, but over Jacobs\u2019s objection. Although the court subsequently determined that the domestic violence complaint Gallagher filed against Jacobs in New Jersey had not been substantiated, the order granting the Dalessios temporary custody of the child was continued in effect pending a determination of the issue of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">On September 3, 2009, the Family Part judge conducted a telephone conference with a commissioner of the Washington Superior Court, which confirmed that Jacobs had filed a petition for a new parenting plan that was currently pending in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">After full briefing and argument, the Family Part judge issued a comprehensive written opinion, which determined that Washington has exclusive jurisdiction under the UCCJEA to determine custody of the parties\u2019 child and that the Dalessios\u2019 complaint should be dismissed. Nevertheless, the order continued temporary custody of the child with the Dalessios under the emergency jurisdiction provision of the UCCJEA, pending further action by the Washington Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Gallagher filed a notice of appeal from this order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a motion for stay pending appeal, which was denied by both the trial court and this court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">This appeal is governed by the UCCJEA, which was adopted by New Jersey in 2004 and by Washington in 2001, <em>see Table of Jurisdictions Wherein Act Has Been Adopted </em>(preceding <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-53), to replace the former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-28 to -52 (repealed). We have previously indicated that the UCCJEA \u201cshould be interpreted so as to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict and require cooperation with courts of other states as necessary to ensure that custody determinations are made in the state that can best decide the case.\u201d <em>Griffith v. Tressel, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>128, 138, 925 A.2d 702 (App.Div.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">One of the primary objectives of the UCCJEA was to \u201cprioritize[ ] home state jurisdiction\u201d over other bases for a state assuming jurisdiction of a child custody dispute. <em>UCCJEA, </em>Prefatory Note, 9 (Part IA) <em>U.L.A </em>651 (1999); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 201 cmts. 1 &amp; 2, at 672. This objective was noted in the sponsor\u2019s statement to the legislation by which New Jersey adopted the UCCJEA S. Judiciary Comm., <em>Statement to Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 150 </em>(2004). (\u201c[The UCCJEA] gives priority to the home state as a ground for taking jurisdiction.\u201d) (reprinted following <em>N.J.SA. </em>2A34-53). Therefore, any ambiguity in the UCCJEA should be resolved in light of this legislative objective. <em>See State v. Drury, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>197, 209, 919 A.2d 813 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">The section of the UCCJEA that determines which state has initial child custody jurisdiction provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>a. ... [A] court of this State has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">(1) this State is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within six months before the <em>commencement o\u00ed </em>the proceeding and the child is absent from this State but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">(2) a court of another state does not have jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction ... and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">(a) the child and the child\u2019s parents, or the child and at least one parent ... have a significant connection with this State other than mere physical presence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">(b) substantial evidence is available in this State concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training and personal relationships!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-10\">b. Subsection a. of this section is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for making a child custody determination by a court of this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A.-34-65; <em>Wash. Rev.Code </em>\u00a7 26.27.201.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-13\">Thus, unless the home state declines jurisdiction, a New Jersey court cannot assume \u201csignificant connection\u201d jurisdiction over an initial child custody determination under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(2) if another state has jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(l) either as (1) the child\u2019s home state or (2) the child\u2019s home state within six months prior to the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from the home state but a parent continues to live in that state.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-14\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A-.34-54 and <em>Wash. Rev.Code </em>\u00a7 26.27.021(7) define \u201chome state\u201d as \u201cthe state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.\u201d Under this definition, New Jersey was clearly not the \u201chome state\u201d of the parties\u2019 child when the Dalessios commenced this child custody proceeding on June 9, 2009, because Gallagher had brought the child to New Jersey less than a month earlier, on May 17, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-15\">Nevertheless, Gallagher argues that Washington also was not the child\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d under this definition because, having been in New Jersey for twenty-three days when this action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>brought, the child had not lived with Jacobs in Washington for at least six consecutive months \u201cimmediately before\u201d commencement of this action. Consequently, according to this argument, the jurisdiction to determine custody of the child can be assumed by the New Jersey courts under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34~65(a)(2) because she and the child have a \u201csignificant connection\u201d with New Jersey, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(2)(a), and there is \u201csubstantial evidence ... available in [New Jersey] concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training and personal relationships[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(2)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">We reject this argument because it would effectively read one of the predicates for home state jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(1) out of the statute. Home state jurisdiction is established under this section and its Washington counterpart if a state either \u201c[1] is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, <em>or </em>[2] was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this State but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(1); <em>Wash. Rev.Code </em>\u00a7 26.27.201(l)(a) (emphasis added). The circumstances of the parties\u2019 child fall squarely within the second factual predicate for home state jurisdiction set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(l) and its Washington counterpart. Washington was her home state \u201cwithin six months before the commencement of the [New Jersey] proceeding\u201d\u2014indeed, up to twenty-three days before\u2014and even though she was \u201cabsent from [Washington],\u201d one of her parents, Jacobs, \u201ccontinues to live in [Washington].\u201d The definition of \u201chome state\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-54 cannot reasonably be read to negate the clear intent of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(l) and <em>Wash. Rev.Code </em>\u00a7 26.27.201(l)(a) to confer home state jurisdiction upon Washington in this circumstance, especially in light of the UCCJEA\u2019s objective to \u201cprioritize[ ] home state jurisdiction\u201d over child custody disputes. <em>UCCJEA, supra, </em>Prefatory Note at 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">This conclusion is supported by decisions in other jurisdictions that have interpreted their analogues to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-54 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-65. <em>See, e.g., Welch-Doden v. Roberts, </em>202 Ariz. 201, 42 P.3d 1166, 1169-76 (Ct.App.2002); <em>Stephens v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>331 <em>Mont. </em>40, 128 P.3d 1026, 1028-29 (2006); <em>Christine L. v. Jason L., </em>23 <em>Misc.3d </em>1039, 874 N.Y.S.2d 794, 796-97 (Fam.Ct.2009); <em>Rosen v. Celebrezze, </em>117 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 241, 883 N.E.2d 420, 427-29 (2008); <em>see generally </em>David Carl Minneman, Annotation, <em>Construction and Operation of Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, </em>100 <em>A.L.R.5th </em>1, 23-29 (2002). In <em>Stephens, </em>the court explained the reasons for concluding that the apparent inconsistency between the sections of the UCCJEA codified as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-54 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(1) should be resolved in a manner that gives full effect to both factual predicates for home state jurisdiction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-65(a)(l):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">Considerable confusion has arisen in this matter regarding how to analyze the children\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d for purposes of determining jurisdiction. Such confusion seems understandable in light of the apparent contradictory language set forth in the Montana statutes. [Montana\u2019s version of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(l) ] provides that Montana has jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination if it is the child\u2019s home state \u201cwithin six months before\u201d the commencement of the child custody proceeding. By contrast, \u201chomo state\u201d as defined under [Montana\u2019s version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34r-54] requires a child to have lived in Montana for \u201cat least 6 consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">The drafters intended that the UCCJEA should be construed to promote one of its primary purposes of avoiding the jurisdictional competition and conflict that flows from hearings in competing states when each state substantively reviews subjective factors, such as \u201cbest interest,\u201d for purposes of determining initial jurisdiction. We thus resolve any statutory conflict in the application of home state jurisdiction in a manner consistent with the UCCJEA\u2019s intent of strengthening the certainty of home state jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">As a result, we hold that \u201chome state\u201d for purposes of determining initial jurisdiction under [Montana\u2019s version of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(l)] is not limited to the time period of \u201c6 consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.\u201d The applicable time period to determine \u201chome state\u201d in such circumstances should be \u201cwithin 6 months before the commencement of the [child custody] proceeding.\u201d This interpretation promotes the priority of home state jurisdiction that the drafters of the UCCJEA specifically intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">[128 <em>P.</em>3d at 1028-29 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Applying the same reasoning to this ease, we conclude that Washington has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the custody dispute over the parties\u2019 child because it was \u201cthe home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the [custody proceedings in both Washington and New Jersey] and the child is absent from [Washington] but a parent [Jacobs] ... continues to live in [Washington].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-65(a)(l); <em>Wash. Rev.Code </em>\u00a7 26.27.201(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Gallagher relies heavily upon our decisions in <em>Bless v. Bless, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>90, 723 A.2d 67 (App.Div.1998), and <em>Ganz v. Rust, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 690 A.2d 1113 (App.Div.1997). However, <em>Bless </em>and <em>Ganz </em>were both decided under the UCCJA, which was superseded by the provisions of the UCCJEA, particularly <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-65, which reject the jurisdictional rules that governed child custody disputes under the UCCJA and instead assign priority to home state jurisdiction. <em>See Welch-Doden, supra, </em>42 P.3d at 1174-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Our conclusion that Washington has exclusive home state jurisdiction to determine the dispute concerning the custody of the parties\u2019 child makes it unnecessary to consider the parties\u2019 other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-8\"> The Dalessios did not file a notice of appeal and have not participated in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> Jacobs and Gallagher have entered into a joint custodial arrangement by consent pending the determination of the issue of custody, which is currently scheduled to be heard by the Washington Superior Court this September.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
