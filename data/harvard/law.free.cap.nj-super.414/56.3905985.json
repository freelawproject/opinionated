D.M. appeals, but F.M. does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The issue presented on appeal is whether a parent\u2019s parental rights may be terminated when the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS or Division) fails to prove all prongs of the best interests of the child standard, but nevertheless, the child may suffer serious psychological or emotional harm by severing the bond between the child and his or her foster parents. We conclude that any harm the child may suffer from severing that bond cannot, in and of itself, serve as a legally sufficient basis for termination of the parent\u2019s parental rights. We hold that in such a case, DYFS must still prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parent\u2019s actions or inactions substantially contributed to the forming of that bond to where any harm caused to the child by severing the bond rests at the feet of the parent. Because we find an absence of that proof, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">Because the procedural history and statement of facts were discussed at length in our prior consolidated unreported opinion, <em>Division of Youth &amp; Family Services v. D.M., </em>Nos. A-6125-06 and A-6128-06 (App.Div. August 11, 2008) (slip op. at 2-37), it is unnecessary for us to fully detail them here; rather, a summary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the procedural history and statement of facts will suffice to place this appeal in context. However, before stating that summary, it is appropriate to review the general legal principles governing termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u201c[T]he right of parents to raise their children is a fundamental one of constitutional magnitude.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.L., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605, 926 A.2d 320 (2007). That right, however, is not without limits. <em>In re K.H.O., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 346-47, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999). Rather, the parents\u2019 rights \u201cmust be balanced against \u2018the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>responsibility to protect the welfare of children.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.M., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>261, 294-95, 914 A.2d 1265 (2007) (quoting <em>In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992)). \u201c[Presumptions of parental unfitness may not be used in proceedings challenging parental rights and all doubts must be resolved against termination.\u201d <em>G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 606, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">To terminate parental rights and obtain guardianship of a child who has been placed in foster care, DYFS may file a complaint under <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4C-15(c) alleging that termination is in \u201cthe best interests\u201d of the child, or under subsection 15(d) alleging that the parents abandoned the child. <em>In re Guardianship of K.L.F., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>32, 36-37, 608 A.2d 1327 (1992). Where the complaint is brought under the best interests of the child section of the statute, \u201c[g]uardianship cannot be awarded ... unless the court itself determines that it is in the child\u2019s best interests under <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:4C-20.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 608 A.2d 1327. Such actions require proof by clear and convincing evidence. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. C.M., </em>\u2014 N.J.-,-, A.2d - (2010); (slip op. at 30); <em>N.J.

L.C., </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>435, 439, 788 A.2d 330 (App.Div. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Termination actions brought under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a) are decided under a four-prong \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard, first enunciated by the Court in <em>New Jersey Division of Youth &amp; Family Services v. </em>A.W., 103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 604-11, 512 A.2d 438 (1986), and now codified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a). Under that standard, parental rights may be terminated only when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">(1) The child\u2019s safety, health or development has been or will continue to be endangered by the parental relationship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">(2) The parent is unwilling or unable to eliminate the harm facing the child or is unable or unwilling to provide a safe and stable home for the child and the delay of permanent placement will add to the harm. Such harm may include evidence that separating the child from his resource family parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">(3) The TD]ivision has made reasonable efforts to provide services to help the parent correct the circumstances which led to the child\u2019s placement outside the home and the court has considered alternatives to termination of parental rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">(4) Termination of parental rights will not do more harm than good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">The \u201cfour [prongs] enumerated in the best interests standard are not discrete and separate; they relate to and overlap with one another to provide a comprehensive standard that identifies a child\u2019s best interests.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 348, 736 A.2d 1246. With these principles in mind, we now state the summary of the procedural history and statement of facts leading to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">The Division first became involved with D.M. and her family in June 2004, when it received a referral concerning an alleged incident of domestic violence between D.M. and F.M. During his involvement with D.M., caseworker Nicholas Mangold learned that D.M. suffered from multiple sclerosis and took medication for the illness. She also suffers from severe scoliosis. Athough Mangold responded to several other referrals between June and October 2004, he never substantiated abuse or neglect by either parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">On March 28, 2005, another DYFS caseworker transported D.M. to the Morris County Courthouse to obtain a temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>restraining order against F.M. Because the caseworker observed what she described as D.M. displaying \u201cinappropriate and bizarre behavior,\u201d DYFS removed S.M. from her parents\u2019 care that day. On July 12, 2005, following a fact-finding hearing, the court found that D.M. had placed S.M. at risk for abuse and neglect because of D.M.\u2019s emotional instability and erratic behavior. On the same day, the court ordered DYFS to return S.M. to the family home to the physical custody of D.M.\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">On August 23, 2005, DYFS removed S.M. from the family home a second time after learning that D.M.\u2019s mother had left S.M. in the care of D.M. who DYFS believed was unable to properly care for the child because of health issues. On that day, the court entered an order placing S.M. into foster care with Mr. and Mrs. H., where S.M. has remained since. Mr. and Mrs. H. have three children: two girls, ages nine and eleven; and a boy, age five.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">On August 23, 2006, DYFS filed a guardianship complaint seeking to terminate the parents\u2019 parental rights. The matter was tried over four days in May 2007. Much of the case centered around the parties\u2019 experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Dr. Rachel Jewelewicz-Nelson, a psychologist, testified on behalf of DYFS. Dr. Jewelewicz-Nelson determined that D.M. and F.M. \u201cwould not be able to parent S.M. in the reasonably foreseeable future\u201d and that \u201cS.M. would be harmed if she were to wait any longer for permanency.\u201d <em>D.M., supra, </em>slip op. at 18. The doctor concluded that S.M. should be \u201c \u2018freed for adopting by her foster parents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Dr. Frederica Brown, a psychologist, testified on behalf of the Law Guardian. Although Dr. Brown determined that S.M. was \u201chappier\u201d with her biological parents than with her foster parents, she did not recommend reunification. <em>Id. </em>at 21. Instead, the doctor \u201cadvocated for an \u2018open adoption\u2019 with some \u2018monitored supervision with the parents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Dr. Susan Herschman, a psychologist, testified on behalf of D.M. and F.M. Dr. Herschman determined that a strong bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>existed between S.M. and her parents, but that S.M. also \u201c \u2018feels comfortable\u2019\u201d with her foster parents. <em>Id. </em>at 25. The doctor \u201copined that termination of parental rights would do more harm than good, based upon the bond she observed between S.M. and defendants, and the fact that there had never been \u2018any obvious abuse or neglect of [S.M.].\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Ultimately, Dr. Herschman concluded that with additional services provided to S.M. and her biological parents, reunification would be successful. <em>Id. </em>at 26. After finding the opinions of Drs. Jewelewicx-Nelson and Brown more persuasive than that of Dr. Herschman, the trial court entered an order on May 22, 2007, terminating D.M.\u2019s and F.M.\u2019s parental rights. Both parents appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We reversed, determining that DYFS had \u201cfailed to present clear and convincing evidence that S.M.\u2019s \u2018safety, health or development\u2019 has been or will continue to be endangered by the parental relationship,\u201d as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 39. We concluded that \u201c[i]n the absence of such proof, termination of appellants\u2019 parental rights was improper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. In reaching that conclusion, we \u201cnoted, the \u2018conduct\u2019 upon which the trial judge relied in weighing the first statutory factor was F.M.\u2019s drug abuse history, D.M.\u2019s multiple sclerosis, and some domestic violence incidents between appellants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45-46. However, as stated <em>infra, </em>we determined that \u201cthere [was] no clear and convincing evidence of record that any such conduct \u2018endangered\u2019 S.M.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">We also concluded that the trial court erred in finding that DYFS had satisfied the second and fourth prongs of the best interests of the child standard. <em>Id. </em>at 47-51. As to the fourth prong, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">S.M. has been in her current foster care placement since August 23, 2005. We are, therefore, mindful that our reversal of appellants\u2019 termination order will require additional proceedings in the Family Part. We note that the trial evidence of S.M.\u2019s bonding with her foster parents was mixed, at best. By contrast, as noted, all experts acknowledged that S.M. maintained a loving relationship with appellants. Dr. [Jewelewicz-Nelson] described S.M. as \u201cvery quiet and very constricted\u201d during the bonding evaluation with the foster parents. The doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>emphasized S.M.\u2019s need for permanency because, \u201cfor almost two years[,]\u201d the child \u201chas been living with a sense of uncertainty and lack of affiliation[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">Defendants may have \u201cpersonality deficits that have a negative impact on their capacity to parent[,]\u201d as Dr. [Jewelewicz-Nelson] opined in her report. Notwithstanding these deficits, the record contains evidence of a strong loving bond between S.M. and her natural parents as well as evidence of the lack of such a bond with her foster parents. Once again we note the lack of any evidence of abuse, neglect or endangerment of S.M. resulting from her parents\u2019 \u201cpersonality deficits!;.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-6\">Dr. Brown testified that S.M. showed no \u201centhusiasm\u201d towards her foster mother; they engaged in no eye contact and no make[-]believe play which the doctor regarded as \u201cnot a good sign.\u201d Dr. Brown described S.M.\u2019s foster care placement as a \u201ccaretaker arrangement\u201d and recommended it \u201cin the absence of something better[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-7\">On remand, the Family Part must examine the present state of S.M.\u2019s bond to her foster parents as well as appellants\u2019 current situation. We have concluded that there is not clear and convincing evidence to support the decision to terminate appellants\u2019 parental rights. \u201cThat does not mean, however, that termination may not be an appropriate resolution.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 608 A.2d 1312. If DYFS presents \u201csubstantial evidence of the harm that may come to [S.M.] if separated from [her] foster parents[,] ... that evidence may not be disregarded, even though, as the record now stands, it does not meet the strict statutory and constitutional standards that govern the termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-8\">If, however, DYFS is unable to offer clear and convincing evidence that, at present, \u201cmoving [S.M.] ... will, to a reasonable psychological certainty, cause serious harm,\u201d <em>In re K.L.F., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>32, 44-45, 608 A.2d 1327 (1992), then appropriate steps must be taken to return S.M. to her natural parents. \u201cThe standard is not that the end result cause no pain or trauma but that the child be kept from [her] parents only to avoid serious and lasting harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 608 A.2d 1327. \u2018We are compelled to note that much of the bonding that has taken place in this case could have been avoided if\u2019 S.M. had not been improperly removed from appellants\u2019 custody in the first place. <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\"><em>[Id </em>at 50-52.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Accordingly, we remanded to conduct an expeditious evidentiary hearing as to whether S.M. had bonded with her foster parents, and if that question was affirmatively answered, to further determine whether the breaking of that bond would cause the child serious psychological or emotional harm. <em>Id. </em>at 52. We also directed the trial court to evaluate the biological parents\u2019 current situation and the present relationship between them and S.M. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52. Recognizing that S.M. last visited with her parents on June 12, 2007, when she was permitted a \u201cgoodbye\u201d visitation following the trial court\u2019s order terminating parental rights, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>directed the court on remand to permit D.M. and F.M. to have sufficient visitation with their daughter for the experts to determine the relationships between S.M. and her biological parents and between S.M. and her foster parents. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On remand, the court entered orders directing that D.M. and F.M. undergo psychological evaluations, S.M. undergo therapy, DYFS permit TSVP<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> supervised visitation between S.M. and her parents, and bonding evaluations be conducted of S.M. and her biological parents and of S.M. and her foster parents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> D.M. attended visitation sessions on a weekly basis with her daughter between February 24 and April 21, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">At the Division\u2019s request, Dr. Jewelewicz-Nelson conducted bonding evaluations between S.M. and members of her foster family on December 8, 2008. The doctor also conducted a psychological evaluation of D.M. on February 17, 2009, and March 3, 2009, and a bonding evaluation between D.M. and S.M. on April 1, 2009. The doctor opined that \u201c[S.M.] is definitely emotionally bonded to her foster family\u201d and that her \u201cbond with her foster parents has increased and strengthened since\u201d her last evaluation approximately one year prior. She opined that adoption was appropriate and in S.M.\u2019s best interests because \u201c[t]he psychological and emotional risks to [S.M.] should she not be adopted [by her foster family] are significant.\u201d She stated that S.M. \u201cdoes not have a relationship with [her biological parents] that is based on nurturing, trust, security and stability.\u201d The doctor concluded that another transition for S.M. would increase the probability of \u201cirreparable and enduring harm\u201d to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">D.M. again engaged the services of Dr. Susan Herschman. Dr. Herschman conducted a bonding evaluation between S.M. and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>foster mother on March 16, 2009, a psychological evaluation of D.M. on April 16, 2009, and a bonding evaluation between D.M. and S.M. on April 20, 2009. As to D.M., the doctor noted that D.M.\u2019s \u201chealth has improved and she has become increasingly more independent and responsible for her own health and physical care.\u201d Elaborating on D.M.\u2019s independence, the doctor stated that \u201c[w]hile, in the past, she was dependent on [F.M.], she now realizes that she cannot let his issues interfere with the reunification of [S.M.]. [D.M.] has proven that she is able to reside on her own, cook, shop, and organize transportation to get her to different appointments.\u201d Concerning her illness, the doctor noted that \u201c[w]hile [D.M.] remains on disability, her MS is currently in remission. [D.M.] still experiences some pain, and takes medication, but when observed in evaluations, the medication did not appear to hamper or interfere with her level of alertness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The doctor described the bond between S.M. and her foster parents as \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201ccomfortable.\u201d She explained that S.M. feels like part of the foster family, and that the foster family was caring and loving, and that S.M. had a good relationship with her foster siblings. Dr. Herschman characterized S.M. as a resilient child who is easy-going and adapts well to her environment. Although she could not guarantee it, the doctor believed that S.M. would make a good adjustment if placed with her biological mother. The doctor stated that changing S.M.\u2019s environment would be significant, but that \u201cshe would be able to adapt to that change without significant trauma or enduring harm.\u201d Finally, the doctor opined that termination of D.M.\u2019s parental rights \u201cwould do more harm than good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The Law Guardian presented Dr. Natalie Barone, a psychologist. On December 4, 2008, Dr. Barone conducted a bonding evaluation between S.M. and her foster family and a psychological evaluation of S.M. She did not conduct a bonding evaluation between S.M. and D.M., nor did she conduct a psychological evaluation of D.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Dr. Barone found that \u201c[S.M.] has been consistently and lovingly cared for by her foster family over the last three years. As such, [S.M.] has developed an undeniably secure and healthy attachment with these caretakers and has emotionally thrived in their home.\u201d The doctor concluded that S.M. \u201cconsiders her foster parents as her psychological parents\u201d in that she has become \u201can integral part of [the foster] family\u201d and community. The doctor stated that S.M. only has a biological tie to her natural mother and that their relationship is only conceptual. She opined that severing S.M.\u2019s psychological attachment to her foster parents would result in S.M. suffering enduring harm while severing the relationship with her biological mother would not. In the doctor\u2019s opinion, if S.M. was separated from the foster family and her current community, she \u201cwould become withdrawn\u201d and \u201cdepressed\u201d and would \u201cblame herself for the loss.\u201d The doctor acknowledged that S.M. is a resilient child, but that her resiliency could easily be broken by the loss of her foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Drs. Jewelewiez-Nelson and Herschman also opined as to S.M.\u2019s current relationship with her mother and the appropriateness of reunification. Dr. Jewelewiez-Nelson noted that D.M. \u201ctakes great care in her personal appearances\u201d and \u201cdresses in clothing more typical of much younger girls.\u201d She also noted that D.M. \u201cwalked with a cane\u201d and \u201cwas bent over at almost a 90 angle due to her scoliosis\u201d but was \u201csturdy on her feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">Dr. Jewelewiez-Nelson reported that D.M. received average scores on all of the \u201cpsychometric measures,\u201d had an adequate understanding of child rearing issues, and showed adequate \u201ccoping strategies.\u201d However, according to the doctor, D.M.\u2019s personality test indicated a \u201ccompulsive personality disorder.\u201d Although she described this is \u201ca pervasive pattern or preoccupation \"with orderliness, perfectionism and control\u201d the doctor stated that the characteristic \u201cdid not reach criteria for a diagnosis of a DSM-IV personality disorder.\u201d Finally, she noted that D.M. had the \u201cintellectual understanding required for adequate child rearing practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>However, Dr. Jewelewiez-Nelson opined that D.M. lacked understanding of the emotional attachment S.M. might have with her foster family. She also believed that D.M. would have difficulty recognizing S.M.\u2019s emotional needs if reunited with her. As a result, the doctor opined that D.M. was not capable of parenting by herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Dr. Jewelewiez-Nelson also conducted a bonding evaluation of S.M. and D.M. The doctor observed S.M. and D.M. engage in conversation while playing cards, with S.M. telling D.M. about her foster family and various life activities. The doctor classified this as \u201cage-appropriate activit[y]\u201d and \u201ccontent-appropriate conversations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Dr. Hersehman explained that D.M.\u2019s psychological examination showed no depression or anxiety disorders, but revealed a \u201chistrionic personality\u201d characteristic, which the doctor explained was \u201cnot significant psychiatrically.\u201d The doctor described this finding as a \u201ccharacteristic\u201d consistent with \u201ca narcissistic personality disorder\u201d that displays itself in \u201cthe way she dresses, she\u2019s very energetic, [and] she ... can be flamboyant at times.\u201d The doctor maintained that this characteristic was not dysfunctional, but rather was \u201cpart of who [D.M.] is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Dr. Hersehman also reported that during the psychological evaluation, D.M. appeared to be \u201ca whole different person\u201d from the last time she evaluated her during the first termination proceeding. Specifically, the doctor noted the physical difference in \u201chow she carries herself, how she presents herself, how she relates, her alertness.\u201d Dr. Hersehman testified that D.M. was open to counseling, but hesitant about the process. She also explained that D.M. \u201cwas doing everything on her own right now\u201d including cooking and making doctor\u2019s appointments. The doctor testified that D.M. was self-sufficient and had been for the past several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Dr. Hersehman characterized D.M. and S.M.\u2019s relationship as \u201chesitant\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d at first, but she attributed those observations to the lack of recent contact between D.M. and S.M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>However, during the bonding evaluation, Dr. Herschman observed that S.M. was \u201cextremely comfortable with her mother\u201d and that S.M. \u201cengaged in conversation throughout the evaluation with no period of silence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Dr. Herschman admitted that D.M. has difficulty understanding some of S.M.\u2019s feelings but that \u201cshe\u2019s beginning to.\u201d She recommended that D.M. attend individual therapy sessions and family counseling if S.M. was returned to her care. Dr. Herschman acknowledged that D.M. would need counseling regarding S.M.\u2019s emotions toward and relationship with her foster family.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On June 23, 2009, the trial court entered an order supported by an oral decision terminating D.M.\u2019s and F.M.\u2019s parental rights to S.M. In so doing, the trial court rendered findings of fact as to the appropriateness of reunification and any psychological or emotional harm S.M. might suffer from the breaking of her bond with her foster parents. As to the appropriateness of reunification, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">... [D.M.] has been a motivated and consistent presence in the case since the remand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">... And I have to say that over the course of my exposure to [D.M.], I tend to like and approve of her. Obviously, nobody\u2019s perfect and there have been issues, but in just getting a sense of her as she comes into the case and conducts her life business under sometimes difficult circumstances, I have no problem with that proposition [ (reunification) ], in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">As to the opinion of Dr. Jewelewicz-Nelson, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">I have to say that I cannot help but disagree to some extent with Dr. [Jewelewicz-Nelson]. In light of the case history, I don\u2019t know anyone who would not be angry and should not be angry and direct their anger, certainly, at the Division. We work in a very difficult case type and now that the Appellate Division has said there was a mistake made ... I cannot assign much weight to the pure fact that [D.M.] may be angry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">I do think that her thinking, her feeling, does play into her capacity to mitigate harm to [S.M.] upon reunification, but as I just said, I ... have trouble attaching negative consequences to feeling anger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">Concerning the testimony of Dr. Herschman, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">Dr. Herschman\u2019s cumulative view was that LD.M.], with appropriate counseling for both herself and [S.M.], could help |S.M.] adjust to the loss of her foster family and transition to a reunified life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>So what I distill from Dr. ... Herschman also refers to the anger that [D.M.] has felt. I think on balance, my own thought is that in terms of where she is at, meaning [D.M.], in terms of her psychological functioning at this juncture, is that it is not as problematic, in my view, as Dr. [Jewelewicz-Nelson] characterizes it, and I have to say that I understand why she would be angry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">At the same time, I think that in reading and understanding Dr. Herschman\u2019s report and testimony, there are elements of her personality that, perhaps, she needs help with while she is helping or would be helping [S.M.] adjust to a reunification. So those are considerations in determining whether there should or ... can appropriately be a reunification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In determining that S.M. would suffer serious psychological harm if the bond between her and her foster parents is broken, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">These are my conclusions and concerns. [S.M.] has been in foster placement since August of 2005. It is now June of 2009. We all know how that came about in terms of the procedural history. One thing we definitely don\u2019t have is a time machine and so we can\u2019t change that fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">The years that she has been in that placement have been her years from the age of, let\u2019s see, just before she turned four, to this time when she is nearly eight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">One thing that occurs to me is that in removing [S.M.] from the foster parents and attempting a reunification with one or both of the biological parents, we are now in a situation where we have a child who not only is in a foster placement with foster parents, and all experts agree that that is a strong bond, she has also had the experience of forming attachments, and now I\u2019m using it in a, perhaps, a laymen\u2019s sense, with a whole host of members of a more extended community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">I think that the experts testified, in particular I think it was Dr. Barone, talked about what attachment and bonding means at different developmental stages. This particular young child is at a stage where, I think it\u2019s fair to say, these extended community connections take on significant meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-11\">... Dr. Barone said that the foster parents, quote\u2014on Page 10 of her report, \u2018\u2018They have built a loving community for [S.M.] that includes siblings, extended family and friends, classmates and teachers. As a result, [S.M.\u2019s] attachment to her foster parents created various levels of bonding to many other people. By the same token, the severing of [S.M.\u2019s] attachment to her foster parents would be correlated with the loss of [S.M.]\u2019s entire small but significant community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">[ ]This examiner opines that removing [S.M.] from her foster family would result in severe and enduring emotional harm and would not be in her best interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-13\">That articulation of the risk makes sense to me. Again, not only a loss of psychological parents, perhaps, but all of these other connections, which I would say constitutes a seven, nearly eight-year-old child\u2019s extended universe, that is a significant consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-14\">Dr. [Jewelewicz-Nelson] ... talked about, \u201cthe psychological and emotional risk[s] to [S.M.] should she not be adopted by this family are significant. She is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>likely to feel guilty ... that it is her fault that she was not adopted. She is also likely to experience intense grief and bereavement at losing this family to whom she has become quite attached during a formative part of her development.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">I think that [echoes], what I\u2019ll call, the amplified concern about not only breaking a bond with foster parents, but with foster family and what I\u2019ll call foster community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">Dr. Hersehman, as I mentioned before, took a different view and said that in her view, that a reunification is not likely to cause [S.M.] enduring emotional distress____ She says, of course, not likely and these are not things that can be established with certainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">So what I think we are left with is the reality that because of the ease history, the bonding that has occurred, although if we had the ability to go back in time would not occur, we have a situation where, in my view ... there is clear and convincing evidence and clear and convincing commonsense evidence, that breaking the current bond, which has been identified as a strong bond with the foster parents, would, to a ... reasonable degree of psychological certainty, cause serious and lasting harm to [S.M.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">And so, I\u2019m left with the dilemma of either doing the thing that I think would right a wrong in a sense, and that is reunify [S.M.] with [D.M.] and hope that Dr. Hersehman is right that its not likely that the child would suffer severe and lasting harm. Or do what my sense tells me, my experience of these type[s] of cases, my thinking through this case, and not take that risk for [S.M.], the risk that she would suffer having ... been in this placement for an extended time, what the Appellate Division told me, specifically, to look for, serious and lasting harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">And I concluded that [this] is what would be likely to happen and the kind of harm it would have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">On appeal, D.M. argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-14\">\n<em>POINT i.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">THE APPELLATE DIVISION DECISION VIOLATED D.M.\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND, THEREFORE, S.M.

Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). Such deference \u201cis especially appropriate \u2018when the evidence is largely testimonial and involves questions of credibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390 (quoting <em>In re Return of Weapons to J.W.D., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>108, 117, 693 A.2d 92 (1997)). Moreover, \u201c \u2018[b]ecause of the family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters, appellate courts should accord deference to family court factfinding.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. H.B., </em>375 <em>N.J.Super. </em>148, 172, 866 A.2d 1053 (App.Div.2005) (quoting <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 713 A.2d 390). However, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm, of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>see also N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. R.L., </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>81, 89, 906 A.2d 463 (App.Div.2006), <em>certif. denied, </em>190 <em>N.J. </em>257, 919 A.2d 850 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In Point I of her brief, D.M. argues that the trial court erred in terminating her parental rights to her daughter without clear and convincing evidence that DYFS satisfied each of the four prongs of the best interests of the child standard. D.M. contends that evidence S.M. has bonded with her foster parents and has achieved stability and permanency in the foster parents\u2019 home to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>where the breaking of that bond might cause S.M. serious, psychological harm is insufficient to justify termination of parental rights. D.M. asserts that the trial court improperly circumvented a constitutional and statutory scheme for terminating her parental rights, and erroneously terminated her rights based solely on S.M.\u2019s current bond to her foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">DYFS counters that on remand \u201cD.M. showed a continuing pattern of being unable to meet S.M.\u2019s needs\u201d and \u201cthat foster parent bonding alone may justify termination.\u201d The Law Guardian supports the Division\u2019s position on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Because the record is devoid of evidence that D.M.\u2019s actions or omissions substantially contributed to her daughter\u2019s bonding with the foster parents, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In our prior opinion, we found that DYFS had failed to prove prongs (1), (2) and (4) of the best interests of the child standard by clear and convincing evidence. Accordingly, we reversed. <em>D.M., supra, </em>(slip op. at 53). In so doing, we noted that the evidence of S.M.\u2019s bonding with her foster parents was at best \u201cmixed,\u201d and that S.M. had been in her foster care placement for three years. <em>Id. </em>at 50. Acknowledging that S.M. had no contact with her parents since June 2007, and that S.M. may have bonded with her foster parents since that time to where the breaking of that bond may cause serious psychological or emotional harm to S.M. requiring termination of parental rights, we remanded to address that issue through the lenses of <em>J.C., </em>and <em>K.L.F.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Although not due to the fault of the trial court or any party, the remand proceeding neither proceeded nor concluded as expeditiously as anticipated. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and determined that as of June 2009, almost four years since S.M. was placed with her foster parents, a strong bond had developed between S.M. and the foster parents, to where the breaking of that bond \u201cwould to a ... reasonable degree of psychological certainty, cause serious and lasting harm to [S.M.].\u201d After reaching that conclusion, the court determined that it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>be in the best interest of S.M. to terminate her parents\u2019 parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The trial court\u2019s finding that S.M. would suffer psychological harm if separated from her foster parents was based on credible evidence in the record. The court weighed the opinions of the three experts, and gave greater weight to the opinions of Drs. Barone and Jewelewicz-Nelson than that of Dr. Herschman. Because \u201cthe weight to be given to the evidence of experts is within the competence of the fact-finder,\u201d <em>LaBracio Family Partnership v. 1239 Roosevelt Ave., Inc., </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 165, 773 A.2d 1209 (App.Div.2001), we discern no reason to interfere with the court\u2019s finding. However, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that this finding alone required termination of D.M.\u2019s parental rights. In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that the language we employed in our previous decision may have inadvertently contributed to the problem we now address. That is, the trial court may have reasonably construed our previous decision as limiting the scope of the remand hearing to determining whether S.M. had bonded with her foster parents to such a degree that severing that bond would cause her \u201csevere and lasting harm.\u201d This analysis, per force, excludes consideration of parental fault as part of the discussion. Unfortunately, an analysis that focuses entirely on the child\u2019s bonding with his or her foster parents, without a concomitant finding of parental fault, cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Our courts have cautiously approached termination proceedings based upon the bond formed between a child and his or her foster parents. We first addressed this question in <em>New Jersey Division of Youth &amp; Family Services v. T.C., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 598 A.2d 899 (1991), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>564, 683 A.2d 1160 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>T.C., </em>the trial court found the mother fit to parent her child; nevertheless, based upon the child\u2019s bond with his foster parents, the court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 431, 598 A.2d 899. We recognized that while AW. suggested \u201cserious psychological damage to the child\u201d could satisfy the first prong of the best interests of the child standard, \u201cthe cause of that disturb<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ing effect [in <em>AW. </em>of parental visits upon the removed child] was rooted in the prior parent-child relationship itself and was not simply due to the child\u2019s bonding to another after removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 598 A.2d 899. While we did not reject the overall theory of termination based upon foster parent bonding, we concluded \u201cthat termination without implication <em>of </em>substantial parental fault and based exclusively upon foster-parent bonding during temporary placement goes beyond the articulated standards of A.W.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 432-433, 598 A.2d 899. <em>See also In re Matter of A., </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 470, 649 A.2d 1310 (App.Div.1994). Lastly, in reversing the trial court\u2019s decision in <em>T.C. </em>to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">the constitutional, social and psychological force of these conjoined principles ordinarily weighs heavily against parental termination based on the foster-parent bonding of a child whose biological parents are fit to have her returned to them, particularly in those cases in which the parent-child separation has been substantially contributed to by public agencies whose mission it is to protect the family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARR\"><em>[T.C., supra, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 440, 598 A.2d 899.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We also acknowledge that an isolated reading of <em>J.C. </em>might suggest that <em>T.C. </em>was implicitly overruled, thus, permitting termination of parental rights to rest solely on a showing that a child has bonded with his or her foster parents, to such a degree, that severing that bond would cause the child \u201cserious psychological or emotional harm.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 608 A.2d 1312. However, on reading <em>J.C. </em>in the light of <em>K.L.F. </em>and <em>G.L., </em>we conclude otherwise. Indeed, <em>T.C. </em>was cited with approval by the Court in <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312, and in <em>K.L.F., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 45, 608 A.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In <em>J.C., </em>the Court addressed the issue of \u201cwhether the parental rights of a natural mother should be terminated based on the need to protect children from potential harm that may result from being separated from foster parents with whom the children may have formed parental bonds.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 5, 608 A.2d 1312. In that case, a mother voluntarily placed her three children in foster care because of homelessness, domestic abuse, and her own substance abuse. <em>Ibid. </em>Three years later, DYFS filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>petition for guardianship on the grounds that the mother was \u201cunable and unwilling to stop causing the children harm,\u201d and the delay in permanent placement would have added to the harm then facing the children. <em>Id. </em>at 6, 608 A.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Following a remand, the parties stipulated to certain facts concerning the mother\u2019s rehabilitation. They agreed that she had been living in the same apartment for two years, had been gainfully employed for two years, there was after-school childcare at her workplace, and she was drug and alcohol free. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 608 A.2d 1312. During the pendency of the action, the mother consented to the adoption of her youngest child by the foster parents. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 608 A.2d 1312. As to the two older children, the court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to them, finding that the children \u201cwould suffer serious psychological harm if they were removed from their foster or pre-adoptive homes and returned to [the mother], and that the harm in part was attributable to [the mother\u2019s] own inability to plan for their future and failure to rehabilitate herself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We affirmed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In addressing the issue presented, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">In cases in which DYFS seeks termination of parental rights, not on grounds of current unfitness but because of potential harm to the child based on separation from a foster parent with whom the child has bonded, the qualify of the proof adduced must be consistent with the interests at stake. To the extent that the quality of the child\u2019s relationship with foster parents may be relevant to termination of the natural parents\u2019 status, that relationship must be viewed not in isolation but in a broader context that includes as well the qualify of the child\u2019s relationship with his or her natural parents. As suggested by <em>In re Guardianship of J.R., </em>174 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, [223, 416 A.2d 62 (App.Div.1980)], <em>prolonged inattention by natural parents that permits the development of disproportionately stronger ties between a child and foster parents may lead to a bonding relationship, the severing of which would cause profound harm\u2014a harm attributable to the natural parents </em>and cognizable under the standards set forth in A.W., <em>supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 604-11, 512 A.2d 438____ To show that the child has a strong relationship with the foster parents or might be better off if left in their custody is not enough. [ (Cite omitted).] DYFS must prove by clear and convincing evidence that separating the child from his or her foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 18-19, 608 A.2d 1312. (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The Court determined that the record did not support termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 608 A.2d 1312. In so finding, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">(Tjhat does not mean, however, that termination may not be an appropriate resolution. DYFS has presented substantial evidence of the harm that may come to these children if separated from their foster parents. Hence, that evidence may not be disregarded, even though, as the record now stands, it does not meet the strict statutory and constitutional standards that govern the termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">Consequently, we remand to the trial court in order that additional evidence may be adduced directly addressing whether the two children have bonded with their foster parents and if so whether breaking such bonds would cause the children serious psychological or emotional harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">In <em>K.L.F., </em>a case decided the same day as <em>J.C., </em>the Court also considered whether a parent\u2019s parental rights could be terminated based on psychological harm that a child might suffer after separation from his or her foster parents. <em>Supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 608 A.2d 1327. In that case, a mother who was unable to find shelter for herself and her daughter, entered into a temporary custody agreement with DYFS and consented to the temporary placement of her daughter in foster care. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 608 A.2d 1327. After separation from her daughter for approximately eighteen months, DYFS placed the child with pre-adoptive foster parents. <em>Ibid. </em>The mother sought visitation with her daughter, but DYFS refused. <em>Id. </em>at 35-36, 608 A.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">DYFS then instituted a guardianship proceeding seeking to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights based on abandonment and on the best interests of the child standard. <em>Id. </em>at 36, 608 A.2d 1327. The court determined that the mother had not abandoned the children. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 608 A.2d 1327. The court also concluded that DYFS had failed to prove the best interests of the child standard, determining that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the mother was a fit parent with \u201cthe ability and capacity not only to care for [her daughter] but to minimize the trauma involved in separating [her daughter] from her foster parents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43, 608 A.2d 1327. We affirmed, <em>ibid., </em>and so did the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 46, 608 A.2d 1327.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Like in <em>J.C., </em>the Court held that \u201cinjury to children need not be physical to give rise to State termination of biological parent-child relationships. Serious and lasting emotional or psychological harm to children <em>as the result of the action or inaction of their biological parents </em>can constitute injury sufficient to authorize termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 608 A.2d 1327 (emphasis added). In discussing the best interests of the child standard and noting that the mother had undertaken \u201csubstantial steps to prepare a stable and secure home environment for her daughter,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 44, 608 A.2d 1327, the Court stated that \u201c[t]he standard is not that the end result cause no pain or trauma but that the child be kept from its parents only to avoid serious and lasting harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 608 A.2d 1327. As to the bonding, the Court concluded that much of the bonding between the foster parents and child had taken place because of the mistaken actions of DYFS, not the mother. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">In <em>G.L., </em>the Court addressed the question, \u201c[w]hen may a parent be subjected to the termination of [his or her] parental rights for failing to eliminate harm to the child posed by [his or her] spouse?\u201d <em>Supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 599, 926 A.2d 320. In answering the question, the court reinforced the principle that termination of parental rights based on the best interests of the child standard \u201cis conduct-based,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 608, 926 A.2d 320, not based on \u201c[presumptions of parental unfitness,\u201d directing that all doubts of parental unfitness must be resolved against termination. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\"><em>G.L. </em>involved the termination of a mother\u2019s parental rights to her newborn daughter. Prior to the daughter\u2019s birth, the mother\u2019s infant son had died under suspicious circumstances while in the care of the child\u2019s father. <em>Id. </em>at 599, 926 A.2d 320. The father was subsequently indicted for second-degree manslaughter and third-degree endangering the welfare of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 926 A.2d 320. While the ease was pending, the mother gave birth to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Although the mother and father were living apart at the time of the daughter\u2019s birth, DYFS required as a condition of the mother retaining custody of her daughter to restrict the father from unsupervised visitation with the child. The mother complied. <em>Id. </em>at 600-01, 926 A.2d 320. Nonetheless, because the mother continued to believe that the father had not caused the injury leading to the death of her son, but had only failed to timely call for help, DYFS filed a complaint seeking custody and care of the daughter, alleging that the mother might allow the father access to the child. <em>Id. </em>at 601, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Division\u2019s psychologist recommended reunification of the mother and daughter; however, the trial court disagreed and directed the Division to proceed with termination of parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03, 926 A.2d 320. Following trial, the court ordered termination of the mother\u2019s parental rights reasoning that the mother\u2019s unwillingness to sever ties with the father posed a serious risk to her daughter. We affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 604, 926 A.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Court reversed, reaffirming that in a termination proceeding based on the best interests of the child standard \u201cDYFS bears the burden of <em>proving each of those prongs </em>by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 926 A.2d 320. (Emphasis added). The Court held that the trial court\u2019s finding that the child was threatened by the mother\u2019s actions was \u201cbased on speculation and not on clear and convincing evidence. The judge simply presumed that [the mother] could not keep [the child] safe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 926 A.2d 320. As to the fourth prong, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">One final note: The trial judge considered the lack of a strong bond between [mother and child] as supporting termination. To be sure, the bond was thin as the direct result of the improvident removal of [the child] from her mother\u2019s custody in 2003. Because she has lived with others for most of her life, [the child] has naturally become attached to them and her bond with her mother was weakened. That conclusion merely satisfies the fourth prong of the statute\u2014that termination would not do more harm than good. That prong serves as a fail-safe against termination even where the remaining standards have been met. <em>It does not provide an independent basis for termination where the other standards have not been satisfied.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>[The child] should never have been removed from [the mother\u2019s] custody. It follows that [the mother\u2019s] parental rights should not have been terminated. [Id. at 608-09, 926 A.2d 320 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Our reading of <em>J.C., K.L.F. </em>and <em>G.L. </em>leads us to conclude that where DYFS fails to prove all prongs of the best interests of the child standard, any psychological or emotional harm a child may suffer as a result of the breaking of the bond between the child and his or her foster parents cannot, in and of itself, serve as a legally sufficient basis for a termination of a parent\u2019s parental rights. In such a case, DYFS must still prove by clear and convincing evidence that the parent\u2019s actions or inactions substantially contributed to the forming of that bond, and that the harm caused to the child from severing that bond rests at the feet of the parent. Such proof would follow the Court\u2019s direction that termination of parental rights is \u201cconduct-based,\u201d <em>G.L., supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 608, 926 A.2d 320, by requiring a showing that \u201c[t]he parent is unwilling or unable to eliminate the harm facing the child____ Such harm may include evidence that separating the child from his [or her] resource family parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm to the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">We found in our prior opinion that until the trial court entered the May 22, 2007 order terminating D.M.\u2019s and F.M.\u2019s parental rights, S.M. had maintained a loving relationship with her parents, and that at best, proof S.M. had bonded with her foster parents was \u201cmixed.\u201d <em>D.M., supra, </em>slip op. at 50. We remanded to determine whether S.M. had bonded with her foster parents since May 22,2007, and whether severing that bond would cause S.M. to suffer serious psychological or emotional harm. <em>Id. </em>at 52. With the trial court so determining, the question becomes whether the record contains evidence showing that D.M. substantially contributed to the forming of that bond between her daughter and the foster parents. We answer the question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">DYFS did not substantiate abuse, neglect, or abandonment against D.M. To the contrary, as noted by the trial court, the original termination had been reversed \u201cbecause there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>evidence linking [D.M.\u2019s] various issues and problems to harm to [S.M.] or even a realistic risk of harm to [S.M.].\u201d Nor on remand did the trial court find any fault on the part of D.M. concerning her actions or omissions in not maintaining contact with her daughter while the appeal was pending, leading to a stronger bond between the child and her foster parents than between S.M. and D.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The trial court expressed concern over the absence of F.M., the potential for future episodes of domestic violence if F.M. returns to the family home, D.M.\u2019s potential (but justified in the court\u2019s view) anger with the Division, and some of D.M.\u2019s shortcomings in addressing S.M.\u2019s emotional needs. However, none of these concerns amount to a finding of fault on D.M.\u2019s part leading to the strengthening of the bond between S.M. and her foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Indeed, D.M.\u2019s actions speak to the contrary. Following remand, D.M. tried to maintain a relationship with her daughter when given the opportunity. D.M. petitioned and was granted visitation with her daughter. Between February 24, 2009 and April 21, 2009, D.M. attended seven visitation sessions on a weekly basis with S.M. She also petitioned and was granted visitation during the pendency of this appeal. Accordingly, the trial court did not, and we cannot, find that D.M. substantially contributed to the bonding between S.M. and the foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">The Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>CM., supra, </em>supports our conclusion that termination of parental rights cannot be justified by evidence that a child may suffer serious, psychological or emotional harm by severing the bond between the child and his or her foster parents without evidence that the parent substantially caused, directly or indirectly, the harm to the child. The Court reaffirmed the principle that to terminate a parent\u2019s parental rights, DYFS bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence each of the four statutory prongs of the best interests of the child standard. <em>C.M., supra, </em>\u2014 <em>N.J. </em>at-, \u2014 A.2d (slip op. at 30). That S.M. would have bonded with her foster parents between the conclusion of the first termination proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and the remand proceeding should not have come as a surprise, D.M. having been improperly separated from S.M. while the first appeal was pending. As noted by the Court \u201c[i]t is well-established that the period of time a child has spent in foster care is not determinative of whether parental rights to that child should be terminated, as \u2018[t]he protection of parental rights continues when a child is placed in foster care.\u2019 \u201d <em>C.M., supra, </em>- N.J. at -, \u2014 A.2d - (slip op. at 38) (quoting <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 347, 736 A.2d 1246). Indeed, \u201c[i]n respect of the first prong of the test for terminating parental rights, ... [the] Court has made clear that \u2018[t]he statute requires that the State demonstrate harm to the child by the parent\u2019 and that the \u2018[Warm, in this context, involves the endangerment of the child\u2019s health and development <em>resulting from the parental </em>relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 348, 736 A.2d 1246). Here, as previously stated, we found the record devoid of any evidence, much less clear and convincing evidence, that D.M. substantially contributed to the forming of the bond between S.M. and her foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">We reverse that part of the June 23, 2009 order that terminated D.M.\u2019s parental rights to S.M. We remand to formulate a plan for reunification between D.M. and S.M. that will be in S.M.\u2019s best interests. The plan should include therapy for D.M. and S.M., individually and jointly, and increased supervised visitation between the parent and child, leading to unsupervised daytime supervision and subsequent overnight visitation as determined by the court to minimize any emotional harm to S.M. caused by separating her from her foster family. The plan should also include an evaluation of D.M.\u2019s present ability to care for her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">We direct that the court formulate its initial plan of reunification within thirty days of the date of this decision. Because of the necessity to bring this matter to a fair and just conclusion in the best interests of S.M., we retain jurisdiction to address any issues that may occur on remand until S.M. has been fully reunited with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\"> TSVP ivS an acronym for the Therapeutic Supervised Visitation Program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\"> F.M. did not comply with the court's orders, did not visit S.M., and only appeared at one hearing on remand.

Nevertheless, the Court held that termination of parental rights still might be \u201can appropriate resolution\u201d of DYFS\u2019s guardianship action. <em>Ibid. </em>In explaining this conclusion, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">... DYFS has presented substantial evidence of the harm that may come to these children if separated from their foster parents. Hence, that evidence may not be disregarded, even though, as the record now stands, it does not meet the strict statutory and constitutional standards that govern the termination of parental rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">Consequently, we remand to the trial court in order that additional evidence may be adduced directly addressing whether the two children have bonded with then-foster parents and if so whether breaking such bonds would cause the children serious psychological or emotional harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\n<em>{Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The Court also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">... In hearing a petition for termination in which the fitness of natural parents is neither relied on nor disputed by the agency, the trial court must also consider parallel proof relating to the child\u2019s relationship with his or her natural parents in assessing the existence, nature, and extent of the harm facing the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">On the first appeal in this case, we concluded that \u201cthere is not clear and convincing evidence to support [the trial court\u2019s] decision to terminate [D.M.\u2019s] parental rights\u201d under the standards set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a). <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. D.M., </em>No. A-6125-06T4 (Aug. 11, 2008) (slip op. at 51). Nevertheless, relying upon <em>J.C., </em>we held that the termination of D.M.\u2019s parental rights still might be required in S.M.\u2019s best interests. Accordingly, we remanded to the trial court \u201cin order that additional evidence may be adduced directly addressing whether [S.M. has] bonded with [her] foster parents and if so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>whether breaking such bonds would cause [S.M.] serious psychological or emotional harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52. (quoting <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 608 A.2d 1312).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The trial court conducted the evidentiary hearing we ordered and found \u201cto a moral certainty\u201d that denying termination of parental rights and compelling reunification of S.M. with D.M. would create \u201ca grave and substantial risk of lasting and enduring harm to [S.M.].\u201d As the majority concludes, there is substantial credible evidence in the record to support this factual finding. <em>See ante, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 74, 997 A.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Under <em>J.C. </em>and the express terms of our remand, I would conclude that the order terminating D.M.\u2019s parental rights to S.M. should be affirmed. However, I am now constrained to conclude, in light of the Court\u2019s subsequent decisions discussed in Judge Gilroy\u2019s opinion, particularly <em>New Jersey Division of Youth &amp; Family Services v. C.M., </em>\u2014 <em>N.J. </em>-, \u2014 A.2d - (2010), which was decided just last week, that the part of <em>J.C. </em>that we relied upon in remanding this ease is no longer good law and that the order terminating D.M.\u2019s parental rights must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\"><em>C.M. </em>unequivocally states that parental rights may be terminated in a guardianship action brought under N.J.S.A 30:4C-15(c) only if DYFS establishes each of the four standards set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">... [T]hose four standards or \u201cprongs,\u201d measured against a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof, are what must govern our inquiry. In determining whether a parent\u2019s parental rights to a child are to be terminated, it is those four standards and their <em>application\u2014and only those four </em>standards\u2014that command our focus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, \u2014 A.2d at - (slip op. at 31) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">A review of the remainder of the Court\u2019s opinion leaves no doubt that a court may not terminate parental rights unless each of the four standards set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1(a) is satisfied, even if, as in this case, the record indicates that denying termination of parental rights and compelling reunification of a child with his or her natural parent \u201cwould cause the [child] serious psychological or emotional harm.\u201d <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 608 A.2d 1312. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Therefore, I concur in the reversal of the order terminating D.M.\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
