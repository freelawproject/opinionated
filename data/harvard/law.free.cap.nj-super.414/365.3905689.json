Also at issue is whether Kentucky\u2019s or New Jersey\u2019s statute of limitations applies to one of these matters for purposes of determining whether the action is time barred. We hold that under either State\u2019s law of repose, the action filed by plaintiff Vonnie Cornett, individually and on behalf of the estate of her deceased husband Billie Cornett, is untimely and therefore, affirm the dismissal of her complaint. We also hold that certain claims of all remaining plaintiffs are federally preempted and accordingly affirm the Law Division\u2019s dismissal of those claims, but otherwise reverse the dismissal of their other claims and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">In September 2008, plaintiffs Vonnie Cornett (Vonnie) and Ernie and Alisha Williamson (collectively Williamsons) filed separate actions in the Law Division for alleged defects in the Cypher drug-coated arterial stent, a medical device manufactured by defendant Cordis, a wholly owned subsidiary of co-defendant Johnson &amp; Johnson (J &amp; J). They claimed negligence and strict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>product liability for design defect, manufacturing defect, and failure to warn; breach of implied and express warranties; negligent misrepresentation and fraud; statutory punitive damages for product liability; and for the Williamsons, loss of consortium. In January 2009, Vonnie filed an amended complaint, which dropped the negligence claims, as well as negligent misrepresentation and fraud, while adding claims for wrongful death, survivorship, and loss of consortium.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Forty-six other cases were consolidated with the Williamsons\u2019 action, which was further consolidated with Vonnie\u2019s action. The court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to adopt a \u201cmaster complaint,\u201d and ordered that Vonnie\u2019s amended complaint \u201cbe deemed to have amended\u201d the complaints in all the eases \u201cwith respect to those allegations and causes of action that are common[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In January 2009, defendants moved to dismiss in lieu of answering, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e). Following argument on April 17, 2009, the court, applying Kentucky\u2019s statute of limitations, dismissed Vonnie\u2019s action as, among other reasons, untimely, and dismissed the remaining actions on the ground that federal approval of the device preempted all State causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">By way of background, the first arterial stents were made of bare metal. A stent is a tiny metal mesh tube that is implanted in the coronary artery to open the artery and improve blood flow through the heart. The healing process after the implantation of any stent is the beneficial regrowth atop the stent and arterial wall of endothelial tissue, the normal artery lining that reduces the risk that a blood clot, or thrombus, will form and adhere. To prevent such clots during the period that regrowth was believed to require, patients were prescribed an antiplatelet drug like Plavix.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Cordis, incorporated in Florida with its principal place of business there, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of J &amp; J, a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business here. Cordis operates facilities worldwide, including one in Warren, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Cordis, as well as other manufacturers, developed \u201cdrug-eluting stents,\u201d which were coated with slow-release drugs intended to inhibit excessive regrowth and thus prevent the artery from being narrowed through the build-up of new tissue. The drug-eluting stent at issue here is Cordis\u2019 Cypher stent, which Cordis coated with sirolimus, a chemotherapy drug from Wyeth that slows cell growth and, in turn, the healing process. Cordis used the polymer PEVA/PBMA to bind sirolimus to the device\u2019s metal surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The Cypher is a Class III medical device regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pursuant to the MDA. Class III devices are used for \u201csupporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health[J\u201d 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360c(a)(l)(C)(ii)(l). \u201cClass III devices receive more extensive federal oversight than any other class of medical devices and are subject to a comprehensive and rigorous process known as premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d).\u201d <em>Riley v. Cordis Corp., </em>625 F.Supp.2d 769, 774 (D.Minn.2009); <em>see Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>312, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>999, 1004-05, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008); 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360e. As part of its application for PMA, a manufacturer must provide the FDA with \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that the device is both safe and effective. 21 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 360e(d)(2). The manufacturer must comply with all design, manufacturing, and labeling specifications set forth in a PMA approval order. 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 814.80. The FDA continues its oversight of the safety and effectiveness of PMA-approved devices after approval. <em>See, e.g., </em>21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 814.39(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">On April 24, 2003, the FDA approved Cordis\u2019 application for premarket approval of Cypher. The approval letter stated that Cypher was \u201cindicated for improving coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic ischemic disease due to discrete <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>novo </em>lesions of length &lt; 30 mm in native coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter of &gt; 2.5 to &lt; 3.5 mm.\u201d The letter instructed that advertising \u201cand other printed materials ... should not include indications or claims not included in the FDA-approved labeling!,]\u201d with the examples of \u201cuse in diabetic patients, small vessels (&lt; 2.5 mm diameter), in-stent restenosis, bifurcation lesions, or patients with acute myocardial infarction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The letter noted that the \u201c[l]ong-term outcome (beyond [twelve] months) for this permanent implant is unknown at present!,]\u201d and it imposed several conditions on the approval. For five years, Cordis was to collect and submit annual updates on the clinical outcomes of the patients in the preapproval clinical studies. Defendant was also to collect such information on 2,000 other United States patients \u201cto evaluate the potential for less frequent adverse events\u201d that \u201ccould not be detected in your initial clinical trials\u201d or that \u201cmay have resulted from changes in the manufacturing process between the production of the clinical trial lot and commercial scale-up.\u201d In addition, Cordis had to monitor and report changes made in the label for sirolimus, and seek supplemental PMA to effect any appropriate corresponding changes to the device\u2019s label. Other manufacturers also obtained FDA approval of their drug-eluting stents.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In April 2004, the FDA sent Cordis a warning letter that described several failures at its facilities, in Warren and out-of-state, to satisfy federal requirements for manufacturing processes and administrative practices that validate conformity to a device\u2019s design, and to identify nonconforming product and prevent its distribution. At Cordis\u2019s multiple facilities, the FDA noted there were incidents in which Cordis decided that laboratory test results of \u201c[o]ut-[o]f-[s]pecification\u201d for some lots were invalid, or, with respect specifically to its Florida facility, in which lots of devices with \u201c[redacted] coated defects\u201d were released without \u201cadequate data or justification\u201d for Cordis\u2019 conclusion that the nonconformity posed a minimal safety risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>According to the master complaint, in the meantime, Cordis began marketing the device. Defendants represented at medical conferences that significant endothelial regrowth occurred within thirty days of implantation, and that patients would only have to take antiplatelet drugs for ninety days. The master complaint further alleges that Cordis also promoted off-label uses. A May 2004 press release said that clinical studies \u201csuggest\u201d the device also had the \u201cpotential\u201d to \u201ctreat higher-risk and more challenging blockages\u201d and an October 2005 press release asserted that a study of patients with chronic total occlusions had better clinical outcomes with the device than with bare-metal stents. In March 2007, another press release declared that a two-year study including off-label uses showed a low rate of adverse events, and no differences in the rates of mortality or stent thrombosis between patients who had received the device for approved versus off-label uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The master complaint went on to claim that while defendants distributed those studies, they did not include information about the adverse events that the studies reported, and they withheld other relevant treatment information they had about off-label uses. For example, post-marketing studies of clinical results showed that some patients who received a drug-eluting stent did not have endothelium regrow over the stent for at least four years. Others showed that patients who were no longer taking antiplatelet drugs had significantly higher rates of heart attacks and death at eighteen to thirty-six months after implantation. Such patients also had a higher rate of stent thrombosis, which did not diminish over time, but rather increased linearly. The studies indicated that the drug coating had prevented regrowth in those patients by damaging their endothelium.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">According to the master complaint, in December 2006, the FDA convened an advisory panel, which reported an increased risk of thrombosis for drug-eluting stents from one to four years after implantation compared to bare-metal stents. The \u201crisk of all causes of death\u201d was no higher overall than for bare-metal stents, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>although the subgroup of patients who received a drug-eluting stent for off-label use had a significantly increased risk of late thrombosis \u201cassociated with death and myocardial infarction\u201d compared to patients who received such stents for approved uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Billie Cornett, Vonnie\u2019s decedent, resided in Kentucky and was presumably treated there. He had coronary artery disease that was treated with implantation of a Cypher stent on December 16, 2004. He also had diabetes, which made the use of the device in him off-label. On May 18, 2005, a cardiac catheterization disclosed a subacute thrombosis in the artery with the stent. Billie died on June 1, 2005, purportedly from subacute stent thrombosis arising from the device\u2019s implantation. As noted, Vonnie filed her complaint in September 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The Williamsons resided in Illinois. Ernie\u2019s only asserted injury was that simply having the device required long-term antiplatelet therapy and the exposure to whatever risks that might entail. Their complaint did not state the date when he received the device, name his medical condition, or assert that the use of the device in him was off-label.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">As noted, the court, applying Kentucky\u2019s statute of limitations, granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Vonnie\u2019s complaint as untimely. Plaintiffs argue the choice of law should have been that of New Jersey, which has a strong governmental interest in discouraging domestic corporations from manufacturing and distributing unsafe products within the State. Applying New Jersey\u2019s discovery rule, plaintiffs further contend that no patient is expected to understand the possibility of injury from a medical device before the medical community has reached such an understanding concerning patients with the same condition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Choice of law analysis is necessary when the statute of limitations of one potential forum would bar a claim as untimely but that of another would not. <em>Gantes v. Kason Corp., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>478, 481-82, 679 A.2d 106 (1996). In this regard, in New Jersey, the limitation period for product liability actions is two years after the cause of action \u201cshall have accrued.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-2(a); <em>Burd v. N.J. Tele. Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>284, 288, 386 A.2d 1310 (1978). New Jersey courts apply a \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d under which a cause of action does not accrue \u201cuntil the injured party discovers, or by an exercise of reasonable diligence and intelligence should have discovered that he may have a basis for an actionable claim.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Swyer, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>267, 272, 300 A.2d 563 (1973). The bases of a claim for personal injury are the plaintiffs awareness that he or she sustained an injury, and the understanding that the injury may involve another party\u2019s fault. <em>Vispisiano v. Ashland Chem. Co., </em>107 <em>N.J </em>416, 427, 527 A.2d 66 (1987). When the plaintiff is aware of a \u201c \u2018state of facts\u2019 \u201d indicating that a third party\u2019s unreasonable conduct might have contributed to the injury, \u201cmedical or legal certainty is not required.\u201d <em>Lapka v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>545, 555-56, 745 A.2d 525 (2000) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In Kentucky, on the other hand, the limitation period for a personal injury claim is one year. <em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 413.140(l)(a) (LEXIS 2010); <em>Fluke Coup. v. LeMaster, </em>306 S.W.3d 55, 60 (Ky.2010). It may be extended by another year for the representative of a decedent who died before the period ran. <em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 413.180(1) (LEXIS 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Kentucky statutes provide a discovery rule in limited circumstances that do not include product liability claims. <em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 413.140 (LEXIS 2010); <em>Fluke Corp., supra, </em>306 S.W.3d at 60-61. The discovery rule that Kentucky limits to medical malpractice claims resembles the rule that New Jersey applies to all claims: a claim accrues when \u201cthe injury is first discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered[.]\u201d <em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 413.140(2) (LEXIS 2010). However, Kentucky also imposes an outer limit of five years from when the alleged negligence occurred. <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Assuming, therefore, a reasonable probability that the application of Kentucky versus New Jersey law would have led to different results on the question of Vonnie\u2019s timeliness, we next consider which state\u2019s law applies. In <em>P.V. ex rel. T.V. and L.V. v. Camp Jaycee, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>132, 138-43, 962 A.2d 453 (2008), the Court adopted the standard in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>(1971) (Restatement) for choice-of-law questions, which was the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test. <em>See also Fu v. Fu, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>108, 119-39, 733 A.2d 1133 (1999). <em>P.V. </em>explained how the \u201cgovernmental-interest\u201d test used in <em>Gantes, F% </em>and other cases had become substantially similar to the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>\u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test, to the point that it expressly relied on the Restatement\u2019s statement of relevant factors and guiding principles. <em>P.V., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 141-42, 962 A.2d 453. Unlike a \u201cpure governmental interest analysis[,]\u201d however, in which the relative strength of each state\u2019s governmental interests was \u201cdis-positive,\u201d the <em>Restatement </em>test used additional factors in assessing the significance of each state\u2019s contacts with the matter. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Under the <em>Restatement </em>Section 146, the choice-of-law analysis in personal injury cases proceeds with the presumption that the law of the state where the injury occurred will apply \u201c \u2018unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the occurrence and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.\u2019 \u201d <em>P.V., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 141, 962 A.2d 453 (quoting <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 146). Since Section 146 ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>plies to strict liability claims for personal injury, <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 146 comment a, it therefore covers product liability actions. <em>Dorman v. Emerson Elec. Co., </em>23 <em>F.3d </em>1354, 1359 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>964, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>428, 130 L.Ed.2d 341 (1994); <em>Kozoway v. Massey-Ferguson, Inc., </em>722 <em>F.Supp. </em>641, 642-44 (D.Colo.1989); <em>McKinnon v. F.H. Morgan &amp; Co., </em>170 <em>Vt. </em>422, 750 A.2d 1026, 1028 (2000). Thus, because Billie Cornett\u2019s injury occurred in Kentucky, Section 146 recognizes that state as \u201clikely to have the predominant ... relationship to the parties and issues in the litigation.\u201d <em>P.V., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 962 A.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Nevertheless, that presumption could be overcome. The <em>Restatement </em>lists a number of contacts that must be weighed in determining the state having the more significant relationship. <em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 962 A.2d 453. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">(a) the place where the injury occurred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">(b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">(c) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\">(d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-10\"><em>[Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 145(2)(a)-(d)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">The analysis of those contacts is \u201cnot merely quantitative.\u201d <em>P.V., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 147, 962 A.2d 453. The purpose is to determine their bearing for the guiding touchstones of Section 6 of the <em>Restatement, </em>which, \u201c[rjeduced to their essence,\u201d are: \u201c(1) the interests of interstate comity; (2) the interests of the parties; (3) the interests underlying the field of tort law; (4) the interests of judicial administration; and (5) the competing interests of the states.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">In our view, the factors of Section 145 of the <em>Restatement, </em>when assessed in terms of the standards of Section 6, show that Kentucky had the more significant relationship to this case. The Cornetts were long-time Kentucky residents, and Billie received all medical care relating to his condition and the device there. Kentucky is where the stent was purchased, implanted and allegedly became blocked. <em>See Rowe v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., </em>189 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>N.J. </em>615, 629, 917 A.2d 767 (2007). This particular plaintiff was neither operated on nor injured in Kentucky by pure \u201chappenstance[,]\u201d so the place of injury could not be discounted as a fortuity. <em>P.V., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 138, 145-46, 962 A.2d 453; <em>Fu, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 137, 733 A.2d 1133. Kentucky was also the locus of the parties\u2019 relationship, because while Cordis issued its warnings and warranties from Florida, Billie and his healthcare providers received them or suffered from their omission in Kentucky. <em>Bearden v. Wyeth, </em>482 F.Supp.2d 614, 620 (E.D.Pa.2006); <em>Accord Knipe v. SmithKline Beecham, </em>583 F.Supp.2d 602, 615-16 (E.D.Pa.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">On the other hand, the fact that Cordis\u2019 parent company, J &amp; J, is headquartered and incorporated in New Jersey is of tenuous relevance absent any showing that the subsidiary is merely its corporate parent\u2019s alter ego and lacks a separate corporate existence. Nor is it sufficient that Florida-based Cordis maintains one of a number of its facilities in New Jersey without any demonstration that specific and identifiable activities in the New Jersey operation contributed to decedent\u2019s injury. In this regard, plaintiffs only allegation even remotely related to New Jersey is that Cordis\u2019 Warren facility was among five others that, after plant inspections, received warnings from the FDA about certain manufacturing processes conducted on premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In any event, while New Jersey undoubtedly has an interest in regulating the safety of any activities in Cordis\u2019 Warren facility that might have contributed to the injury, <em>see Smith v. Alza Corp., </em>400 <em>N.J.Super. </em>529, 545, 948 A.2d 686 (App.Div.2008), that concern was in competition with Kentucky\u2019s differing view of how stringently to regulate. The Kentucky product liability statutes do not have the same tests and standards as New Jersey\u2019s. <em>Compare Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 411.310 and 411.320 (LEXIS 2010) and N.J.S.A 2A:58C-2 to -4. The Kentucky statutes also bar recovery when the plaintiffs negligence was a \u201csubstantial cause\u201d of the injury, <em>Ky.Rev.Stat. Ann. </em>\u00a7 411.320(3), whereas New Jersey bars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>recovery only if the plaintiffs negligence was the predominant cause. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-5.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">These distinctions imply a different balancing of, on the one hand, the need to regulate product safety and, on the other, the need to avoid undue inhibition of the availability of products to consumers. Consequently, they reflect different \u201cinterests underlying the field of tort law[.]\u201d <em>See P.V., supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 147-50, 962 A.2d 453 (internal quotations and citations omitted) (New Jersey\u2019s strong commitment to charitable immunity reflected different priorities than those served by Pennsylvania\u2019s abrogation of the immunity). The varying statutory standards also implicate the parties\u2019 interests and expectations, because they establish different substantive standards of conduct to be observed. <em>Id. </em>at 153-54, 962 A.2d 453. Kentucky\u2019s interest in its own weighing of those concerns applies to all in-state conduct by manufacturers, regardless of whether they are residents. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 149-50, 152-53, 962 A.2d 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Applying New Jersey law would thus threaten \u201cthe values of uniformity and predictability\u201d that are the main interests of judicial administration, by impairing Kentucky\u2019s ability to regulate conduct within its borders according to its own standards. <em>Id. </em>at 153-54, 962 A.2d 453. That ability is a right to which our courts \u201chave continuously deferred\u201d notwithstanding the evolution of choice-of-law doctrines. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 962 A.2d 453. Infringement on that ability would obviously impair comity. By the same token, application of Kentucky law will not frustrate the policies of New Jersey insofar as both States\u2019 statutes of limitations are designed to bar stale claims arising out of distant occurrences while providing compensation to residents who are unlawfully injured. Moreover, New Jersey has little interest in protecting the compensation rights of a Kentucky resident. <em>See Deemer v. Silk City Textile Mach. Co., </em>193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>643, 649, 475 A.2d 648 (App.Div.1984) (\u201cNew Jersey has no interest in protecting the compensation rights of a non-domieiliary resident.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude, as did the motion judge, that the relative strength of New Jersey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>relationship with the parties and the issues compared to Kentucky\u2019s was insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of applying Kentucky law.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Even were New Jersey law to apply, we find that plaintiff would fare no better. On its face, plaintiffs September 2008 complaint, alleging decedent\u2019s May 29, 2005 death from a blood clot in Cordis\u2019 medical device diagnosed on May 18, 2005, is time-barred. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-2(a); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:31-3. Plaintiff argues, however, that the causative link would not have been discovered until December 2006 when the FDA convened an advisory panel to examine the risks of thrombosis related to drug-eluting stents, and therefore, New Jersey\u2019s equitable discovery rule should operate to defer the accrual of her cause of action. We, as did the motion judge, disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Generally, a cause of action accrues at the time of injury. <em>Tevis v. Tevis, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>422, 431, 400 A.2d 1189 (1979). This is so because awareness of one\u2019s injuries is usually \u201cimmediate and knowledge that someone is at fault is inherent in the nature of the injury or the circumstances in which it occurred.\u201d <em>Yarchak v. Trek Bicycle Corp., </em>208 F.Supp.2d 470, 479 (D.N.J.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Here, on May 18, 2005, a \u201csub acute stent thrombosis\u201d was observed \u201cin the area where the Cypher stent was placed.\u201d Thus, we may reasonably characterize the May 18, 2005 diagnosis of decedent\u2019s stent thrombosis as the date of the injury itself. The thrombosis was immediately apparent, and its diagnosis approximately five months after decedent received his stent on December 16, 2004, with no alleged intervening events, coupled with his death eleven days later, should have made plaintiff at least realize that Billie\u2019s death may have been related to a defect in the device or in its use. <em>Vispisiano, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>at 427, 527 A.2d 66. After all, this was not the situation of a toxic tort, in which the injury arises years after the exposure. Since the thrombosis occurred in the artery where the device was implanted, a lay person could have reasonably suspected a possible connection between the medical device and decedent\u2019s injury, at least to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>investigated the matter further or to have contacted counsel. Indeed, even plaintiff acknowledges that it was self-evident from the cause of death that the thrombosis or blood clot formed within the Cypher stent.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Plaintiff nevertheless contends that the cause of action did not accrue until the medical community reached a consensus as to causation. But neither medical nor legal certainty is required if the state of facts would alert a reasonable person to the possibility of an actionable claim, <em>Lapka, supra, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 555-56, 745 A.2d 525, namely, that a third party\u2019s conduct may have contributed to the injury and the conduct might have possibly been unreasonable. <em>Savage v. Old Bridge-Sayreville Med. Group, P.A., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>241, 247\u201418, 633 A.2d 514 (1993). To posit otherwise, as plaintiff does, the statute of limitations would never run unless and until the relevant medical community reaches agreement as to its understanding of the correlation between a medical product and a particular medical condition. Yet, as noted, that is clearly not the standard. Given the proper measure, the present circumstances\u2014especially the short interval of time involved\u2014lead ineluctably to the conclusion that plaintiff had reason to believe that decedent\u2019s clot may have been caused by the stent and to realize that a possible cause of action might exist against defendant. Consequently, even if New Jersey law applies, plaintiff could not avail herself of the State\u2019s equitable discovery rule to cure the untimeliness, so her cause of action falls outside both states\u2019 limitations periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The Law Division dismissed the remaining counts in the master complaint for the consolidated matters, ruling that the express preemption provision for medical devices in the federal statutes precluded all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In particular, the claimed express warranty was the patient information card and guide that the FDA had specifically approved as part of Cypher\u2019s label, so a claim \u201cthat these materials failed to conform with the materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>expressly approved by the FDA ... would be patently false.\u201d The claim for breach of express warranty was thus \u201cnothing more than a defective labeling/failure to warn claim, which is preempted\u201d for a device approved under the FDA\u2019s premarket approval regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The court further found that plaintiffs were simply declaring their claims to be parallel to federal requirements in order to invoke that exception to preemption, without using facts or legal authority to demonstrate that the standards for proving their claims were indeed equivalent to the federal requirements. Even if claims concerning off-label use were not categorically preempted, the amended complaint contained no allegations that defendants had promoted any particular off-label use.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend the court erred in finding their master complaint was preempted by federal law. They argue that federal law permits claims for violation of state-law duties that parallel federal requirements for medical devices, and that they pleaded each claim in conformity with that test. For reasons that follow, we conclude that some of plaintiffs\u2019 claims were properly dismissed as preempted, but that others should not have been rejected on a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">As a threshold matter, we note the standard of review for the dismissal of a complaint under <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, is whether the pleadings even \u201csuggestf ]\u201d a basis for the requested relief. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989). The reviewing court is assessing only the legal sufficiency of the claim, <em>Sickles v. Cabot Corp., </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 106, 877 A.2d 267 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>297, 884 A.2d 1267 (2005), so \u201c[a]t this preliminary stage of the litigation the Court is not concerned with the ability of plaintiffs to prove the allegation contained in the complaint.\u201d <em>Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31. We instead accept the factual allegations as true, <em>Sickles, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106, 877 A.2d 267, and \u201c \u2018search[ ] the complaint in depth and with liberality to ascertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>whether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 568 A.2d 31 (internal quotations and citation omitted). However, we have also cautioned that legal sufficiency requires allegation of all the facts that the cause of action requires. <em>Sickles, supra, </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 106, 877 A.2d 267. Without such allegations, the claim must be dismissed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A42\">\n<em>A.

The MDA also extended some general provisions of the FDCA to apply to devices as well as to drugs, for example, 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 351 on adulteration and 21 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 352 on misbranding. Even without regard to such modification, the FDCA\u2019s general provisions about manufacturing standards, labeling, and standing to enforce have been construed after the MDA\u2019s enactment as equally applicable to devices and drugs. <em>See, e.g., Buckman Co. v.

In addition to design controls, the manufacturer must also comply with manufacturing controls outlined at 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 814.20(b)(4) and \u00a7 820. These controls require the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a complete description of the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, storage, and where appropriate, installation of the device. As to labeling of the medical device, 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 801.5 requires a manufacturer to give adequate directions for the use of a medical device such that a \u201clayman can use a device safely for the purposes for which it is intended[,]\u201d and Section 801.15 includes requirements for how the label must appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">PMA approval thus incorporates an FDA finding that the device is safe and effective under the conditions of use included on the label and that the label is not false or misleading. 21 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 360e(d)(l)(A), (2).

The second task was to determine whether the state-law claims were \u201cbased upon\u201d state requirements that related to safety or effectiveness, and if so, whether they were \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to[,]\u201d the federal requirements. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Turning to the state claims, and distinguishing <em>Lokr, Riegel </em>observed that they were not just related to, but rather centered on, the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness in its approved use. <em>Id. </em>at 327-30, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1009-11, 169 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 904-07. Common law claims are premised on the violation of a substantive legal obligation, which in the context of a negligence or strict liability claim amount to a \u201crequirement,\u201d and 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360k preempted all such requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1007-08, 169 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 902-03. The Court reasoned that the mere existence of federal and state requirements created the potential for multiple standards of conduct for the design and marketing of devices, which was precisely what Congress intended to avoid. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1007-08, 169 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 902-03. It was irrelevant that the state common law obligations applied to all products rather than just medical devices, because 21 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 360k prohibited any state requirement whenever there was a federal requirement specific to devices, no matter how general the state requirement may be. <em>Id. </em>at 327-28, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1009-10, 169 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 905. Thus, the Court interpreted the statutory language as preempting all state causes of action that created the possibility of \u201ca jury determination that the FDA-approved labeling for a pacemaker violated a state common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>requirement for additional warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1011, 169 L.Ed.2d at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><em>Riegel </em>expressly recognized that its interpretation of 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360k would categorically deny judicial redress under state law for consumers injured by devices to which the FDA gave premarket approval. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1008-09, 169 L.Ed.2d at 904. The Court believed that the statutory language \u201csuggests that the solicitude for those injured by\u201d such devices \u201cwas overcome in Congress\u2019s estimation by solicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1009, 169 <em>L.Ed.2 </em>d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Having said all that, <em>Riegel </em>did not strip plaintiffs of any and all recourse for injuries from a medical device. To the contrary, the Court expressly held that the MDA preempted only state claims that applied substantive standards of liability <em>different </em>from the federal requirements specific to devices. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1011, 169 L.Ed.2d at 906. <em>Riegel </em>agreed with <em>Lohr </em>that the \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d language in 21 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 360k meant that the statute \u201cdoes not prevent a State from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of FDA regulations!;,]\u201d because \u201cthe state duties in such a ease \u2018parallel,\u2019 rather than add to, federal requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Lohr, supra, </em>518 <em>U.S. </em>at 495, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2255, 135 L.Ed.2d at 721). <em>Riegel </em>did not, however, reach the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that their state claims were parallel; it deemed them waived for lack of prior assertion. <em>Supra, </em>552 <em>U.S. </em>at 330, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1011, 169 L.Ed.2d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\"><em>Lohr </em>and <em>Riegel </em>did not involve a claim that a device\u2019s manufacturer had intended or promoted an off-label use.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Buckman </em>did, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>although the device had been approved as a substantial equivalent rather than under the PMA regime. Because such approval did not reflect any federal requirements for demonstrating safety or effectiveness, and with which the plaintiffs state law claims could conflict, such claims arguably were not <em>expressly </em>preempted by \u00a7 360k(a). But that did not end the inquiry because even though not expressly preempted, such claim may be <em>impliedly </em>preempted. <em>Buckman, supra, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>at 347-48, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1017, 148 L.Ed.2d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In <em>Buckman, </em>the plaintiff premised his state cause of action on the claimed federal violation that the manufacturer had committed \u201cfraud on the FDA\u201d by failing to disclose that it intended the device for off-label uses. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court explained that \u201c[p]olicing fraud against federal agencies\u201d was not a traditional field of primarily state regulation, which meant that \u201cthe relationship between a federal agency and the entity it regulates is inherently federal in character\u201d and therefore, actionable only under federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 347-48, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1017, 148 L.Ed.2d at 860-61. A state cause of action for fraud on the FDA, including failure to disclose intended off-label uses, would conflict with the flexibility that Congress granted the FDA for two reasons: to balance the regulation of devices that had \u201cpotentially beneficial off-label uses\u201d against the concern that \u201cunpredictable civil liability\u201d for off-label use would discourage manufacturers from seeking approval of substantially equivalent devices even for approved uses, and to avoid discouraging physicians from off-label uses despite their legality under 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 396. <em>Id. </em>at 348-51, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1017-19, 148 L.Ed.2d at 861-63. <em>Lohr\u2019s </em>presumption against the preemption of state causes of action accordingly did not apply, so implied preemption due to the conflict with federal law sufficed to preclude the plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>Id. </em>at 348, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1017, 148 L.Ed.2d at 861. For that reason, <em>Buckman </em>declined to address whether the express preemption of 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360k also applied. <em>Id. </em>at 348 n. 2, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1017 n. 2, 148 L.Ed.2d at 861 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Buckman </em>distinguished the fraud claims before it, which \u201cexist solely by virtue of the FDCA disclosure requirements!,]\u201d from the claims in <em>Lohr </em>that \u201carose from the manufacturer\u2019s alleged failure to use reasonable care in the production of the product, not solely from the violation of FDCA requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352-53, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1019-20, 148 L.Ed.2d at 864. The state causes of action that had to be preempted, because they were in effect no more than <em>per se </em>claims for violation of a federal requirement, such as the fraud claim before it, were thus distinguishable from \u201cstate-law causes of actions that parallel federal safety requirements\u201d as <em>Lohr </em>described. <em>Id. </em>at 353, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1020, 148 L.Ed.2d at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Furthermore, <em>Buckman </em>addressed a detail about \u201cparallel\u201d state claims that <em>Lohr </em>did not have to reach. <em>Buckman </em>explained that a claim describes a \u201ctraditional\u201d state law cause of action not simply because it contains required elements for the manufacturer\u2019s conduct beyond the violation of a federal requirement, but rather because it would provide the required elements of a state cause of action even with no reference to federal requirements as the measure of the reasonableness or wrongfulness of the manufacturer\u2019s conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1019, 148 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 863 (distinguishing claim in <em>Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp., </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>238, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984), that relied on \u201ctraditional state tort law principles of the duty of care owed by the producer of plutonium fuel pins to an employee working in its plant,\u201d and \u201cwas not based on any sort of fraud-on-the-agency theory\u201d). Regardless of how the plaintiff styles a state claim, if it is a claim that could not be articulated but for the existence of a federal requirement that was allegedly violated, it is functionally equivalent to a claim that is grounded solely on the federal violation, and is therefore impliedly preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 352-53, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1019-20, 148 L.Ed.2d at 864. <em>See also Riley, supra, </em>625 F.Supp.2d at 776-77 <em>(Buckman </em>imposed implied preemption on state claims that \u201cwould not exist if the FDCA did not exist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">To recap, as construed by <em>Lohr, Riegel, </em>and <em>Buckman, </em>the federal statutes and regulations apply to a Class III device that must receive premarket approval (a PMA device), and preempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>state claims based on requirements different than, or in addition to, those inhering in the FDA\u2019s premarket approval. Such approval encompasses the device\u2019s design, manufacturing methods, and label, including the information to be given to patients. It represents the FDA\u2019s determination that the manufacturer\u2019s clinical trials have shown the device to be safe and effective for its intended use, and that the label is accurate and contains adequate warnings against unsafe uses. Deviations from the approved design and manufacturing process make a device \u201cadulterated\u201d and deviation from the approved label make it \u201cmisbranded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">PMA approval imposes a continuing duty on the manufacturer to report adverse events relating to the device that it knows or should know, as well as any studies or investigations about the device\u2019s safety or effectiveness. However, if such information indicates the need for an enhanced warning, the manufacturer must seek FDA approval before adding it to the label. Manufacturers have a safe harbor for promoting an off-label use, namely, distributing certain clinical study reports to physicians, as long as they also seek FDA approval for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The requirements for a PMA device are \u201cdevice-specific\u201d because they focus on the safety and effectiveness of such devices, and are applied to each device\u2019s particular characteristics. They are not the generic standards applied by the FDA to \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d devices. Therefore, to avoid the statutory preemption of state requirements that vary from federal requirements, a state claim concerning PMA devices must be parallel to the federal requirements, meaning that the state requirements it embodies must not impose any duty on the manufacturer beyond satisfying the federal requirements. However, to avoid the implied preemption of claims outside the traditional areas of state regulation, a claim concerning PMA devices must also represent a traditional state cause of action that would impose a duty on the manufacturer even if there were no federal requirements at all to be referenced, much less violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">While plaintiffs are correct that the FDA does not literally \u201capprove\u201d off-label uses, because approval would axiomatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>make them label uses, they are incorrect to argue that the absence of affirmative approval mandates the finding that no federal requirements exist. Federal requirements for off-label use manifestly exist, in the form of the safe harbor for their promotion, and the obligation to seek a supplemental PMA to add warnings to the label for off-label uses even when the manufacturer has no desire to promote them. Furthermore, plaintiffs\u2019 argument presumes off-label use to be inherently suspect or substandard, which Congress rejected by enacting 21 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7 396 to protect off-label use. <em>See Buckman, supra, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>at 350-51, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1018-19, 148 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 862-63. <em>See also Riley, supra, </em>625 F.Supp.2d at 777-78 (\u201c[gjiven what the Supreme Court said in <em>Buckman </em>about the off-label use of medical devices, it seems highly unlikely\u201d that the Court intended in <em>Riegel </em>to declare off-label use a vacuum of federal requirements and therefore, broadly amenable to state claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\n<em>C. Application of the federal law to plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>5</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Plaintiffs brought their striet-liability claims under the Product Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-1 to -ll(PLA), which governs all claims for harm caused by a product other than claims for breach of an express warranty. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:58C-l(b)(3). The allowable theories are that a product was harmful because it \u201cdeviated from the design specifications, formulae, or performance standards of the manufacturer or from otherwise identical units manufactured to the same manufacturing specifications or formulae[;]\u201d that it \u201cfailed to contain adequate warnings or instructions[;]\u201d or that it \u201cwas designed in a defective manner.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:58C-2. The standard of liability is that the product \u201cwas not reasonably fit, suitable or safe for its intended purpose[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\n<em>(i) Design Defect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Plaintiffs alleged that Cypher\u2019s design was less safe and no more effective than bare-metal stents or drug-eluting stents using different polymer coating, as well as alternative medical treatments not involving stents, because, among other things, the polymer allegedly prevents healing of the artery and results in blood clots. The PLA would allow a jury to agree, without regard to the federal requirements for PMA approval, and without regard to any determination the FDA may have made that the device\u2019s design had advantages compared to the alternatives that justified a certain degree of increased risks. Because the PLA is a state law that provides a different standard for the adequacy of the device\u2019s design than the federal requirements, plaintiffs\u2019 design defect claim is not \u201cparallel\u201d to them and is thus squarely within Riegel\u2019s preemption holding. <em>Brooks v. Howmedica, Inc., </em>273 <em>F.3d </em>785, 796 (8th Cir.2001) (stating a claim that would allow a jury to require a different component in a PMA device is \u201csurely\u201d preempted by Section 360k), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 <em>U.S. </em>1056, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>1914, 152 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>823 (2002); <em>Funk v.

Arrow Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>641 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>1270, 1285-86 (M.D.Fla.2009) (same); <em>In re Medtronic, Inc., </em>592 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>1147, 1162-64 (D.Minn.2009) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\n<em>(ii) Manufacturing Defect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Unlike their claim for design defect, plaintiffs limit their allegations of manufacturing defect to what the FDA warning letter identifies as potential deviations from the device\u2019s approved design and manufacturing processes, or from the federal requirements under 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 820, 814.20(b)(4), and 814.39 on manufacturing practices crafted to identify and prevent product deviations. This claim reflects the traditional state regulation of the sale of adulterated products. In effect, it incorporates the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>requirements of having to maintain fidelity to the manufacturer\u2019s own design and performance standards without allowing an alternative measure of the manufacturer\u2019s duty. The additional requirement that this state claim imposed on plaintiffs, proving that the deviations actually rendered the device unsafe or unsuitable for the intended uses, was acceptable because it narrowed the circumstances in which manufacturers could be liable compared to the federal scheme, instead of enlarging them.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">A state claim with that effect is therefore parallel under <em>Rie</em>gel\u2019s construction of <em>Lohr </em>and not preempted. <em>Hofts v. Howmedica Osteonics Corp., </em>597 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>830, 836-37 (S.D.Ind.2009). <em>Cf. Wolicki-Gables, supra, </em>641 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 1285 (holding that a manufacturing defect claim was preempted because state law allowed liability even without violation of federal requirements); <em>Horowitz v. Stryker Corp., </em>613 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>271, 282-83 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding a claim was allowable as parallel, but the pleading of causation failed to satisfy federal standards). Indeed, the court in <em>Hofts, supra, </em>held that a manufacturing defect claim, based on an allegation that the device was adulterated due to failure to comply with federal regulations, was not preempted because a jury could find the defendants breached their duty of care to the plaintiff and that the product was unreasonably dangerous without imposing different or additional requirements. 597 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 836-37. <em>See also Riley, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 789 (recognizing that a properly pled manufacturing defect claim may not be preempted and allowing the plaintiffs leave to replead their claim). Here, contrary to defendant\u2019s contention, plaintiffs\u2019 manufacturing defect claim was sufficiently pleaded, because the amended master complaint incorporated the FDA warning letter\u2019s assertion of manufacturing defects that could have affected the device\u2019s safety, in particular those concerning its polymer coating, along with inadequate controls to prevent or track the release of nonconforming product.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\n<em>(Hi) Failure to Warn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The PLA is a strict-liability standard that focuses on \u201cthe actual condition of the product\u201d rather than on the reasonableness of the manufacturer\u2019s conduct. <em>Coffman v. Keene Corp., </em>133 <em>N.J. 581, 598, 628 A.2d 710 (1993). </em>Thus, the manufacturer has a duty to warn of \u201cdangers\u201d that it knew, or that it \u201cshould have known on the basis of reasonably obtainable or available knowledge.\u201d <em>Feldman v. Lederle Labs., 97 N.J. </em>429, 434, 479 A.2d 374 (1984). It satisfies that duty by giving \u201can adequate warning or instruction.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">A warning that \u201chas been approved or prescribed by\u201d the FDA under the FDCA carries a rebuttable presumption of adequacy. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cFor all practical purposes, absent deliberate concealment or nondisclosure of after-acquired knowledge of harmful effects, compliance with FDA standards should be virtually dispositive of such claims.\u201d <em>Perez v. Wyeth Labs., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>1, 25, 734 A.2d 1245 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">The warnings that plaintiffs allege defendants had a duty to provide related to the duration of antiplatelet therapy needed to ensure the regrowth of endothelium over the device, or to the lack of comparative safety studies of the polymer coating used by Cordis versus the alternatives. The FDA did not require defendants to provide such information for its review of the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness, or to place such information on the label or the patient information materials. The FDCA\u2019s rebuttable presumption thus barred a claim about the failure to give such warnings for approved uses in the absence of deliberate nondisclosure, and such a claim was also expressly preempted under <em>Riegel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>as an additional state requirement on defendants. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>669 F.Supp.2d at 710; <em>Riley, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 780-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">However, when the claim about the failure to warn for approved uses was combined with allegations of nondisclosure, it became a claim within a traditional area of state regulation that would have existed even in the absence of federal requirements. To that extent, it satisfied Buckman\u2019s test for avoiding implied preemption as a claim that amounted to no more than \u201cfraud on the FDA.\u201d <em>Hughes, supra, </em>669 F.Supp.2d at 709-10. While it is true that the \u201cmisconduct\u201d underlying plaintiffs\u2019 claims also constitutes a violation of federal regulations\u2014indeed that is precisely why the claims are parallel\u2014the suit was brought to vindicate plaintiffs\u2019 rights, not the FDA\u2019s. Plaintiffs adequately pled that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On this score, we also take issue with the Law Division\u2019s holding that plaintiffs\u2019 pleading failed to overcome the presumption that the device\u2019s FDA-approved label was adequate. The basis for the court\u2019s ruling was that the FDA, notwithstanding defendants\u2019 alleged withholding of information and failure to provide warnings about off-label use, was otherwise \u201cwell informed\u201d that the off-label use of the device was \u201cprevalent.\u201d The court found further that plaintiffs had \u201cnot provided enough evidence to show\u201d that defendants had acted deliberately, which was required for overcoming the presumption. We disagree with the court\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">As already noted, 21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360i requires defendants to submit information after approval that reasonably suggested adverse device experiences. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint clearly implied that defendants commissioned post-marketing studies that contained reportable adverse experiences, and further alleged that these studies demonstrate the label\u2019s inadequacy concerning the need for extended antiplatelet therapy, even for approved uses. While defendants supposedly withheld them from the FDA and the advisory panel, they allegedly distributed altered versions of them to physicians, to promote both approved and off-label uses with misrepresentations about the length of antiplatelet therapy and about overall safety. According to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>mission of the studies as federal law required would have caused the FDA to improve the label, and any heightened warnings concerning approved uses would also have increased the safety of off-label uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The conduct and consequences that plaintiffs alleged constituted the kind of deliberate nondisclosure needed to overcome the PLA\u2019s presumption of adequacy for an FDA-approved label. <em>Perez, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 734 A.2d 1245. The allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint must be accepted as true on a motion to dismiss, and as such, the complaint sufficiently pled such deliberate violations of defendants\u2019 federal responsibilities to rebut the presumption. The Law Division erred in requiring plaintiffs to <em>prove </em>such deliberate nondisclosures at the motion to dismiss stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Turning to off-label uses, the PLA permits claims only relating to a product\u2019s \u201cintended purpose.\u201d As discussed above, federal law does not treat an off-label use as \u201cintended\u201d when the manufacturer simply has knowledge of it or is promoting it within the safe harbor. Any basis for treating such circumstances as an intended use of the product for PLA purposes would be invalid under <em>Riegel </em>for imposing duties on the manufacturer in addition to the federal requirements. In other words, under federal law manufacturers are \u201cobligated to warn only about intended uses, and, under the safe harbor, evidence of the dissemination of information about an off-label use [is] deemed not to be evidence of an intended use that was different from the use on the label.\u201d <em>Riley, supra, </em>625 F.Supp.2d at 782; <em>see also </em>21 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 360aaa-6(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">On this score, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 argument that because \u00a7 360k(a) only applies when a medical device is used in a manner that was reviewed and approved by the FDA, then \u00a7 360k(a) should not preempt any of their claims against defendants arising out of the off-label use of the Cypher stent. <em>See Riley, supra, </em>625 F.Supp.2d at 777. Indeed, in <em>Riegel, supra, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were found to be preempted by \u00a7 360k(a) even though the balloon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>catheter at issue there had been used off-label. 552 <em>U.S. </em>at 320, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1005, 169 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 900. And in <em>Buckman, supra, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that off-label usage is not illegal or even disfavored under federal law. 531 <em>U.S. </em>at 350-51, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1018-19, 148 L.Ed.2d at 862-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">It is, however, only when the manufacturer promotes an off-label use without abiding the requirements or limitations of the safe harbor that federal law regards the off-label use as an intended use, triggering the duty to provide instructions or warnings about that off-label use. <em>Riley, supra, </em>625 F.Supp.2d at 781-82. All such activity is in violation of the federal requirements, so the PLA would then be a parallel requirement, while also reflecting a traditional state law cause of action. A claim that promotion of off-label use beyond the safe harbor was coupled with a failure to warn would not be preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 783-84. (\u201cInsofar as [plaintiff] sufficiently alleges that, in the course of unlawfully promoting the Cypher stent for off-label use, Cordis failed to adequately warn of foreseeable dangers of that use, [plaintiff] may succeed in asserting a claim that is neither expressly or impliedly preempted.\u201d) The federal violation did not have to be the withholding of information from the FDA, because there were other ways in which promotion could exceed the safe harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Here, plaintiffs alleged Billie Cornett was a diabetic and while the Cypher stent was not FDA-approved for marketing or use in diabetics, defendants marketed the device for such use.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If that were the extent of the allegation, it would not have succeeded as preempted because, as noted, the lack of federal requirements does not mean off-label marketing is prohibited entirely. To the contrary, the FDA\u2019s failure to require adequate off-label warnings for devices promoted within the safe harbor is a deliberative decision in and of itself that warrants preemptive force. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 complaint goes <em>much </em>further.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs also allege that defendants affirmatively promoted the off-label use of the Cypher stent in a manner that violated federal law, specifically 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 99.101, 803.10(c), 803.50, 814.39; that defendants were aware or should have been aware of the dangers inherent in the off-label uses from post-approval studies they performed revealing a significant adverse event rate associated with their device\u2019s unapproved uses yet affirmatively represented that there were \u201cno stent thrombosis or mortality differences between the off-label [ ] subgroups ... [and] indicated <em>[ie. </em>on-label subgroups] ..and that while marketing the device in violation of federal law, defendants failed to include adequate warnings about the off-label use they were promoting. Under the liberal standard of review for a motion to dismiss, we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of off-label promotion without adequate warnings was a sufficient pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\n<em>(iv) Breach of Express Warranty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Like other state requirements that exceed federal requirements for a PMA device, a state claim that allows liability for statements in the FDA-approved label and other documentation is preempted. <em>Riley, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 787-88 (noting split among decisions that pre-dated Riegel); <em>Horowitz, supra, </em>613 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 285. Thus, to the extent plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleges that an express warranty was created by a \u201cpatient information guide\u201d and a \u201cproduct identification card,\u201d it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>preempted because the FDA already reviewed and approved this information as part of the device\u2019s labeling in conjunction with the Cypher\u2019s PMA. Accordingly, that part of plaintiffs\u2019 express warranty claims premised on the contents of the Cypher\u2019s \u201clabel\u201d squarely conflicts with the FDA\u2019s PMA of the Cypher and its labeling and is therefore preempted by \u00a7 360k(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">However, a claim for breach of express warranty based on voluntary statements, meaning any statement that the FDA did not approve or mandate, is not preempted. <em>Riley, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 788; <em>Horowitz, supra, </em>613 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 285-86 (the claim foundered instead on a peculiarity of state law). This would apply for voluntary statements concerning approved uses, and for voluntary statements concerning off-label uses that were outside the safe harbor. \u201cFederal law already requires Cordis to ensure that any warranty statements it voluntarily makes are truthful, accurate, not misleading, and consistent with applicable federal and state law.\u201d <em>Riley, supra, </em>625 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 788. Therefore, to the extent plaintiffs seek to impose liability on defendants for voluntarily making warranties, plaintiffs are not imposing any different or additional requirements on defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\n<em>(v) Breach of Implied Warranty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The preclusion of breach of implied warranty by federal law is moot, because the PLA subsumed those claims. With the sole exception of its accommodation for breach of express warranty, the PLA displaces all other causes of action \u201cfor harm caused by a product, irrespective of the theory underlying the claimf.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-l(b)(3). This preclusion of breach of implied warranty \u201cas a viable separate claim\u201d is \u201cdefinitive.\u201d <em>Tirrell v. Navistar Int% Inc., </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 398, 591 A.2d 643 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>390, 599 A.2d 166 (1991). <em>Accord Koruba v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., </em>396 <em>N.J.Super. </em>517, 531, 935 A.2d 787 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>272, 944 A.2d 32 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\n<em>(vi) PLA Punitive Damages</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For PMA devices, the PLA allows punitive damages only \u201cwhere the product manufacturer knowingly withheld or misrepresented information required to be submitted under the [FDA]\u2019s regulations, which information was material and relevant to the harm in question[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-5(c). Instead of making punitive damages an aspect of a common-law claim for compensatory damages (or of the statutory replacement for such a claim), the Legislature enacted a separate statute that was \u201cnarrowly drawn\u201d with \u201cthe single focus upon fraud on the FDA\u201d as unlawful conduct that the State had an interest in punishing. <em>McDarby, supra, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 90-93, 949 A.2d 223. <em>Buckman </em>accordingly precludes all claims that the FDA would have responded differently to an application if the manufacturer had fully and accurately provided all the information that federal law required. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, 949 A.2d 223. That is the nature of the punitive damages claim here, and consequently such a claim is preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\n<em>(vii) Wrongful Death, Loss of Consortium and Survivorship</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">The Law Division dismissed these claims solely for being derivative of the strict liability and breach of warranty claims it found expressly preempted. Thus, to the extent the predicate causes of action survive defendants\u2019 preemption challenge, the derivative claims for wrongful death, loss of consortium and survivorship must stand as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">In sum, we find the following claims of plaintiffs not to be preempted: manufacturing defect; failure to warn concerning both approved and off-label uses, to the extent that plaintiffs based it on allegations of failure to satisfy federal requirements on disclosure or federal limitations on off-label promotion within the safe harbor, respectively; and breach of express warranty, to the extent that plaintiffs based it on voluntary statements relating to approved uses, or on voluntary statements about off-label uses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>that were outside the safe harbor. As noted, reversal of the <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e) dismissal of these predicate claims compels reinstatement of plaintiffs\u2019 derivative claims for wrongful death, loss of consortium, and survivorship. The dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims, however, was proper as either federally preempted or precluded by the PLA itself. Lastly, the dismissal of plaintiff Cornett\u2019s complaint as untimely was required under both Kentucky\u2019s and New Jersey\u2019s law of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Affirmed in part; reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"> Plaintiffs do not appeal the dismissal of their Consumer Fraud Act claim, apparently due to our ruling that failure to warn may only be asserted as a product liability claim. <em>McDarby v. Merck, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 94-98, 949 A.2d 223 (App.Div.2008), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>267, 979 A.2d 766 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\"> While Kentucky courts have sometimes applied a discovery rule to avoid legislative infringement of common-law causes of action that existed prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>adoption of the state constitution, they have not extended that principle to \"new [statutory] rights unknown at common law.\" <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Oberle-Jordre Co., </em>910 S.W.2d 241, 243 (Ky.1995).
