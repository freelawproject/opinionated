The court sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of fifty years, with an eighty-five percent period of parole ineligibility and a five-year period of parole supervision, both pursuant to the No Early Release Act (\u00d1ERA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. The court also imposed the relevant mandatory fines and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Defendant now challenges his conviction and sentence on appeal. Although we reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on other grounds, because defendant presumably will be tried anew on these charges, we also address defendant\u2019s attack on the trial court\u2019s admission of DNA evidence presented by the State as part of its case against him. Specifically, we hold that the trial court correctly admitted Y-STR DNA evidence, in the form of biological material found under the victim\u2019s fingernails, under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702 and the standards established by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Harvey, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>117, 167, 699 A.2d 596 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1085, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>811, 145 L.Ed.2d 683 (2000). The trial court thus correctly admitted the testimony of the State\u2019s expert witness, who opined that this DNA evidence showed that defendant could not be excluded as a \u201cdonor\u201d of the biological material.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We derive the following facts from the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In October 2005, defendant shared his marital residence in the Township of Holmdel with his wife Susan and their eight-year-old daughter \u201cAna\u201d (a fictitious appellation to protect the child\u2019s privacy). At that time, defendant was employed as the director of sales and marketing for a computer software company. Susan was described by those who knew her as a \u201cstay-at-home mom\u201d who took an active part in her daughter\u2019s social and academic life.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">At approximately 6:15 a.m. on October 21, 2005, defendant telephoned the 911 Center at the Monmouth County Sheriffs Department to report that his wife was missing. The call was referred to the Holmdel Police Department which in turn dispatched Patrolman David D\u2019Arcy to the Calleia residence. As D\u2019Arcy approached the house, defendant opened the door and motioned for him to come inside. Once inside the house, defendant told D\u2019Arey that his wife Susan was missing. Defendant stated that he first became aware of her absence when he entered the garage at 5:30 a.m. to leave for work and discovered that Susan\u2019s car was gone. He then searched the house to confirm that she was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">In response to D\u2019Arcy\u2019s questions, defendant indicated that the last time he had seen his wife was the previous evening. He had been watching television while waiting for her to return home; defendant was upset because she had left without telling him where she was going. When Susan returned home at around 8:00 p.m., they had a \u201cverbal dispute\u201d that they \u201cresolved,\u201d and then defendant went upstairs to bed. During further questioning by D\u2019Arcy, defendant indicated that his wife had no history of mental illness, was in good physical health, and was not taking any medication. D\u2019Arcy described defendant\u2019s demeanor during this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>encounter as \u201cvery nervous\u201d; he was trembling, spoke in a subdued tone, and persistently looked at the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">D\u2019Arcy returned to the police station and shared the information he had obtained with the detective bureau. As a result, the Holmdel Police Department issued an alert or \u201cTRAK message,\u201d indicating that defendant had reported his wife, Susan Calleia, missing; her name was also entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> database. Later on the morning of October 21, 2005, Holmdel detectives contacted the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office to request assistance with their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">At approximately 4:00 p.m., Detective Sergeant Brian Veprek, who was assigned to the major crimes unit in the prosecutor\u2019s office, reported to the Calleia residence, where Holmdel Detective Sergeant James Smythe briefed him on the case. Veprek testified that when he extended his right hand to shake defendant\u2019s hand, defendant did not extend his hand in return and did not shake Veprek\u2019s hand. Veprek recalled that defendant was wearing a long-sleeved white shirt that hung below the tips of his fingers on both hands. He also noted that defendant continually looked down without making eye contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Veprek and Smythe told defendant that they would like to obtain a formal statement from him concerning his wife\u2019s disappearance and asked him to accompany them to the police station. According to Veprek, defendant asked if it was really necessary since this was \u201cjust a missing persons investigation.\u201d Defendant then stated: \u201cI\u2019m not going to your house, I\u2019ve seen Law and Order and NYPD Blue, and I know what happens when I\u2019m in your house.\u201d Veprek asked defendant if a secretary from his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>office could come to his home with a computer to take his statement; defendant agreed, stating: \u201cif it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The secretary arrived at the Calleia house at approximately 4:53 p.m. Defendant\u2019s statement consisted of his answers to questions posed to him by the interrogating officers; it covered seventeen pages and was taken down verbatim by the secretary using a laptop computer. The interview lasted one hour and thirty-four minutes, with a one-minute break to permit defendant to walk the family dog. The statement concluded at 6:27 p.m. It is important to note that at the time he gave this statement, the police had no reason to believe that defendant was in any way responsible for his wife\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Responding to Veprek\u2019s direct questions, defendant indicated that he arrived at his house the night before his wife\u2019s disappearance at approximately 6:20 p.m. When he entered the residence through the garage, he noticed that his wife was home. He encountered Susan in the \u201claundry room/kitchen area,\u201d where she told him that she was going out for \u201cthree maybe four hours and [he] asked her where she was going and she said she was late and she had to go.\u201d She did not tell him where she was going and left without further incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">When asked to describe \u201cthe tone of the conversation,\u201d defendant rejected the interrogating officer\u2019s characterization of the exchange as a \u201cconversation,\u201d describing the interaction instead as something his wife said to him as she was walking out of the house. He described her demeanor as \u201c[c]asual cordial\u201d and denied that either one of them \u201cscreamed\u201d or \u201chollered\u201d at the other. He admitted, however, that it was unusual for his wife to leave the house without telling him where she was going. When asked: \u201cHow did it make you feel when your wife told you that she was leaving for three or four hours and did not tell you where she was going,\u201d defendant responded: \u201cConcerned <em>... I don\u2019t </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>know if she didn\u2019t want to tell me </em>or if she was in too much of a rush to tell me. But I was concerned.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The next and last time defendant saw his wife alive was at approximately eight o'clock that same night. He gave the following description of the encounter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">About 8:10 [p.m.] is when my wife came home and that is when I asked her where she was and [told her] that I was concerned and that the car got stuck the other day, and you should have told me where you were [\u2018pause I was concerned. <em>Stis said I don\u2019t have to tell you where I was, I don't ask you where you go. </em>1 said yes you do and I always tell you. What I didn\u2019t tell you [before] was when she came in she was agitated so I don\u2019t know where she was or what transpired but she was very agitated when she came back. She said she wasn\u2019t in a good mood and I said could you tell me why, what happened, where did you go. And then what I said before, I went backwards I put one thing in front of the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">[(Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">When asked to explain how his wife was agitated, defendant simply responded: \u201cBy the way she was putting her stuff [jacket and notepad] down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">Defendant described his relationship with his wife as \u201ccordial\u201d and \u201cfriendly.\u201d By contrast, he described his marriage as \u201cstrained\u201d and not \u201cas close as we used to be.\u201d The following exchange illuminates this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">What has separated you and your wife that you are not as close as you used to be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">Good question. I think it was on her part, it was an aceumulation[.] She said in the past (sic). I spent twentyHfive years in one firm, and it was a merger and the other firm took control and for the past year and a half[,] two years I have been very depressed over the fact that people that I have worked with for twenty years have been let go, the management, the people don\u2019t know the business. They are trying to run it, they don\u2019t understand it. It wasn\u2019t a happy time. So what I mean is by it was not a happy time for me is that I might have neglected my wife f\u2018]eause I was focused on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-12\">What are the sleeping arrangements between you and your wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-13\">For about a month we have been in separate beds in separate parts of the house.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">When asked what led him to think that his wife was \u201cmissing,\u201d defendant indicated that he noticed that her car was not parked in the garage and that she was not otherwise in the house. Thereafter, following the advice of the officer who responded to his 911 call, he followed his morning routine. Defendant took his daughter to school at approximately 7:30 a.m., returned home therefrom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>at about 8:20 a.m., and \u201cdrove around [for about 45 minutes] but stayed home most of the day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">He called his wife\u2019s cell phone two or three times in the early afternoon hours. When asked why he did not call his wife on her cell phone before calling the police, defendant responded that he was <em>\u201cin shock that she wasn\u2019t there and I just thought that if she wasn\u2019t there it can\u2019t be good.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). When asked to clarify what he meant by this, defendant stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">She has never been out of the house, never, in the morning, never not seen her or her car whatever. I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I thought, I don\u2019t know what I thought. I was in shock.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">In response to questions regarding the argument he and his wife had the night before her disappearance, defendant indicated that his daughter was awakened because \u201c[w]e were getting so loud.\u201d He told her to go back to sleep and he and his wife returned to the \u201claundry room/garage.\u201d Although he did not remember whether the garage overhead doors were open, he recalled that he could see \u201cthe light from the street.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">There was a one minute break at this point in the interrogation, from 5:43 p.m. to 5:44 p.m. When the interrogation resumed, the police refocused the conversation on evidence concerning Susan\u2019s activities. According to defendant, the spare bedroom appeared unused, thus leading him to think that his wife had not slept there during the night. As to her personal items, although defendant did not know whether any of her toiletries had been taken, her pocketbook, which held her credit cards, was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The interrogation next focused on the stability of the marriage. According to defendant, his wife voluntarily told him that she was not seeing anyone else. When asked whether his wife had ever asked him for a separation or divorce, defendant responded: \u201cShe says she needs her space. Those are her words, never said separated or divorce.\u201d When asked whether he or his wife had seen or consulted with an attorney, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t, my wife said she wanted to speak to somebody just to find out any implications about buying another house.\u201d He assumed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>reference to \u201cseeing somebody\u201d meant consulting with an attorney. With respect to their daughter, defendant indicated that they had discussed a joint custody arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Despite the fact that he and his wife had been sleeping in separate bedrooms and were discussing issues such as child custody and maintaining separate residences, defendant claimed that \u201c[f]or the past couple of weeks things have been getting nice again.\u201d He further stated that \u201c[u]p until a month ago I thought everything was good.\u201d Overall, defendant denied ever physically assaulting his wife and denied having any knowledge of what could have caused her disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">At the end of the interrogation, the police gave defendant a printed copy of the statement, asked him to review it and initial each page, and requested that he sign the affirmation indicating that \u201cthe facts contained herein are true.\u201d Defendant read the statement as requested, but he initialed only pages 1-7 of this seventeen page document; he also refused to sign the affirmation, writing instead: \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable signing all of the pages or the end without an attorney present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">As the detectives were leaving his home, defendant suddenly said: \u201cI think my wife was abducted at 5:30 this morning while going to Welsh Farms to get milk.\u201d According to Veprek, defendant also asked how they \u201cwere making out\u201d on the burglaries that had occurred on Goldsmith Drive. Smythe replied that an investigation was underway and that an arrest was expected soon. Defendant then stated that during the summer, someone had tried to break into his house and perhaps Susan\u2019s disappearance was tied to that alleged incident. When Smythe asked him why he had not mentioned these things before, defendant replied that he did not think that they were important.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Veprek and Smythe returned to the Calleia residence at 3:20 a.m. on October 22, 2005, with a warrant to search the premises. They were accompanied by other detectives from the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>office, patrol officers and detectives from Holmdel, and personnel from the New Jersey State Police Laboratory. When defendant opened the door, he was wearing the same long-sleeved white shirt he had worn the previous day. He kept both of his hands inside the sleeves of the shirt or in the pockets of his sweatshirt. Veprek and Smythe accompanied defendant to wake his daughter and take her to a neighbor\u2019s house. Defendant returned home and stayed there throughout the search; he was accompanied at all times by Veprek and Smythe.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">At one point, defendant asked Veprek if he could change his clothes. Veprek advised him that he had to escort him to observe that nothing was tampered with or removed. Veprek and defendant went into defendant\u2019s bedroom closet while Smythe stood in the doorway. Veprek took out the clothes that defendant requested and handed them to him. When defendant reached out to take the clothes with his right hand, Veprek and Smythe observed that his right hand was badly swollen and had a large cut just below the middle knuckle of his middle finger. In response to Veprek\u2019s question about the injury, defendant indicated that he received it when he had punched a wall in his house during the argument with his wife the night before her disappearance. According to Smythe, when he asked defendant to show him the wall so that the police could \u201cproperly document that and have it photographed and videotaped,\u201d defendant \u201c[f]or the first time with (sic) our interaction he looked up and stared at [the detectives] for a good five seconds ... [t]hen he looked back down at the ground.\u201d At this point, Smythe commented to defendant that the injury \u201clooked like it was from someone\u2019s teeth.\u201d Both Smythe and Veprek testified that defendant then said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">I want to recant what I just told you ... I backhanded Susan in the face on Thursday night in the garage. That is why she left the residence and did not return ... I want to recant that ... I went to hug Susan and she bit me on the hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">When Veprek asked defendant why, if in fact Susan had bitten him, there was only one set of teeth marks on his hand and not two, defendant put his head down and did not say anything further.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Defendant signed a consent form allowing the police to photograph his right hand, and although he refused to do so in writing, he verbally consented to the taking of a buccal swab of the injury. Thereafter, at defendant\u2019s request, Veprek and Smythe drove him to a hospital to be treated for the injury to his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">At 11:53 a.m. on October 22, 2005, police located a vehicle matching the description of Susan\u2019s Lexus SUV in a remote area behind the PNC Arts Center. The patrol officer who found the vehicle looked inside and saw what appeared to be a discolored female hand sticking out from under a mat in the back cargo compartment. Veprek, Smythe, and a team of forensic investigators and other law enforcement personnel responded to the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The vehicle was locked and the keys were inside on the front seat. When the police broke into the back hatch of the car, they discovered Susan\u2019s body in the cargo area covered by a pink yoga mat. According to Veprek, there was extensive bruising and trauma to her face and a pool of blood under her head. She was wearing socks, a red sweater, and an unfastened bra. Her boots, black pants, and underpants were found inside the cargo area next to her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Later that afternoon, Veprek and Smythe took a statement from the Calleias\u2019 next-door neighbors, Frederick and Marilyn Baxter. According to Mrs. Baxter, at about 8:15 on the evening before Susan was reported missing, she was in her driveway when she heard screams coming from the Calleias\u2019 garage. Although she recognized Susan\u2019s voice as the person screaming, she could not discern whether any words were said. Mrs. Baxter characterized the screams as \u201cblood-curdling.\u201d At her request, her husband telephoned the Calleias and left a message on their answering machine. He never received a call back.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Dr. Frederick DiCarlo, an assistant medical examiner with the Monmouth County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, performed the au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>topsy on the morning of October 23, 2005. According to Dr. DiCarlo, Susan was not suffering from any natural disease or physical abnormality at the time of her death. An examination of her body revealed that she received traumatic injuries to her head, neck, chest, arms, and legs. There was no evidence, however, that she had been sexually assaulted or of sexual activity prior to her death. Dr. DiCarlo opined that the immediate cause of Susan\u2019s death was manual strangulation;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if she had not been strangled, Dr. DiCarlo believed that the blunt force trauma to her head would have resulted in death within a short time. In Dr. DiCarlo\u2019s opinion, the hemorrhaging that occurred around Susan\u2019s head injuries indicated that she was beaten for about fifteen or twenty minutes before she was strangled. He estimated the time of death as 9:00 p.m. on October 21; he admitted, however, that her death could have occurred at any time between 4:00 p.m. and midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">[AT THE COURT\u2019S DIRECTION, THE ONLY PUBLISHED PART OF THIS OPINION IS THE COURT\u2019S DISCUSSION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S ARGUMENT THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING HIS MOTION TO BAR THE STATE\u2019S EXPERT WITNESS FROM TESTIFYING ABOUT Y-STR DNA EVIDENCE. DEFENDANT ARGUES THAT SUCH EVIDENCE DID NOT SATISFY THE STANDARD FOR ADMISSIBILITY UNDER <em>FRYE V. UNITED STATES, </em>54 <em>APP.D.C. </em>46, 293 <em>F. </em>1013 (D.C.Cir.1923).]</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">At trial, defendant challenged the admission of Y-STR DNA evidence, which demonstrated that he could not be excluded as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>donor of biological material recovered from under the victim\u2019s fingernails. At oral argument before us, the State urged us to consider and affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the Y-STR DNA evidence, even if we were to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction on other grounds. The State argued that appellate approval of this scientific evidence will settle the question among the trial courts, at least until the Supreme Court decides otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Given the strong likelihood that this evidence will again emerge as a key part of the State\u2019s case against defendant, we will address the propriety of its admission by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In a criminal case, we review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit novel scientific evidence by applying an expansive de novo standard of review that goes beyond the record developed before the trial court to account for and consider the latest and most reliable scientific developments in the field under review. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 167-68, 699 A.2d 596. We are thus obligated to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">scrutinize the record and independently review the relevant authorities, including judicial opinions and scientific literature ... By reviewing post-trial publications, an appellate court can account for the rapid pace of new technology. The continuing review also recognizes that general acceptance <em>may </em>change between the time of trial and the time of appellate review. Moreover, by examining such additional information, an appellate court can prevent any injustice rendered by admission or exclusion of the evidence at the trial level.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\"><em>[Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 167-68, 699 A.2d 596 (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Generally, the admission of expert testimony is governed by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">In order to bo admissible under this Rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-13\">(1) the intended testimony must concern a subject matter that is beyond the ken of the average juror; (2) the field testified to must be at a state of the art such that an expert\u2019s testimony could be sufficiently reliable; and (8) the witness must have sufficient expertise to offer the intended testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>[State v. <em>Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 208, 478 A.2d 364 (1984) (addressing <em>Evid. R. </em>56(2) now codified as <em>N.J.R.E. </em>702).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Here, defendant does not challenge the State\u2019s expert\u2019s qualifications to offer testimony regarding forensic DNA testing, nor does he contend that the science of Y-STR DNA analysis is within the ken of the average juror. The sole question before us is whether Y-STR DNA analysis has reached a level of development and acceptability within the relevant scientific community that an expert\u2019s testimony concerning it can be deemed sufficiently reliable. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 168, 699 A.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Although in 1993 the United States Supreme Court abandoned the general acceptability standard in <em>Frye v.

Although prior to this case no court in this state has addressed the admissibility of Y-STR DNA evidence, the State maintains that Y-STR analysis has been used in criminal trials in other states and in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The trial court first considered the admissibility of the State\u2019s scientific evidence in a <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing outside the presence of the jury. The only witness who testified at this hearing was called by the State. The trial court admitted Edward J. LaRue, the Assistant Director of the New Jersey State Police DNA Laboratory, as an expert in the field of DNA analysis. LaRue testified that Y-STR DNA testing uses exactly the same method<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ology as STR DNA testing and is closely related to a number of DNA testing methods that have been accepted in judicial proceedings. The following scientific discussion is derived entirely from LaRue\u2019s testimony. We refer to that testimony at length here as a basis from which to assess whether the State satisfied the first prong under the Harvey test: whether expert testimony can establish the general acceptance of Y-STR DNA testing. <em>Harvey supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 699 A.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\n<em>General DNA Testing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The nucleus of a human cell contains twenty-three pairs of chromosomes. Chromosomes are tightly wound structures of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a double-stranded molecule that is configured like a twisted ladder. The \u201crungs\u201d of the DNA ladder form when a nucleotide or \u201cbase\u201d on one strand binds to a base on the opposite strand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is the combination of these bases that creates the entire inherited genetic code.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">More than ninety-nine percent of human DNA is the same from person to person. Because the human genome consists of approximately 3.2 billion base pairs, however, even the small percentage of variation results in a large number of base pairs that differ between individuals. Due to the large number of possible base-pair combinations, each individual, with the exception of identical twins, has a unique genetic code. A locus is a specific spot or position on the chromosome. If the locus is responsible for producing a particular protein, it is referred to as a gene. If the locus does not produce a protein, it is referred to as \u201cnon-coding DNA.\u201d Forensic science focuses primarily on the non-coding areas of DNA because that is where the most variation is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Since the early 1990s, scientists have used a technique known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to prepare a DNA sample for study. PCR is a method of multiplying a small amount of DNA in order to make a sufficient quantity to be detected by instrumenta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>tion. PCR amplification involves: heating the DNA solution to denature the double helix and create a solution of single-stranded molecules; adding a \u201cprimer,\u201d which is a short sequence of DNA base pairs intended to adhere to specific loci on the strands; and adding an enzyme that \u201creads\u201d each strand and uses it as a template to build a new strand that is an exact copy of the original. The cycle is then repeated in a chain reaction that can make billions of copies of the original DNA sample. PCR was found to be scientifically reliable and hence admissible in a criminal proceeding in <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 160-61, 183, 699 A.2d 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">One type of DNA testing that uses the PCR method is short tandem repeats (STR) analysis. A short tandem repeat is a non-coding area of DNA that has repeating sequences of nucleotides. Differences can be seen between individuals depending on the number of times a nucleotide sequence is repeated at a given locus. Thirteen core loci have been identified by CODIS<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for use in STR analysis. These loci are differentiated from one another through the use of differently colored fluorescent tags that are attached to the primer during PCR amplification. The tagged specimen is placed in a capillary filled with a polymer gel and inserted into an instrument known as a \u201cgenetic analyzer.\u201d When an electric current is placed across the capillary, the DNA migrates through the gel column. Because short fragments climb faster than long fragments, a physical separation occurs. When a fragment reaches the end of the capillary, a laser excites its fluorescent tag and creates a very specific signal that is detected by the instrument. The signals obtained are represented on an electropherogram, which can be used to generate a DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">When loci on all twenty-three pairs of chromosomes are tested, the process is called autosomal STR DNA analysis. Y-STR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>analysis, on the other hand, involves the testing of loci on only one specific chromosome: the male \u201cY chromosome.\u201d Of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes in a human cell, one pair is comprised of two \u201csex chromosomes\u201d that determine whether a person is male or female. In a female, both sex chromosomes are \u201cX chromosomes.\u201d In a male, one sex chromosome is an \u201cX chromosome\u201d and one sex chromosome is a \u201cY chromosome.\u201d Thus, Y chromosomes can only be found in males.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Since the early 1990s, forensic scientists have been able to use specific short nucleotide sequences to differentiate the sex chromosomes from the other chromosomes and determine whether the DNA donor was male or female. In 2008, forensic technology was markedly advanced when the full Y chromosome nucleotide sequence was established. Since that time, over 200 different STR loci have been identified on the Y chromosome.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Y-STR DNA Testing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The Scientific Working Group for DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has selected a core number of Y-STR loci for forensic examination. Commercial kits are available that provide primers that specifically target these loci. The State Police Laboratory uses the \u2018Tfiler Kit\u201d that is manufactured by Applied Biosystems, Inc.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At all times, the Laboratory follows the SWGDAM guidelines for internal validations; a validation conducted for Y-STR testing showed that the Laboratory used here was in compliance with the federal guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The analytical procedure followed in Y-STR DNA testing is identical to that followed in autosomal STR DNA testing. The sample is extracted in the same manner, amplified by the PCR method, tagged with a primer, and detected in the genetic analyzer. The data is collected and represented in exactly the same way. The only procedural distinction is that the primer included in the test kit for Y-STR DNA analysis contains markers for the Y-STR loci specified by SWGDAM; the primer included in the test kit for autosomal STR DNA analysis contains markers for loci on all twenty-three chromosome pairs. The major difference between autosomal STR DNA analysis and Y-STR DNA analysis is in the interpretation and application of the test results.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">An individual inherits his or her genetic code from his or her biological parents. Specifically with regard to autosomal STRs, the frequency of repeat sequences found in an individual\u2019s DNA is the result of random combinations of the repeat sequences found in the DNA of his mother and father. Because the mixing of the parents\u2019 DNA information is random and each loci is independent of the others, it is possible to mathematically calculate the probability that any individual will possess a specific DNA profile through use of the \u201cproduct rule.\u201d This means that the probability that an individual will inherit a particular repeat frequency at locus one is multiplied by the probability that he will inherit a particular repeat frequency at locus two, which is multiplied by the probability at locus three and so on.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The probability is extremely low, one in one quadrillion, that the STRs on all thirteen loci of two different individuals will \u201cmatch,\u201d i.e., that each corresponding locus will have the identical frequency of repeated nucleotide sequences. For this reason, if a thirteen-loci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> autosomal STR DNA profile from a forensic specimen matches a profile generated by a sample taken from a particular individual, it is virtually certain that the individual was the source of the specimen. Stated differently, if there is a full profile match, the probability that the specimen came from someone else is so remote as to be negligible; identity is established. Because autosomal STR DNA testing provides a high probability of identifying an individual as the DNA source, it is the preferred method of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Autosomal STR DNA analysis is problematic, however, when forensic scientists are confronted with a mixed DNA sample. For example, blood stains found at a crime scene may be the result of bleeding by both the victim and the perpetrator. An autosomal STR DNA profile generated from the stains will have a combination of both individuals\u2019 DNA patterns and it is not possible to attribute which traits go with which person. Further, one individual\u2019s profile often overwhelms the other and renders it un-detectible. When one individual is male and one is female, however, it is possible to perform a Y-STR DNA analysis and focus solely on the DNA of the male. Thus, the strength of Y-STR DNA testing derives from the fact that only males have a Y chromosome. Unfortunately, that fact is also the source of the test\u2019s weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Because only males possess Y chromosomes, a mother does not contribute to the genetic code of her son\u2019s Y chromosome. The DNA sequence on the Y chromosome is passed in complete form from grandfather, to father, to son and on down the male lineage. The Y chromosome loci are not independent of one another and there is no recombination of DNA. It is strictly a male marker and there is no randomness on the chromosomes. Consequently, the product rule used to generate probabilities for autosomal STR DNA analysis is inapplicable to Y-STR DNA analysis. In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>words, barring random mutations, all men in a paternal lineage will possess the same Y-STR DNA profile. Thus, fathers, sons, brothers, uncles, and paternal cousins cannot be distinguished from one another through a Y-STR DNA profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">For this reason, Y-STR DNA testing has limited usefulness in positively identifying an individual. The testing is extremely useful, however, in excluding someone since an individual cannot be the source of the DNA if the profiles do not match. If the Y-STR DNA profiles do match, then all that can be said is that the individual <em>cannot be excluded </em>as the DNA donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Because the product rule is inapplicable, the State Police Laboratory uses the \u201ccounting method\u201d to convey the odds that the Y~ STR DNA profile of any one individual would coincidentally match the profile obtained from a crime scene specimen. The State Police Laboratory has access to a database of 3561 Y-STR DNA profiles of randomly selected individuals. When a Y-STR DNA profile is generated from a crime scene specimen, the database is searched to determine if that profile has ever been seen before. The laboratory report will then state whether the profile was found in the database, and if so, how often it occurred. The frequency of the occurrence of any particular Y-STR DNA profile in the general population, however, cannot be estimated from this information since the very next person sampled could have that profile. Thus, although Y-STR DNA analysis can detect a match with one hundred percent certainty, the match itself can only be interpreted as indicating that the individual cannot be excluded as the sample donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">\n<em>Reliability of Y-STR DNA Testing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Based on the record developed before the trial court, we are satisfied that there is a general acceptance of Y-STR DNA analysis in the scientific community. The State\u2019s duly qualified expert in the field explained the theoretical basis of Y-STR DNA analysis, the methodology used by the testing laboratory, the SWGDAM standards that govern DNA testing, and the validation procedures associated with those standards. The State Police Laboratory uses a commercially available testing kit to conduct Y-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>STR DNA analyses and Y-STR DNA profiles are maintained in a national database.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">LaRue\u2019s testimony established that Y-STR DNA analysis is a \u201cnon-experimental, demonstrable technique\u201d that is widely accepted by forensic scientists. <em>Harvey, </em>supra, 151 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 699 A.2d 596. The scientific basis of Y-STR DNA analysis is sufficient to prove that the technique produces uniform and reasonably reliable results. <em>Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 478 A.2d 364. LaRue\u2019s testimony thus satisfied the first prong of the <em>Harvey </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In the interest of completeness, we also note that the State proved the reliability of the Y-STR DNA technique under the second prong of the test, which allows a proponent to establish general acceptance \u201cby authoritative scientific and legal writings indicating that the scientific community accepts the premises underlying the proffered testimony.\u201d <em>Harvey, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 699 A.2d 596.

Imwinkelried, 2 <em>Scientific Evidence </em>\u00a7 18.03 at 33-34 (4th ed. 2007), the authors observe that since its initial recognition in 1996, STR analysis has become the dominant DNA typing methodology. They explain that the Y-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>STR test is \u201cgenerally similar to the method employed in conventional autosomal STR analysis,\u201d but note that the rarity of Y-STR profiles has not yet been determined from empirical studies. <em>Id. </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In Benjamin E. Krenke et al., <em>Validation of a Male-Specific, 12-Locus Fluorescent Short Tandem Repeat (STR) Multiplex, </em>148 <em>Forensic Sci. Int\u2019l </em>1, 2 (2005), the authors state that \u201cshort tandem repeat (STR) analysis is the primary technology for genetic human identification\u201d and that Y-specific analysis is a valuable tool in criminal investigations. They discuss standards established by the Director of the FBI and SWGDAM for Y-STR DNA analytical methods and set forth a study of the \u201cconsistency and robustness\u201d of one particular technique, the \u201cPowerPlex\u00ae Y System.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>They conclude that Y-STR DNA analysis is reliable when used for forensic human identification. <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">A similar conclusion was reached by researchers investigating the Y-PLEX\u21226 and Y-PLEX'1,M5 genotyping systems for forensic casework.

Forensic Sci. </em>1 (July 2004), <em>available at </em>http://www.hartnell.cc.ca.us/faculty/jhughey/Files/yplexgenetics.pdf. They state that these techniques provide reliable and probative results that could not be achieved through the analysis of autosomal STRs. <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">By contrast, defendant has not cited any scientific study that questions the validity and/or reliability of Y-STR DNA analysis. The State\u2019s proffer of authoritative sources concerning the scientific basis for Y-STR DNA analysis thus demonstrates that the Y-STR technique has been generally accepted in the scientific community.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">Having determined the general acceptability of Y-STR DNA analysis, we must next consider defendant\u2019s argument that such evidence is not probative on the question of whether he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the person who murdered his wife. Specifically, defendant argues that the State cannot prove that he was the source of the DNA material recovered from under decedent\u2019s fingernails.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">We are satisfied that this evidence is relevant and has probative value because it shows that defendant could not be excluded from the class of individuals who could have \u201ccontributed\u201d this biological material. Thus, although this evidence cannot unequivocally establish that defendant was the person who killed his wife, it does show that defendant cannot be excluded from the class of individuals who could have been the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Relevant evidence is that which has \u201ca tendency in reason to prove or disprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>N.J.R.E. </em>401. \u201cIn determining whether evidence is relevant, the inquiry focuses upon \u2018the logical connection between the proffered evidence and a fact in issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 33, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Hutchins, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 358, 575 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1990)). If evidence supports the existence of a specific fact, even obliquely, it is relevant. <em>Verdicchio, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 843 A.2d 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Here, the State\u2019s forensic expert, Christopher Szymkowiak, testified that a sample obtained from the fingernail clippings of decedent\u2019s right hand yielded a mixture of male and female DNA. Y-STR DNA analysis of the male component of the mixture produced a profile that matched the profile developed from defendant\u2019s control sample. According to Szymkowiak, this particular profile did not match any profile recorded in the Applied Biosystems Yfilter Database of 3561 individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">This evidence is thus relevant in establishing that defendant cannot be ruled out as his wife\u2019s killer. This scientific conclusion is a key part of the State\u2019s case when considered in light of the totality of the evidence presented against defendant. Specifically, Susan was manually strangled; defendant had wounds on his right hand. Although Susan and defendant were married, they had not been intimate for some time. The fact that Susan had DNA under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>her fingernails that links defendant, by way of inclusion in the class of potential killers, justifies a reasonable inference that Susan scratched defendant while trying to remove his hand from her throat. The fact that Szymkowiak could not say with certainty that defendant was the source of the DNA does not render the test results irrelevant. Although all males in a paternal lineage share the same Y-STR DNA, and even seemingly unrelated individuals can have the same Y-STR DNA profile, there are still sufficient variations within the population to make any particular profile distinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In that sense, Y-STR DNA matches are analogous to several conventional forms of evidence that are routinely admitted at criminal trials. In <em>State v. Swint, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 252-53, 745 A.2d 570 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>492, 758 A.2d 651 (2000), we concluded that a box-cutter found in the defendants\u2019 possession within eight hours of an assault in which the victim was severely cut was relevant because it \u201chad a tendency in reason to prove a fact of consequence.\u201d There had been no showing in <em>Swint </em>that the defendants\u2019 box-cutter was unique in any way; in fact, there was no proof that a box-cutter was the weapon used in the assault. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 745 A.2d 570. There was also no testimony concerning how many other individuals in the area might have owned a box-cutter. We noted, however, that the State\u2019s failure to provide a specific link between the evidence and the crime went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. <em>Id. </em>at 252, 745 A.2d 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In fact, shoe imprint evidence provides the best analogy to Y-STR DNA evidence. Our courts have long admitted evidence connecting shoe imprints found at a crime scene with shoes found in a defendant\u2019s possession, despite the fact that any number of persons might own identical pairs of shoes. <em>See, e.g., State v. Johnson, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>263, 293-95, 576 A.2d 834 (1990) (upholding the admission of lay testimony that a footprint found at the crime scene had been made by the defendant\u2019s sneaker); <em>State v. Gerald, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>40, 53-54, 549 A.2d 792 (1988) (recounting trial testimony that the pattern on the defendant\u2019s sneakers matched <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>imprints found on the victim\u2019s forehead); <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215, 463 A.2d 320 (1983) (recounting trial testimony regarding the similarity between an imprint on the victim\u2019s door and a boot found in the defendant\u2019s room), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984). In all of these cases, the State was not required to prove that the defendant\u2019s shoes were the only ones that could have made the impressions found at the crime scene. Instead, the courts left to the jury the task of weighing the probative value of the evidence that the defendant possessed shoes identical to those used in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Here, Y-ehromosome DNA with a specific STR profile was found under decedent\u2019s fingernails. The coincidence that this, profile matches that of defendant is probative of his guilt in the same manner as if he had owned shoes that matched a foot imprint found at the crime scene. It was up to the jury to weigh the probative value of that evidence in light of the fact that a significant number of other individuals may possess the same profile.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Reversed and remanded.

Before a laboratory may receive federal funding or upload results into the CODIS database, it must be audited and found to be in compliance with SWGDAM standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\"> See specifications for YfilerOPCR Amplification Kit, https://products.applied biosystems.com/ab/en/US/adirect/ab?cmd=catNavigate2&amp;catID=601709 (follow \"specifications\" tab).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\"> LaRue explained that the probability that a particular repeat frequency will occur at a particular locus is set by a database created by the FBI from random sampling of a large number of individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds. This database has been published, peer reviewed by the scientific community, and accepted worldwide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">LaRue testified that sometimes DNA degrades in a sample and it is not possible to examine all thirteen loci. If, for instance, it is only possible to generate a six-loci profile, then the probability of a match would be higher, the product of six individual probabilities instead of thirteen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
