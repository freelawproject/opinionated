The Board of Appeals affirmed the rejection. Appellant alleges reversible error in the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">Claim 1 is representative and reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">\u201c1. That method of making sodium borohydride comprising finely dispersing hydride of the alkali metal in an inert liquid of high boiling point, maintaining the dispersion at a substantially uniform temperature of about 250 to 350\u00b0C, and reacting said sodium hydride with a boron-containing reagent introduced into the dispersion and selected from the group consisting of boron halides and their organic addition agents, boric oxide, alkali metal borohalides, and alkyl borates, and recovering said sodium borohydride from the system.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">References relied on by the examiner are:</p>\n<p id=\"b732-18\">Schlesinger et al. (I) 2,534,533 December 19, 1950; Schlesinger et al. (II) 2,494,968 January 17, 1950; Muckenfuss 1,958,012 May 8, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-19\">Appellant\u2019s invention relates to a process of producing alkali metal borohydrides characterized by the formula MB Hi in which M represents an alkali metal. The process consists of the steps of (1) dispersing the metal hydride in an \u201cinert liquid, most suitably one of high boiling point such as mineral oil,\u201d (2) heating the dispersion to between 250\u00b0 and 350\u00b0G and (3) introducing a dry boron-containing reagent while stirring the dispersion rapidly. The specification states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-20\">\u201cFine dispersion of the metal hydride is a <em>sine qua non </em>of all embodiments of the invention, otherwise the reactions do not proceed, at least at any acceptable rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-21\">The \u201cboron-containing reagent\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-22\">\u201c * * * boron halides, such as boron trifluoride (BF3) or boron trichloride (BC13), and the organic addition products of boron halides of which a considerable number are known, as well as alkyl borates, e. g., methyl and ethyl borates: [B (OMe)3; B(OEt)3], Boron reagent as the term is here used also includes boric oxide (B203), or alkali metal borohalide such, for example, as so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>dium borofluoride (NaBF4), so that such compounds too are boron-containing reagents for present purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Schlesinger et al., patent No. 2,534,533, hereinafter referred to as Schlesinger I, discloses the preparation of alkali metal borohydrides by the reaction of alkali metal hydrides and boron-containing reagents. The method utilized by Schlesinger I is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201c* * * The apparatus is flushed out with dry nitrogen, and sodium hydride in powdered form is introduced into the apparatus without contacting it with air and moisture. The sodium hydride is slowly heated to between 200\u00b0 and 275\u00b0C., and the methyl borate is added at such a rate that the theoretical amount is introduced over a period of 40 to 60 minutes. During the adding of the methyl borate the reacting materials are vigorously stirred. After all the borate has been added the temperature is maintained and the stirring is continued until the reaction is complete. * * * <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">When boric oxide is used as the boron reagent, operating temperatures of 300-375 \u00b0C are required. Schlesinger I also discloses the reaction of the boron reagent with an alkali metal and hydrogen to produce the borohydride.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">Schlesinger II, patent No. 2,494,968, discloses the preparation of alkali metal alkoxyborohydrides by reacting, in different molecular proportions, the same materials used in Schlesinger I, viz., alkali metal hydrides and boron-containing reagents. The patentees state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">\u201cGenerally speaking the reaction is exothermic and tends to occur vigorously. The vigor of the reaction may be at least partially controlled by the use of diluents which serve to prevent the temperature of reaction from reaching an unduly high value. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">The materials named as diluents are benzene, toluene and dioxane. Example IV of the patent teaches placing benzene, the hydride and the borate in the reaction vessel prior to heating.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">Muckenfuss teaches the preparation of alkali metal hydrides from the respective alkali metal and hydrogen. Liquid distributing agents, such as commercial lubricating and paraffin oils, are used in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">The examiner rejected claims 1 and 9 as unpatentable over Schlesinger I in view of Schlesinger II. Claims 2 and 3 were rejected on the same prior art further in view of Muckenfuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">The board, in sustaining the examiner, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-19\">\u201cThe examiner\u2019s answer sets forth the examiner\u2019s position with commendable thoroughness and clarity. Since we agree with this position as stated, we adopt as a statement of our opinion the examiner\u2019s answer, as amplified by the following comments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-20\">Those comments included discussion of a journal article<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> cited by appellant. The board further relied on In re Migrdichian, 29 CCPA 110, 129 F.2d 547, for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-21\">\u201c * * * the indicated use of an inert diluent is a conventional expedient that requires no more than the ordinary skill of the art. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ac7\">The examiner\u2019s position on claims 1 and 9 is that Schlesinger I teaches the claimed process \u201cexcept .for the limitation that the sodium hydride is dispersed in an inert liquid of high boiling point when it is contacted with the boron containing reagent.\u201d He stated that \u201cIn view of the close similarity of the reactions taught by Schlesinger et al (I) and (II), no invention can be seen to reside in merely controlling the temperature in the reaction taught by Schlesinger et al (I) in the same manner as taught by Schlesinger et al (II), i. e., by dispersing the sodium hydride in an inert liquid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>such as benzene or toluene.\u201d The limitation of claims 2 and 3 that the liquid be mineral oil was considered by the examiner \u201cto be within the skill of the art\u201d, especially in view of Muekenfuss.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Appellant in his brief states <em>\u2018\u2018The precise point of novelty lies in </em>maintenance of fine dispersion of the sodium hydride in <em>mineral oil or similar inert high boiling liquid.\u201d </em>He contends that the use of such a liquid in the instant process is unobvious', basing his argument on the allegation that the \u201cposition of the Patent Office utterly <em>overlooks the history of this field </em>and the relevant facts\u201d as well as the affidavits of record, citing In re McKenna et al., 40 CCPA 937, 203 F.2d 717. He further alleges that the rejection is based on hindsight arising from appellant\u2019s disclosure and that the references were improperly combined.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Appellant submitted for the examiner\u2019s consideration the affidavit of one Dr. Millard which states that the operation of the process of Schlesinger I \u201cfrequently develops\u201d hot spots allegedly caused by the \u201cinadequate dissipation of heat throughout the reaction mixture.\u201d The affidavit further states that in appellant\u2019s process</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201c \u00ab- * * There has been no occurrence of an uncontrolled violent reaction of the type described for the \u2018dry\u2019 process. The reason for the more satisfactory control of this re- , action when carried out in mineral oil suspension is believed to be due to the more even distribution of heat throughout the reaction mixture and the quick dissipation of heat which precludes the development of. a \u2018hot spot\u2019. Another reason for the better control which is obtained when this reaction is carried out in mineral oil . suspension is due to the solubility of methyl borate in mineral oil. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjL\">We have thoroughly considered all of appellant\u2019s contentions but are unable to agree that the board erred as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">' As pointed out by the examiner, Schlesinger II clearly teaches the exothermic character of the reactants and the control of that reaction by the use of diluents. Since Schlesinger I teaches a process utilizing the identical reactants, it would be obvious, in our opinion, to also use diluents to control that reaction. It is true that Schlesinger II discloses diluents of relatively low boiling point, such as benzene or toluene.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, it is noted that the reaction of Schlesinger II is carried out at about 90\u00b0C, as in \u201cExample IV,\u201d while Schlesinger I specifically requires a temperature \u201cbetween 200\u00b0 and 275\u00b0C\u201d for the preparation of the borohydride. If one were to control the Schlesinger I exothermic reaction in the manner taught by Schlesinger II, it is evident that an inert liquid of higher boiling point would be necessary. In our opinion, the use of a high boiling inert diluent in the process of Schlesinger I would be obvious to one skilled in this art in view of the teachings of Schlesinger II.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-24\">.
