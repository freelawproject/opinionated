Pending hearing upon the merits of its complaint, plaintiff obtained, <em>ex parte, </em>a restraining order, and prayed that a preliminary injunction also issue to remain in force until final hearing. Defendant moved to vacate the <em>ex parte </em>restraining order. On the cross-motions the district judge below in a reasoned opinion vacated the temporary restraining order and denied the motion for the preliminary injunction. Plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-13\">We affirm the district court.
