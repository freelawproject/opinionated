Count Eleven charged her in substance with endeavoring, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (1958), to impede the administration of justice by influencing Freed, a witness before the grand jury. The conviction and sentence on this count are clearly valid. Under the doctrine of Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943), since the judgment is upheld on one count of the indictment, we need not reach the remaining assertions of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
