The respondents moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and after hearing arguments of counsel the court below from the bench, so we are told, but the appellant\u2019s record appendix does not include a transcript of the proceedings at the hearing, orally dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Immediately after the hearing counsel for the plaintiff filed notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-22\">It is true that a docket entry reflects the action taken by the court below on the bench. But a docket entry is not <em>per se </em>a judgment. It is but a minute of action taken by the court, for courts render judgments; clerks only enter them on the court records. What is determinative therefore is the action of the court, not that of the clerk, and lacking a transcript we do not know whether the court intended its announcement from the bench to be its \u201cfinal decision\u201d or not. That is to say, we cannot tell on the record presented to us whether the court\u2019s statement from the bench embodied the essential elements of judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>ment. or was merely a forecast of the final action it intended to take. No specific form of words are required to constitute a judgment. Intention controls and a final decision may even be embodied in an opinion. United States v. F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Co., 356 U.S. 227, 232, 78 S.Ct. 674, 2 L.Ed.2d 721 (1958). But since we know full well that it is the general, indeed the universal, practice of the court below to express its judgments in separate documents clearly so labeled, we can only assume, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, that it intended to follow its established practice in this case and did not intend its oral pronouncement from the bench to constitute its final determinative action. No judgment ever having been rendered:</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">An order will be entered dismissing this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
