In view of the foregoing the Court finds that plaintiff\u2019s patent in suit is void for want of invention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">We have carefully considered the record. The trial court\u2019s finding that the subject matter of the patent did not meet the standards of invention required by the patent statute is supported by substantial evidence. The trial court\u2019s opinion clearly reflects that its findings and conclusion were not induced by any erroneous view of the law. No purpose would be served by retreading the ground so well covered by Judge Robinson in his published opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Upon the basis of such opinion, the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-14\">. In setting out claim 4 (p. 374, 197 F.Supp.) the trial court apparently through inadvertence failed to include in said claim the words \u201cspaced thereon and extending therefrom, said portions\u201d. Such words should appear immediately preceding the word \u201cbeing\u201d in line 9 of said claim 4. It is obvious that the foregoing omission did not affect the trial court\u2019s decision. The thought of the omitted words is incorporated in other claims properly set out.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
