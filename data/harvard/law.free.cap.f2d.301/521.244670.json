Seeking declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>tory and injunctive relief, appellant challenged the Comptroller\u2019s authority under pertinent provisions of the National Bank Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to issue a certificate of authority which would permit the intervenor, Delaware National Bank of Delaware Township, to commence the business of banking. The District Court granted summary judgment to the Comptroller and the intervenor and dismissed the complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">On this appeal, appellant argues that under New Jersey\u2019s Banking Act of 1948,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> no other state bank could establish a branch in Delaware Township. Accordingly, it is urged that no national bank can establish a branch<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at Ellis-burg Circle in Delaware Township, only one mile from appellant\u2019s branch at Erlton. The Haddonfield National Bank, located in the adjacent Borough of Haddonfield, had sought in 1960 to locate its main office in Delaware Township while retaining as a branch its Haddonfield office, only two miles from Ellisburg Circle. The Comptroller denied that application, correctly we think,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for clearly the application related to a <em>branch, </em>not a \u201cnew\u201d bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-13\">Shortly thereafter, eight of Haddonfield National\u2019s nine directors, later joined by the ninth, as individuals signed and filed an application for the incorporation of a new national bank at the Ellis-burg Circle location. Appellant filed objections to the application and by appearance before the Comptroller voiced its protest. The Comptroller nevertheless indicated his intention to approve, whereupon Camden filed this action. Its complaint in the District Court alleged that the application of the Haddonfield di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>rectors was \u201con its face a manifest subterfuge to circumvent the provisions and purposes of the National Bank Act by attempting to introduce into Delaware Township a banking facility that will for all practical purposes constitute a branch facility of the Haddonfield National Bank. Issue of a Certificate of Authority in such a case is contrary to law, beyond the defendant\u2019s authority, and a clear abuse of his discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Whatever weight is to be given to the appellant\u2019s legal argument, it is difficult to think of the Haddonfield directors\u2019 action as a \u201csubterfuge,\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> at least in an invidious sense. On the contrary, the preliminary proceedings seem to have been open and notorious. Perhaps on that account the \u201csubterfuge\u201d was alleged to be \u201cmanifest.\u201d The president of the Haddonfield National Bank on its letterhead notified all of its shareholders of the plan and the objective which the directors sought.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant protested orally and in writing to the Comptroller. The latter and the New Jersey Bank Commissioner <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> corresponded concerning the project. It fairly may be said that we perceive nothing arcane or wrongfully covert in the effort. The respectively zealous competitors really are at issue, we feel sure, solely as to whether or not the Comptroller in the circumstances shown is to be precluded by law from issuing a certificate of authority to the intervenor.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">Thus viewed in its fundamentals, the case would seem to turn, not on the Comptroller\u2019s power but on its exercise. It is not claimed that the Comptroller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>may not charter a \u201cnew\u201d bank. Rather it is urged, he must permit the creation only of a \u201cbona fide independent national bank doing business within its four walls.\u201d For that narrow proposition appellant points to 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 36(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We read the section as saying that the Comptroller affirmatively is empowered to authorize a national banking association to establish and operate new branches if, when and where state law permits state banks to do so.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The amendment subsequent to First National Bank in St. Louis v. Missouri, is clear on its face and says, without ambiguity, exactly what it means. Beyond peradventure, Congress even defined the term \u201cbranch.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Appellant next would say, the intervenor will be \u201can affiliate\u201d of the Haddonfield National Bank, referring to its exhibit, set forth in full in note 7. We read that language as an assurance to shareholders of Haddonfield that the trusted management of Haddonfield and the policies pursued in the past may justify investment in the shares of the new bank. The directors of Haddonfield who as individuals were committing themselves and their capital sought information as to \u201cwhether or not\u201d existing shareholders \u201care interested in purchasing shares in the new bank and to what extent.\u201d They were to be required to raise $517,500 \u201cwhich would result in a legal loan limit of $50,000 \u2014 the same as that of Camden Trust Company\u2019s branch at Erlton,\u201d the appellant tells us in its brief. We see nothing sinister in a banker\u2019s prudent inquiry as to just where the promoters were to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">There is nothing in the record to show that the shareholders formed the association \u201cfor any other than the legitimate objects\u201d contemplated by the Act. The Haddonfield National Bank has not been shown to own the intervenor even if some of the stockholders and directors of the former should own some of the shares of the latter. The intervenor clearly is not a branch of Haddonfield but is a completely separate entity with certain distinguishing characteristics sufficiently so set up in the Government\u2019s brief as to justify our quoting verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2M\">\u201cThe capital structure of Delaware Valley is totally independent of that of Haddonfield National; the stock of Delaware Valley has been subscribed to and \u2018paid in\u2019 as required by 12 U.S.C. 53; Delaware Valley stockholders are subject to the individual liability described in 12 U.S.C. 63 [sic; repealed, 73 Stat. 457 (1959); see 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 64a], unrelated to their possible liability as shareholders in Haddonfield National ; the Comptroller has assigned a name to Delaware Valley that is not susceptible of confusion with Haddonfield National; Delaware Valley will be located approximately two miles from the main office of Haddonfield National * * * the general business of banking to be conducted by Delaware Valley will \u2018be transacted in the place specified in its organization certificate\u2019 (12 U.S.C. 81); deposits with Delaware Valley will be its liability not that of Haddonfield National; loan limitations on Delaware Valley will be those applicable to an independent bank, based on its own capital structure and totally independent of loan limitations applicable to Haddonfield National (12 U.S.C. 84); the limits of indebtedness which may be incurred by Delaware Valley will be as prescribed in 12 U.S.C. 82 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>independent of similar limitations on Haddonfield National; the directors of Delaware Valley have been elected by its shareholders (12 U.S.C. 71), meet the citizenship, residence, and stock-ownership requirements specified in 12 U.S.C. 72, and: \u2018If the directors * * * shall knowingly violate, or knowingly permit any of [the] officers, agents, or servants * * * to violate any of the provisions of [12 U.S.C. 21-214c], all the rights, privileges, and franchises of the association shall be thereby forfeited. * * * \u2019 12 U.S.C. 93.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">It is not within our province to pass upon the desirability <em>vel non </em>of permitting a national bank to have an \u201caffiliate,\u201d as the appellant has here used the term. If such an affiliate is to be denied status, Congress must clearly say so. It is sufficient for our disposition of the present controversy to observe that what was done was within the authority conferred by existing statutes. Convinced, as we are, that 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 36 has no applicability to the situation disclosed on this record, we deem it unnecessary to consider other contentions urged upon us.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-5\">. 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 21-27 as amended, 12 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 21a, 24, 26.

As an exhibit to appellant\u2019s complaint, the following letter, on the Bank\u2019s letterhead, was reproduced:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">December 8, 1960</p>\n<p id=\"Ac_\">To the Shareholders of Haddonfield National Bank</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">On many occasions your Board of Directors and Officers have been invited by the residents and business men of Delaware Township to extend banking facilities to that area by the establishment of a branch office in that fast growing municipality. Under the New Jersey banking law, to which we are subject with regard to branches, it is not permissible for a bank, other than in its home community, to establish a branch office in a municipality where a banking office already exists. It is possible, however, to apply for a charter to start a new bank where the need, both present and future, would appear to exist. In line with that reasoning your Board of Directors as individuals, applied and have received from the Comptroller of the Currency, preliminary approval to establish a new bank to be known as the DELAWARE YALLEX NATIONAL BANK OF DELAWARE TOWNSHIP, to be located in the Barclay Farm area.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-14\">The new bank proposes to issue 22,500 shares ($10 par) stock at $23.00 per share and the proceeds from the stock sale will be divided as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">Capital .............$225,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Surplus ............ 225,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Undivided Profits .... 67,500.00</p>\n<p id=\"b571-18\">It is expected that the DELAWARE YALLEX NATIONAL BANK will be an affiliate of the Haddonfield National Bank and that its affairs will be conducted by the same management and under the same policies as the Haddonfield National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-19\">The Board of Directors of the Haddonfield National Bank feels this is a very worthwhile undertaking and as shareholders you are invited to subscribe for shares in the new bank. Will you please indicate on the stub, which appears at the bottom of this letter, <em>whether or not </em>you are interested in purchasing shares in \u25a0 the new bank and to what extent.

This is by virtue of the Banking Act of 1948 of the State of New Jersey (N.J.S.A. 17:9A-19), which provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-12\">\u201cB. No bank or savings bank shall establish or maintain a branch office which is located outside the municipality in which it maintains its principal office; except that a bank or savings bank may establish and maintain a branch office or offices anywhere in the same county as that in which it maintains its principal office.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">I think appellant is correct in its argument that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-14\">\u201cTile facts plainly show that the transaction here involved, in form an application for a \u2018new\u2019 bank charter, is, in substance a subterfuge to obtain a forbidden branch facility. These facts, fully known to the Comptroller, imposed a statutory duty on him to reject the application. This duty would follow the application of the familiar general principle that form will be disregarded whenever necessary to prevent evasion of the clear purpose of a statute. But the duty is made clear beyond question here by consideration of those statutory provisions from which alone the Comptroller derives his authority, the consistent interpretation of those provisions, and the strong and affirmative Congressional policy as to the nature of the Comptroller\u2019s authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-15\">\u201cA. The 1933 branch bank legislation was preceded by over a quarter of a century of concern by the Comptroller of the Currency as to his lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>of authority to authorize branching by national banks and his repeated recommendations to Congress that he be given such authority. The Congressional history of the 1933 legislation makes plain that the Comptroller was only empowered to authorize national banks to establish branches on the basis of precise competitive equality with state banks. Accordingly, national banks could establish outside branches only in states where such branches were \u2018 * * * authorized to State banks by the statute law of the State in question by language specifically granting such authority affirmatively and not merely by implication or recognition * * The debates which led to this strictly circumscribed branching authority are outspoken in their condemnation of the use of chain or \u2018affiliate\u2019 banks as devices for evading branch banking restrictions or prohibitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201cThus, the only power added to the Comptroller\u2019s original authority to charter <em>bona fide </em>unit independent banks was the authority to permit branching as permitted by the statute law of the state in question, on a basis of precise equality with state banking systems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">While my colleagues take exception to appellant\u2019s use of the word \u201csubterfuge,\u201d I think that one of the definitions quoted by them, namely \u201can evasion,\u201d covers the action of appellee like a glove.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The State of New Jersey, which has filed an <em>amicus </em>brief, contends, correctly I think, that \u201cif an application for a new State banking charter were made under the same circumstances, it would be regarded in its substantive character as a branch application and rejected under the statute governing branch applications\u201d; and that \u201c[o]n the facts present in this case, the Delaware National Bank of Delaware Township should be held to be tantamount to a branch office of the Haddonfield National Bank, thereby bringing it within the scope and prohibition of 12 U.S.C.[A. \u00a7] 36 (C[c]&gt; and Section 19 of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (N.J.S.A. 17:9A-19).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">If substance rather than form is to prevail, the judgment of the District Court should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
