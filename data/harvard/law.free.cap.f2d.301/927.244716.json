It shows sales in excess of thirty million dollars from 1951 through 1958, and advertising expenditures of over five hundred thousand dollars on \u201cWINCO\u201d products since 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Appellee, Wiancko Engineering Company, and its predecessors, have been marketing products falling within the designation of goods in their applications for registration since 1947. The products were identified by the mark \u201cWIANCKO\u201d alone until 1953, but since then by \u201cWIANCKO\u201d in association with a twisted tube design. Sales of the products have been substantial and supported by appreciable advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The record shows \u201cWINCO\u201d was derived from appellant\u2019s corporate name, Wincharger Corporation, and \u201cWIANCKO\u201d is the surname of appellee\u2019s predecessor, who is now its president. The board found certain distinctions between various products of the parties, but also found that appellee\u2019s broad designation of goods as power supplies \u201ccomprehends static and transistorized power equipment of the character sold by opposer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Appellant argues here that the board committed reversible error in dismissing the opposition, specifically pointing out the similarities in sound and spelling of the competing marks. While we appreciate those similarities, we are of the opinion they are sufficiently outweighed by the dissimilarities as to allow registration of the mark applied for.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">Finding no error in the decision of the board, we affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b975-17\">. In application Serial No. 24,890, involved in Opposition No. 38,517, registration of the mark is sought for oscillator units, automatic frequency standardizing units, electronic range and balance control units, electrical filter units attenuator units, amplifiers, demodulator units, combined amplifier and demodulator units, instrument cabinets and tables, especially adapted for use in data measuring systems; electronic commutators and electro-mechanical commutators especially adapted for use in telemetering systems; force gauges, pressure sensing devices, accelerometers and pressure calibration units; digital computers, analog cornputers, counter registers and other data measuring systems; frequency multiplier units; peak voltage indicators, bridge circuit units; and oscillograph patch panels, in class 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-25\">In application Serial No. 24,889, involved in Opposition No. 38,526, registration is sought for power supplies, in class 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b975-26\">.

The Board found that \u201c \u2018Winco\u2019 and \u2018Wiancko\u2019 are substantially different in appearance, and while they contain some similarity in sound, they are readily distinguishable in that respect.\u201d \u2014 a finding adopted by the majority of this court though not in exactly the same terms. Judging by eye and ear, which is necessarily the basic consideration in trademark cases of this kind, I am unable to reach any conclusion other than that the marks are <em>not </em>substantially different in appearance and are <em>not </em>readily distinguishable in sound. In fact, it seems to me that anyone would be hard put to it to devise a word any closer to the opposer\u2019s mark than the applicant\u2019s, without making a letter for letter copy. The difference between \u201cco\u201d and \u201ccko\u201d is practically nil, and the whole case for the applicant hangs upon the insertion of an intermediate \u201ca\u201d which in pronouncing the word may be, and probably frequently is, slurred over.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">The goods of the parties are closely related products. The Board found that the goods of both \u201cmay be classified as electronic and electrical equipment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>are to some extent sold to the same classes of purchasers or advertised in the same publications\u201d\u2014a finding not questioned by the majority. Both the Board and the majority agree that the applicant\u2019s broad designation of the goods as power supplies \u201ccomprehends static and transistorized power equipment of the character sold by opposer.\u201d In other words, regardless of the precise types of equipment now being sold, if registration is allowed, the trademarks may be used in connection with identical goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We are not here concerned with the law of unfair competition nor with the right of the applicant to the use of its corporate name, nor with its good faith in adopting it as a trademark. The issue is confusing similarity of the marks and nothing else. It is true that precedents are not very helpful in determining that issue. Even so, I do not see how the court can be applying consistent standards as to likelihood of confusion when it decides that \u201cDyanshine\u201d and \u201cDi-shine\u201d (Barton Mfg. Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., supra) are confusingly similar and also that \u201cWinco\u201d and \u201cWiancko\u201d are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">This court, in a recent case in which it was held that \u201cHuvilon\u201d so resembled \u201cUvinul\u201d as to be confusingly similar, pointed out that \u201cThe fact that neither name has any meaning apart from the goods on which they are used makes it difficult for a purchaser to keep the names clear of possible confusion based on * * similarities.\u201d General Aniline &amp; Film Corp. v. Hukill Chemical Corp., Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 287 F.2d 926, 927. In the present case we have two perfectly meaningless words, both of them unusual and neither remotely suggestive of any English word. In the case of ordinary well known English words, most literate people know how the word should be spelled and, therefore, quickly notice a very slight variance. Not so with words like those before us or like \u201cHuvilon\u201d and \u201cUvinul\u201d. It seems to me that the soundness of the court\u2019s observation in the \u201cHuvilon\u201d case quoted above is demonstrated by the fact that in a period of seven months the letters received by the applicant showed over 100 different variations or misspellings of its name although the writers had the correct address and thus appeared to be acquainted with the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">I would reverse the decision of the Board.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-16\">. \u201cThere is no such thing as a correct pronounciation for a trade-mark. It is pronounced in different ways by different people.\u201d Barton Mfg. Co. v. Hercules Powder Co., 88 F.2d 708, 710, 24 CCPA 982.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
