This evidence might have been important because the warrant of arrest for the offenses had been issued on the basis of an application for an arrest warrant attributed to the complaining witness. If the warrant had been invalidly issued evidence obtained by the search and seizure which followed the arrest might not have been available to the prosecution at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">Appellant filed a motion for a new trial in the District Court, and the present appeal is from the order of the court denying the motion. The order recites that the evidence proffered in support of the motion qualified as newly discovered but that the arrest warrant application which resulted in the arrest was in fact and in law that of the complaining witness, and that the arrest accordingly was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">Upon examination of the testimony taken at the hearing on the motion we agree with the conclusion reached by the District Court and its order accordingly is</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-12\">.
