The opposition was predicated on opposer\u2019s prior registration No. 612,985 issued September 27, 1955 on its mark \u201cRedi-Are\u201d for \u201cwelding machines,\u201d and the alleged likelihood of confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers by reason of applicant\u2019s use of its mark on its goods. Applicant alleges first use of its mark on July 25, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The single issue presented here is whether applicant\u2019s mark \u201cREDI-SET\u201d when applied to applicant\u2019s goods is likely to cause confusion or mistake or deception of purchasers because of its similarity to opposer\u2019s registered mark \u201cRediArc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">While there are technical differences in the specific goods on which the parties use their respective marks, we do not consider these differences to be of significance here. As was stated in Hollywood Water Heater Co. v. Hollymatic Corp., 274 F.2d 679, 47 CCPA 782, \u201cSection 2 (d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 and the unquestioned weight of modern authority in this field does not require a finding of confusing similarity of goods as a basis for sustaining a trademark opposition * * <em>&amp;\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">The issue here must be determined primarily by a comparison of the marks in issue. Considered as wholes, the only similarity in sound and meaning of the marks is in the common use of the prefix \u201cRedi.\u201d In appearance they are similar in that both are hyphenated compound words with each suffix comprising a three letter word. While in a proper case the prefix \u201cRedi\u201d might be shown to possess distinctiveness as an indicator of source or origin of the goods to which it is applied, the present record does not afford us sufficient evidence of such distinctiveness. Instead, the prefix \u201cRedi\u201d is here used in both marks for its descriptive connotation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *****It is similarly shown in the fifteen third party registrations of record <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for various goods. These registrations are, therefore, some evidence of the lack of distinctiveness per se of the prefix \u201cRedi\u201d and hence of its inability to here function as an indicator of source or origin of the goods. Shoe Corporation of America v. The Juvenile Shoe Corporation of America, 266 F.2d 793, 46 CCPA 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">A non-distinctive prefix such as \u201credi\u201d when combined with other words or syllables may acquire with such other words or syllables, sufficient distinctiveness to serve as a trademark indicating the source of origin of the goods on which it is used. However, the words \u201care\u201d and \u201cset\u201d which opposer and applicant use respectively with the common prefix \u201credi\u201d are descriptive of the goods, i. e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>the arc drawn by opposer\u2019s welder and the set of equipment which applicant supplies as its welding apparatus. Such distinctiveness as is here present thus resides only in the combined words as unitary marks which must be compared in their entireties. Shoe Corporation of America v. The Juvenile Shoe Corporation of America, supra; Vita-Var Corporation v. Galvicon Corporation, 284 F.2d 953, 48 CCPA 771; E. L. Bruce Company v. American Termicide Co., 285 F.2d 462, 48 CCPA 762.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Thus, comparing the entire marks,'it is our opinion that they differ so in sound, meaning and appearance that there is no likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers arising by reason of the common use of the non-distinetive prefix \u201credi\u201d which on the present record is shown to be incapable per se of indicating source or origin of the goods on which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The marks in issue here are similar only insofar as both use the prefix <em>Redi. </em>Opposer\u2019s record here fails to establish facts to support a finding that such prefix has significance as an indicator of the source or origin of the goods on which it was applied. The term \u201cRedi\u201d as used by opposer and by applicant is used in the same sense as it is used in several of the third party registrations of record as descriptive of the availability of the goods for immediate use. As such it is descriptive of a property of the goods here in issue. The mere fact that opposer had used its mark \u201cRedi-Arc\u201d on its goods prior to applicant\u2019s use of its mark \u201cREDI-SET\u201d on its goods is not sufficient to establish that the prefix \u201cRedi\u201d had acquired such trademark significance that opposer was entitled to preclude registration of a mark by another merely because it too used the common descriptive prefix \u201cRedi.\u201d We think, therefore, that the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was in error in finding on the present record that the prefix \u201cRedi,\u201d in effect had \u201ctrademark significance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This court in a long line of decisions has refused to accord any great weight to terms such as the prefix \u201cRedi\u201d in determining whether marks are confusingly similar. See: The May Department Stores Co. v. Schloss Bros. &amp; Co., Inc., 234 F.2d 879, 43 CCPA 980, and cases.there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Where the only similarity of the marks is found in a common prefix which has been recognized for its descriptive connotation rather than as an indicator of source or origin of the goods on which it is used, it is insufficient for an opposer, as here, to prove merely a prior use thereof. It is essential in such a situation that opposer establish facts from which a determination can be made that such descriptive and common connotations of such prefix are subordinate to its acceptance as an indicator that opposer was the source of the goods on which the mark was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">This situation which prevails on the record here is similar to that which prevailed in Eastern Wine Corp. v. Winslow-Warren, Ltd., 137 F.2d 955 (C.C.A. 2), cert. den. 320 U.S. 758, 64 S.Ct. 65, 88 L. Ed. 452, where the court in holding that the mark \u201cChateau Montay\u201d did not infringe on the mark \u201cChateau Martin\u201d said at page 959 of 137 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">\u201cHere the plaintiff chose to build its business around the use of a name \u2018Chateau\u2019 which was previously in common use in advertising wines. It took the risk that competitors, old and new, would also use that common name. * * * Plaintiff, therefore, could not and did not pre-empt every use of \u2018Chateau\u2019 * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">Where, as here, the sole point of similarity of the marks is found in the common portions thereof which are descriptive of the goods or of some property thereof, such common portions, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, must be considered to indicate the <em>nature </em>of the goods rather than the <em>source </em>of the goods. It is the likelihood of confusion, mistake or deception of -purchasers as to the <em>source </em>of the goods on which applicant\u2019s mark is used which is recognized by the Lanham Act as a basis for refusing regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>tration under section 2(d). We are unwilling on the present record to predicate such likelihood on the tenuous proposition advanced by opposer that the marks in issue both utilize a term of common descriptive connotation such as \u201cRedi,\u201d which has not been shown to have been used in either mark in other than its common descriptive sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, and MARTIN, Judge, concur in result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-8\">. The prefix \u201cRedi\u201d is but a phonetic spelling of the word \u201cReady\u201d which Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-12\">\u201c * * * 2.

Akins, vice president and director of opposer, stated by affidavit that the trademark \u201cRedi-Arc\u201d has been used on \u201care welding machines and torches\u201d and that the mark \u201cRedi-Fast\u201d is being used by his company for battery chargers. The Notice of Opposition also asserts a possible future use by opposer of \u201c \u2018RediJet\u2019, as a trademark on welding and cutting outfits, as it expands its line of this type of welding equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">In answering opposer\u2019s interrogatories, appellant admitted that some welding operations can be satisfactorily performed through the use of either arc welding equipment or gas welding equipment. While not admitting that it is common in the trade for electrical welding machines and gas torches and welding and cutting outfits to be marketed through the same or partially the same channels, appellant did note that a \u201cpublication of the National Welding Supply Association * * * [discloses that] * * * 393 of 408 distributors [over 96 %] of welding equipment who are members of the association handle electric and gas welding equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The sole issue is whether appellant\u2019s \u201cREDI-SET,\u201d <em>as a whole, so </em>resembles opposer\u2019s registered mark \u201cRedi-Arc\u201d as to be <em>likely, </em>when applied to appellant\u2019s goods, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">In its decision sustaining the instant opposition, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-16\">\u201cThe term \u2018REDI\u2019 although suggesting that the products to which it is applied are available for instant use is not without trademark significance. Considering, therefore, that the marks \u2018REDI-SET\u2019 and \u2018REDIARC\u2019 are both composed of the term \u2018REDI\u2019 followed by the merely descriptive word \u2018SET\u2019 and \u2018ARC\u2019, it is concluded that the similarities between these marks are such that confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers is reasonably likely to occur.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-17\">Considering the undisputed prior use of \u201cRedi-Arc\u201d by opposer, opposer\u2019s manufacture and sale of both electric arc welders and gas welding outfits and the similar practices of others in the trade, I have no doubt that at least some people already familiar with the \u201cRedi-Arc\u201d line, upon seeing gas welding outfits for sale under the \u201cREDI-SET\u201d mark, are likely to conclude that there is a common source. They do not have to know <em>what </em>the source is. It is enough that they imagine it is the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-18\">It is common for concerns to have a family of products with similar marks on them. Obviously the suffix \u201cArc\u201d could not be used on a gas welding outfit and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>would seem <em>normal to </em>use <em>the </em>prefix \u201cRedi-\u201d with an appropriate suffix such as \u201cSet.\u201d The similarities between the two marks, considered as a whole, are too obvious for discussion. The majority opinion concedes similarity in appearance, that both are hyphenated, and both have identical prefixes and three-letter suffixes. The differences are not such as to make confusion unlikely. Neither are the differences in the goods. I cannot understand how it can be said that \u201cthe only similarity of the marks is found in a common prefix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Appellant strenuously argues that \u201cRedi-\u201d is descriptive and that \u201cArc\u201d and \u201cSet\u201d are too, hence that opposer\u2019s entire mark is descriptive, weak, and entitled to little protection. Not only are these arguments inconsistent with appellant\u2019s strenuous efforts to register \u201cREDISET,\u201d but clearly \u201cRedi-\u201d is not descriptive, merely suggestive. \u201cRedi-Arc,\u201d being registered on the Principle Register, is presumably a good trademark, not descriptive, and it sufficiently resembles \u201cREDI-SET,\u201d in my judgment, to prevent registration of the latter <em>on such closely similar goods </em>under the.conditions prevailing in this trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">As to the third-party registrations, in the Shoe Corporation case, cited by the majority, the word \u201cLazy\u201d was discounted as an origin indicator in marks for shoes in view of its incorporation as the first word in five other registrations of marks <em>for shoes. </em>Of the 15 third-party registrations in footnote 2 of the majority opinion there is but one (524,179) remotely related to this case. It is for welding rods and is not a hyphenated mark. The others truly are for \u201cvarious goods\u201d ranging from corn poppers and frying griddles to vacuum cleaners and oil burners. I think that notwithstanding such uses \u2014 even assuming the marks <em>are </em>in use so as to condition the public mind, an assumption supported by no proof whatever \u2014 \u201cREDI-\u201d plus a three-letter suffix may have very great origin-indicating ability and significance <em>in the welding field. </em>I think citation to a dictionary showing that \u201cready\u201d is a word of the English language and stating what it means would have more relevance here than the third-party registrations.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">It seems to me apropos to quote here a paragraph from a very recent board opinion, Union Carbide Corp. v. Midwest Mower Corp., 132 USPQ 689 (1962), involving another \u201cready\u201d mark, to wit, \u201cEVEREADY.\u201d The applicant, seeking to register \u201cEVER-READY,\u201d put over 100 third-party registrations into the record. Applying views previously expressed by this court, the board said (132 USPQ at 691):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">\u201cIt has been argued that \u2018EVERREADY\u2019 is a weak mark. The term \u2018EVEREADY\u2019 or \u2018EVER-READY\u2019 does have a definite suggestive meaning and the record discloses innumerable registrations thereof for a wide variety of goods. If a trademark, however weak, is to retain any validity, its owner must be protected where the circumstances are such that a substantial likelihood of confusion would result by the use of identical marks. See: King-Kup Candies, Inc. v. King Candy Company, [288 F.2d 944, 48 CCPA 948].\u201d I would affirm.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
