At the time, appellant had been placed under arrest and the officer was at a call box, sending for the police patrol. Although there was a conflict, there was evidence from which the jury could have concluded as it did conclude, that the officer was attacked when the appellant sought to effectuate his escape. Appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel have earnestly urged all that could be said in appellant\u2019s behalf but we find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
