However, for many widows of ranking employees in companies, this cause for worry has been alleviated by the practice of the employer making payments to the widow for limited periods following the husband\u2019s death, frequently by continuing to pay her the salary her husband would have received had he lived. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has since 1950<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sought to treat such payments as ordinary income to the widow under the general provisions of section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 61.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The widows, on the other hand, have contended with considerable success in the courts that the payments were gifts, hence not includible in gross income under section 102.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue in the present case is of this character. We are asked by a widow to reverse a decision of the Tax Court which treats as ordinary income the payments made to her by a corporation of which for 38 years her husband had been president and majority stockholder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The statutory definition of a \u201cgift\u201d which is excluded from a person\u2019s gross income by section 102 and the function of an appellate court in reviewing the findings of the trier of fact in these cases have recently received extensive attention by the Supreme Court. Commissioner v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218 (1960). A study of this decision indicates that in any given case there are three steps which must be followed in reaching a conclusion. First, the trier of fact must make findings as to the basic facts, the actual happenings. These findings may not be upset if found by a jury unless the reviewing court is convinced that reasonable men could make only contrary findings, or, if found by a judge without a jury, unless clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-18\">Second, the trier of fact must draw from these basic findings his inferences as to the \u201cdominant reason\u201d for the payments \u2014 the answer to the question why the payments were made. This determination too is one of fact as to which appellate review is restricted to the clearly erroneous standard where, as in the present case, a judge sat without a jury. The scope of review is therefore limited to ascertaining whether the trier of fact considered the correct criteria in making the factual inferences and whether the finding as to dominant motive is sufficiently supported in the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-19\">Third, the lower court must decide whether the dominant reason, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>found, for the payments is such as to require gift treatment and an escape from taxation under section 102, or income treatment and taxation under section 61. This question, involving the proper meaning of the statutory term \u201cgift,\u201d is one of law as to which an appellate court may make an independent judgment. To give guidance in the decision of future cases, the majority opinion in Duberstein summarized earlier oases, citing specific examples of motives which require as a matter of law either the conclusion that the payments are a gift or that they are income, as those terms are used in the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Now we shall see how this three-stage approach was followed in the case before us. The basic facts are undisputed since the parties submitted the case to the Tax Court upon stipulation. Over a span of 38 years before his death on January 31, 1956, Mervin G. Pierpont, the taxpayer\u2019s husband, served as the president of the Loewy Drug Company, a wholesale drug distributor in Baltimore. Throughout the entire period, he owned two-thirds of the outstanding stock, the rest being owned by Morton L. Lazarus. The company had paid him all amounts owed for his services. On March 22, 1956, the Board of Directors of the company passed a resolution whereby a 1954 Cadillac, valued at $3,245.14, was transferred to his widow. The resolution stated that \u201cin recognition of the services rendered by the late Mervin G. Pierpont, this Corporation pay to his widow as a continuance of his salary the sum of Three Thousand, Two Hundred Forty-Five Dollars and Fourteen Cents * * By a similar resolution passed the following month, the company undertook to pay his widow $600 per month either until the payments aggregated $20,000 or until further action by the Board. She received under the two resolutions a total of $9,910.05 in 1956 and $7,800.00 in 1957 when the payments were terminated upon the liquidation of the company. It was stipulated in the Tax Court that the payments were \u201cnot made pursuant to any contract, plan, policy, practice, or understanding made or in effect prior to the Decedent\u2019s death.\u201d However, there is no mention in the stipulation as to who were the directors who authorized the payments and what were their relationships to the widow; neither are we told to whom Pierpont devised his controlling interest in the company, or what the widow\u2019s personal financial status may have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">In her 1956 tax return the widow reported as a gift the $9,910.05 received in that year. The Commissioner, however, determined that it was income to her, applied the $5000 exclusion provided for employee death benefits by section 101 (b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and asserted a tax deficiency of $1,-376.22 on the remaining $4,910.05. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>sums paid the widow had been fully deducted by the company as an expense of doing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">From the stipulated facts, the Tax Court proceeded to draw factual inferences as to motive. Referring to the two corporate resolutions which authorized the payments, the Tax Court said that they \u201csuggest that the dominant intention of the donor was to pay additional compensation in respect of the decedent\u2019s services.\u201d In addition, the court found that there was \u201cnothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the alleged gifts \u2018proceed [ed] from a detached and disinterested generosity * * * out of affection, respect, admiration, charity or like impulses,\u2019 \u201d motives which the Supreme Court recognized in Duberstein as indicating gift treatment. The Tax Court then summarized its findings and conclusions by saying that \u201cthe payments in controversy were not intended as a \u2018gift,\u2019 \u201d and treated them as income.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> We think that the findings of the Tax Court regarding the dominant reason for the payments, based as they are upon the stipulated facts, cannot be sustained. The decisions in the Tax Court prior to the Duberstein case<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> established a set of factors to be evaluated in discovering the dominant motive for such payments to widows, and our decision in Bounds v. United States, 262 F.2d 876 (4th Cir. 1958), recognized and followed these criteria. The clearest formulation appears in Florence S. Luntz, 29 T.C. 647, 650 (1958), where the Tax Court listed the following as the five factors to be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">\u201c(1) the payments had been made to the wife of the deceased employee and not to his estate; (2) there was no obligation on the part of the corporation to pay any additional compensation to the deceased employee; (3) the corporation derived no benefit from the payment; (4) the wife of the deceased employee performed no services for the corporation; and (5) the services of her husband had been fully compensated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">The stipulated facts directly respond to every one of the five factors, and in each instance the response is favorable to the widow. This being so, we see.no justification for the Tax Court\u2019s finding that \u201cthere is no solid evidence that they [the directors authorizing the payments] were motivated in any part by the widow\u2019s needs or by a sense of generosity or the like.\u201d In every prior Tax Court case, essentially identical facts were held sufficient to support the conclusion that the dominant motive was sympathy for the taxpayer\u2019s widowed position. The only evidence on which the Tax Court specifically relies for its contrary finding is the wording of the authorizing corporate resolutions. While the language of the resolutions certainly merits considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tion, never before has such language been deemed sufficient by itself, and in the face of the other above specified factors, to support a finding that the payments were compensation for services rendered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the facts stipulated in this case do not differ from those deemed conclusive in past cases, a contrary finding seems to us without warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The Supreme Court in Duberstein did not destroy the authority of the earlier Tax Court cases and the guides enunciated in them for discovering motivation. The plea addressed by the Government to the Supreme Court in Duberstein to establish a new test defining \u201cgift\u201d was expressly rejected. The Court limited itself to summarizing earlier decisions as to which particular dominant motivations, when adequately supported by the evidence, result in income treatment, and which result in gift treatment. An enumeration of the criteria, by which the trier of fact shall determine in every type of case what that dominant reason is, was deemed inadvisable, if not futile. The Court preferred to leave the development of such criteria to a case-by-case approach in the lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">On the other hand, Duberstein cannot be read as limiting inquiry by the trier of fact solely to the factors recognized by the earlier decisions. The objective is to discover which motive is dominant in a field of co-existing motives. In the task of sorting out the varying motives, the development of more reliable criteria by the triers of fact should not be curtailed. Indeed, the Tax Court since Duberstein has considered it necessary to inquire into the widow\u2019s stock holdings in the company<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the knowledge or lack of it on the part of the Board of her financial status following the death of her husband.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Tax Court in the present case also seems to have thought that the directors\u2019 knowledge of \u201cthe widow\u2019s needs\u201d was an important factor. These subjects are certainly relevant, and inquiry may properly be directed to them, and whatever other factors the trier of fact might think helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Nevertheless, none of the facts stipulated in the present case touches upon those additional factors which since Duberstein have been important. The stipulations were made before Duberstein and covered only the criteria which had up to that time been formulated and treated by the Tax Court and this circuit as decisive. It would be unfair now to allow findings to stand, which are adverse to the taxpayer because of her silence on matters never deemed pertinent in earlier litigation. '\"While, as we have indicated, it is perfectly proper for the court to broaden the field of inquiry beyond that previously established, this should not be done without affording an opportunity to the taxpayer, and to the Government as well, to amplify the record. Of course, we do not undertake to dictate the result to be reached upon the broadened inquiry. Additional data which the parties will be free to produce may have the effect of confirming or overcoming the result which the five Luntz factors, standing alone, were held to require in the earlier cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Decision vacated and case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\">.

This ..restricted scope of review was applied in Kaiser v. United States, 363 U.S. 299, 80 S.Ct. 1204, 4 L.Ed.2d 1233 (1960), and by the courts of appeals in United States v. Stanton, 287 F.2d 876 (2d Cir. 1961), and United States v. Kasynski, 284 F.2d 143 (10th Cir. 1960). In defining the proper scope of appellate review, the Supreme Court in Duberstein specifically adopted the view of the dissenters in Bogardus v. Commissioner, 302 U.S. 34, 39, 44, 58 S.Ct. 61, 64, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>L.Ed. 32 (1937). The majority had there held that drawing factual inferences from the basic facts as to the reasons for the payments was \u201ca conclusion of law or at least a determination of a mixed question of law and fact,\u201d a question to which the clearly erroneous standard of review did not apply so that an appellate court could more independently exercise its own judgment. The courts of appeals, however, did not consistently use this approach. Compare Simpson v. United States, 261 F.2d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1958) (broad review), with United States v. Allinger, 275 F.2d 421, 423 (6th Cir. 1960) (narrow review). In Bounds v. United States, 262 F.2d 876, 880 (4th Cir. 1958), relying on the majority\u2019s opinion in Bogardus, we felt at liberty to apply the broad scope of review in reversing the findings of the District Court as to motive. Consequently, we would be guilty of no inconsistency were we to reach a different result here, having proceeded in Bounds according to a now unacceptable standard for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">. 363 U.S. at 285, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\">. \u201c\u00a7 101.
