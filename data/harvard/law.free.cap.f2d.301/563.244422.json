Oppenheimer was one of its stockholders. The District of Columbia assessed a deficiency in Oppenheimer\u2019s 1953 income tax, based on the difference between the amount she invested in the corporation and the value of the property it distributed to her when it was dissolved. The question is whether this difference was a \u201cdividend\u201d as the term is defined in the District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1947, as amended: \u201cThe word \u2018dividend\u2019 means any distribution made by a corporation * * * to its stockholders * * <em>* </em>out of its earnings, profits, or surplus (other than paid-in surplus), whenever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>earned by the corporation * * * and whether distributed prior to, during, upon, or after liquidation or dissolution of the corporation * * D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1551e(m) (1951), 61 Stat. 332. In other words, did the unrealized appreciation in the value of General Realties\u2019 assets become a \u201cdividend\u201d when the corporation distributed the assets to the stockholders ?</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">We think the District of Columbia Tax Court was clearly right in holding it was not a dividend. The critical statutory word is \u201cearned\u201d. Since the corporation never realized the appreciation, by sale or otherwise, it was never a part of the corporation\u2019s income or earnings. Even a corporation which calls its distribution of appreciated property a \u201cdividend\u201d does not realize a taxable gain. General Utilities &amp; Operating Co. v. Helvering, 296 U.S. 200, 56 S.Ct. 185, 80 L.Ed. 154. The District places some reliance on Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hirshon Trust, 213 F.2d 523, 56 A.L.R.2d 467 (2d Cir., 1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 861, 75 S.Ct. 85, 99 L.Ed. 679. But even in that case the court said: \u201cBoth parties here agree with the premise of the Tax Court in the Godley case [Estate of Godley v. Commissioner, 19 T.C. 1082] * * * that under \u00a7 115(a) unrealized appreciation in corporate assets may not be reckoned in \u2018earnings or profits\u2019 * * 213 F.2d at 527. It now \u201cseems well settled that unrealized appreciation does not increase \u2018earnings and profits\u2019.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Gross, 236 F.2d 612, 618 (2d Cir., 1956). See also Harry Handley Cloutier, 24 T.C. 1006, 1013. In Berliner v. District of Columbia, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 351, 258 F.2d 651, we held that a distribution stipulated to have been paid out of surplus, which a corporation had acquired by sale of its property and business, became taxable to its stockholders as a dividend when the corporation was dissolved and the surplus distributed. But that was a case of realized appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
