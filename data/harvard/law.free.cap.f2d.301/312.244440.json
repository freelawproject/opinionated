The disputed tax liability arose over the valuation of sheep which appellant-taxpayers had on hand on November 1, 1945. Prior to that date, taxpayers had followed an accrual method of accounting wherein they inventoried their purchased and raised animals on a \u201cunit-livestock-price\u201d basis and deducted the difference between their \u201cbook-value\u201d and the \u201ccost-price\u201d in the year of purchase. Subsequent to November 1, 1945, the government required taxpayers to value all sheep purchased at \u201ccost\u201d and to include them in inventory, or, in the alternative, to treat them as a capital asset subject to depreciation. Taxpayers elected to depreciate the animals purchased after November 1, 1945, but the animals on hand on that date were left in inventory and their value was not adjusted in computing taxpayers\u2019 past tax liability. Taxpayers seek an adjustment which would allow for prior depreciation of the ani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>mals in the opening inventory and base their claim for over-statement and overpayment of taxes on the refusal by the government to allow them to deduct the prior depreciation on those animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">We concur entirely with the sound reasoning and conclusion in the trial court\u2019s reported decision and adopt it as the opinion of this Court. Visintainer v. Allan (D.Colo.), 191 F.Supp. 425.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
