Three men were seated in an automobile, parked by the curb with the motor running. Holloway was in the driver\u2019s seat. Two police officers, on police business unrelated to any of these three, were passing by. They recognized Holloway as a known addict, and they knew he did not have an automobile driver\u2019s license. They stopped to inquire. Holloway refused to display a license or to open the car door. He made a gesture toward his mouth with his right hand; one officer observed white capsules in his hand and called out to his brother officer, \u201cHe is eating the caps.\u201d Thereupon the latter officer opened the curbside door and placed Holloway under arrest. Heroin was found in Holloway\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">The points on this appeal are, principally, that the heroin taken from Holloway\u2019s pocket was inadmissible as evidence and that the trial judge should have directed a verdict of acquittal or granted a motion for a new trial. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">A companion case, No. 16635, Jackson v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. -, 301 F.2d 515, is also decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
