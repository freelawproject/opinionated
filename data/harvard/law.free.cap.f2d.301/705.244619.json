Rev. \u00a7 42-77 (1958) (Requirements for Conditional Sales Contracts). The ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>eree\u2019s order was affirmed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The requirement of acknowledgment in \u00a7 42-77 was not repealed by the Uniform Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title and Anti-Theft Act, Conn.Gen.Stat.Rev. \u00a7\u00a7 14-165 to 211 (1958).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 14-190 of that Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-5\"><em>\u201cMethod of perfecting interest exclusive. </em>The method provided in this chapter of perfecting and giving notice of security interests subject to this chapter is exclusive. Security interests subject to this chapter are hereby exempted from the provisions of law which otherwise require or relate to the filing of instruments creating or evidencing security interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The Uniform Act was prepared by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and was submitted to the various states with accompanying Notes. The Note to the \u201cexclusivity\u201d provision (\u00a7 14-190) specifically instructs legislative draftsmen to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-7\">\u201c[ijnsert in the brackets appropriate phraseology to refer to technical requirements of other statutes relating not only to recording or filing of security interests but also to acknowledgments, affidavits of good faith, witnesses, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">The Connecticut enactment dispenses only with \u201crequirements of other statutes\u201d relating to \u201cthe <em>filing </em>of instruments\u201d (emphasis supplied). The failure of the legislature to extend the exemption to the requirement of acknowledgment indicates an intent to continue that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">There is no inconsistency between the statutes if the exclusive perfection procedure set forth in the Uniform Act is read to refer to the perfection of valid security interests, i. e. security interests <em>created </em>in accordance with the applicable law which includes the requirement of acknowledgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\"> Repeals by implication are not favored, see Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 456-57, 65 S.Ct. 716, 89 L.Ed. 1051 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b754-10\">. We find no instance in which a Connecticut court has passed on the question of statutory interpretation here presented. Two Referees in Bankruptcy in the District of Connecticut have decided that \u00a7 42-77 was not repealed as to conditional sales of motor vehicles by the Uniform Act. In re Robena Harrington, 34 Conn.B.J. 368 (1960); In re Floyd Edward Ramsdell, No. 29448, August 18, 1960, aff\u2019d, Sept. 23, 1960, D.Conn. (Anderson, Ch.
