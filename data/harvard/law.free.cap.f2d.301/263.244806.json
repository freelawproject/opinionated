Originally the fruit cake business was a side line to Community\u2019s operation of a number of retail bakery stores in Chicago but in 1959 the retail stores were sold and Community has since engaged exclusively in the baking of fruit cakes. The business is seasonal, commencing between May and July and terminating in December.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In 1958, when sufficient orders had accumulated, the fruit cake business was established as a separate operation at Community\u2019s Western Avenue plant. A majority of the fruit cake production employees were unskilled, hired \u201coff the street,\u201d and at the close of the season all but a few of these employees, who were needed for clean-up and repair, were discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In mid-July, 1958, as in prior years, Community made no effort to contact employees who had previously worked for it on a seasonal basis although, as the president of Community testified, it was \u201cmore receptive to hiring a good former employee * * * than a person off of the street without any experience.\u201d In fact approximately thirty per cent of the employees hired in 1958 had worked for Community in former years.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In the fall of 1958 two labor unions, Local 2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *3 and Local 15 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, began to compete for the right to represent the production and maintenance employees of the Western Avenue plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">On September 20, 1958 Local 15 called a strike, characterized by the Board as an \u201ceconomic strike.\u201d Approximately fifty employees joined the strike. By hiring replacement employees, however, Community was able to operate without interruption. When the strike ended November 11, 1958 all strikers who applied were reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">The Board conducted an election in December, 1958 to determine which of the rival unions should represent the employees. Local 15 charged that Community interfered with the election by assisting Local 2. The charge resulted in the election being set aside pursuant to an agreement between Community and the- Board. The Board ordered a new election held during the 1959 season.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">The second election in August, 1959 was won by Local 2. Local 15 then filed objections to the second election based in part on Community\u2019s alleged discriminatory rehire formula for the 1959 season.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">The attacked rehire formula which Community adopted in April, 1959 was, as <em>to it, novel. The </em>Trial Examiner for the Board made the following finding concerning the formula:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-17\">\u201cThe Respondent had not established any seniority system prior to the end of the 1958 season. In April, 1959, [certain Community officials] met to decide on a method for hiring employees for the 1959 season. They first considered rehiring past employees on the basis of merit. This was discarded because, as the Respondent kept no permanent records pertaining to performance, there was no point of reference other than memory. Therefore, it was felt that such a system might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>give rise to numerous objections from individual employees of the two competing Unions. The next suggested method of hire was to rehire old employees in order of their first date of hire. This also was rejected on the grounds that \u2018there had been too much intermittent working\u2019 and that it \u2018could lead to * * * greater problems than perhaps some other methods might bring about.\u2019 The criteria finally adopted for determining hiring for the 1959 season were as follows: Former employees who had worked for the Respondent prior to 1958 were given preference over those who had worked for the Respondent only during the 1958 season. Those who had worked only during the 1958 season were to be selected for rehire in order of 'their length of \u2018actual working experience\u2019 during the 1958 season. In determining the length of \u2018actual working experience,\u2019 only time actually worked was to be considered, regardless of the reason for absence. Thus, time during which an employee did not work because he was on strike, was ill, was laid off, or was absent for any other cause was to be disregarded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In accordance with this new rehire formula Community gave no credit to the striking employees for the weeks they were on strike in 1958 when considering their priority to being rehired in 1959. The Board found that \u201c15 strikers lost from one week to six months of employment during the 1959 season solely because the Respondent on the basis of its newly created seniority formula either refused to rehire or delayed in rehiring these employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The Trial Examiner sustained the charge that Community had engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8(a) (1) and (3), supra, on the basis that its 1959 rehire formula was per se discriminatory to the striking employees. In the course of his intermediate report the Examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">We turn * * * to a determination of what is perhaps the key issue. * * * Whether the rehire formula adopted by the Respondent in April 1959, and thereafter put into effect, was discriminatory per se because it failed to credit strikers for time during which they engaged in a lawful economic strike, regardless of the Respondent\u2019s motive? ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">\u00ab* * * employer\u2019s failure or refusal to accord seniority to strikers during the period of the strike in a situation such as existed here, regardless of motive, has the effect of penalizing the strikers and acts to the detriment of their tenure of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">\u201c * * * And this is true regardless of the Respondent\u2019s motivation in doing so. It is therefore unnecessary to reach the question of the Respondent\u2019s intent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">The Board .rejected the Examiner\u2019s finding that the rehire formula was discriminatory per se. Instead the Examiner\u2019s conclusion that the formula was unlawful was upheld for the reason that, \u201cIn the circumstances of this proceeding we are persuaded that the natural and foreseeable consequence of Respondent\u2019s rehire formula was to discourage employees from union membership in contravention of the Act. Respondent must be held to have intended this result.\u201d (Citing Radio Officers\u2019 of Commercial Telegraphers Union v. N. L. R. B., 347 U.S. 17, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455) As dissenting Board member Rogers pointed out, the Board did not, however, find that Community was discriminatorily motivated in adopting the rehire formula; but by putting special stress on certain factors dealing with how Community managed its business the Board seemed \u201cto suggest that a discriminatory motive was present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">After the Board\u2019s decision the Supreme Court decided Local 357, International Brotherhood of Teamsters etc. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>N. L. R. B., 365 U.S. 667, 81 S.Ct. 835, 6 L.Ed.2d 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In Local 357 the Board contended that all it must show to sustain a charge of a violation of Section 8(a) (1) and (3) in the light of Radio Officers is that a tendency of the questioned conduct to encourage or discourage union membership was foreseeable to an employer or union; since one is presumed to intend the foreseeable consequence of his acts and since acting in order to encourage or discourage union membership is forbidden, the Board\u2019s case is made by a simple showing that such encouragement or discouragement is the foreseeable result of the employer\u2019s or union\u2019s action. 'The Supreme Court rejected this contention by pointing out that, \u201cIt is the \u2018true purpose\u2019 or \u2018real motive\u2019 in hiring or firing that constitutes the test,\u201d although, \u201cSome conduct may by its very nature contain the implications of the required intent; the natural foreseeable consequences of certain action may warrant the inference.\u201d Supra, 365 U.S. at 675, 81 S.Ct. at 839. Mr. Justice Harlan, in a concurring opinion, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart concurred, made explicit what he believed to be implicit in the opinion written for the Court by Mr. Justice Douglas. Mr. Justice Harlan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cWhat in my view is wrong with the Board\u2019s position in these cases is that a mere showing of foreseeable encouragement of union status is not a sufficient basis for a finding of violation of the statute. It has long been recognized that an employer can make reasonable business decisions, unmotivated by an intent to discourage union membership or protected concerted activities, although the foreseeable effect of these decisions may be to discourage what the act protects.\u201d Supra, 365 U.S. at 679, 81 S.Ct. at 841.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Even though it appears the Board in the instant case relied upon a \u201cforeseeability\u201d test such as was rejected by Local 357, it now contends that the lack of direct evidence to show Community was motivated by a desire to discourage union membership is of no significance. It argues that Community\u2019s conduct by its very nature contained the implications of the required intent; that the natural foreseeable consequence of this action warrants the inference. (Citing Local 357)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">We do not agree with the Board\u2019s contention. The inconsistency of its position is obvious insofar as it attempts to justify its decision on the ground that the rehire formula is discriminatory \u201cby its very nature\u201d when the Board specifically held that the formula was not discriminatory \u201cper se.\u201d The two concepts equate.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Aside from this inconsistency of the Board\u2019s position there is evidence that Community\u2019s rehire formula was initiated pursuant to a legitimate business purpose. Although Community had previously made no attempt to employ a plan for rehiring its seasonal employees, the situation at the beginning of the 1959 season made the adoption of a plan imperative. In the words of dissenting Board member Rogers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">\u201c * * * during the 1958 season the Respondent had a total complement of 181 employees, and Respondent needed only about half of this number for the 1959 season. The fact that there would be an election in which Local 15 and Local 2 would be competing made obvious the need for the adoption of some kind of employing formula which could not be attacked by either union as discriminatory, and which would still provide the Respondent with the most qualified workers. Certainly, had the Respondent kept work performance records, they probably would have better suited the Respondent\u2019s purpose. But the absence of such records by itself does not evidence an unlawful motivation; rather, it only serves to underline Respondent\u2019s need to devise another reasonable basis for hire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Because the record contains evidence of a legitimate business motivation for the rehire formula and since the formula applied equally to both strikers and non-strikers we hold, on the authority of Local 357, that the formula was not discriminatory by its nature; that to find a violation the Board was required to make a finding that Community\u2019s intent in adopting the rehire formula was to discriminate against the employees who had struck in 1958; and that since no such finding was made or could have been made when the record as a whole is considered, the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order must be and is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">.
