To the contrary, we find that the evidence fully warranted the findings of the trial court and its conclusion to the effect that \u201cThe equities are with the Intervenor and the Union and against the plaintiff, and the defendant Union has the right to negotiate with the defendant Railroad for modification of the 1952 merger agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-19\">The judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
