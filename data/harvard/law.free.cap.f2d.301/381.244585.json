The indictment in this case is in seventeen counts, one count of which charged six defendants, including appellants, with conspiracy to violate the alcohol tax laws and sixteen substantive counts charging various defendants with illegal sales of alcohol in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5205, 5604, 5642 and 5008. The jury returned a verdict of guilty against both appellants on all counts in which they were named. Verra was given concurrent sentences of two years on each of the four counts and a fine of $2,000. Piccirillo was given concurrent sentences of eighteen months on each of the five counts and a fine of $2,-500. The other defendants received suspended sentences. Appellants seek a reversal on three grounds: insufficiency of the evidence, alleged inflammatory remarks of the prosecutor, and failure to charge the jury as requested by appellant Verra.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-17\">Appellants\u2019 major attack on the evidence involves the credibility of government witnesses, which is a jury question. However, we have read the entire record in the case and are convinced that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. See United States v. Delli Paoli, 229 F.2d 319 (2 Cir.), aff\u2019d, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957). The objections to the argument of the prosecutor do not amount to prejudicial error. United States v. Universita, 298 F.2d 365 (2 Cir. 1962). Appellant Verra\u2019s contention that the charge to the jury, while in substantial compliance with appellant\u2019s request, was erroneous because it was not in the exact words requested is without merit. Rule 52(a), F.R.Crim.P., 18 U.S.C.A.; United States v. Arrow Packing Corp., 153 F.2d 669 (2 Cir. 1946) cert. denied 327 U.S. 805, 66 S. Ct. 962, 90 L.Ed. 1030 (1946).
