CLARKE, Appellant, v. UNITED STATES of America, Appellee.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b591-10\">No. 16722.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b591-11\">United States Court of Appeals District of Columbia Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b591-12\">Argued March 7, 1962.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b591-13\">Decided March 29, 1962.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b591-14\">Petition for Rehearing Denied April 18, 1962.</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-19\">Mr. George R. Gallagher, Washington, D. C. (appointed by this court), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-20\">Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam, Asst. U. S. Atty., with whom Messrs. David C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Acheson, U. S. Atty., Nathan J. Paulson, and Thomas A. Flannery, Asst. U. S. Attys., were on the brief, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b592-4\">Before Fahy, Washington and Danaher, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Appellant was convicted by a jury on each of two counts of an indictment, one under the so-called White Slave Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the other under the related provision of the District of Columbia Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sentences are concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The principal contention urged by able counsel appointed by this court is that it was reversible error for the trial judge, at the conclusion of his charge to the jury, to refuse to grant an oral request then made that the charge be enlarged to include a specific reference to defendant\u2019s theory of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The court, Judge Jackson sitting, had not reviewed or commented upon any of the evidence in the charge to the jury. The elements essential to be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict were explained without reference to any aspect of the evidence. In view of this, and the circumstances of the case as a whole, including the omission of counsel prior to the charge to suggest or formulate the desired instruction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we think it was not reversible error for the court to refuse to reopen its charge as requested. Compare Levine v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 281, 261 F.2d 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">We note appellant\u2019s request that a ruling be reserved as to the authority of the trial judge to preside, pending decision by the Supreme Court in Lurk v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 296 F.2d 360, cert. granted, 368 U.S. 815, 82 S.Ct. 110, 7 L.Ed.2d 23. In view of this court\u2019s decision in Lurk, and the procedural avenues available to appellant to preserve his rights, we do not think that a postponement of our decision of this case is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">We have considered appellant\u2019s other contentions and find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421 (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-11\">. 22 D.C.Code \u00a7 2705 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b592-12\">. See Fed.R.Crim.P. rule 30, 18 U.S.C. We note that appellant does not show any prejudice resulting from the refusal of the trial court to grant his request. Cf. Rule 52(b) Fed.R.Crim.P. We note further that the accused took the stand, and made his version of the facts quite clear to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
