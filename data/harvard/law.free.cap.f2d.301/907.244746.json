A judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff-appellant but the total amount of damages awarded him was diminished by 40% by reason of his contributory negligence. It is from this reduction that he has appealed. We can perceive no error in what the trial court did. The diminution finds adequate support in the evidence of the contributory negligence of the appellant. Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 53. Accordingly the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
