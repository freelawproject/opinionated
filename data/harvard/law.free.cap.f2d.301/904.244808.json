Appellee obtained a summary judgment, and order for the delivery of the securities to it, and levied a writ of execution. Appellant moved for a stay of execution, and moved to quash the summary judgment. Both motions were denied. The levy of execution was then issued, and the securities were delivered to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-21\">The judgment, having gone to execution, has eliminated any controversy between the parties, and there is no issue on the merits which this court can decide. The appeal is moot, and is dismissed. Brownlow v.
