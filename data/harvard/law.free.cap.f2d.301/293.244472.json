He took no appeal. In 1957 he filed a motion in pursuance of \u00a7 2255 to vacate the sentence imposed, on the ground that his conviction was obtained through violation of his constitutional rights by the admission of certain evidence obtained in an allegedly unlawful search of his premises by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The district court\u2019s denial of that motion was affirmed by this court. Beasley v. United States, 6 Cir., 257 F.2d 414. Appellant\u2019s present motion to vacate his sentence is based upon the same grounds as his. above-mentioned 1957 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-20\">Section 2255 provides that \u201cthe sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.\u201d As the appellant\u2019s present or second motion to vacate sentence is based upon the same grounds as his former motion, which was denied, we affirm the order of the district court denying his present motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
