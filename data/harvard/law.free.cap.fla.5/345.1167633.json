On the day following, to-wit: on the 15th March, 1844, by act of the Legislature, the rate of interest was reduced from eight to six per cent. The Court below ruled that interest on the note should be calculated at the rate of eight pep cent., from which the defendant appealed,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-10\"><em>Bush </em>for Appellant s</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-11\">The only error alleged in this cas\u00e9is, that interest should have been calculated at six per cent, instead of eight. The suit was on a note dated 14th March, 1844, and due at one day after date. It contained no agreement as to the rate of interest. The last law on the subject was approved 15th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>March, 1844. I can find no authorities directly in point, but think there is an analogy between the present and the cases which decide that the rate of interest is governed by the law of the country where the note is to be paid. Story\u2019s Conf. Laws, 241, \u00a7 291, 292; Scofield vs. Day, 20 J. R., 102; Cooper vs. Sandford, 4 Yerger, 452; Fanning vs. Consequa, 17 J. R., 511; Boyce <em>&amp; </em>Henry vs. Edwards, 4 Peters, 112, 123. And. this notwithstanding <em>that </em>well established principle of the law, \u201c that all questions affecting-<em>u </em>the validity of a contract, are to be governed by the law \u201c of the land where the contract is made.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The decisions are, that interest follows of course, after the debt falls <em>due, as an'incident to it. </em>Washington vs. Planter\u2019s Bank, 1 How. (Miss.,) 230; McConnell vs. Thomas, 2 Scam., 313, cited in Supplement 2 U. S. Digest, 209, 210, Nos. 60, 75.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">Incident means to fall out, to happen, &amp;e. Now, by what law is an event to be governed other than that in force when the event happens ? Webster defines it to be iC something which happens outside of the main design.\u201d It is separate from, and forms no part of the contract. The contract is the act of the party : interest, its incident, results from the law. They well be governed by different laws.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">Another analogy. The merchants at the Soiith give \u25a0their notes to those of New York, payable at certain periods after date, <em>with the current rate </em>of exchange on New York. This exchange is calculated by the rate at the time the note falls due. Why should not interest be assessed by the same rulo ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-8\">Another analogy. At common law, judgments did not bear interest. It exists by statutory provisions. The law is changed between the date of the note and the rendition of the j udgment. IV hich law governs ? Certain]y the lat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ter; and this because it is competent for the Legislature to change the rate at any time before it begins to run.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-4\">And again. The measure of damages for the violation of a contract for delivery of property at a certain future time, is the value of the property at the time of the breach, with interest from that time. This is a contract for the payment of money : there is no difference in principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">It sometimes happens that between the date and maturity of a note, a ebangeftakes place in the value of the coin or currency in which it is payable, even in the same country. It will be discharged by due pa-yment in any coin which, by law, is made of equivalent value at the time of payment. Sedgwick on Damages, 287; Story on Prom. Notes, 511, \u00a7 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">In the cases quoted and the one now before the Court, the action of the Legislature was between the date of the note and its maturity. If legitimate in those cases, it must \u25a0certainly he so in this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-7\">As to the time when this note fell due, adding the days of grace, it became due on the 18th, or three days after the law was passed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-8\">All notes payable at a certain time after dato, arc, by the \u25a0law, entitled to grace. Story on Prom. Notes, 272, \u00a7 224. The prospective words in the statute apply only to conventional rules agreed on by the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">As to the Constitutional question, the only answer is, that interest is an <em>incident to </em>a contract, but forms no part of-it; that tbe act left tbe contract entire in all its parts, untouched and unimpaired; that it only operated upon ,\u00a3\u00a3 something\u2019 outside of the main design.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-10\"><em>Hawkins </em>for Appellee:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-11\">The Court below was correct in its decision</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>1. To rule otherwise, would, impair the obligations of a contract.

Story, \u00a7 1379. To apply the law of 1844, <em>(six </em>per cent, act,) would give it a retrospective operation, changing and affecting vested rights : <em>void. </em>1 Kent, 456; 2 Pet., 656.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-10\">2. The laws regulating interest operate on the contract, and do not affect the remedy. Declaratory Statutes. If remedial, they cannot operate retrospectively, if they impaircontracts. 3 Story Con., \u00a7 1379.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-11\">3. The interest is an entirety. Anomaly to calculate under both statutes. I cite\u20142 U. S. Digest, 616, \u00a7 16; Smedes\u2019 Dig., 201, \u00a7 3; Lee vs. Davis, 1 A. K. Marsh., 397.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-12\">SEMMES, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">The only question presented by the record in this case is, the rate of interest which sliould bo allowed on the note ;.yed on.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The note of the Appellant is elated the 14th of March, 1844, and payable one day after date. At the date of the note, our statute provided that where no rate of interest was expressed in the contract, no higher rate than eight per cent, should be charged. Duval, 78, \u00a7 1. On the day after the execution of the note, this statute was altered, reducing the rate of interest to six per cent.' per annum. Thomp. Dig., 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">It is contended, that inasmuch as the law was amended before the maturity of the note, and, of course, before interest had commenced running, the judgment of the Court below, allowing eight per cent, interest, was erroneous. We do not think so. Upon both principle and authority, the respondent was entitled, as of right, to recover eight per cent, interest. All contracts for the payment of money bear interest after maturity, though silent on the subject, unless there is an express stipulation to the contrary. When the contract is silent as to the interest, as in this case, the law will imply an understanding, on the part of the debtor, to pay the legal rate, and this implied understanding is not only supported by mercantile usage in all commercial instruments of a negotiable nature, but because interest is considered as a legal incident to every debt, certain in amount, and payable at a certain time. The rate of interest is to he determined by the law of the place where the contract is to bo executed, and when, as in the contract before us, no place is indicated, it is to be presumed where it is made. 1 Am. Lead. Cases, 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The interest, though an incident to the debt, is impliedly a part of the contract, and the contracting parties are to be presumed to have had reference to the law as it existed at the time the contract was made, and, as a consequence, \u00fcio statute altering the rate of interest can be made to af <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>feet contracts entered into before its passage, otherwise the obligation of the contract would bo impaired, for the Constitution, in tliis respect, recognizes no distinction between express and implied contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">No analogy, in our opinion, exists, and therefore no argument can bo drawn, from the right of the Legislature to alter the rate of interest in reference to judgments, after a contract is made. A judgment is a part of the remedy, and carries such rate of interest as is legal at its dato, whatever rate was recoverable on the contract. The contract is merged in the judgment rendered, and the judgment is controlled by the statute, and not by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It has been expressly determined in the case of Lee vs. Davis, 1 A. K. Marsh., 397, that the rate of intoi\u2019cst -on a note is to be regulated by the law as it exists at the time \u25a0the contract was made. We see no reason to depart from the principle decided in that case. See also Bryan vs. Moore, Miner 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Let the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
