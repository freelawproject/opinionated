We hold that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17 requires the police to inform the suspect that a retained attorney is immediately available to consult with him, and failure to so inform him before he confesses per se precludes a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights to remain silent and to counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">During the early morning hours of August 2, 1991, bicycles were taken from two separate residences, and a sink was removed from a house that was under construction. Bloomfield Township Police Officer Steven Currie arrived at one of the locations at 3:33 A.M. A canine unit arrived, and at approximately 4:00 A.M. defendant Jamieson Bender was arrested by a canine handler. He was placed in a holding cell at approximately 4:30 A.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Officer Currie and Sergeant DeWolfe went to defendant Scott Zeigler\u2019s house between 7:00 and 8:00 A.M. Zeigler let the officers into the house and told them that he had loaned his car to Bender, that he knew where his car was located, that he and Bender had taken a couple of bicycles, and that they had taken a sink from a house that was under construction. Zeigler was arrested and then showed Officer Currie where the stolen property was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Officer Currie testified that he arrested Zeigler about 8:00 or 8:30 A.M. However, Zeigler\u2019s mother, Ruth, who was at the house at the time that Zeigler was arrested, stated that she had called attorney Allan Goldfine at 6:45 A.M. Mr. Goldfine agreed to represent Zeigler and told her to go to the police station and tell Zeigler not to talk to anyone until Zeigler first talked to him. Thus, she went to the police station at 7:15 A.M., talked to Officer Currie, and asked to see her son.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When he refused, she told Officer Currie that she had a message for her son from his attorney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Officer Currie, however, told Ruth that she could not see her son, that she could not get a message to him, and that she could not stay and talk to the detective. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>A police officer called Bender\u2019s mother, Kathleen, about 5:30 A.M. to inform her of her son\u2019s arrest. She then contacted Bender\u2019s father, Phillip, who was residing out of state. Phillip called the police station at 7:00 A.M. and asked to speak with his son. When the officer refused, Phillip told him that he was going to get counsel for his son immediately. He then called attorney Elizabeth Pezzetti who agreed to represent Bender.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Ms. Pezzetti called the police station at approximately 9:00 A.M. and asked to speak with Bender and the detective in charge as soon as possible. The officer who answered the telephone told Ms. Pezzetti that Bender was being held, but that his paperwork had not been completed and that she would tell the detective that Ms. Pezzetti wished to speak with him and Bender. The detective did not return her call, so Ms. Pezzetti called the station again at 10:00 A.M., and was also unsuccessful. Detective Genereaux finally returned Ms. Pezzetti\u2019s call between 11:00 and 11:30 A.M. He stated that he had talked to both defendants, that they had been cooperative, and that they would be released without bond to their parents. Ms. Pez-zetti stated that had she been given the opportunity to speak with Bender, she would have told him not to talk to anyone and that she would be at the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Without informing either defendant of his attorney\u2019s attempted contacts, Detective Genereaux interrogated both defendants. Zeigler was interrogated first. He read aloud and signed a Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>-warnings form at 9:08 A.M., and gave his statement during the subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>quent thirty- to forty-minute interview. Next, Bender was interviewed and also read aloud and signed a Miranda-warnings form at 9:50 A.M. His interview also lasted between thirty and forty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Each defendant testified regarding his statement. Zeigler was twenty years old, had no prior contacts with the police, and was a college student. On the night in question, he had been drinking beer, although Detective Genereaux stated that he saw no signs of intoxication. Zeigler stated that he was not given the opportunity to make a telephone call. He was not offered food or water, and he had not slept for about twenty-six hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Bender was also twenty years old, had no prior contacts with the police, and was attending college. He had also been drinking that night. He was not given food or water and had not slept for about twenty-five hours. When he was being fingerprinted, he asked to make a telephone call, but he was told that he could make a telephone call later. He was never given that opportunity. Bender testified that he thought he would have to remain in a holding cell if he requested an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">It is undisputed that Bender was never informed by the police that Ms. Pezzetti had attempted to call him and had been retained for him. It is also undisputed that Zeigler\u2019s mother was not permitted to see her son and that no message was given to Zeigler that she had retained an attorney for him. Both defendants stated that they understood the <em>Miranda-wanmxgs </em>form, and neither requested counsel before or during the interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">On the basis of the evidence given at the <em>Walker </em>hearing, the trial court ruled that the conduct of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>police had not been reprehensible and that each defendant had made a voluntary statement with full knowledge of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. However, the trial court ruled that the postarrest statements had to be suppressed because the defendants were not informed that counsel had been retained for them before the statements were given and that the statements were, therefore, made without a knowing waiver of the right to counsel. The trial court made this ruling on the basis of <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. 208 Mich App 221, 232; 527 NW2d 66 (1994). The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">[W]e extend the rights afforded under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17 to include information of retained counsel's efforts to contact a suspect. We believe that such a protection is necessary to allow suspects in custody to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of their right to counsel and right to remain silent Therefore, the trial court did not err in suppressing defendants\u2019 postarrest statements where the police failed to inform them that counsel had been retained and of counsel\u2019s attempts to contact them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">We agree with the analysis of the Court of Appeals and, therefore, affirm its holding that the suppression of both defendants\u2019 statements was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">n. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution protect a defendant\u2019s federal rights to remain silent and to counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>ally, the Michigan Constitution protects a defendant\u2019s corresponding state rights. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In <em>Miranda v </em>Arizona, 384 US 436, 444; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u2019\u2019 While the Court in <em>Miranda </em>required procedural safeguards, it also recognized that the defendant may waive his rights to remain silent and to counsel. Thus, it also required that the waiver be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478, 490, n 14; 84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977 (1964), and <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461; 146 ALR 357 (1938). See also <em>People v Paintman, </em>412 Mich 518; 315 NW2d 418 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Whether the waiver is valid involves a two-part inquiry. First, the waiver must be a \u201cproduct of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.\u201d <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 421; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986). Second, \u201cthe waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>Id</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In the instant cases, neither defendant claims that procedural safeguards were not heeded. In fact, both defendants signed a <em>Miranda </em>waiver form.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because there was no evidence of police coercion, we agree with the trial court that neither defendant\u2019s statement was involuntary, and thus need not be suppressed for that reason. <em>People v Reed, </em>393 Mich 342; 224 NW2d 867 (1975).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, the defendants contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>their statements must be suppressed because the police failed to inform them of their attorneys\u2019 attempts to contact them, which deprived them of the information necessary to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of their rights to remain silent and to counsel under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">m. RELEVANT CASE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"AO_\">A. FEDERAL</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Although today we base our decision solely on independent state grounds, we recognize that the United States Supreme Court decided a similar issue in <em>Moran, </em>wherein defendant asserted a violation of his federal rights. In <em>Moran, </em>the defendant was arrested by police for his alleged participation in a local burglary. Shortly before his arrest, a confidential informant gave the local police information that led them to believe that the defendant had committed a murder in another city several months earlier. The local police attempted to persuade the defendant to execute a written waiver form, but he refused. The officers then questioned the codefendants about the burglary, and they further implicated the defendant in the murder. The local police then contacted the police from the jurisdiction where the murder occurred, and within an hour officers arrived to question him regarding the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>When the defendant\u2019s sister learned that her brother had been arrested on suspicion of burglary, she contacted the public defender\u2019s office and requested representation for her brother. An attorney assigned to represent the defendant immediately contacted the local police and requested to speak to her client before he was questioned or placed in a lineup. The officer who answered her call assured her that they were through with the defendant for the evening. The defendant\u2019s attorney was not informed that the defendant was also under suspicion for murder and that another jurisdiction\u2019s police officers were at the local station to question him regarding that matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In fact, later that evening the police questioned the defendant regarding the murder. He signed written waiver forms and fully confessed to the murder in three separate statements. The defendant was not informed, before he confessed, that his sister had secured counsel for him or that his attorney had contacted the local police department seeking to speak with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In a six to three decision, the Court held that the federal constitution did not require the exclusion of the three inculpatory statements. <em>Id. </em>at 434. The Court reasoned that \u201c[e] vents occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422. The Court further reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">Once it is determined that a suspect\u2019s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\u2019s intention to use his statements to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law. <em>[Id. </em>at 422-423.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Court concluded that because the defendant voluntarily confessed with full awareness and comprehension of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the waivers were valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">While the Court based its holding on its interpretation of the federal constitution, it explicitly recognized that \u201c[n]othing we say today disables the States from adopting different requirements for the conduct of its employees and officials as a matter of state law.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">B. OTHER STATES</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">In fact, many states that have considered this issue have held that, as a matter of state law, the police must inform the suspect that his attorney is immediately available to consult with him. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And, although the states have provided different rationales for imposition of this duty, \u201cthey agree on one supervening principle: the atmosphere of custodial interrogation is inherently coercive and protecting the right against self-incrimination entails counteracting that coercion.\u201d <em>State v Reed, </em>133 NJ 237, 255; 627 A2d 630 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">For example, in <em>State v Stoddard, </em>206 Conn 157; 537 A2d 446 (1988), the Supreme Court of Connecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>cut determined, on facts similar to the instant case, that the defendant\u2019s statement must be suppressed. In <em>Stoddard, </em>the defendant was arrested on suspicion of murder. Immediately following the defendant\u2019s arrest, his girlfriend contacted an attorney who agreed to represent the defendant. On the day of the arrest, the attorney contacted the police department three times, requesting to speak with the defendant, but was incorrectly told each time that the defendant was not there. Early the next morning, the attorney called the station for a fourth time and was again told that the defendant was not there. Later that morning, the defendant confessed to the murder, still unaware that his attorney had repeatedly attempted to contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The court, adopting a totality-of-the-circumstances test, held that \u201cthe state has not met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the efforts of counsel, if properly communicated, would not have altered the defendant\u2019s appraisal and understanding of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176-177. Thus, the trial court had erred in failing to suppress the confession. The court reasoned that the duty to inform only requires the police to act as a neutral conduit for the pertinent and timely requests by the attorney to speak with a custodial suspect. In addition, the court found that the attorney\u2019s attempts to communicate with the suspect were constitutionally significant with regard to whether the suspect\u2019s waiver was knowingly and intelligently made.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In another case with similar facts, the Supreme Court of New Jersey determined that the trial court had erroneously admitted the defendant\u2019s confession. In <em>Reed, </em>the defendant confessed to murder and criminal sexual contact, which became evidence crucial in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>the case against him. However, the police had refused before and during the defendant\u2019s interrogation to inform him that his friend had hired an attorney to represent him, and that the attorney had been present at police headquarters and had attempted to speak with the defendant before he confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The court held that, under New Jersey law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">when, to the knowledge of law-enforcement officers, an attorney has been retained on behalf of a person in custody on suspicion of crime and is present or readily available to assist that person, <em>the communication of that information to the suspect is essential to making a knowing waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination, </em>and withholding that information renders invalid the suspect\u2019s waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>[Id. </em>at 269 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The court reasoned that its holding was essential to effectuate the defendant\u2019s right to counsel, which in turn effectuates the right to remain silent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While acknowledging that its decision placed a further burden on police when dealing with criminal suspects, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>the court reasoned that the duty to inform is narrow and specific. It only arises when the attorney who has been retained to represent the suspect in custody communicates his presence or immediate availability and desire to speak with the suspect to an agent of the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Similarly, in <em>People v </em>McCauley, 163 Ill 2d 414; 645 NE2d 923 (1994), the Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the defendant\u2019s statement and the lineup identification on the basis of state law. In <em>McCauley, </em>the defendant was questioned regarding his possible involvement in a homicide. He denied involvement and provided an alibi. After police officers left the station to investigate his alibi, the defendant\u2019s family hired an attorney to represent him. The attorney proceeded to the station where the defendant was being held, but the officer told the attorney that he could not speak with the defendant, and that the officer would not tell the defendant that his lawyer was present in the station. Later, the defendant was identified in a lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The court held that the trial court properly suppressed the defendant\u2019s statement and lineup identification because it resulted from a violation of state constitutional protections, where the police denied the attorney access to the defendant and failed to inform him that the attorney was present, available, and seeking to consult with him. The court reasoned that \u201c [i]f a defendant is entitled to the benefit of an attorney\u2019s assistance and presence during custodial interrogation and this right is guarded, certainly fundamental fairness requires that immediately available assistance and presence not be denied by police authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444. The court also concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>that, on the basis of state law the police conduct violated the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">IV. THE MICHIGAN RULE</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In <em>Wright, </em>this Court held that the Michigan Constitution imposes a stricter requirement for a valid waiver of the rights to remain silent and to counsel than imposed by the federal constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Wright </em>at 147 (Mallett, J.), <em>id. </em>at 155 (Cavanagh, C.J., concurring),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 170 (Brickley, J., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>concurring).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under federal law, a waiver is knowingly and intentionally made where no police coercion was involved and where the defendant understands that he has the right to remain silent and that the state intends to use what he says to secure a conviction. <em>Moran </em>at 422-423. We agree that those circumstances are a minimal prerequisite to a valid waiver; however, in Michigan, more is required before the trial court may find a knowing and intelligent waiver.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We believe that in order for a defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>fully comprehend the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of his decision to abandon it, he must first be informed that counsel, who could explain the consequences of a waiver decision, has been retained to represent him.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>In the instant case, the police failed to inform both defendants that counsel had been retained for them and that their respective attorneys attempted to contact them before making a statement. Thus, we hold that, on the basis of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, neither defendant Bender nor defendant Zeigler made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights to remain silent and to counsel, because the police failed to so inform them before they confessed. In so holding, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>reiterate that our state constitution affords defendants a greater degree of protection in this regard than does the federal constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">If we were to hold otherwise, we would encourage the police to do everything possible, short of a due process violation, to prevent an attorney from contacting his client before or during interrogation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Once the suspect signed the waiver form, police could interrogate the suspect in isolation, without the assistance of his own lawyer, even if that lawyer is making an actual effort to consult with the suspect.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>To encourage this type of police behavior would undermine the safeguards we have established to protect the rights to remain silent and to counsel.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> If these rights are to mean anything, surely we must be adamant in our protection of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Additionally, we decline to adopt a totality-of-the-circumstances test in this situation, but instead adopt a per se rule. As the Supreme Court of Delaware stated in <em>Bryan v State, </em>571 A2d 170, 176 (Del, 1990),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">In evaluating the totality of the circumstances, a court makes a two-part inquiry. First, the waiver must have been voluntary \u2014 it must have been \u201cthe product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception.\u201d Second, the waiver must have been made upon \u201ca full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>However, a purported waiver can never satisfy a totality of the circumstances analysis when police do not even inform a suspect that his attorney seeks to render legal advice. </em>[Citations omitted; emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\u201cTo hold otherwise would be to condone \u2018affirmative police interference in a communication between an attorney and suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Moran </em>at 456, n 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>(Stevens, J., dissenting). \u201cWhen the opportunity to consult counsel is in fact frustrated, there is no room for speculation what defendant might or might not have chosen to do after he had that opportunity.\u201d <em>State v Haynes, </em>288 Or 59, 75; 602 P2d 272 (1979). The right to counsel becomes meaningless if a suspect cannot communicate with his attorney or can only speak with him after the suspect has given a statement.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, the inherently coercive nature of incommunicado interrogation requires a per se rule that can be implemented with ease and practicality to protect a suspect\u2019s rights to remain silent and to counsel.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Further, we do not limit this rule by requiring the attorney\u2019s physical presence at the police station.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>agree that \u201c[a] suspect has a right to know that his attorney wishes to see him whether that request comes over the police station counter, over the telephone, or via messenger.\u201d <em>People v Houston, </em>42 Cal 3d 595, 615; 230 Cal Rptr 141; 724 P2d 1166 (1986) (Bird, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Further, we agree that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">an attorney\u2019s diligence can manifest itself in ways other than showing up at the police station. In many situations, a phone call or messenger may well be the most efficient, effective \u2014 and most diligent \u2014 means of transmitting a message to a client. This is true, for example, when an attorney is (1) engaged in trial, (2) handling an urgent matter for another client, (3) located far from where the suspect is being detained, or (4) delayed by traffic or weather conditions. It is unreasonable to suggest that failing to appear in person indicates a lack of diligence on the attorney\u2019s part. <em>[Id. </em>at 616.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">We recognize that the rule we announce today may decrease the likelihood that interrogating officers will secure a confession.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> However, this duty to inform is as necessary as other safeguards we have developed to protect a suspect\u2019s rights to remain silent and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>counsel.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Escobedo:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">No system worth preserving should have to fear that if an accused is permitted to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware of, and exercise, these rights.

CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">On the basis of the foregoing principles, we find that both defendants\u2019 statements were taken in violation of their Michigan constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel. The police failed in their duty to inform them that their attorneys attempted to contact them before they made their statements, information crucial to their making a knowing and intelligent waiver. When the police fail in their duty to inform a suspect of his counsel\u2019s attempts to consult with him before he makes a statement, this Court will not speculate what the defendant might or might not have chosen to do after he had the opportunity to consult with his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s suppression of both defendants\u2019 statements taken after the police failed to inform them that counsel had been retained for them and of counsels\u2019 attempts to contact them. Both types of attempted contact, through telephone calls or through a messenger, satisfy the rule that we adopt today. We remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-6\">Levin and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\"> Contrary to the demagogic opinion of the dissent, our goal is not to eliminate \u201cconfessions from the arsenal of society\u2019s weapons against crime.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 624. Nor will our rule necessarily result in the reversal of convictions as the dissent alleges. Rather, we believe that confessions are not only a valid, but also an essential part of law enforcement. However, we would go one step beyond the dissent and also concern ourselves with how law enforcement obtained the confession. More importantly, if law enforcement officers adhere to the rule we announce today, there will be no reversal of convictions on the basis of failure by officers to inform the suspect that his counsel wished to speak with him before he made a confession. Thus, if law enforcement does not follow this rule, it will be a government agent, and not this Court, that is responsible for thwarting and hampering cases of urgent social concern as referenced in the dissent\u2019s n 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Additionally, the dissent\u2019s argument that our rule will thwart or substantially hamper prosecution in certain cases has no merit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\"This argument is not supported by any reference to the experience in the states that have adopted this rule.\u201d <em>[Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 460; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).] Prior to <em>Moran, </em>a majority of states followed a rule similar to the one we enunciate today, without any apparent dimin-ishment in the effectiveness of their law-enforcement agencies.

In that circumstance, the choice belongs to and is made by the accused and not the police. Thus, the careful balance of the interests of legitimate law enforcement and the interest of individuals embodied in the Michigan Constitution remains intact. <em>[Id. </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b702-9\"> As support for this conclusion, we adopt the reasoning of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>Reed.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">[I]nforming a suspect of the right to the presence of an attorney is qualitatively different from informing a suspect of both the right to the presence of an attorney and that the attorney is already in the stationhouse. In the first instance, the suspect may reject the offer out of fear that the police will interpret the request for an attorney as an acknowledgment of guilt, or the suspect may view with skepticism the offer by police to provide an unknown attorney. But if the attorney is already present, the same suspect may conclude that consultation with the attorney outweighs any risk of antagonizing the police, particularly if the suspect has had a prior relationship with the attorney or if friends or family have retained the attorney. Thus, the presence and availability of a retained attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>ney is critical information that qualitatively affects the exercise by a suspect of the right to consult with counsel. When that information is withheld, the suspect\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel and to remain silent is more abstract than real, becoming, in effect, a waiver of a theoretical right that is uninformed by the material knowledge that retained counsel, present and available to assist the suspect in the full exercise of his or her rights, is just outside the door. That the suspect may ultimately reject the offer and waive his or her right is irrelevant to whether the uninformed waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>[Reed </em>at 274 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In addition, we also adopt the reasoning of the Connecticut Supreme Court in <em>Stoddard.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">We are unwilling ... to dismiss counsel\u2019s effort to communicate as constitutionally insignificant to the capacity of the suspect to make a knowing and intelligent choice whether he or she will invoke the right to counsel. <em>Miranda </em>warnings refer only to an abstract right to counsel. That a suspect validly waives the presence of counsel \u201conly means that for the moment the suspect is foregoing the exercise of that conceptual privilege.\u201d Faced with a concrete offer of assistance, however, a suspect may well decide to reclaim his or her continuing right to legal assistance. \u201cTo pass up an abstract offer to call some unknown lawyer is very different from refusing to talk with an identified attorney actually available to provide at least initial assistance and advice, whatever might be arranged in the long run. A suspect indifferent to the first offer may well react quite differently to the second.\u201d We cannot therefore conclude that a decision to forego the abstract offer contained in <em>Miranda </em>embodies an implied rejection of a specific opportunity to confer with a known lawyer. Accordingly, the lack of authority of counsel to invoke the personal right of the suspect is no bar to the imposition of a duty to inform a suspect of counsel\u2019s efforts. <em>[Stod-dard </em>at 168 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b703-9\"> The dissent asserts that Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17 provides no greater protection than the Fifth Amendment.

In doing so an attorney is merely exercising the good professional judgment he has been taught. This is not cause for considering the attorney a menace to law enforcement.

I conclude that rather than interpreting these provisions, it would be more appropriate to approach the law enforcement practices that are at the core of this case in the same manner as the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Court approached the constitutional interpretation task in <em>Miranda </em>v <em>Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966); namely, by announcing a prophylactic rule. See <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The right to counsel and the right to be free of compulsory self-incrimination are part of the bedrock of constitutional civil liberties that have been zealously protected and in some cases expanded over the years. Given the focus and protection that these particular constitutional provisions have received, it is difficult to accept and constitutionally justify a rale of law that accepts that law enforcement investigators, as part of a custodial interrogation, can conceal from suspects that counsel has been made available to them and is at their disposal. If it is deemed to be important that the accused be informed that he is entitled to counsel, it is certainly important that he be informed that he has counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">As Justice Souter explained in <em>Withrow </em>v <em>Williams, </em>507 US 680, 691; 113 S Ct 1745; 123 L Ed 2d 407 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cProphylactic\u201d though it may be, in protecting a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination <em>Miranda </em>safeguards \u201ca fundamental trial right.\u201d The privilege embodies \u201cprinciples of humanity and civil liberty, which had been secured in the mother country only after years of struggle\u201d and reflects</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-8\">\u201cmany of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations: . . . our preference for an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal justice; our fear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses; our sense of fair play which dictates \u2018a fair state-individual balance by requiring the government to leave the individual alone until good cause is shown for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>turbing him and by requiring the government in its contest with the individual to shoulder the entire load\u2019; our respect for the inviolability of the human personality and of the right of each individual \u2018to a private enclave where he may lead a private life\u2019; our distrust of self-deprecatory statements; and our realization that the privilege, while sometimes \u2018a shelter to the guilty,\u2019 is often \u2018a protection to the innocent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murphy </em>v <em>Waterfront Comm of New York Harbor, </em>378 US 52, 55 [84 S Ct 1594; 12 L Ed 2d 678] (1964) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">Nor does the Fifth Amendment \u201ctrial right\u201d protected by <em>Miranda </em>serve some value necessarily divorced from the correct ascertainment of guilt. \u201c \u2018[A] system of criminal law enforcement which comes to depend on the \u201cconfession\u201d will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses\u2019 than a system relying on independent investigation.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v <em>Tucker, supra </em>[417 US] 448, n 23 (quoting <em>Esco-bedo </em>v <em>Illinois, </em>378 US 478, 488-489 [84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977] [1964]).

It would have been simple in this case for the police to have complied with the rule we presently announce. To the extent that the burdens may be increased in future cases, I take comfort in the knowledge that, before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Moran </em>v <em>Burbine, </em>475 US 412; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), many states adhered to the rule we adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>today and others continue to follow it. Yet, as the majority points out, there is no suggestion that those jurisdictions have been any less successful obtaining confessions than those following the <em>Moran </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">However, even if contrary evidence existed, I am convinced that our decision more fully comports with our most closely guarded legal traditions. Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Jackson discussed the problem we presently face and concluded that our system of criminal justice requires us to err on the side of protecting the constitutional rights of the accused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">I suppose the view one takes will turn on what one thinks should be the right of an accused person against the State. Is it his right to have the judgment on the facts? Or is it his right to have a judgment based on only such evidence as he cannot conceal from the authorities, who cannot compel him to testily in court and also cannot question him before? Our system comes close to the latter by any interpretation, for the defendant is shielded by such safeguards as no system to law except the Anglo-American concedes to him. <em>[Watts </em>v <em>Indiana, </em>338 US 49, 59; 69 S Ct 1357; 93 L Ed 1801 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">In my view, the rule we adopt today requiring police to inform suspects that counsel has been retained for them insures that our system of criminal justice remains accusatorial and not inquisitorial in nature. Perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that experience has taught us that the good will of state agents is often insufficient to guarantee a suspect\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-8\">Levin, Cavanagh, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Brickley, C.J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"pA4J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"aog-dedup-0\">(dissenting). Today, without a single foundation in the language, historical context, or the jurisprudence of this Court, a majority of the Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> engrafts its own \u201cenlightened\u201d view of the Constitution of 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17, on the citizens of the State of Michigan. With nothing more substantial than a disagreement with the United States Supreme Court as the basis for its conclusion, a majority of the Court ignores our obligation to find a principled basis for the creation of new rights and imposes a benefit on suspects that will eliminate voluntary and knowledgeable confessions from the arsenal of society\u2019s weapons against crime. The obvious and immediate cost of today\u2019s result will be the reversal of convictions. The hidden consequences \u2014 the cases that will not be brought because confessions that are wholly voluntary and made with full knowledge of <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cannot be admitted, and the cases brought and lost because the jury never hears the uncoerced words of the defendant on trial \u2014 are, if anything, more onerous.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>The lead opinion\u2019s characterization of the \u201cnarrow and specific\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> duty to inform frustrates the constitutionally legitimate and societally beneficial purposes of custodial interrogation. It raises the specter of \u201cvirtual\u201d lawyers, who call, FAX, or E-mail police stations with their desire to contact incarcerated suspects; of clerks, whose job it is to log the moment the communication was received and transmit it promptly; and of judicial hearings to determine whether a given statement was obtained before or after communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">By cloaking its assumption that the criminal justice system exists for lawyers and their clients in constitutional garb, a majority of the Court has placed it beyond correction by the Legislature. The fact that this Court has no authority to make policy for the citizens of Michigan does not deter the conclusion. There is no principled basis for today\u2019s decision, but there is a point: to make it more difficult to convict those who acknowledge their guilt with full knowledge of their rights. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Contrary to the lead opinion\u2019s conclusory assertion that \u201c[t]he Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution protect a defendant\u2019s federal rights to remain silent and to counsel,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 602, these rights cannot be found in the actual text of either amendment. The Fifth Amendment in its entirety states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any Criminal Case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">This amendment affords many rights, but not a right to counsel or a right to remain silent. The Fourteenth Amendment is equally barren soil in which to ground such rights, and its only purported function in this case is to serve as a conduit for applying the Fifth Amendment to the states. See <em>Malloy v </em>Hogan, 378 US 1; 84 S Ct 1489; 12 L Ed 2d 653 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The genesis of the \u201cright to remain silent\u201d is found in <em>Miranda v </em>Arizona, 384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), not the Fifth Amendment. In 1966, three years after the current Michigan Constitution was ratified, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>created a prophylactic set of warnings to ensure protection of Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Michigan v Tucker, </em>417 US 433, 444; 94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974). If properly administered and validly waived, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings ensure protection of a defendant\u2019s right against compulsory self-incrimination, while at the same time allowing the police to fulfill their duty in a constitutionally permissible manner. The warnings and rights delineated in <em>Miranda, </em>however, are not constitutionally required, and the rights to counsel and silence are only suggested as one possible formula for dispelling the coercive atmosphere the Court found present in custodial interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The <em>Miranda </em>Court developed its formulation as one possible method of informing a defendant that the state could not force him to incriminate himself.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">The Fifth Amendment confers a right not to be compelled to answer questions; it does not confer a substantive or formal right of silence. Concededly, the former right does give rise to a right of silence in \u201cthe very weak sense\u201d that a person has \u201ca right to silence on every subject\u201d: a person who cannot lawfully be coerced into speaking can, of course, remain silent. [Grano, Confessions, Truth, and the Law (Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1993), pp 141-142.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">A right to remain silent is not the same as the right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. That difference goes beyond mere semantics. If there were a constitutional \u201cright to remain silent,\u201d a statement that was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda, </em>or before notice of such rights could be given, would be inadmissible not only in the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, but in all phases of the trial. The United States Supreme Court has explicitly rejected this blanket limitation, however, and endorsed the use of both prearrest silence and statements taken in violation of <em>Miranda </em>for purposes of impeachment. <em>Harris v New York, </em>401 US 222; 91 S Ct 643; 28 L Ed 2d 1 (1971); <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231; 100 S Ct 2124; 65 L Ed 2d 86 (1980). See also <em>People v Cetlinski, </em>435 Mich 742; 460 NW2d 534 (1990). If there were a constitutional \u201cright to silence,\u201d these statements could not be used to impeach in the case in chief. As Professor Grano notes, the Fifth Amendment precludes only compelled self-incrimination and does not guarantee a right to silence, and he comes to the fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>\u201cunremarkable conclusion that the Fifth Amendment actually means what it says.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The corresponding guarantee against compelled self-incrimination found in art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution provides no greater protection than the Fifth Amendment. In <em>Sitz v Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>443 Mich 744; 506 NW2d 209 (1993), this Court reaffirmed that it is this Court\u2019s duty to interpret the Michigan Constitution. Our review may lead us to conclude that our constitution provides greater, equal, or lesser protection than its federal counterpart. \u201c[W]e may not disregard the guarantees that our constitution confers on Michigan citizens merely because the United States Supreme Court has withdrawn or not extended such protection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">That duty does not authorize the \u201cunprincipled creation of state constitutional rights that exceed their federal counteiparts,\u201d <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 763, nor does it mandate that we ignore the rich body of federal law the United States Supreme Court has created through analysis of corresponding provisions in the federal constitution. Although we have repeatedly concluded that our constitution should be interpreted differently only if there is a compelling reason for doing so, <em>id. </em>at 763; <em>People v Nash, </em>418 Mich 196; 341 NW2d 439 (1983), the lead opinion is not hindered by traditional principles of constitutional interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The following factors are relevant in determining whether there is a compelling reason to interpret that our constitution affords protection different from the federal constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">1) the textual language of the state constitution, 2) significant textual differences between parallel provisions of the two constitutions, 3) state constitutional and common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>history, 4) state law preexisting adoption of the relevant constitutional provision, 5) structural differences between the state and federal constitutions, and 6) matters of peculiar state or local interest. <em>[People v Collins, </em>438 Mich 8, 31, n 39; 475 NW2d 684 (1991), citing <em>People v Catania, </em>427 Mich 447, 466, n 12; 398 NW2d 343 (1986); <em>Sitz, supra </em>at 763, n 14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Employing this methodology, analysis of the Fifth Amendment and art 1, \u00a7 17 of the Michigan Constitution indicates that there is no justification, compelling or otherwise, for construing these provisions differently. First, the relevant language in each provision is identical,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and has been identical since the incorporation of a provision against compulsory self-incrimination in the Michigan Constitution in 1850. Const 1850, art 6, \u00a7 26. Moreover, there is nothing in the record of the 1961 Constitutional Convention that would indicate any intent to engraft a different interpretation than that embodied in the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Second, opinions of this Court have repeatedly indicated that the protection against compulsory self-incrimination found in our constitution is identical to its federal counteipart. Over ninety years ago, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Court first examined the federal and state provisions against compelled self-incrimination. In <em>In re Moser, </em>138 Mich 302; 101 NW 588 (1904), a witness who was called before a grand jury was held in contempt for failing to turn over certain corporate records. The witness claimed that the protection against self-incrimination found in both the Fifth Amendment and the corresponding Michigan provision \u2014 at that time art 6, \u00a7 26 \u2014 guaranteed him the right to withhold the records. In concluding that the witness had no such right, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\">Under the Constitutions of Michigan and the United States, no witness can be compelled to give testimony ' which might tend to criminate himself or expose him to a criminal prosecution. <em>The provision in each Constitution is the same. [Id. </em>at 305 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">More recently, in a case that is factually similar to <em>Moser, </em>this Court again squarely addressed the claim that the Michigan Constitution provides greater protection than the federal constitution. In <em>Paramount Pictures Corp v Miskinis, </em>418 Mich 708; 344 NW2d 788 (1984), the defendants argued that compelled production of business records in a civil suit violated their privilege against self-incrimination because the records could be used against them in a subsequent criminal prosecution. This Court concluded that a corporate custodian of documents cannot assert a privilege against self-incrimination for documents that relate to the corporation. The privilege is personal, only applies to natural persons, and cannot be asserted on behalf of another. The defendants argued that, although production of the documents might not be \u201cprotected under the federal constitution, it is pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>tected under the Michigan Constitution, Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17 <em>Id. </em>at 725. In rejecting that argument, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">Having examined prior decisions of this Court, we find nothing which requires an interpretation of our constitutional privilege against self-incrimination different from that of the United States Constitution. <em>[Id. </em>at 726.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Thus, previous decisions of this Court illustrate a solid and unwavering line of authority for inteipreting our protection against self-incrimination identically with the federal guarantee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">We examined the relationship between the Michigan and federal provisions most recently in <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992). The facts in that case presented the exact issue that we address in this case. In <em>Wright, </em>the defendant was taken into custody, and the police properly informed him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He agreed to waive these rights and make a statement. The police, however, did not immediately take his statement, but continued to investigate the case for approximately another four hours. During this four-hour period, the defendant was confined without food or water in a fairly small room. Eventually, the police took the defendant\u2019s statement after he had been in custody for approximately nine hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">When the defendant was apprised of his rights, he agreed that he understood them and told the officers that he did not have an attorney. Although the officers informed the defendant that an attorney would be appointed for him if he so desired, they did not tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>him that his family had hired an attorney and that the attorney had been attempting to contact him.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress his statement. At the suppression hearing, the trial judge found that the \u201cdefendant wanted to make a statement and never explicitly asked for a lawyer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145. Moreover, the trial judge concluded that the United States Supreme Court opinion in <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412, 430; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), was directly on point and that, although the police behavior may have been \u201creprehensible,\u201d the law did not require suppression of the defendant\u2019s statement. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and this Court granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The case resulted in a fragmented decision with four separate opinions. Justices Levin and Mallett would have found that the Michigan Constitution provided greater protection than that provided by the Fifth Amendment. <em>Wright, supra </em>at 154-155. Chief Justice Cavanagh agreed with Justices Levin and Mallett but went on to state that the police conduct violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20. Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion focused on the defendant\u2019s due process claim and found that the defendant\u2019s confession was involuntary because of the coercive nature of his interrogation. Finally, Justices Riley, Griffin, and Boyle would have construed the scope of the protection afforded by the Michigan Constitution identically with that of the Fifth Amendment guarantee.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The lead opinion mischaracterizes what this Court \u201cheld\u201d in <em>Wright. </em>Although the opinions of Justice Mallett and Justice Brickley can be manipulated to state \u201cthat the Michigan Constitution imposes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>stricter requirement for a valid waiver of the rights to remain silent and to counsel than imposed by the federal constitution,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 611, four justices could not agree on why the Michigan Constitution imposes a more stringent standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">As the lead opinion acknowledges, determining whether a defendant properly waived the rights conveyed in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings involves a bifurcated inquiry: 1) was the waiver voluntary, and 2) was the waiver knowing and intelligent? <em>Ante </em>at 603. The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Moran v Burbine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception. Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived. <em>[Id. </em>at 421, quoting <em>Fare v Michael C, </em>442 US 707, 725; 99 S Ct 2560; 61 L Ed 2d 197 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The voluntary and knowing and intelligent prongs involve significantly different inquiries. Assuming, arguendo, that the Michigan Constitution provides a more stringent standard than its federal counterpart for determining whether a waiver was voluntary \u2014 a premise with which I wholeheartedly disagree \u2014 there is no justification for the proposition that the knowing and intelligent inquiry is also more exacting.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Close scrutiny of the opinions of Justice Mallett and Justice Brickley in <em>Wright </em>illustrate the fallacy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the lead opinion\u2019s broad assertion regarding waiver in general without regard for the dual prongs of the inquiry. Both Justice Brickley and Justice Mallett concluded that Wright\u2019s confession was improper because it was not <em>voluntary. Wright, supra </em>at 153 (Mallett, J.); <em>id. </em>at 164 (Brickley, J.). Justice Mallett also asserted that Wright\u2019s confession was not \u201cknowing and intelligent,\u201d but he framed the issue: \u201cwhether defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary under the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147. Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion never mentions the terms \u201cknowing and intelligent,\u201d and even goes so far as to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">In sum, voluntariness forms the touchstone of the inquiry concerning the validity of the waivers made while in police custody. <em>[Id. </em>at 168.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Thus, if there is any support for the proposition that the Michigan Constitution requires a more demanding standard, the increased stringency has been engrafted only onto the voluntariness inquiry. This issue was not addressed in <em>Moran, </em>where the Court explicitly stated \u201c[t]he voluntariness of the waiver is not at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421. There is no support for the conclusion that the United States Supreme Court or this Court has adopted a more stringent standard for the \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d prong of the waiver analysis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The lead opinion admits that \u201c[b]ecause there was no evidence of police coercion, we agree with the trial court that neither defendant\u2019s statement was involuntary, and thus need not be suppressed for that reason.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 604. If the statements were not involuntary, and, if, as Justice Brickley concluded, volunta-riness is the \u201ctouchstone\u201d for determining whether a waiver is valid, the confessions in this case are not constitutionally deficient under Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion in <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The opinion on which the lead opinion relies, Justice Mallett\u2019s opinion in <em>Wright, </em>focused on the voluntary prong of the waiver requirement. Although there is language addressing the knowing and intelligent prong of the waiver, this opinion suffers the same infirmities that plague the majority opinion in the present case. The fact that there may be policy reasons to support informing a suspect that counsel would like to speak with him, and that other states may find such a requirement in their constitutions is irrelevant. The self-restraint imposed by limiting recognition of new rights through a principled analysis express this Court\u2019s commitment to the organic instrument of state government. If there is no reasoned basis for concluding that art 1, \u00a7 17 imposes more stringent requirements than the Fifth Amendment, recognition of such a right is simply an unprincipled declaration by this Court of its power in the premises.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The lead opinion, without constitutional analysis or judicial support, declares by judicial fiat that \u201cwe reiterate that our state constitution affords defendants a greater degree of protection in this regard than does the federal constitution.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 614-615. As Justice Cooley in his treatise explained over one hundred years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">A constitution is not to be made to mean one thing at one time, and another at some subsequent time when the circumstances may have so changed as perhaps to make a different rule in the case seem desirable. A principal share of the benefit expected from written constitutions would be lost if the rules they established were so flexible as to bend to circumstances or be modified by public opinion. . . . What a court is to do, therefore, is <em>to declare the law as written, </em>leaving it to the people themselves to make such changes as new circumstances may require. The meaning of the constitution is fixed when it is adopted, and it is not different at any subsequent time when a court has occasion to pass upon it. [Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (6th ed), pp 68-69.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">The restrictions the lead opinion attributes to art 1, \u00a7 17 rest only on its belief that a different interpretation is more \u201cdesirable\u201d than that set forth in the constitution or in our previous decisions. A belief that the law as we would write it is more desirable than the law as written has no place in constitutional interpretation, or in the faithful adherence to our oath of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>The two provisions guarantee the same level of protection because <em>\u201c[t]he provision in each Constitution is the same,\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and there is no \u201ccompelling reason\u201d for interpreting the identical provisions differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Having concluded that the protection against compelled self-incrimination in the Michigan Constitution should be construed the same as its federal counterpart, we now examine whether the Fifth Amendment would invalidate defendants\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>waiver. It does not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">[I]t is . . . axiomatic that the [Fifth] Amendment does not automatically preclude self-incrimination, whether spontaneous or in response to questions put by government officials. \u201cIt does not preclude a witness from testifying voluntarily in matters which may incriminate him,\u201d <em>United States v Monia, </em>317 US 424, 427 [63 S Ct 409; 87 L Ed 376] (1943), for \u201cthose competent and freewilled to do so may give evidence against the whole world, themselves included.\u201d <em>[United States v Washington, </em>431 US 181, 186-187; 97 S Ct 1814; 52 L Ed 2d 238 (1977), quoting <em>United States v Kimball, </em>117 F 156, 163 (CC SD NY, 1902).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that defendants did not make a knowing and intelligent waiver of their <em>Miranda </em>rights because the police failed to inform them that attorneys hired for them by their parents attempted to contact them before making their statements is not required by the federal constitution. <em>Moran v Burbine. </em>In fact, the majority\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>was expressly rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Moran.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Moran, </em>addressed the very issue we are presented with today. The Court concluded that the police violated neither <em>Miranda </em>nor the federal constitution when they obtained a confession from a suspect after securing a valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver, but without informing him that a lawyer retained by his sister had telephoned the police station, offering to represent him if he was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In <em>Moran, </em>the defendant was arrested and properly informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After voluntarily signing three written waivers of these rights and never requesting counsel, the defendant admitted that he had committed a murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Meanwhile, shortly after the defendant was arrested, and before the police began to question him, a public defender, who had been contacted by the defendant\u2019s sister, called the police station and inquired whether the police intended to question the defendant that evening. In response, the police stated that they were not going to question the defendant that night. Throughout the interrogation, the defendant was unaware that his sister had retained an attorney or that the attorney had called.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Before trial, the defendant moved to suppress his confession. The trial court denied the motion and concluded that the waiver was voluntarily and knowingly made. At trial, the defendant was convicted of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, and the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>his habeas corpus petition. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction, and the United States Supreme Court granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">On appeal, the United States Supreme Court reinstated Burbine\u2019s conviction, concluding that failure by the police to inform the defendant that his sister had retained counsel for him did not deprive him of his right to counsel or render his <em>Miranda </em>waiver invalid. The Court emphasized that <em>Miranda </em>imposes on police an obligation to \u201cinform [a suspect] of his rights to remain silent and to \u2018have counsel present ... if [he] so desires.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 468-470. \u201cBeyond this duty to inform, <em>Miranda </em>requires that the police respect the accused\u2019s decision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.\u201d 475 US 420. <em>Moran </em>reaffirmed that a suspect may waive his rights under <em>Miranda, </em>as long as that waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">After noting that the voluntariness of the waiver was not at issue, the Court found that there was no question concerning the defendant\u2019s understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and of the consequences of waiving them. The Court held that the information withheld from the defendant did not affect the knowing and intelligent nature of his waiver. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">Events occurring outside of the presence of the suspect and entirely unknown to him surely can have no bearing on the capacity to comprehend and knowingly relinquish a constitutional right. . . . [W]e have never read the Constitution to require that the police supply a suspect with a flow of information to help him calibrate his self-interest in deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights. Once it is determined that a suspect\u2019s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\u2019s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law. [475 US 422-423 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The <em>Moran </em>majority also emphasized that, if the police inform a suspect of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and ensure that the suspect waives those rights knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, any other police conduct, or misconduct, is then irrelevant. \u201c[S]uch conduct is only relevant to the constitutional validity of a waiver if it deprives a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning f em.\u201d <em>Moran, supra </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The <em>Moran </em>Court declined to extend the prophylactic <em>Miranda </em>warnings to include the duty to inform a suspect that an attorney is attempting to contact him. The Court indicated reluctance to muddy <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>clear waters and indicated concern over shifting <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>delicate balance between the societal value of confessions and the need to protect against the inherently coercive environment of police interrogation. 475 US 425. Although, as pointed out by the majority, <em>Moran </em>acknowledged that states were free to adopt different standards if they so chose, 475 US 428, the United States Supreme Court by definition could only mean that federal law did not preclude the adoption of different rules. The Court could not and did not address the authority of state supreme courts to interpret their own governing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Finally, the Court flatly refused to accept that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is in any way implicated at the custodial interrogation stage of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>ceedings. It reemphasized as well that any constitutional support for <em>Miranda </em>lies solely in the Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Like <em>Miranda, Moran\u2019s </em>rationale and holding reflects the careful balance struck between protection of an incarcerated defendant, and the legitimate law enforcement objectives of society. Professor Yale Kamisar, who has defended <em>Miranda </em>in the face of its critics and criticized the United States Supreme Court for cutting back on that opinion, supports <em>Moran. </em>He states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">It is hard to believe that [the Miranda] Court would consider the now-familiar warnings insufficient when \u2014 even though a suspect has been adequately advised of his rights and has effectively waived them, thus expressing a willingness to talk to the police without a lawyer \u2014 a lawyer whose services the suspect has not sought has, unbeknown to him, entered the picture. [Kamisar, <em>Remembering the \u201cold world\u201d of criminal procedure: A reply to Professor Grano, </em>23 U Mich J L Ref 537, 581 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">The guiding principle of <em>Moran </em>is that outside events have no effect on whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is knowing and intelligent. The United States Supreme Court underscored this point in <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 577; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987), stating, \u201cthe additional information could affect only the wisdom of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver, not its essentially voluntary and knowing nature.\u201d Thus, the Court concluded that the withholding by the police of certain information from the suspect did not affect his waiver decision \u201cin a constitutionally significant manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8y\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">What a majority of the Court is really saying in this case has nothing to do with whether defendants knowingly and intelligently waived their <em>Miranda </em>rights. Having been advised of and having agreed that they understood their rights, defendants, by definition, knew they had a right to have counsel present, in the room, and chose not to exercise that right. Rather, the point of both the lead opinion and Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion is that had defendants known an attorney was \u201cattempting] to contact them,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 614, they probably would have chosen to consult with that attorney, who likely would have advised them not to confess. However, if in fact there is a subjective difference in the suspect\u2019s mind between knowing that he has the right not to speak without an attorney present and knowing that a retained attorney is trying to contact him, it is a difference that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings already address.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Contrary to the rationale of the Connecticut court on which the lead opinion relies, <em>Miranda </em>advice is not an abstract offer to call some unknown lawyer, it is an offer to have an attorney of one\u2019s choice present during questioning. Thus, although the lead opinion speculates that defendants might not have made a statement had they known an attorney was going to be available (immediately, within an horn, within several hours), this is exactly the kind of information that would have been produced had defendants exercised their options under <em>Miranda </em>to ask questions and request their attorneys.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Both the lead opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>and Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion benefit those suspects who already have retained counsel \u2014 the very suspects who currently exercise that option. Experience teaches that it is precisely those persons, educated and well enough off to retain an attorney, who are most likely to exercise their rights at precisely this point and to ask the police to contact their counsel. That a suspect may later regret that he did not choose to wait for the appearance of counsel of his choice does not affect the voluntariness of the choice. Nor does it logically support the conclusion that defendants would have foregone the opportunity to speak if they knew that their attorneys were \u201con [their] way.\u201d As stated by the United States Supreme Court, \u201cthe Constitution does not forbid \u2018every government-imposed choice in the criminal process that has the effect of discouraging the exercise of constitutional rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jenkins v Anderson, </em>447 US 231, 236; 100 S Ct 2124; 65 L Ed 2d 86 (1980), quoting <em>Chaffin v Stynchcombe, </em>412 US 17, 30; 93 S Ct 1977; 36 L Ed 2d 714 (1973).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>In its haste to create a novel \u201cMiranda-like right[ ],\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a majority of the Court blurs the distinction between the constitutional right to be free from compelled self-incrimination and the safeguards\u2014 <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 created to protect that right. In effect, a majority of the Court creates prophylactic rules to protect prophylactic rights. The argument seems to be that it is necessary to inform a suspect that an attorney is attempting to contact him, which, in turn, effectuates the suspect\u2019s right to counsel, which, in turn, effectuates a suspect\u2019s right to remain silent, which, in turn, effectuates a suspect\u2019s right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. Safeguards for safeguards is absurd and is not required by the Michigan Constitution, the federal constitution, or <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Given, for the reasons stated above, that neither the Michigan nor the federal constitution require extension of the <em>Miranda </em>litany, the majority\u2019s only possible justification for requiring the police to inform a suspect that an attorney wishes to speak with him must be grounded solely on policy concerns, not constitutional mandates. But policy concerns also fail under proper analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Most problematic of all is the majority rule\u2019s disruption of the delicate balance reached in <em>Miranda </em>between law enforcement\u2019s need for confessions and the suspect\u2019s need for protection against coercion. The holding in <em>Miranda </em>is a compromise between the state\u2019s position that the due process voluntariness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>standard adequately protects rights and the competing position that only the presence of a lawyer will eliminate the coercion of custodial interrogation. The majority comes down against law enforcement, believing that a holding to the contrary \u201cwould encourage the police to do everything possible, short of a due process violation, to prevent an attorney from contacting his client before or during interrogation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 615. There is no constitutional harm.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> If the police have done everything required by <em>Miranda </em>to effectuate a suspect\u2019s right to choose not to speak, there is no due process violation; and if the \u201cclient\u201d has not asked for an attorney even though he knows he has a right to the presence of counsel, what and whose rights are in jeopardy? Having thus created a paper tiger, however, a majority of the Court seeks to prevent the nonexistent constitutional violation and suppress all voluntarily given statements by saving the suspect from his own choice. What neither the lead opinion nor Chief Justice Brickley\u2019s opinion recognizes, however, is that \u201c[i]f all harsh, painful, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>intrusive means of law enforcement were prohibited, law enforcement would be impossible.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">Indeed, far from being prohibited by the Constitution, admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are inherently desirable. In addition to guaranteeing the right to remain silent unless immunity is granted, the Fifth Amendment proscribes only self-incrimination obtained by a \u201cgenuine compulsion of testimony.\u201d <em>Michigan v Tucker, supra, </em>417 US 440. Absent some officially coerced self-accusation, the Fifth Amendment privilege is not violated by even the most damning admissions. <em>[Washington, supra </em>at 187.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">The majority\u2019s imposition of an affirmative obligation on the police to offer more information than that required by <em>Miranda </em>will inevitably invite other challenges. Once the carefully crafted balance of <em>Miranda </em>is disturbed, there is no principled basis on which to stop further erosion of the rule. Perhaps the next challenge will mirror that in <em>Spring, supra, </em>where the defendant contended his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because he was not informed of the subject matter in which the police were interested or the exact use to which the information sought would be put. If a suspect cannot intelligently waive his right to the presence of counsel without calibrating information that he did not have, it might logically follow that unless he understands the particular significance of any information he gives, his waiver is equally unknowing. The majority rule likewise encourages a defendant to challenge his <em>Miranda </em>waiver because he was not informed of evidentiary developments in the case against him, a challenge rejected in <em>Oregon v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>Elstad, </em>470 US 298, 317; 105 S Ct 1285; 84 L Ed 2d 222 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Similarly, the majority\u2019s new requirement does not lend itself to easy administration. While <em>Miranda </em>rights must be read to every suspect about to undergo custodial interrogation, whether a suspect must be informed of the majority\u2019s rule depends on the circumstances. Consequently, it raises serious questions of application. The majority\u2019s rule requires that the police inform a suspect that an attorney wishes to see him \u201c \u2018whether that request comes over the police station counter, over the telephone, or via messenger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 618, quoting <em>People v Houston, </em>42 Cal 3d 595, 615; 230 Cal Rptr 141; 724 P2d 1166 (1986) (Bird, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). This rule opens Pandora\u2019s box with respect to challenges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">[T]he duly of police to inform a suspect that an attorney seeks to communicate with the suspect raises a number of other issues that the Court will surely need to address before long. For example, how quickly must the police relay the information that an attorney is available? If an attorney calls the police station, is the officer receiving the call obliged immediately to put aside all other matters and race to inform the investigating officers? Does the right attach at the time of communication or at some reasonable time thereafter? If the suspect should blurt out a confession a moment before an officer seeking to impart the availability of counsel enters the room, does the statement become retroactively involuntary even though the police made every effort to honor a defendant\u2019s rights? . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">Also, what duty do police officers have to provide full and accurate information concerning the attorney\u2019s identity? . . . And we will eventually have to wrestle with the nasty little issue of whether a negligent misstatement of the information concerning that attorney would have any effect on a subsequent waiver. <em>[State v Reed, </em>133 NJ 237, 280-281; 627 A2d 630 (1993) (Clifford, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>As the dissent in <em>Reed </em>illustrates, the majority\u2019s rule will disturb <em>Miranda's </em>clear, bright-line rule. An officer may no longer rest assured that as long as he reads the <em>Miranda </em>litany to the suspect, and the suspect informs him that he understands them and waives them, that he has adequately protected the suspect\u2019s rights under the Fifth Amendment. Now, a seemingly valid waiver will always be open to challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The majority compounds its error by holding that a waiver is invalid per se if a suspect is not informed of an attorney\u2019s attempted contact. This is contrary to <em>Miranda </em>itself and to our own precedent, both of which require the waiver inquiry to be resolved by considering the totality of the circumstances. 384 US 475; <em>People v Cipriano, </em>431 Mich 315; 429 NW2d 781 (1988); see also <em>Fare v Michael C, supra </em>at 724-725 (holding that the totality of the circumstances test applies when determining whether a juvenile waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights). The totality of the circumstances test is preferable to a rule per se because \u201ca waiver of rights may or may not, depending on the totality of the circumstances, be vitiated by the failure of the police to fulfill their responsibility to inform the suspect.\u201d <em>State v Stoddard, </em>206 Conn 157, 163; 537 A2d 446 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">To support creation of an exclusionary rule per se, the lead opinion reasons as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-7\">\u201cWhen the opportunity to consult counsel is in fact frustrated, there is no room for speculation what defendant might or might not have chosen to do after he had that opportunity.\u201d <em>State v Haynes, </em>288 Or 59, 75; 602 P2d 272 (1979). The right to counsel becomes meaningless if a suspect cannot communicate with his attorney or can only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>speak with him after the suspect has given a statement. <em>[Ante </em>at 617.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">Close examination of these two sentences, however, reveals that the lead opinion focuses on the wrong person in the attorney-client relationship. The privilege against self-incrimination is personal to the suspect. <em>United States v Scarpa, 897 </em>F2d 63, 69 (CA 2, 1990); <em>People v Ledesma, </em>204 Cal App 3d 682, 694; 251 Cal Rptr 417 (1988).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Likewise, a person\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda </em>may not be invoked by a third party. Failure to inform the suspect that an attorney would like to speak with him no more \u201cfrustrates\u201d the suspect\u2019s right to consult with counsel than if counsel had accompanied his client to the police station and was sitting outside the interrogation room. Rather, it \u201cfrustrates\u201d the attorney\u2019s attempts to consult with the suspect. More precisely, it frustrates the interest of the third party who has retained the attorney, or the interests of those who hold the view that confessions and admissions are not socially desirable. Likewise, suggesting that the right to counsel would be \u201cmeaningless if a suspect cannot communicate with his attorney\u201d focuses on the attorney, not the suspect. The right to counsel is not \u201cmeaningless\u201d if the attorney cannot communicate with a suspect because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>suspect has not indicated a desire to speak with the attorney. By contrast, the prophylactic protections created by <em>Miranda </em>were intended to protect suspects, not their families, their principals in crime, or their attorneys.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The majority rule might also raise serious equal protection concerns. Suspects who have a retained attorney whom they can call on a moment\u2019s notice, or who have supportive, wealthy families who know attorneys personally, obtain the benefit of the result of the majority opinion. Other beneficiaries include \u201cprofessional criminals\u201d who have previously had contact with the law. Indigent suspects, however, who have had no previous experience with law enforcement, will receive no assistance from the holding of the majority. As eloquently stated by the dissent in <em>Reed:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">[T]he Court\u2019s rule creates an illogical or unfair advantage for some suspects. Those suspects who are taken into custody in the presence of others, or who have previously obtained a private attorney, or who have previously required the services of a public defender \u2014 and therefore are more likely to be the beneficiaries of someone\u2019s call to an attorney on their behalf \u2014 will be found to have been coerced if not alerted should an attorney arrive at the station house. On the other hand, the indigent defendant with no previous experience with law enforcement who is arrested while alone \u2014 and hence \u201cout of the loop\u201d as far as legal assistance is concerned \u2014 although subjected to identical interrogation techniques will have knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel. The rule therefore results in two classes of suspects and favors those who are more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>likely to have access to counsel. Such intolerable incongruities result when the emphasis shifts to <em>events </em>entirely unrelated to the suspect\u2019s knowledge rather than focusing on the sole person who matters in evaluating the validity of a suspect\u2019s waiver \u2014 the <em>suspect. </em>[133 NJ 279 (Clifford, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The unequal treatment created by the majority, however, may be short-lived. Today\u2019s ruling will invite an indigent suspect to challenge the rule on equal protection grounds, claiming that the <em>Miranda </em>litany must be expanded to include the admonition that not only do you have a right to a free attorney if you cannot afford one, but that a free attorney is presently available and wants to talk with you. The majority is chargeable with knowledge that, given such an argument, the extreme position advocated in an amicus brief in <em>Miranda </em>\u2014 that the actual presence of counsel is necessary to dispel the coercion inherent in custodial interrogation \u2014 may' become the law in Michigan. By opting for less intrusive warnings, the <em>Miranda </em>Court rejected that position. So should we.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The trial court found that \u201ceach defendant had made a voluntary statement with full knowledge of his <em>Miranda </em>rights,\u201d 208 Mich App 221, 226; 527 NW2d 66 (1994), but believed that under Wright, the police committed a fatal error in failing to inform the defendants that an attorney was retained for them. Thus, the trial court concluded that the waivers were not knowing, and the confessions were suppressed. The Court of Appeals affirmed, reasoning that the rationale used in <em>Wright </em>by either Chief Justice Cavanagh or Justice Mallett would support sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>pressing the confessions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The majority affirmed the suppression of the confessions, albeit on slightly different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Given the lead and concurring opinion\u2019s desire to find the waivers unknowing, noticeably and understandably absent from either opinion is any reference to defendants\u2019 testimony at the suppression hearings. Analyzed properly, there is no question that the defendants understood their rights under <em>Miranda </em>and knowingly and intelligently waived those rights.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">Once it is determined that a suspect\u2019s decision not to rely on his rights was uncoerced, that he at all times knew he could stand mute and request a lawyer, and that he was aware of the State\u2019s intention to use his statements to secure a conviction, the analysis is complete and the waiver is valid as a matter of law. <em>[Moran, supra </em>at 422.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">At the suppression hearings, both defendants testified that they read, understood, and signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver forms.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There is no allegation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>defendants did not comprehend the substance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>rights provided by <em>Miranda. </em>There is no basis to question either defendant\u2019s cognitive ability; both were attending college and doing well.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Both testified that they knew they had a right to an attorney.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Defendants clearly understood that the police intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>use what they said against them because they both testified that they told the police the truth in the hope that the police would \u201cgo easy\u201d on them and allow them to go home.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Bender testified that he knew he should not sign the waiver form and asked the police for a reason why he should do so.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Review of the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>timony at the suppression hearings, focusing only on what the suspects knew and understood, leads to the inexorable conclusion that both defendants knowingly and intelligently waived their <em>Miranda </em>rights. As a matter of law, this is all that is necessary for a constitutionally valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Absent any claim of coercion, the fact that there were developments unknown to defendants \u2014 that an attorney had telephoned the station in Bender\u2019s case, or that his mother had arrived in person with the message that he was not to speak until the attorney arrived in Zeigler\u2019s case, had no bearing on whether the waivers were constitutionally sufficient. Similarly, it is irrelevant to a waiver analysis that each defendant testified that had he known an attorney had been retained for him, he would have heeded the attorney\u2019s advice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">A waiver may be knowing and intelligent in the sense that there was awareness of the right to remain silent and a decision to forego that right, but yet not knowing and intelligent in the sense that the tactical error of that decision was not perceived. But this is no bar to an effective waiver for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, for it \u201cis not in the sense of shrewdness that <em>Miranda </em>speaks of \u2018intelligent\u2019 waiver,\u201d and thus in \u201cthis context intelligence is not equated with wisdom.\u201d [1 LaFave &amp; Israel, Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 6.9, p 527, quoting <em>Collins v Brierly, </em>492 F2d 735, 739 (CA 3, 1974).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>This reasoning applies to the <em>Miranda </em>right to an attorney as well. A suspect\u2019s choice to forgo the presence of an attorney in the interrogation room will almost always be a tactical error. It is irrelevant, however, that, with hindsight, the suspect regrets his decision and would have done differently had he had the information needed to make the best decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Finally, from a pure policy standpoint, it is appropriate to find a valid waiver in these cases. Defendants made a conscious choice to tell the truth to the police, rather than exercise their right to remain silent, believing as a consequence that the police would \u201cgo easier\u201d on them and release them sooner. No societal goal is served in protecting the defendants against the consequences of their own intelligent choices.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Nor is it desirable to suppress a presumptively truthful statement, voluntarily made, that aids in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Finding a waiver in these cases upholds the eminently sound principle that a truthful, uncoerced confession will be used in prosecuting crime. The majority devalues confessions, yet does not explain why \u201cplanishing people for what they reveal from their own mouths\u201d is less acceptable than the common practice of convicting defendants using the testimony of others.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">To suppress these statements also hinders post-<em>Miranda </em>law enforcement. <em>Miranda </em>allows the suppression of some constitutionally obtained confessions in order to ensure that no omconstitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>obtained confessions are admitted. The rule set forth by the majority disturbs the delicate balance created in <em>Miranda </em>between confessions, which are desirable, and coercion, which is not. The balance is now skewed not to protect against coercion, but to discourage confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In short, there is no support in the Michigan Constitution for the rule announced today. I would adopt the holding and reasoning of <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>and consequently, would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b748-7\">Riley and Weaver, JJ, concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\"> Although a majority of the Court concludes that suspects must be told that an attorney is attempting to contact them, even when they have validly declined the invitation to speak with an attorney, four justices cannot agree on the rationale for why this information must be provided.
