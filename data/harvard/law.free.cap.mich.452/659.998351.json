The circuit court was, therefore, without jurisdiction to review the uncontested administrative forfeiture. MCL 333.7523(l)(c) and (d); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c) and (d). Furthermore, the prosecutor\u2019s agreement to return noncontraband property did not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court. Consequently, the circuit court was without authority to order the return of defendant\u2019s cash and jewelry. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">On January 23, 1992, officers obtained a search warrant that led to the seizure of cocaine, drug paraphernalia, cash, gold jewelry, and personal items from defendant Dale Mierzejewski. He was arrested for possession of under twenty-five grams of cocaine with intent to deliver. Later that day, the St. Clair County sheriff\u2019s office personally served defendant <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with a notice of intent to forfeit property. The sheriff\u2019s department sought forfeiture of the previously seized items: $3,420 in cash, two gold bracelets, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>three gold chains, pursuant to the controlled substances act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant failed to file a claim or post bond as required by MCL 333.7523(l)(c); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c). The prosecution declared the property administratively forfeited under MCL 333.7523(l)(d); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(d). On February 21, 1992, a notice of forfeiture was sent to defendant informing him that the statutory period had lapsed and that the money and jewelry were now the property of St. Clair County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">On August 4, 1992, defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver less than twenty-five grams of cocaine and was taken into custody. After a series of delays, trial was scheduled for August 10, 1993. On that date, however, the prosecutor moved to dismiss the case because the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, other occupants of the motel room arrested with defendant, indicated that if called to testify they would exercise their Fifth Amendment rights. After the trial court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to dismiss, counsel for defendant moved \u201cfor the return of the property seized pursuant to the statute MCLA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>600.4706 [MSA 27A.4706].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor replied that \u201c[a]ny property that is not clearly contraband or drug paraphernalia will be returned.\u201d Subsequently, the prosecutor\u2019s office notified defense counsel that the cash and jewelry would not be returned because defendant did not comply with the statutory twenty-day requirement to file a claim and post bond. See MCL 333.7523(l)(c); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Therefore, on October 18, 1993, defendant brought a motion before the trial court for the return of all his property. The court, apparently relying on the error in defendant\u2019s address on the notice of forfeiture, ordered the forfeited property returned to defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff appealed as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">In a two to one decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the trial court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> holding that the property forfeited under MCL 333.7521; MSA 14.15(7521) was properly returned to defendant. The Court of Appeals denied rehearing, and the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>tion applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted leave to appeal on December 7, 1995.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Disposition of the seized and subsequently forfeited items in this case is governed by the controlled substances act, MCL 333.7521 <em>et </em>seq.; MSA 14.15(7521) <em>et seq. </em>Property that has been legally \u201cseized\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> may be administratively forfeited by a governmental agency that provides the property owner with notice that the property has been seized and that the agency intends to forfeit the property.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the present case, the St. Clair County Sheriffs Department personally served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>defendant with notice<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in full compliance with the controlled substances act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">After receiving this notice, defendant had every right to contest the forfeiture. However, to do so, defendant was obligated to file a claim and post bond:<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">Any person claiming an interest in property which is the subject of a notice under subdivision (a) may, within 20 days after receipt of the notice or of the date of the first publication of the notice, file a written claim signed by the claimant with the local unit of government or the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>expressing his or her interest in the property. [MCL 333.7523(l)(c); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Upon receipt of the property owner\u2019s claim, the prosecuting attorney must then commence forfeiture proceedings at the expiration of the twenty-day period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">Upon the filing of the claim, and the giving of a bond to the local unit of government or the state in the amount of 10% of the value of the claimed property, but not less than $250.00 or greater than $5,000.00 .... The attorney general, the prosecuting attorney, or the city or township attorney shall promptly institute forfeiture proceedings after the expiration of the 20-day period. [MCL 333.7523(l)(c); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">This is the <em>only </em>means by which the statute confers jurisdiction on the circuit court. In the present case, defendant never filed a claim or posted bond. His failure activated the automatic forfeiture clause of MCL 333.7523(l)(d); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(d): \u201cIf no claim is filed or bond given within the 20-day period as described in subdivision (c), the local unit of government or the state <em>shall declare the property forfeited and shall dispose of the property </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) As a matter of law, the property was ceded to St. Clair County on the twentieth day following service of the sheriff\u2019s notice of intent to forfeit property on defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In the present case, the prosecuting attorney declared the property forfeited and sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>defendant a notice of forfeiture.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because an administrative forfeiture had been declared, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to <em>review </em>the matter. MCL 333.7523; MSA 14.15(7523).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court did not have the authority to order the return of the forfeited cash and jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Notwithstanding the clear and unambiguous language of the statute, defendant argues that the circuit court had jurisdiction to <em>review </em>the forfeiture proceedings, citing <em>In re Property Held by the Detroit Police Dep\u2019t, </em>141 Mich App 302, 304; 367 NW2d 376 (1985). In <em>Detroit Police Dep\u2019t, </em>the defendants sought return of property <em>\u201cseized and held\u201d </em>by the police. Significantly, the property in <em>Detroit Police Dep\u2019t, </em>however, was merely seized and apparently held as evidence, but was <em>never administratively forfeited </em>pursuant to the controlled substances act. In fact, <em>Detroit Police Dep\u2019t </em>relied on <em>People v Washington, </em>134 Mich App 504, 510; 351 NW2d 577 (1984), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>which the Court of Appeals upheld the return of \u201cseized\u201d property,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> but noted this very distinction, cautioning: \u201cHowever, this record does not indicate any effort by appellant to seek forfeiture of the money under the controlled substance forfeiture statutes.\u201d Neither case purports to confer jurisdiction on a circuit court to return administratively forfeited property. In fact, the cases stand for quite the opposite proposition, as the <em>Washington </em>Court stated: \u201cA forfeiture claim under the controlled substance statutes would pose a different question than that which we decide here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510-511.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">It is clear from both the language of the decision in <em>Detroit Police Dep\u2019t </em>and that Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Washington </em>that the property at issue in <em>Detroit Police Dep\u2019t </em>had not been administratively forfeited under the controlled substances act. Therefore, <em>Detroit Police Dep\u2019t </em>merely stands for the proposition that following a preliminary examination in which the <em>charge </em>against the defendant is dismissed, property <em>seized and held </em>as evidence, <em>but not administratively forfeited under the controlled substances </em>act, may be returned to the defendant by a circuit court having jurisdiction over the criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Defendant also argues that a binding agreement was made between the parties in open court that obligated the prosecutor to return the forfeited property. Defendant and the Court of Appeals cited MCR 2.507(H) in support:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">An agreement or consent between the parties or their attorneys respecting the proceedings in an action, subsequently denied by either party, is not binding unless it was made in open court, or unless evidence of the agreement is in writing, subscribed by the party against whom the agreement is offered or by that party\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Assuming, arguendo, that the prosecutor agreed to return the <em>forfeited, </em>property, the prosecutor\u2019s agreement was invalid.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> MCR 2.507 does not abrogate the fundamental rule of civil procedure that \u201csubject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred on the court by the consent of parties.\u201d <em>In re Hatcher, </em>443 Mich 426, 433; 505 NW2d 834 (1993). The prosecutor simply could not confer by agreement subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court. See MCL 333.7423(2); MSA 14.15(7423)(2). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Moreover, defendant and the Court of Appeals rely on <em>Nelson v Consumers Power Co, </em>198 Mich App 82; 497 NW2d 205 (1993), for the proposition that an agreement made in open court between counsel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>binding under principles of apparent authority. <em>Nelson, </em>however, is not at all relative to the present case because it involved the apparent authority of an attorney to bind a party <em>to a settlement agreement. </em>There was no issue of the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction in <em>Nelson. </em>In the present case, the property was administratively forfeited by defendant\u2019s failure to file a claim or post bond. Consequently, the circuit court set aside an uncontested administrative forfeiture action without jurisdiction to decide the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">It is also claimed that the prosecutor waived the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. It is well established that \u201c[j]urisdiction of the subject-matter cannot be given by consent.\u201d <em>Warner v Noble, </em>286 Mich 654, 659; 282 NW 855 (1938).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Therefore, defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecuting attorney waived the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction is without merit and also must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Unquestionably, the sheriff\u2019s department fulfilled the notice requirements of MCL 333.7523(l)(a); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(a). A copy of the notice was personally served on defendant at the county jail in total compliance with MCL 333.7523(l)(a); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(a). The forfeiture became final twenty days later when defendant failed to file a claim or post bond. MCL 333.7523(l)(c); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c). The alleged agreement by the prosecutor to return the seized items is of no significance because the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review and set aside the forfeiture. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>defendant is bound by his failure to respond to the notice of intent to forfeit property. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and order the property disposed of in accordance with MCL 333.7524; MSA 14.15(7524).</p>\n<judges id=\"b762-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-9\"> MCL 333.7521(1)00; MSA 14.15(7521)(1)CO provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">The following property is subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-11\">Any thing of value that is furnished or intended to be furnished in exchange for a controlled substance, an imitation controlled substance, an androgenic anabolic steroid, or a counterfeit androgenic anabolic steroid in violation of this article or section 17766a that is traceable to an exchange for a controlled substance, an imitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>controlled substance, an androgenic anabolic steroid, or a counterfeit androgenic anabolic steroid in violation of this article or section 17766a, or that is used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation of this article or section 17766a including, but not limited to, money, negotiable instruments, or securities. . . .

But the ultimate forfeitability of such property depends on proof that the property was furnished in exchange for, or is traceable to an exchange for, a controlled substance. Fundamental fairness and the irrefutable requirement of the review-ability of law enforcement actions for the protection of our civil liberties requires the existence of a \u201cformal system ... by which to check the potentially unbridled discretion the police would possess if allowed to make [both determinations required by the controlled substances act]. The potential for abuse seems obvious.\u201d <em>People v Gallego, </em>430 Mich 443, 452; 424 NW2d 470 (1988). \u201cA criminal statute . . . may not vest law enforcement officials . . . with unbridled discretion . . . .\u201d <em>People v Lino, </em>447 Mich 567, 591; 527 NW2d 434 (1994) (opinion of LEVIN, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">I think an independent determination whether seized property satisfies the requirements of subsection 7521(l)(f) is compelled by general principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>administrative validity and, more importantly, is in fact contemplated by the controlled substances act.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Moreover, in this particular case, it is actually unnecessary to even reach the question who should ultimately decide the forfeitability of the property at issue. This is so because, given the fact that the charges against defendant were dropped and no prosecution was carried out against any of the parties involved, there is legally no \u201cexchange for a controlled substance\u201d to which defendant\u2019s property is \u201ctraceable\u201d or for which defendant\u2019s property was \u201cfurnished or intended to be furnished.\u201d Therefore, the requirements of subsection 7521(l)(f) were never met and defendant\u2019s property never became legally subject to forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Subsection 7523(1) provides that \u201c[i]f property is seized pursuant to section 7522,[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] forfeiture proceedings shall be instituted promptly.\u201d MCL 333.7523(1); MSA 14.15(7523)(1). Then, in cases in which the seizing agency has notified the owner of the property of an intent to forfeit and the owner files a written claim and gives a bond, forfeiture proceedings must be instituted. MCL 333.7523(l)(c); MSA 14.15(7523)(l)(c). Property seized in accordance with the act \u201cis deemed to be in the custody of the seizing agency subject only to this section or an order and judgment of the court having jurisdiction over the forfeiture proceedings.\u201d MCL 333.7523(2); MSA 14.15(7523) (2). In my judgment, the provision in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>section 7523(l)(d) purporting to authorize a local unit of government, in cases in which no claim is filed or bond given within the twenty-day period, to simply \u201cdeclare the property forfeited\u201d without any neutral, independent proceeding is the kind of unbridled discretion our rule of law safeguards us against.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In my opinion, although the property was properly seized and the owner was notified (albeit insufficiently) of the county\u2019s intent to forfeit, the absence of a subsequent independent determination that the seized property was actually forfeitable vitiates the conclusion that legal ownership of the property passed from defendant to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">I would also point out that the notice of intent to forfeit served on defendant was defective because of the undisputed fact that it did not comply with its own clearly stated requirement of advising the property owner where to file a claim and give a bond, should he decide to do so.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Protection against arbitrary governmental seizures of private property, a protection well embedded in our legal tradition, surely requires strict compliance with procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">If the majority\u2019s interpretation is correct \u2014 that, absent the filing of a claim, any property lawfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>seized becomes the property of the seizing authority (here, the sheriff) after twenty days \u2014 then police agencies have a marvelous tool for augmenting their budgets. This automatic transfer of title could never be challenged later, even if the prosecutor determines on the twenty-first day that a mistake was made, that the seized property was not drug related, and that there will be no criminal prosecution. And we cannot rely on the good intentions of the prosecutor in such circumstances because, at oral argument, in response to Justice Mallett\u2019s inquiry whether the prosecutor could return the items after twenty days had passed, the prosecutor responded, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that we could, Justice. ... If the 20 days had passed, it would be my position that that property belonged to St. Clair County, and <em>it would be out of our consideration\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The majority\u2019s interpretation endorses irrevocable transfers of ownership to the governmental entity that makes the initial decision to seize property without any authoritative determination that the property is actually subject to forfeiture. This is certainly a financial boon to law enforcement agencies \u2014 perhaps there was a method to leaving the notice of intent form blank rather than indicating <em>where </em>to file a claim \u2014 but it is a boon that cannot be countenanced under our rule of law. And, more specifically, it violates the overall statutory scheme of the forfeiture provisions of the controlled substances act.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">In conclusion, then, I would hold that legal ownership of defendant\u2019s property never transferred to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>county. Therefore, on that basis alone, defendant is entitled to the return of his property.</p>\n<judges id=\"b767-5\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\"> Such notice is not mentioned in the act. It is apparently a self-initiated administrative practice of the St. Clair County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-10\"> MCL 333.7522; MSA 14.15(7522). This section sets forth the circumstances under which property may be seized. As already noted, I do not contend that the property at issue in this case was illegally seized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b765-10\"> The notice of intent to forfeit in this case was defective in that it failed to provide any information on where a claim was to be filed. The form served upon defendant stated: \u201cIn the event you wish to contest this forfeiture and have a hearing thereon, you must do the following: (1) within twenty (20) days from receipt of this notice file a claim by <em>sending a notice of that claim </em>to_.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
