Amy was wearing a tag on her clothes supplied by the school indicating that she was to be let off the bus at the comer of 156th and Lakewood. Witteveen had been furnished with a list of the students and the locations where they were to be dropped off. She was to check by radio with the school if a tag did not correspond with the list. She did not do so, and mistakenly dropped Amy off at 160th and Perry.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Amy, in an effort to reach her babysitter\u2019s house on her own, walked about half a mile along 160th Street to Lakewood Boulevard. When Amy reached Lakewood, she attempted to cross the street, but was struck by an oncoming car. Amy sustained serious and permanent disabling injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">West Ottawa had insurance coverage through three carriers. Appellant Michigan Mutual Insurance Company was the general liability carrier providing primary coverage up to one million dollars. The policy was subject to the following exclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">Transportation of Pupils: With respect to the transportation of students or pupils, exclusions (b) and (e) of the policy are replaced by the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">The insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage <em>arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading </em>of any . . . automobile . . . owned, operated or hired by or for the insured. . . . [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">The automobile liability carrier was appellee State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, which provided primary coverage up to $500,000. The policy provided that the insurer agrees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall be legally obligated to pay as damages because of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">(A) bodily injury sustained by other persons, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">(B) property damage,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">caused by accident <em>arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use, including loading or unloading, </em>of the owned motor vehicle ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">School Bus, Church and Other Approved Bus Use</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">The coverage applies only while the motor vehicle is used for a \u201cuse\u201d shown in the exceptions space on the declarations page and during maintenance, inspection, testing or renovation, subject to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">Use</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">Bus uses are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">A. School Bus Use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">School Bus Use \u2014 means the carrying of persons in connection with school attendance or any school activity of your school or school district. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">Appellee Pacific Employers Insurance Company was the umbrella carrier, providing coverage up to five million dollars applicable when the primary coverage provided by State Farm or Michigan Mutual is exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">Johannes Doolaard, Amy\u2019s father and conservator of her estate, brought suit in May 1985 against West Ottawa Public Schools and school bus driver Wit-teveen for damages resulting from Amy\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">The excess carrier, Pacific, filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the liabilities of the insurers. Pacific contended that the general liability insurer, Michigan Mutual, rather than the automobile insurer, State Farm, was the primary insurer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>While this action was pending, the underlying law suit was settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">The circuit judge ruled, in the present action, that Michigan Mutual was primarily liable for costs incurred in the settlement of the underlying suit. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court concluded that \u201cuse\u201d should be defined narrowly \u201cto encompass only those injuries arising from the carrying of persons aboard the bus.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Amy\u2019s injuries occurred five to ten minutes after and about half a mile away from where she alighted from the bus, the Court reasoned that the injuries and damages were not covered by the State Farm policy. The Court drew a distinction between Witteveen\u2019s driving of the school bus, which it said involved the \u201cuse\u201d of the bus, and her \u201cseparate, personal act of discharging Amy Doolaard at the wrong stop.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The parties agree that one or the other of the two primary insurers, Michigan Mutual or State Farm, is subject to liability. It is not claimed that neither primary insurer is subject to liability with the result that only the excess carrier provides coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The question is whether the accident that injured Amy arose, as stated in the State Farm policy, \u201cout of the ownership, maintenance or use\u201d of the school bus or whether, as stated in the Michigan Mutual policy, coverage is excluded because the accident arose \u201cout of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading\u201d of the school bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Because the language in the State Farm policy describing the coverage and the language in the Michigan Mutual policy describing the exclusion from coverage is essentially parallel, the general rules of construction are of little assistance in resolving this controversy between two (or three) insurers in which the insured has no direct interest. We, nevertheless, note that, in general, exclusionary clauses are construed against the insurer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But, \u201c [t]his Court cannot create ambiguity where none exists. . . . Clear and specific exclusions must be given effect.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We also review an exclusion from coverage, bearing in mind that an insurance contract should be read as a whole to effectuate the overall intent of the parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We turn to a consideration of whether Amy\u2019s injury \u201carose from\u201d the \u201cuse\u201d of the school bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The school bus was \u201cused\u201d to transport Amy until shortly before the accident. She was injured after disembarking the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The tort standard of causation is not determinative of causation in an insurance case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The insured must show more than the minimal \u201cbut for\u201d causation. See <em>Thornton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 643, 650; 391 NW2d 320 (1986), in which this Court adopted a cau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>sation standard set forth in <em>Kangas v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>64 Mich App 1, 17; 235 NW2d 42 (1975), that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">[W]hile the automobile need not be the proximate cause of the injury, there still must be a causal connection between the injury sustained and the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile and which causal connection is more than incidental, fortuitous or but for. The injury must be foreseeably identifiable with the normal use, maintenance and ownership of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Other states and commentators have stated essentially comparable standards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The Court of Appeals concluded that \u201c \u2018[u]se\u2019 is narrowly defined to encompass only those injuries arising from the carrying of persons aboard the bus.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While this definition may suffice for a public transit bus that transports passengers from embarkation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>disembarkation, the Court of Appeals definition ignores a major aspect of the particular \u201cuse\u201d to which a school bus is put. A school bus driver is charged both with physically carrying passengers on the bus <em>and </em>with assuring that each child is delivered to a predetermined bus stop. When this driver failed to disembark the child at the correct location, she \u201cmisused\u201d the bus. The injuries that followed were foreseeably identifiable with the negligent decision to disembark the child at the wrong bus stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The Court of Appeals failed to recognize the scope of the term \u201cuse\u201d when it held that school bus use under the State Farm policy was limited to the carrying of persons in connection with school attendance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cUse\u201d is defined more broadly than the mere carrying of persons and, while it encompasses the \u201coperation\u201d of the bus, it may also include a range of activity unrelated to actual driving. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Although the State Farm policy does not include the term \u201coperation,\u201d \u201cuse\u201d as \u201cthe carrying of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>sons\u201d under the State Farm policy includes at least the operation of school buses. If we were to construe the policy otherwise, even the most obvious negligent driving would not be covered by the State Farm policy, such as where a school bus driver negligently decides to pass despite a double yellow line and that decision results in injuries to persons aboard the school bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\">The \u201cuse\u201d of a school bus, even when limited by the State Farm policy to \u201ccarrying of persons in connection with school attendance,\u201d encompasses the disem-barkment of school children at predetermined bus stops. In <em>Burke Co School Dist v Roberts, </em>220 Ga App 510, 513; 469 SE2d 529 (1996), in which the issue was as here whether the automobile liability insurer or the general liability insurer was responsible for school bus driver negligence in disembarking a young child at an unauthorized bus stop, and the child was struck by an automobile trying to navigate his way home, the Georgia court held that \u201cthe dropping off of the child was unquestionably an act which arose \u2018out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use,\u2019 of the school bus. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">State Farm asserts that it is not subject to liability because it was the school bus driver\u2019s \u201cseparate, personal act of discharging Amy Doolaard at the wrong stop\u201d and not her \u201cuse\u201d of the school bus that caused the injuries. This is not a legally recognizable distinction, however. The school bus driver\u2019s charge included disembarking the children at predetermined bus stops, not merely transporting them to and from school. The driver \u201cused\u201d the school bus in doing so, even if one characterizes her conduct as a \u201cseparate and personal\u201d act.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A foreseeably identifiable injury resulting from the failure to disembark a child from the school bus at the predetermined destination is no more beyond the scope of \u201cuse\u201d under the State Farm policy because the separate and personal negligence of the school bus driver was involved than a foreseeably identifiable injury caused by the school bus crossing a double yellow line or going through a red light would be excluded from \u201cuse\u201d under the State Farm policy because the separate and personal negligence of the school bus driver was involved.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Our analysis of the Michigan Mutual policy reinforces our conclusion that State Farm, as the automobile liability insurer, rather than Michigan Mutual, the general liability insurer, is responsible for providing coverage in the circumstances. Michigan Mutual\u2019s policy states that \u201c[t]he insurance does not apply to bodily injury or property damage arising out of . . . use ... of any . . . automobile . . . .\u201d Although this exclusion is written in the negative, the language is otherwise virtually identical to that found in the State Farm policy. Accordingly, the analysis in this opinion respecting the provisions concerning coverage in the State Farm policy apply to the virtually mirror-image language of the Michigan Mutual exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Also telling is that the language of the Michigan Mutual exclusion is set forth under the heading, \u201cTransportation of Pupils.\u201d This heading clearly communicates Michigan Mutual\u2019s intention not to provide coverage for the transportation of pupils in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Ordinarily an automobile liability insurer would not be responsible for injuries suffered, say, ten minutes after disembarkation, and a quarter of a mile from the place where the passenger was disembarked.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We conclude, however, that the term \u201cuse\u201d in the phrase \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\u201d of a school bus includes disembarking school children, especially a child at the conclusion of her first day of kindergarten, at the predetermined location. The purpose of transporting a child by a school bus is to assure that the child reaches the predetermined bus stop under the supervision of the school bus driver. Driver Witteveen used the bus to take Amy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>to the wrong place, and a foreseeably identifiable injury resulted. When a school bus driver disembarks a child at a location other than the predetermined location, the purpose of providing secure school bus transportation may, as here, be significantly defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b320-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> 204 Mich App 265; 514 NW2d 239 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 270.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b314-9\"> <em>Bianchi v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>437 Mich 65, 70; 467 NW2d 17 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\"> <em>Auto-Owners Ins Co v Churchman, </em>440 Mich 560, 567; 489 NW2d 431 (1992); <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>432 Mich 656, 666; 443 NW2d 734 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\"> <em>Churchman, </em>n 5 <em>supra </em>at 566; <em>Fresard v Michigan Millers Mut Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 686, 694; 327 NW2d 286 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b314-13\"> <em>Vanguard Ins Co v Clarke, </em>438 Mich 463, 466, n 3; 475 NW2d 48 (1991); <em>Hernandez v Protective Casualty Ins, </em>473 So 2d 1241 (Fla, 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> After surveying case law construing the phrase \u201carising out of the use of\u201d from its own and other jurisdictions, the Supreme Court of Connecticut stated that for a homeowner\u2019s exclusion with that language to apply, \u201cit is sufficient to show only that the accident or injury \u2018was connected with,\u2019 \u2018had its origins in,\u2019 \u2018grew out of,\u2019 \u2018flowed from,\u2019 or \u2018was incident to\u2019 the use of the automobile . . . .\u201d <em>Hogle v Hogle, </em>167 Conn 572, 577; 356 A2d 172 (1975).

See also <em>Vanguard, </em>n 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">In <em>Vanguard, </em>this Court held that the insureds\u2019 deaths \u201carose out of\u201d the operation of a vehicle where one of the insureds drove his vehicle into the garage and accidentally asphyxiated himself and two members of his family by lowering the garage door while keeping the engine running. We so concluded although the vehicle was not being \u201coperated\u201d and was not \u201ccarrying\u201d anyone anywhere at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">State Farm and Pacific contend that <em>Vanguard </em>is inapposite because the issue in that case was whether this Court would adopt the theory of concurrent or dual causation. Nevertheless, the question presented required this Court to resolve whether the accident fit within the automobile exclusion in the insureds\u2019 homeowner policy.

Nor is such an accident less foreseeable. Regardless of the scope of the mistake, the child was still obliged to walk alone and unaided and face the dangers sought to be avoided by use of the school bus.
