We conclude that the airport parking tax is not a local tax and, therefore, does not violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 31. Thus, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Plaintiff, Airlines Parking, Inc., owns and operates an airport parking facility in Romulus, which is in Wayne County. The facility is located within five miles of Detroit Metropolitan Airport (Metro). Plaintiff brought an original action in the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>pursuant to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 32 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against defendants, the City of Romulus, the County of Wayne, and the State of Michigan, contending that the tax is a \u201clocal tax\u201d subject to \u00a7 31 of the Headlee Amendment, and therefore subject to prior approval by a majority of local voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The Court of Appeals granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposition and initially granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for rehearing, but, after further review, rejected the motion. Plaintiff filed an application for leave to appeal with this Court. We retained jurisdiction and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for an explanation of the reasons for denying the plaintiff\u2019s rehearing motion. 447 Mich 985 (1994). In response, the Court of Appeals stated that plaintiff\u2019s claim was untimely and alternatively rejected its contention that the tax was a \u201clocal tax\u201d under the current constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">When the case returned to this Court, we held it in abeyance pending a decision in <em>Taxpayers Allied for Constitutional Taxation v Wayne Co, </em>450 Mich 119; 537 NW2d 596 (1995). After review, and in light of that case, we granted leave to appeal limited to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>issue whether the airport tax was an unconstitutional tax under the Headlee Amendment, art 9, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">A. THE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The Airport Parking Tax Act, MCL 207.371 <em>et seq.\\ </em>MSA 7.559(101) <em>et seq., </em>in pertinent part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">There is hereby levied upon and shall be collected from a person engaged in the business of providing an airport parking facility an excise tax at the rate of 30% of the amount of the charge for the transaction. [MCL 207.373; MSA 7.559(103).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The statute levies an excise tax on each parking transaction<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> at an airport parking facility<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> located within five miles of a regional airport facility, which is defined by the act as an airport that services four million or more annual \u201cenplanements.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Metro is currently the only airport in the state that fits the definition of a regional airport facility. The tax is collected, distributed by the state, and appropriated by legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>tive act for Wayne County and Romulus, the county and city in which the airport is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The parties have not argued nor do we find ambiguity in the statute. Plaintiff does not contend that Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29 is relevant to his claim and has not argued or briefed this issue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The only issue before us is whether the tax violates art 9, \u00a7 31 of the Headlee Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">B. CONSTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The Headlee Amendment was \u201cpart of a nationwide \u2018taxpayers revolt\u2019 ... to limit legislative expansion of requirements placed on local government, to put a freeze on what they perceived was excessive government spending, and to lower their taxes both at the local and the state level.\u201d <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 378; 381 NW2d 662 (1985). For present purposes, we observe that Headlee establishes tax limitations on state and local governments and pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>hibits tax increases by both state and local governments without direct voter approval. Art 9, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Plaintiff asserts that the tax was levied in violation of the prohibition of art 9, \u00a7 31:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">Units of Local Government are hereby prohibited from levying any tax not authorized by law or charter when this section is ratified or from increasing the rate of an existing tax above that rate authorized by law or charter when this section is ratified, without the approval of a majority of the qualified electors of that unit of Local Government voting thereon.9 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark>!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Simply stated, a proposal by local government to levy a new tax or increase the rate of an extant tax beyond the limit imposed by law must be approved by a majority of the local voters.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In parallel fashion, Headlee controls the level of state taxation, limiting the total amount of taxes that may be imposed on state taxpayers in any fiscal year. This limit cannot \u201cbe changed without approval [of a] majority of qualified electors,\u201d and the Legislature is prohibited from imposing \u201ctaxes of any kind which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>together with all other revenues of the state, federal aid excluded, exceed the revenue limit established in this section\u201d of the amendment. Art 9, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is undisputed that, if the airport tax is a state tax, the limits of \u00a7 26 of the Headlee Amendment have not been exceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The amendment is built on the previously existing system, and the temporal reference point of the requirements and limitations imposed on state government is fiscal year 1978-79. Art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 26 and 30. The temporal reference point for the limitation on local government here at issue is the date of ratification, November 7, 1978. In each instance, the language of the provisions is linked to the determination of which entity \u2014 the state or local government\u2014 imposes or levies the tax in question.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, because it is at least theoretically possible that the state could levy a tax that was local in character, the entity imposing the tax in question may not conclusively resolve the Headlee question.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">We find no reason in this case to conclude that the tax is a local tax. It is an excise tax, \u201ca tax imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>upon . . . the engaging in an occupation.\u201d <em>Dooley v </em>Detroit, 370 Mich 194, 206; 121 NW2d 724 (1963), which the constitution authorizes the Legislature to enact.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is styled as a state tax, has the structural attributes of a state tax, and serves a state purpose. It was enacted by the Legislature and is administered by the state. It is collected by the state treasury and accounted for in the state budget. The funds are deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the airport parking fund<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and distribution is directed to each qualified county<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and city according to a statutory formula.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The state retains all interest and penalties from delinquent taxes. The statute requires a con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>turning appropriation<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> from year to year, and revenues are therefore subject to redirection by the Legislature. <em>Michigan Ass\u2019n of Cos v Dep\u2019t of Management &amp; Budget, </em>418 Mich 667; 345 NW2d 584 (1984).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">By contrast, local taxes are collected by local government, administered directly by that local entity, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>and spent by the local government according to local fiscal policy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Obviously, local taxes, levied by local governments, would not be subject to state appropriations or to legislative discretion in terms of revenue distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Additionally, the act has a provision allowing assignment of payments from the revenues generated to locally incurred debt obligations of the county. The statute specifically provides that the act shall not be construed to \u201c[r]equire the state to continue to impose and collect taxes imposed by this act [or] [l]imit or prohibit the state from repealing or amending this act.\u201d MCL 207.378(3)(a), (b); MSA 7.559(108)(3)(a), (b). In short, all indicia of the tax indicate prevailing state control.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Finally, while plaintiff contends that the tax is local because it benefits only local end users, we conclude that the tax clearly serves a state purpose.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>guage of the act is not exclusive, and its application is not limited to any one location. The act applies to parking facilities in any qualified county providing public services to a regional airport facility. Although Wayne County at present is the only county in Michigan that has an airport meeting the statutory definition, the statutory language does not restrict application of this tax to one locale as would the language of a local tax act.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">To the extent that plaintiff suggests that the Legislature is allowed to impose taxes only for the purposes of state government, and not for purposes of local government, and that only a constitutional provision would allow for a diversion of state tax dollars to local governments, plaintiff is clearly incorrect. Excise taxes and other state taxes are distributed to local governments for local purposes under the Revenue Sharing Act, MCL 141.901; MSA 5.3194(401), as are state tax dollars under the gasoline tax act and other state taxes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Plaintiffs functional end-user argument ignores the fact that matters of local concern may also be matters of state concern. The determination of public purpose is preeminently a legislative prerogative. We have held that a purpose to stimulate the state\u2019s apple industry is beneficial to the general public, <em>Miller v State Apple Comm, </em>296 Mich 248; 296 NW 245 (1941), and that the public financing of gubernatorial elections is for the general welfare of the public and well within the Legislature\u2019s power. <em>Advisory Opinion on Constitutionality of 1975 PA 227, </em>396 Mich 465, 496-497; 242 NW2d 3 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">In <em>Moreton v Secretary of State, </em>240 Mich 584, 588; 216 NW 450 (1927), we found that the building and maintenance of public roads was not solely a matter of local concern. Rejecting the assertion that the gasoline tax, 1927 PA 150, now codified as MCL 207.101 <em>et seq.\\ </em>MSA 7.291 <em>et seq., </em>was for the benefit only of the locality where the funds were expended, the Court found that the public interest divested the tax appropriation of its local character, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">To say that a highway appropriation is for local purposes means that it is for the benefit of the locality where it is expended. The purpose of these appropriations is not for the benefit of certain localities but for the State at large. ... It is a general statute enacted for a State-wide purpose [and therefore] the act does not make appropriations for local purposes .... <em>[Id. </em>at 589-590.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Like the gasoline tax revenues in <em>Moreton, </em>which were appropriated to certain local governments for highway maintenance and repair and which, in turn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>benefited the entire driving public in the state, the revenue generated by the airport tax is allocated to those local governments that are involved in the provision of services to a major regional airport. Wayne County provides services to Metro, which itself serves as a hub for international, national, and regional airlines travel for the entire state.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In <em>Advisory Opinion, </em>we observed that the fact that certain individuals benefit from an appropriation does not necessarily imply that the appropriation is lacking a public purpose. The question is whether society at large has an interest in having those individuals benefited. <em>Id. </em>at 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Likewise, the fact that these defendants benefit from a state appropriation does not necessarily imply that the tax; has only a local purpose. The state has an interest in the provision of services to a major regional airport, which has an obvious economic benefit to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Relying almost exclusively on <em>Youngblood v Sexton, </em>32 Mich 406; 20 AR 654 (1875), plaintiff asserts that the airport tax is a \u201clocal tax\u201d because the monies collected pursuant to the tax come exclusively from the local parking businesses<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and are subsequently distributed solely to Wayne County and Romulus on a monthly basis. Defendants contend that <em>Youngblood </em>is inapplicable, given the structure, requirements, and purpose of the Headlee Amendment, and that the tax is not a local tax. The relatively straightforward ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tion is whether <em>Youngblood v Sexton </em>requires the conclusion that this tax is a local tax as that term is used in the Headlee Amendment. Because the Headlee Amendment subjects local taxes and state taxation and spending to distinct requirements, the simple question has profound consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The venerable holding of <em>Youngblood v Sexton </em>rejected a challenge to a liquor tax imposed on liquor dealers, payable to the city and collected by the local sheriff. The Court concluded that the tax was a \u201clocal specific tax,\u201d rather than a \u201cstate specific tax,\u201d and therefore did not violate a provision of the then-existing constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 413. That provision specified that proceeds from \u201cstate specific taxes\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> imposed by general law were to be applied to interest on education funds and to interest and principal on state debt.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The tax provided for in <em>Youngblood </em>was a general tax that was collected within a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>locality and handed over to the local authorities, credited to the local contingent fund for purposes that the local authorities agreed upon, for the general purposes of local government. Youngblood, <em>supra </em>at 415. The Court noted that \u201cany tax levied by a general law is a state tax; but if the moneys are to be put to local uses, the only substantial difference between that and one levied by local action, consists in this: that in one case the state levies the tax, and in the other [the state] authorizes the levy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Simply stated, under the 1850 Constitution, the state had the power to levy \u201cstate specific taxes\u201d to support state government and the power to authorize the levy of \u201clocal specific taxes\u201d to be collected by local governments for local purposes.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 413. We agree with defendant Wayne County\u2019s observation that the result in <em>Youngblood </em>is explained by the fact that, given the latitude to compel local taxation that was deemed not to be a state specific tax, the Court saw no need to classify specific taxes authorized by the state to be levied on local communities as anything but local taxes. In concluding that state specific taxes did not include taxes imposed by state law, but allocated to local units of government, <em>id. </em>at 413-414, the Court likewise avoided the constitutional requirement that all state taxes nominated as specific taxes be allocated to the reduction of the interest on either the education fund or the state debt because either local taxes locally imposed or state taxes compelled for a local purpose had the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>We disagree that <em>Youngblood </em>requires the result advocated by plaintiff for a fundamental reason: <em>Youngblood </em>was decided under the 1850 Constitution, which expressly permitted the state to impose tax revenues for purposes of local government. Under the current constitution, the state has no power to compel local governments to impose a new tax. See art 9, \u00a7 29. The resulting change in the relationship between the state and local governments mandated by Headlee, expressly precludes the <em>Youngblood </em>approach, thus removing the linchpin of plaintiffs analysis as it applies to state taxes not levied in lieu of property taxes.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As defendant Wayne County correctly notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>The distinction which was meaningless in <em>Youngblood, </em>who \u201clevied\u201d the tax, has now become the foundation for determining whether approval of the local electorate is necessary before the tax may be collected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The Headlee Amendment makes the crucial inquiry, for purposes of analyzing tax limitations, the entity responsible for levying the tax. The claim that the recipient of the tax proceeds, rather than the entity levying the tax, determines whether the tax is state or local is refuted by the structure of the amendment and the structure of its purpose. Thus, accepting plaintiffs argument that the end-user recipient of tax proceeds determines whether a tax is state or local would have the negative effect of allowing the Legislature to classify taxes it appropriates to local units of government as local taxes and circumventing the state taxing cap, something the state is plainly precluded from doing under Headlee.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We hold that the airport parking tax is a state tax authorized by state law, administered, collected, and distributed by the state. The Wayne County regional airport benefits the entire population of this state. Though the tax is currently allocated to Wayne County and Romulus, the language of the statute does not limit payments solely to these localities. The tax is not a local tax levied under the Headlee Amendment and, thus, is not subject to a vote by a majority of the electors of either of these local governments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We affirm the Court of Appeals conclusion that the airport parking tax is a state tax.</p>\n<judges id=\"b635-4\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\"> The Headlee Amendment is the popular name for Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 25-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b619-9\"> An earlier dispute between the plaintiff and the Department of Treasury was the catalyst for the present case. Plaintiff was assessed penalties and interest by the Department of Revenue for several late payments of the airport tax, which had been due but not timely paid in January and February, 1988, and April, May, and June, 1989. Plaintiff disputed the charges and filed a petition with the Michigan Tax Tribunal on November 8, 1989, for redetermination of the delinquent payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">The Department of Treasury responded to the petition with a motion for summary disposition. On March 30, 1990, the Tax Tribunal granted the motion, finding that plaintiff failed to appeal the final determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>tax assessment in a timely manner. Plaintiff appealed, and the Court of Appeals upheld the Tax Tribunal decision, <em>Airlines Parking, Inc v Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 21, 1992 (Docket No. 129276), affirming the holding and noting that plaintiff did not take advantage of the two distinct opportunities available for administrative review under the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\"> Any taxpayer of the state shall have standing to bring suit in the Michigan State Court of Appeals to enforce the provisions of Sections 25 through 31, inclusive of this Article and, if the suit is sustained, shall receive from the applicable unit of government his costs incurred in maintaining such suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\"> Unpublished order, entered December 15, 1994 (Docket No. 167321).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\"> \u201c \u2018Transaction\u2019 means the parking, storing, housing, or keeping of a motor vehicle for consideration.\u201d MCL 207.372(f); MSA 7.559(102)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\"> \u201cAirport parking facility\u201d means an area, space, garage, parking structure, or other facility upon or in which motor vehicles are parked, stored, or housed for a consideration and that is located within the boundaries or within 5 miles of the boundaries of a regional airport facility.

Additionally, <em>Avis </em>is distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Avis, </em>1953 PA 189 provided for a tax on leased property as if it were real property. The statute included an exemption from the tax if the leased real property was used in connection with an airport concession. The issue in <em>Avis </em>concerned a legislative amendment of the earlier statute, requested by the City of Romulus, to exclude from the tax exemption aiiport concessions in counties of over 1,000,000 population. <em>Id. </em>at 343. The Court held that the population classification did not bear a reasonable relationship to the purpose of the statute, quoting with approval the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthere is no correlation between the counly in which an airport is located and the traffic which passes through the airport.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 348. The amendment, in effect, allowed a local government to impose a selective local tax where the state had granted a state-wide legislative exemption from the tax. Unlike the tax in <em>Avis, </em>the aiiport parking tax is a state-imposed tax, applies to all qualified counties, classifies by volume of airport traffic, and does not allow selective application by local units of government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\"> Section 31 further explains the taxing formula for local governmental units:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">If the definition of the base of an existing tax is broadened, the m\u00e1ximum authorized rate of taxation on the new base in each unit of Local Government shall be reduced to yield the same estimated gross revenue as on the prior base.

In addition to the question at issue in this case, there are other limitations on local taxes that do not arise if a tax is a state tax rather than local tax. Other questions of constitutional interpretation that have arisen in the context of the application of \u00a7 31 to local tax levies are not before the Court, and we make no determination regarding them other than to observe that, because the Headlee Amendment imposes additional controls, in effect building on an existing system of previously determined tax levels, the point of origin of the tax is central to its scheme. See <em>Bailey v Muskegon Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>122 Mich App 808; 333 NW2d 144 (1983), <em>Fahnenstiel v Saginaw, </em>142 Mich App 46; 368 NW2d 893 (1985), <em>Smith v Scio Twp, </em>173 Mich App 381; 433 NW2d 855 (1988), and <em>Saginaw Co v Buena Vista School Dist, </em>196 Mich App 363; 493 NW2d 437 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b625-4\"> Art 9, \u00a7 3 allows \u201c[t]he legislature [to] provide for alternative means of taxation of designated real and tangible personal property in lieu of general ad valorem taxation ....

The issue is whether the Legislature may impose a tax on a specific activity in a specific location in order to generate revenue to assist financially the specific county and the specific municipality in which that activity occurs. In this case, I would hold that it may not. I dissent because I fail to see how the Legislature\u2019s purpose in relieving financially distressed Wayne County is reasonably related to imposing an excise tax on airport parking at private lots located solely in the Detroit Metropolitan Airport area. Accordingly, I would hold that the Airport Parking Tax Act, MCL 207.371 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.559(101) <em>et seq., </em>is unconstitutional under the Headlee Amendment, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 31,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it was levied without local voter approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Generally, there are two means of interpreting a constitutional limitation on the government\u2019s authority to impose taxes. The first would be to determine whether the statute violates the literal language of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 31, which proscribes units of local government from levying or increasing taxes without voter approval. Under this approach, the airport parking tax arguably could be upheld under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 31, because it was imposed by the Legislature and not by a unit of local government. The majority seems to reject this approach by stating that \u201cthe entity imposing the tax in question may not conclusively resolve the Headlee question.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 534. If the majority is in fact rejecting this approach, then I agree with it because this Court has long looked beyond literal constitutional language. See, e.g., <em>Lockwood v Comm\u2019r of Revenue, </em>357 Mich 517; 98 NW2d 753 (1959) (a legislatively imposed tax that was styled as a use tax was held to be unconstitutional as an improper sales tax).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Indeed, the proper approach is to look beyond form to substance and to determine whether the practical function of the tax violates the intent of the constitutional provision. <em>Lockwood </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-5\">There is no middle ground. Either we construe the constitutional limitation literally or we construe it to accomplish its manifest objective and intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">Which is to be our choice?

See anno: <em>Validity of statutory classifications based on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number><em>population </em>\u2014 Tax <em>statutes, </em>98 ALR3d 1083.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Headlee Amendment shares a common theme with other constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In <em>Durant v State Bd of Ed, </em>424 Mich 364, 383; 381 NW2d 662 (1985), this Court described the purpose of the Headlee Amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">[The voters] were striving to gain more control over their own level of taxing and over the expenditures of the state. It is evident that while the voters were concerned about the general level of state taxation, they were also concerned with ensuring control of local funding and taxation by the people most affected, the local taxpayers. The Headlee Amendment is the voters\u2019 effort to link funding, taxes, and control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The goal of local control underlying the Headlee Amendment parallels the people\u2019s intent underlying Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">The legislature shall pass no local or special act in any case where a general act can be made applicable, and whether a general act can be made applicable shall be a judicial question.

The practice was bad in two very important particulars. In the first place, much of the legislation thus enacted constituted a direct and unwarranted interference in purely local affairs and an invasion of the principles of local self-government. In the second place, such legislation affecting as it did certain limited localities in the State, the senators and representatives from unaffected districts were usually complaisant, and agreed to its enactment without the exercise of that intelligence and judgment which all legislation is entitled to receive from all the members of the legislature. This course led to many abuses (principally in amendments to city charters), some of which found their way into the courts, and were there redressed so far as the Constitution then in force would permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201cWith these evils in mind, the Constitution of 1909 [sic] was formulated and adopted by the people. From a reading of the provisions above quoted and others of a similar character, it is, we think, entirely clear that it was the settled purpose of the framers of the new instrument and of the people who adopted it to forever insure to the people the right to control their affairs purely local, and to secure for all general legislation grave attention and the application of the collective wisdom of the legislators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Given the analogous purposes underlying the Headlee Amendment and Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29, I believe we should approach the instant case in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>same manner that this Court has approached a Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29 challenge. Under that provision, the challenge has been that a facially neutral statute, which in practicality only applied to Wayne County or Detroit, was really an unconstitutional local act. The test this Court has used was summarized in <em>Dearborn v Wayne Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>275 Mich 151, 155-156; 266 NW 304 (1936):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">The legislature has enacted a number of laws upon a population basis and without referendum requirement, which, <em>in prcesenti, </em>could apply only to the county of Wayne or the city of Detroit. Some of them have been before this court. The principles upon which they have been sustained as general laws or defeated as local acts are well established in this State and elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">The first test to be applied is whether population has a reasonable relation to the purpose of the statute. In <em>Mulloy v Wayne Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>246 Mich 632, 635 [225 NW 615 (1929)], the distinction is pointed out:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201cClearly, because of its provision as to population, the act applies to Wayne county only. If it is a reasonable and logical basis of classification, considering the subject of legislation, unquestionably a specified population may be made the test of the applicability of a general legislative act; and under such conditions the act will not be construed to be invalid as local legislation. But where the subject of legislation is such that population has no obvious relation to the purpose sought to be accomplished, an attempt to make the application of the legislative act dependent on population is unwarranted and amounts to local legislation. <em>Attorney General ex rel Dingeman v Lacy, </em>180 Mich 329.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">The second test of a general law, based upon population, is that it shall apply to all other municipalities if and when they attain the statutory population. It must have \u2014 \u201can open end through which cities are automatically brought within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>its operation when they attain the required population.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">This Court reaffirmed the <em>Dingeman v Lacy </em>test in <em>Avis Rent-A-Car System, Inc v City of Romulus, </em>400 Mich 337; 254 NW2d 555 (1977), a case factually similar to the instant case. There, the Avis and Hertz rental car companies had received grants of concessions at Detroit Metropolitan Airport pursuant to MCL 259.133; MSA 10.233. They also had leased land from the airport and had built service buildings. 1953 PA 189 related to taxing lessees of what would otherwise be tax-exempt property (owned by the airport). The act provided an exception for concessions at public airports that were available for general public usage. Romulus tried to tax Avis and Hertz for their use of the land at the airport, but lost in suits brought by the companies. Romulus then sought the assistance of the Legislature, which passed 1970 PA 174, limiting the exception to concessions at airports \u201conly in \u2018counties of over 1,000,000.\u2019 \u201d <em>Avis, </em>400 Mich 343, quoting 1970 PA 174. The Court restated the longstanding rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">[A] population classification \u201cmust have a reasonable relation to the subject matter of the legislation, and must furnish some fairly apparent reason for legislation differing from that applicable to other municipalities having a substantial difference in population.\u201d A population classification \u201ccan never be sustained where it is, as in the case at bar, a manifest subterfuge.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 345.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The <em>Avis </em>Court held that the 1,000,000 population limitation was unconstitutional. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-7\">1970 PA 174 limits the application of the tax exemption granted by 1953 PA 189 by requiring the concessionaire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>meet \u201cbasic tests.\u201d This is appropriate. However, the legislation has a discriminatory thrust. It is applicable only to airports and only to airports in counties with more than 1,000,000. We require that a reasonable relationship between those qualifications and the limiting of a tax exemption be demonstrated. It has not been demonstrated in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">The legislative purpose in 1970 PA 174 was to withdraw a tax exemption from concessions at airports located in counties over 1,000,000 people (only Wayne County). The legislative conclusion must have been that these airports will attract concessions without the lure of a tax exemption. The attraction, however, is not a function of county population. It depends on the volume of traffic flowing through the aiiport. Under this legislation, the exemption is withdrawn not only from concessions at Metro but also could apply to the other two Wayne County airports\u2014 Detroit City and Grosse He Municipal Airport. It is difficult to \u201creconcile the legislative intent . . . with the legislative scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">The trial court in <em>Hertz </em>noted that the defendants had supplied \u201cfigures on enplanement and deplanements which show that the overwhelming majority of Michigan\u2019s passenger air traffic taires place at Metropolitan Airport.\u201d Defendants said this was because Metro \u201cis in the state\u2019s most populous county.\u201d The court said that the aiiport traffic was not related to or dependent on Wayne County\u2019s population. The trial court in <em>Avis </em>said \u201cthere is no correlation between the county in which an airport is located and the traffic which passes through the airport.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">We do not see a reasonable relationship between the withdrawing of a tax exemption from aiiport concessions and the size of the county where the aiiport is located. We believe the legislation is a local act in an area where a general act could be made applicable. <em>[Id. </em>at 347-348.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The reasonable-relationship test has long been used by many state courts with respect to determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>whether a statute with a population classification was really a local act or local tax.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such statutes have been sustained where the court found a rational reason for not extending the statute to less populated municipalities. <em>Alexander v Chicago, </em>14 Ill 2d 261, 268; 151 NE2d 319 (1958) (population density was found to be rationally related to park maintenance and services); <em>Hassler v Engberg, </em>233 Minn 487, 513-514; 48 NW2d 343 (1951) (population density and proximity of buildings may affect fire risks). In contrast, similar statutes have been struck down where the court did not find such a reason. <em>Sivort Co v State, </em>136 Fla 179, 184; 186 So 671 (1939) (\u201cthe basis for the attempted classification finds no reasonable justification in connection with the subject matter of the Act\u201d). <em>Koons v Atlantic City Bd of Comm\u2019rs, </em>134 NJL 329, 332-333; 47 A2d 589 (1946), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-4\">[T]he law-making authority may subdivide the common-law municipalities into subordinate classes; and the validity of such legislative classification depends upon the existence of distinguishing qualities and attributes related to the subject matter of the legislation. The characteristic constituting the basis of the classification must be reasonably appropriate to the object of the law. Unless it rests upon distinctions that are substantial and not merely illusory, the classification is wanting in the virtue of constitutional generality. The test is whether the statutory class has a logical and reasonable basis, free from artificiality and arbitrariness, embracing all and omitting none naturally falling into that category. Is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the legislation of such a character as that it is equally appropriate to all forming the statutory class, and is that class embracive of all in like situation and circumstances, and therefore natural members of the class? If, viewed in the light of the legislative design, the necessity and propriety of the classification reasonably appears, it is not within the constitutional interdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><em>Green v Arlington Co Bd, </em>193 Va 284, 287-288; 68 SE2d 516 (1952), echoed a similar test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\">The test of reasonableness of classification is said to be whether it embraces all of the classes to which it relates. The basis of the classification involved must have a direct relation to the purpose of the law, and must present a distinction which renders one class, in truth, distinct or different from another class. . . . Laws may be said to apply to a class only, and that class may be in point of fact a small one, provided the classification itself be a reasonable and not an arbitrary one, and the law be made to apply to all of the persons belonging to the class without distinction. [Citation and internal quotations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">These cases would support a two-pronged test for determining whether the instant enplanement classification is a cloaked local tax: (1) the classification must be open-ended so that other counties, municipalities, and airports, in a situation similar to that which is the aim of the statute, fall within the class, and (2) the classification itself must bear a reasonable relationship to the puipose of the statute. I turn first to the relationship between the Legislature\u2019s purpose in enacting the Airport Parking Tax Act and the number of passengers enplaning at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The airport parking tax was part of a package of bills aimed at addressing Wayne County\u2019s financial situation, <em>at Wayne County\u2019s request. </em>House Legislative Analysis, HB 5164, 5166, 5168, 5170, 5171, 5198-5200 (January 22, 1988). The problem that the Legislature was seeking to address was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">Wayne County is seeking the state\u2019s help with its massive budget problems. County officials, faced with the possibility of bankruptcy, are threatening drastic cuts and layoffs in essential services, such as law enforcement, health care, libraries, and parks. The county is contemplating closing a floor of the county jail and cutting the prosecutor\u2019s staff, moves that would frustrate anti-drug trafficking efforts just underway. According to House Taxation Committee staff reports, Wayne County owes the state $49 million from a debt settlement agreement in 1984 and some $60 million accumulated since then. A $15 million shortfall is expected in the 1988 resident county hospitalization (rch) budget. Another $52-72 million is owed to non-state sources (e.g., tax anticipation notes issued to meet payroll). The county\u2019s budget has a recurring $10 million operating deficit. The causes of the problems are manifold and complex, but there is little doubt that the cost of providing health care to indigents is a major contributor to the county\u2019s fiscal woes. The rch program was expected to cost $32 million this year (slightly over $19 million to be paid by the state), but instead will cost about $50 million! (Wayne County officials say the second largest rch program, in Oakland County, cost $2.5 million.) Alone among Michigan\u2019s counties, Wayne County is required to run an open-ended indigent health care program where demand determines costs. While the county needs long-term budget reforms, including a way to control health care costs, and new sources of revenue with growth potential, it also needs immediate relief from its overwhelming difficulties. <em>[Id. </em>at 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The legislative history reveals that the revenue from the airport parking tax was generated to help Wayne County avoid financial disaster. I would fully agree that the state has a vital interest in Wayne County\u2019s financial stability. But, \u201c[a] laudable purpose does not validate unconstitutional means.\u201d <em>Dearborn, </em>275 Mich 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">I find that none of the described problems that the Legislature sought to address are related to Detroit Metropolitan Airport parking. Indigent health care costs, which are a function of the number of indigent residents, are <em>wholly unconnected </em>to the volume of passengers enplaning at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, just as the volume of concessions at an airport is unrelated to the population of the county in which the airport sits. <em>Avis, </em>400 Mich 348. I do not believe that the majority can genuinely say that this airport parking tax serves a state purpose related to serving a major airport.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Further, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">(1) Beginning January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1988, on the first day of each month, the state treasurer shall make a distribution from the fund to each qualified county in an amount equal to the total amount on deposit in the fund multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is <em>the population of that qualified county </em>during the immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ately preceding year and the denominator of which is <em>the total population of all qualified counties </em>during the immediately preceding year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-4\">(2) Beginning January 1, 1989, on the first day of each month, the state treasurer shall make a distribution from the fund to each city within which a regional airport facility is wholly located in an amount equal to 20% of the total amount on deposit in the fund minus the amount of revenue generated from any airport parking facility located within the boundaries of the regional airport facility divided by the total number of cities within which a regional airport facility is wholly located. Any surplus funds remaining after the distribution <em>shall be distributed in accordance with (1) above. </em>After the distribution is made under subsection (1), on the first day of each month, the state treasurer shall make a distribution from the fund to each qualified county in an amount equal to the total amount on deposit in the fund after the distribution under subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">(3) A distribution made under subsection (1) or (2) shall be deposited in <em>the general fund </em>of the city or qualified county.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">(4) The distribution provided by subsection (2) shall not be made if all taxing units are authorized by law to impose taxes and the collection is made of taxes imposed under Act No. 189 of the Public Acts of 1953, being sections 211.181 to 211.182 of the Michigan Compiled Laws, on concessions at a regional airport facility. [MCL 207.377; MSA 7.559(107) (emphasis added).]1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The money is in no way earmarked for maintaining the airport that produced the parking that is the subject of the tax. Instead, it is distributed to Wayne County\u2019s and Romulus\u2019 general funds. Moreover, assuming arguendo that another county or city could ever qualify under the statute, the amount that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>be distributed would be a function of <em>the population </em>of the county \u2014 not the number <em>of enplanements. </em>Similarly, the amount distributed to qualified cities would be a function of both <em>the number </em>of cities and of their populations \u2014 again, not the number of enplanements.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In any event, by design, the Legislature intentionally drafted the airport parking tax statute to apply only to parking in the Detroit Metropolitan area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet, even if the majority was correct that Wayne County\u2019s financial distress was related to serving its airports,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> there is no apparent reason for excluding from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>taxed class the private parking facilities at airports in Wayne County other than Detroit Metropolitan Airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">In contrast to the majority\u2019s analysis, <em>Lockwood </em>would have us apply an \u201cacid test\u201d to the airport parking tax:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-5\">When we put these taxing acts, as we must, to the acid test of examination in terms of their \u201cpractical operation,\u201d when we, again as is our duty, \u201clook through forms and behind labels to substance,\u201d what do we find? <em>[Id. </em>at 558.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">I find the following. The Legislature wanted to provide Wayne County with financial assistance, <em>at Wayne County\u2019s request. </em>However, to do so directly would require two-thirds approval by both houses of the Legislature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the pre-Headlee Amendment constitution, the Legislature could not levy a local tax without two-thirds approval of both houses. Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29. Under the Headlee Amendment, Wayne County itself could not have imposed a local tax without direct voter approval. Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 31. Therefore, in an attempt to circumvent the requirements of local voter approval and two-thirds approval of both houses, the Legislature drafted a tax classification scheme based on enplanements. Applying the acid test of examination to this tax, I would find a manifest subterfuge by which the Legislature sought to raise money for a local purpose. Moreover, the means chosen are not rationally related to the budgetary problems faced by Wayne County. Further, even if there were a rational connection, the enplane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>ment classification has excluded private parking at other airports that would seem to naturally fall within the burden of a county and city providing services to airports. As such, I find that the classification itself is arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Absent a reasonable relation between the purpose of the tax and the classification employed for imposing the tax, the tax cannot be held to have a constitutional state purpose. By upholding this tax, the majority has created a loophole, that is, an opening through which the intent of the drafters of the constitution and of the people adopting the Headlee Amendment in protecting local control over local concerns can be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">I would hold that this tax is unconstitutional in violation of the Headlee Amendment\u2019s purpose of ensuring local taxpayer control over local taxes. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-9\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> Units of Local Government are hereby prohibited from levying any tax not authorized by law or charter when this section is ratified . . . without the approval of a majority of the qualified electors of that unit of Local Government voting thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> The aiiport parking tax statute applies to private parking within five miles of \u201can airport that services 4,000,000 or more enplanements annually.\u201d MCL 207.372(h); MSA 7.559(102)(h). I believe this enplanement classification functions much like a population classification, which is a device often used by state legislatures. However, it has long been recognized that population classifications can be used \u201cas a mere cloak for local laws . . . .\u201d <em>Birmingham Electric Co v Harry, </em>215 Ala 458, 458; 111 So 41 (1926).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\"> In those cases involving the issue of whether a population classification contained in a tax statute renders such a statute invalid, the courts have discussed a variety of different grounds of attack upon such a statute. One frequent argument as to the validity of such statutes has concerned state constitutional provisions prohibiting local or special laws, either altogether or in certain cases only and subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. Generally, it appears well settled that a statute under which counties or municipalities are classified on the basis of population does not fall within a constitutional inhibition against local or special laws, where the classification has reasonable relation to the purposes and objects of the legislation. <em>[Id. </em>at 1087.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b643-5\"> See, e.g., <em>Miller v El Paso Co, </em>136 Tex 370, 375; 150 SW2d 1000 (1941):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">Resort to population brackets for the purpose of classifying subjects for legislation is permissible where the spread of population is broad enough to include or segregate a substantial class, and where the population bears some real relation to the subject of legislation and affords a fair basis for the classification.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b646-9\"> To further underscore that the airport parking tax is not a function of maintaining an airport, I note that the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">The distribution received by a qualified county under this act <em>does not constitute revenue from the use or operation of the airport </em>located within that county and is not subject to any pledge of, lien upon, or use restriction of revenue received or derived by that county from the use or operation of that airport.

The revenue would go to a special state fund and be distributed monthly. During 1988, the distributions would go entirely to Wayne County. As of 1989, 20 percent would go to the city in which the airport is located (Romulus) and the remainder to the county. A county could assign or pledge some or all of its portion to pay off obligations under the Fiscal Stabilization Act or Shared Credit Rating Act. The distribution to the city would not be made if the city is collecting taxes on airport concessions under Public Act 189 of 1953.

If that were true, then I would agree that an airport parking tax would have a valid state purpose because the state has a strong interest in maintaining airports.
