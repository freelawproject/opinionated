Substantial compliance requires the court to discuss with the defendant the waiver of counsel requirements set forth in both <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule, and to find that the defendant fully understands, recognizes, and agrees to abide by these procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">We hold that the trial courts in both <em>People v Adkins </em>and <em>People v Suggs </em>substantially complied with the waiver of counsel procedures provided by this Court. The records support the trial courts\u2019 findings that both defendants effectively waived their right to counsel. Therefore, the judicial grants of the defendants\u2019 requests to proceed in propria persona were proper. We reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals granting the defendants new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"AUv\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\">\n<em>PEOPLE v ADKINS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">In a May 1991 jury trial before Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court Judge Michael J. Callahan, defendant Kenneth Ray Adkins was convicted of five counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520d; MSA 28.788(4), and one count of unarmed robbery, MCL 750.530; MSA 28.798.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On April 29, 1991, two days before the scheduled trial, retained counsel Marcus Ellis told the court that Mr. Adkins did not want him to continue to represent him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecutor requested a hearing regarding the reasons for Mr. Adkins\u2019 dissatisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Mr. Adkins testified that he did not like what Mr. Ellis had done about the case and that Mr. Ellis was not \u201con [his] side.\u201d He said that he had been dissatisfied since the preliminary examination and had explained his dissatisfaction to his family, who already had spent \u201cseveral hundred dollars\u201d on the case. Despite his alleged dissatisfaction, Mr. Adkins had not apprised the court of his feelings about Mr. Ellis until that morning. When pressed by the court, he was unable to refer to any specific problems with Mr. Ellis. Rather, he said that he did not like the way he saw Mr. Ellis in court and did not value his judgment. Mr. Adkins said to the court: \u201cI just prefer to either[,] I ask questions, appoint me a lawyer, or I will do this on, attempt this on my own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Mr. Ellis believed that the breakdown in the attorney-client relationship was apparent. However, the court believed that Mr. Adkins was being dilatory. Mr. Ellis asked the court to appoint another attorney, even though he would remain in the courtroom, so that Mr. Adkins would have \u201cthe benefit of talking to a lawyer that he [could] trust.\u201d Mr. Ellis did not move to withdraw from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Mr. Adkins told the court: \u201cIf you will just have an attorney probably come see me for twenty minutes, until today or tomorrow, I will be ready with an attorney to represent myself with another attorney or ask him to take in whenever he can do anything. I would rather not take any advice from Mr. Ellis.\u201d The court declined Mr. Adkins\u2019 request for an appointed attorney and said that he could represent himself or have Mr. Ellis represent him. The court ordered Mr. Ellis to remain in the courtroom during the trial, which was to begin on May 1, 1991, either as counsel for Mr. Adkins or as standby counsel if Mr. Adkins chose to proceed in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">On the morning of May 1, 1991, before jury voir dire, Mr. Adkins decided to represent himself. At this point, the judge proceeded to comply with the initial waiver of counsel procedures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Adkins, we were in court two days ago and you indicated to me that you wished to discharge Mr. Ellis as your attorney, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-8\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-9\"><em>The Court: </em>And that you wished to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-10\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-11\"><em>The Court: </em>You indicated also that you wanted me to appoint an attorney for you and that you would rely on the services of an appointed attorney, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes, I did say that, but I think I will go on my own.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\"><em>The Court: </em>So it is your desire to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-6\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Sir, how old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Twenty-four.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you read and write the English language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\"><em>The Court: </em>How far did you go in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>10th Grade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you have any other formal education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-14\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-15\"><em>The Court: </em>Sir, do you know, or has your IQ ever been tested? Do you know what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-16\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-17\"><em>The Court: </em>Before you got into this difficulty with the law, did you have a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-18\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-19\"><em>The Court: </em>What were you doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-20\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Partime [sic] making car parts for a company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-21\"><em>The Court: </em>How long had you held that job, Mr. Adkins?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-22\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>I only worked there a short period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-23\"><em>The Court: </em>Before that what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-24\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>I did odd jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-25\"><em>The Court: </em>Now, sir, is it my understanding that you are voluntarily deciding to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-26\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-27\"><em>The Court: </em>And you feel that you know what you are doing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-28\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-29\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. You understand that even if you dislike Mr. Ellis, or can\u2019t stand him, or whatever your feelings are, he is here, that he is seated no more than six feet away from you and that you can ask him any question that you want during the course of this trial, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Even if you choose to ask him nothing, you understand he is here and he is available to advise you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\"><em>The Court: </em>You understand, sir, that there is always a hazard in representing yourself, and that is you are not schooled in the Rules of Evidence and the like, but you still must abide by my rulings, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\"><em>The Court: </em>You understand there is what we call courtroom decorum where people don\u2019t interrupt one another unless there is an objection to be made, and you can\u2019t talk over someone else, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-11\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-12\"><em>The Court: </em>You understand if you wish to make an objection, you just simply say objection and everything stops until we hear from you, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-13\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\"><em>The Court: </em>You understand during the course of the whole trial, however long it takes, except for making objections, you can\u2019t interrupt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-16\"><em>The Court: </em>And that if you speak out of turn, there are ways by which you can be disciplined for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-17\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-18\"><em>The Court: </em>And, sir, it is your intention to proceed with this, not in any sense to try to embarrass anyone or yourself, but just to proceed to have the Jury determine by way of verdict what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-19\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Say that again for me, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-20\"><em>The Court: </em>Sure. You are going to go through this as if it were from beginning to end, you are going to be a gentleman about this and let the Jury decide what happened out there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-21\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-22\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Cunningham, do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-23\"><em>Mr. Cunningham: </em>Yes. Could the Court please inquire whether this is the first contact the defendant ever had with the criminal justice system, or, if in fact, he has had prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>contact with the police and the Court, perhaps gained some experience with the prior contact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\"><em>The Court: </em>That is unfair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>This is the second time I have had trial, but the first one was a juvenile, the Judge, they first made a felony out of it. This is the first jury trial I have seen.1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Who in this case had hired Mr. Ellis to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-9\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>My family and I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Now anytime since October 17th through March 28, 1991, did you ever tell any Judge that you were dissatisfied with the services of your attorney?1<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-11\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>No, I didn\u2019t. If I did, I surely would like to see you prove it to me. That\u2019s right. At that time you said, you asked me, I don\u2019t recall your ever asking me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-12\"><em>The Court: </em>I am asking a different question now. I am asking you, did you ever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number><em>Defendant </em>Adkins: No, I didn\u2019t. I told him that I had problems right then. I was hoping he would change.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">After questioning Mr. Adkins about his decision to proceed in propria persona, the judge analyzed the defendant\u2019s response under <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay. Well, we are proceeding to trial today. I rely on <em>People versus </em>Anderson, 398 MichAp [sic] 401 from the Michigan Supreme Court. The indication is that [a] trial judge can in some circumstances allow a person to proceed on their own. Mr. Adkins has indicated to me unequivocally that he wishes to represent himself. An earlier request he had made to me asking for alternative indigent counsel be appointed for him. He is [sic] withdrawn that. He knows what he is asking. He is doing it voluntarily and intentionally, I so find. And he understands the hazards, the disadvantages of representing himself. He agreed in open court that he will be gentlemanly in conduct in his defense, that he will not burden or inconvenience this Court with the administration of the Court business. I find that he could read and write the English language and that he is going to have his desire granted and that is that he will be permitted to represent himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The court concluded by asking the defendant if he was prepared to hire a new lawyer. Mr. Adkins said he was not. The judge then granted the defendant\u2019s motion to proceed in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">For the first two days of trial, Mr. Adkins represented himself. On the third day, retained attorney Markus Simon appeared on behalf of Mr. Adkins and requested a one- or two-day adjournment so that he could familiarize himself with the case. Mr. Simon explained that he had only been retained the previous afternoon and was not prepared to proceed. He also informed the court that Mr. Adkins was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>read or write as evidenced by Mr. Adkins\u2019 trial notes, which neither he nor Mr. Adkins could read.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\">The judge denied Mr. Simon\u2019s request, stating that he felt it was not made in good faith, noting the undesirable effects of a delay. The judge recognized that victims now have a right to a speedy trial of their alleged attacker and that because the trial was already in progress, a delay because of an adjournment was unwarranted. Later that day, Mr. Simon again entered his appearance as Mr. Adkins\u2019 attorney. The court said it would allow him to represent Mr. Adkins as long as he was ready to go forward immediately. The court also ordered Mr. Ellis to remain in the courtroom for consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The jury found Mr. Adkins guilty of five counts of third-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of unarmed robbery. On May 21, 1991, the court sentenced Mr. Adkins to six ten- to fifteen-year prison terms. Mr. Adkins was represented by Mr. Simon at the sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Mr. Adkins appealed of right, and, on December 21, 1993, the Court of Appeals affirmed his convictions in an unpublished opinion per curiam (Docket No. 143693). Mr. Adkins applied for leave to appeal to this Court. In lieu of granting leave to appeal, this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of <em>People v Dennany, </em>445 Mich 412; 519 NW2d 128 (1994). 447 Mich 1007 (1994). On remand, on February 15, 1995, the Court of Appeals reversed the convictions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>There was no consensus among the justices in <em>Dennany </em>with regard to the consequences of failure to fully follow the court rule and <em>Anderson. </em>However, the main concern expressed in both <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Dennany </em>was that the trial court ensure that the defendant was making a decision to act as his own counsel with his eyes open. The trial court in this case completely failed in that regard. [Unpublished opinion per curiam (Docket No. 180218).][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">On October 18, 1995, this Court granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal. 450 Mich 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\"><em>PEOPLE </em>v <em>SUOGS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">On November 13, 1985, defendant Ronny Suggs was convicted of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b; MSA 28.788(2), following a jury trial before Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court Judge Thomas E. Jackson. On December 2, 1985, the court sentenced defendant to three concurrent terms of thirty to fifty years. In an opinion per curiam, issued October 26, 1988 (Docket No. 90946), the Court of Appeals reversed Mr. Suggs\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Following the reversal of his first conviction,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Suggs was returned to Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court, and, on February 10, 1989, Craig Daly was appointed to represent him during retrial. Three weeks later, on March 3, 1989, at a pretrial conference, a hearing on a motion for reduction of bond was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">On March 17, 1989, Mr. Daly asked to be removed as counsel for Mr. Suggs in view of a letter that Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Suggs had sent to him and the court, indicating that he did not want Mr. Daly to represent him and that he wanted to represent himself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Without further inquiry into the nature of Mr. Suggs\u2019 dissatisfaction with Mr. Daly, and without further inquiry into Mr. Daly\u2019s desire to terminate his representation, the court granted Mr. Daly\u2019s request. The judge did not ask Mr. Suggs about the validity of the letter, nor did he question Mr. Suggs\u2019 desire to proceed in propria persona at this time.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Immediately before trial began on June 19, 1989, the court questioned Mr. Suggs about his decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>proceed pro se.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This was the defendant\u2019s initial attempt at waiving his right to counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\"><em>The Court: </em>Understanding, Mr. Moore, that Mr. Suggs wishes to represent himself and proceed in pro per?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\"><em>Mr Moore: </em>That is my understanding. I present Mr. Suggs to answer that specifically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Suggs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, this is how the deal is. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">After a brief sidetrack, the judge explained to the defendant the rules of self-representation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Let me say there are some rules to play by when you, the same as yourself or anyone acting as a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-10\">First of all, you are not allowed anymore than what the lawyer is allowed. You don\u2019t get any kind of special privileges when you represent yourself. Part of that, you don\u2019t interrupt the Court when the Court is speaking. I will give you a chance to make your statement and what you have to say. When I respond to them, you sit and be quiet and don\u2019t interrupt me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\">More than that, I hope you discuss the issues regarding the rules of evidence and matters of procedure with Mr. Moore to get some guidelines on how to present those and I think we all can save some time on this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">After another sidetrack from the waiver of counsel issue, the judge continued to explain to the defendant his rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number><em>The Court: </em>Let\u2019s proceed with this first and then try to get some of the things straightened out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-3\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-4\"><em>The Court: </em>Now, you do have the U S Supreme Court by way of the Sixth Amendment that says in the case of <em>[Faretta] </em>v <em>California </em>here, found at [422 US] 806[; 95 S Ct 2525; 45 L Ed 2d 562], a 1975 decision, there is an explicit guarantee for one to represent oneself. It is also found in the Michigan Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-5\">Now there is, and I think there should be some things you should understand, okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-6\">Do you fully understand you have a right to a have a lawyer represent you throughout the proceedings and if you cannot afford to retain counsel, that the Court will appoint counsel for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\"><em>The Defendant: </em>You asked did I understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\"><em>The Court: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-10\"><em>The Court: </em>Now, do you further understand that I must make a determination throughout what would disrupt and inconvenience and unduly burden the Court and the Court\u2019s business, I realize it is that of judgment call and it depends on you conducting yourself in the proper manner. I realize you are not trained in the law and won\u2019t be able to represent yourself the same as a lawyer would represent you. There are some procedure rules and you have to follow the rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-12\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you further understand there is an inherent danger in you representing yourself. Those include not asking proper questions. It may include not being able to make a proper statement or misstatement about the manner in which you represent yourself or cross-examine a witness. There may be a lot of inherent possibilities there in representing yourself. Do you understand that those things do exist and that you will not be able to raise issues, you know, later on that were matters that might have been better handled by an attorney representing you, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-13\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, I understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number><em>The Court: </em>You still wish to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-6\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-7\">Your Honor, you recall when I dismissed the attorney, Mr. Craig Daily [sic], I sent a letter to the Court besides the letter I sent to Craig Daily explaining to the Court why I was dismissing Craig Daily. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want an attorney to represent me, it\u2019s just that Craig Daily never spoke to me. I had a trial date and never had a chance to talk to my attorney. I couldn\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s unprofessional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Look, I am telling you I do not have a problem with you representing yourself and recognizing the fact that there is case law that says you can. I am also obligated to tell you the problems and pitfalls of that and have you unequivocally indicate on the record you understand those and you do wish to represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>I understand \u2014 I understand what you said, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay, fine. Do you have any other preliminary issues that you want to bring up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-12\"><em>The Defendant: </em>No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">After proceeding in propria persona, Mr. Suggs was again convicted of three counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">After an appeal was submitted, the Court of Appeals entered an order on May 6, 1993 (Docket No. 122775), stating that it could not adequately address the issues without supplemental briefs, addressing the issue whether defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was sufficient under MCR 6.005(E) and the pertinent case law. The panel also directed both parties to file supplemental briefs addressing this issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>On January 27, 1994, the Court of Appeals affirmed Mr. Suggs\u2019 conviction, finding no error requiring reversal in the three issues raised. With reference to its May 6 order, the Court observed: \u201cIn response to this Court\u2019s order, defendant, through counsel, stated he did not wish to pursue that issue, but, rather, wished to stand on the brief as filed.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-3\">The defendant filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court, raising the three original appellate issues and two additional issues, improper waiver of counsel and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. By order dated October 25, 1994, this Court considered the application and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals \u201cfor consideration as on rehearing granted.\u201d 447 Mich 994. On remand and rehearing, the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a third trial because of an improper waiver of counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">On November 21, 1995, this Court granted plaintiff-appellant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, and ordered that this case be argued and submitted to the Court with <em>People v Adkins. </em>450 Mich 920.</p>\n<p id=\"avf-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The United States Supreme Court recognizes self-representation as an implicit constitutional right. \u201cThe right to defend is given directly to the accused; for it is he who suffers the consequences if the defense fails. ... To thrust counsel upon the accused, against his considered wish, thus violates the logic of the [Sixth] Amendment.\u201d <em>Faretta v California, supra </em>at 819-820. Defendants are also explicitly afforded the right to proceed in propria persona by the Michigan Constitution and state statute. Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 13, MCL 763.1; MSA 28.854.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court, however, has found that a defendant has either a right to counsel or a right to proceed in propria persona, but not both.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, there is an unavoidable tension created between two constitutional rights when a defendant chooses self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Proper compliance with the waiver of counsel procedures set forth by this Court is a necessary antece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>dent to a judicial grant of the right to proceed in propria persona. Proper compliance requires that the court engage, on the record, in a methodical assessment of the wisdom of self-representation by the defendant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant must exhibit \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment\u201d of the right to counsel, and the court should \u201c \u2018indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 \u201d of that right. <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-3\">The presumption against waiver is in large part attributable to society\u2019s belief that defendants with legal representation stand a better chance of having a fair trial than people without lawyers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u2019 \u201d <em>People v Dunn, </em>380 Mich 693, 698; 158 NW2d 404 (1968), citing Ca<em>rnley v Cochran, </em>369 US 506, 516; 82 S Ct 884; 8 L Ed 2d 70 (1962). In short, if a judge does not believe the record evidences a proper waiver, the judge should note the reasons for his belief and require counsel to continue to represent the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">After careful review of waiver of counsel case law, this Court extrapolated three main requirements that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>a court must comply with in the waiver of counsel context. <em>People v Anderson, supra </em>at 366-367. First, the defendant\u2019s request must be unequivocal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 367. Second, the defendant must assert his right to self-representation knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. In assuring a knowing and voluntary waiver, the trial court must make the defendant aware of \u201cthe dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368. Third, the court must establish that the defendant will not unduly disrupt the court while acting as his own counsel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">In addition to <em>Anderson, </em>judges must satisfy the requirements of MCR 6.005 with respect to a defendant considering self-representation. The purpose of MCR 6.005, like <em>Anderson, </em>is to inform the defendant of the risks of self-representation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The rule requires the court to offer the assistance of an attorney and to advise the defendant about the possible punishment for the charged offense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Clearly, this Court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sion to incorporate these concepts into a court rule indicates their importance in the waiver process. This Court expects that judges will create a record that establishes the trial court\u2019s compliance with the court rules and <em>Anderson </em>during the initial waiver process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Application of the waiver of counsel procedures is the duty of the court. The trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has made the waiver knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v </em>Berkowitz, 927 F2d 1376, 1383 (CA 7, 1991). Further, the effectiveness of an attempted waiver does not depend on what the court says, but rather, what the defendant understands.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Consequently, other facts, such as evidence of a defendant\u2019s intentional manipulation or delay of the court proceedings as a tactical decision may favor a judicial finding of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>knowing and intelligent waiver. <em>United States v Sandles, </em>23 F3d 1121, 1129 (CA 7, 1994).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Waiver of counsel issues arise most often, and are most difficult for judges, in cases in which a defendant is unhappy with his counsel close to the onset, or during the course of, a trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-7\">Reluctance on the part of many defendants to face the reality on trial day morning that the moment of truth is at hand is a familiar fact of life in the criminal justice system. Experienced trial judges, such as the able judge in this case, are thoroughly familiar and regularly confronted with trial day adjournment requests, advanced for countless reasons and frequently coupled with parallel and conditional requests to discharge counsel and proceed pro se. <em>[Anderson </em>at 375.1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">For judges, dealing with such double-edged requests further complicates the already technical process of the waiver of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">The Court recognizes and sympathizes with the Catch 22 judges face in the waiver of counsel setting.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On the one hand, defendants have a right to counsel. On the other hand, defendants have a right to self-representation. We realize the potential for savvy defendants to use these competing rights as a means of securing an appellate parachute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>\u201cWe believe that the record in this case unmistakenly shows that defendant understood exactly what he was doing and chose to represent himself while fully aware of his alternatives. To permit a defendant in a criminal case to indulge in the charade of insisting on a right to act as his own attorney and then on appeal to use the very permission to defend himself in pro per as a basis for reversal of conviction and a grant of another trial is to make a mockery of the criminal justice system and the constitutional rights sought to be protected. We would not permit it.\u201d <em>[Dennany </em>at 436, quoting <em>People v Morton, </em>175 Mich App 1, 8-9; 437 NW2d 284 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-3\">Consequently, it is the desire of this Court to set forth, through these two cases, the judicial inquiry required before a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">We agree with Justice Boyle\u2019s concurrence in <em>Den-nany </em>that <em>Anderson </em>does not favor a litany approach. See also <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 (1975). We also believe, however, that the substantive requirements in <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule are worthy of attention in every initial waiver of counsel by a criminal defendant. See <em>Dennany. </em>The <em>Anderson </em>and court rule requirements are merely vehicles to ensure that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived counsel with eyes open. See <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Dennany. </em>A particular court\u2019s method of inquiring into and satisfying these concepts is decidedly up to it, as long as the concepts in these requirements are covered.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>We believe the substantial compliance test adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States v McDowell, </em>814 F2d 245 (CA 6, 1987), is an effective way to address the waiver of counsel issue. In <em>McDowell, </em>the court advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-5\">In the future, whenever a federal district judge in this circuit is faced with an accused who wishes to represent himself in criminal proceedings, the model inquiry or one covering the same substantive points along with an express finding that the accused has made a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel, shall be made on the record prior to allowing the accused to represent himself. <em>[Id. </em>at 250.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The test \u201c \u2018requires substantial compliance and not literal adherence to the guidelines in the <em>Bench Book.\u2019 \u201d </em>(1 Bench Book for United States District Court Judges [3d ed].) <em>United States v Miller, </em>910 F2d 1321, 1324 (CA 6, 1990), quoting <em>McDowell </em>at 252 (Engel, J., concurring).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We hold, therefore, that trial courts must substantially comply with the aforementioned substantive requirements set forth in both <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D). Substantial compliance requires that the court discuss the substance of both <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D) in a short colloquy with the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>and make an express finding that the defendant fully understands, recognizes, and agrees to abide by the waiver of counsel procedures. The nonformalistic nature of a substantial compliance rule affords the protection of a strict compliance rule with far less of the problems associated with requiring courts to engage in a word-for-word litany approach. Further, we believe this standard protects the \u201cvital constitutional rights involved while avoiding the unjustified manipulation which can otherwise throw a real but unnecessary burden on the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\">Completion of these judicial procedures allows the court to consider a request to proceed in propria persona. If a judge is uncertain regarding whether any of the waiver procedures are met, he should deny the defendant\u2019s request to proceed in propria persona, noting the reasons for the denial on the record. <em>People v Ratliff, </em>424 Mich 874 (1986). The defendant should then continue to be represented by retained or appointed counsel, unless the judge determines substitute counsel is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">We hold that the trial courts in both <em>People v Adkins </em>and <em>People v Suggs </em>substantially complied with the waiver of counsel procedures set forth by this Court. The records support the trial courts\u2019 findings that both defendants effectively waived their right to counsel. Therefore, the judicial grants of the defendants\u2019 requests to proceed in propria persona were proper. We reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals granting the defendants new trials.</p>\n<p id=\"Azc\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>\n<em>ADKINS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">The record evidences a proper waiver of counsel by the defendant in substantial compliance with the procedures set forth by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The defendant\u2019s initial waiver of counsel occurred on the .first day of trial. On April 29, 1991, the court determined that substitute counsel would not be appointed. The judge did not dismiss Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Ellis did not move to withdraw from the case. Rather, the judge directed both Mr. Ellis and the defendant to be present and ready to proceed on the first day of trial. The court left open the question what capacity Mr. Ellis would play in the trial proceedings.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The judge initiated the waiver of counsel procedures on the first day of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The record establishes Mr. Adkins\u2019 unequivocal waiver of his right to counsel. On the first day of trial, the court began the proceedings by asking Mr. Adkins if he was \u201cpresent in court to represent\u201d himself. The defendant responded in the affirmative. The judge then made reference to the substitution of counsel proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Mr. Adkins, we were in court two days ago and you indicated to me that you wished to discharge Mr. Ellis as your attorney, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-10\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\"><em>The Court: </em>And that you wished to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-12\"><em>Defendant Adkins: </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>The Court: </em>You indicated also that you wanted me to appoint an attorney for you and that you would rely on the services of an appointed attorney, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-3\">\n<em>Defendant Adkins: Yes, I did say that, but I think I will go on my own.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-4\">\n<em>The Court: So it is your desire to represent yourself?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\"><em>Defendant Adkins: Yes, it is. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant clearly and without hesitation acknowledged his desire to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Mr. Adkins\u2019 waiver of counsel was also knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The judge questioned. Mr. Adkins about his education and his previous experiences in other judicial forums. The defendant affirmatively stated that he was voluntarily deciding to represent himself. He also acknowledged that he knew what his waiver signified. The judge indicated to Mr. Adkins that Mr. Ellis would serve as standby counsel.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The judge explained the function and role of standby counsel to Mr. Adkins. The judge expressed the hazards of self-representation to Mr. Adkins, noting that Mr. Adkins was bound by the judge\u2019s rulings despite the defendant\u2019s lack of schooling in the Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The defendant\u2019s behavior is also relevant to our conclusion that he knowingly waived his right to counsel. While evidence of manipulation or delay of the court proceedings does not eliminate the need for other explanations about the hazards of self-representation, it may serve to bolster a trial judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>assessment that a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. See <em>San-dies, supra. </em>The court believed that the defendant was intentionally stalling and manipulating the courtroom proceedings. Mr. Adkins had never expressed to the court any problems with Mr. Ellis\u2019 representation at any of the numerous pretrial proceedings. When he did express his concerns, two days before trial, he did not provide any good reason to support his desire to replace Mr. Ellis. Further, the judge found the defense\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to move the case to another courtroom right before trial evidence of the defendant\u2019s purposeful manipulation and delay of the proceedings. Consequently, we believe the judicial findings and recorded evidence of defendant\u2019s manipulation bolsters the trial judge\u2019s assessment that the defendant\u2019s waiver was made knowingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The judge determined that the defendant would abide by the rules of the courtroom. The judge explained courtroom protocol that Mr. Adkins would be expected to follow. Mr. Adkins agreed to abide by the courtroom protocol explained to him by the judge. The judge told the defendant that Mr. Ellis, as standby counsel, would answer any of his questions concerning the case and trial. The judge asked Mr. Adkins if he was prepared to hire a new lawyer. The defendant said he was not. Finally, the judge made reference to <em>Anderson </em>and noted the reasons he found compliance with each of the <em>Anderson </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We regret the fact that the judge did not make direct reference to the applicable court rule in the waiver context; however, we find that the judge substantially complied with the requirements of MCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>6.005. Under the version of MCR 6.005 in effect during Mr. Adkins\u2019 trial, the judge was required to comply with the court rule before permitting the defendant to waive his right to counsel. The judge indirectly addressed part 1 of the court rule during his <em>Anderson </em>analysis with the defendant. During that discussion, the judge corrected defendant\u2019s statement, \u201cit is a pretty serious case,\u201d with \u201c[i]t is a very serious case.\u201d Furthermore, the judge had already expressed the nature of the charge and possible punishments to the defendant at his arraignment. The fact that the judge did not specifically address the charged offense and the range of possible punishment is not enough to defeat a finding of substantial compliance with the waiver procedures in this case. The trial court also addressed part 2 of the court rule, concerning the right to counsel, when the judge asked the defendant if he was prepared to hire a new lawyer and when the judge asked the defendant if he still wanted a new lawyer appointed to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-3\">In light of this analysis, we believe that the judge substantially complied with the requirements in <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005. We conclude this because the judge conveyed the substance of both <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule to the defendant. Further, the defendant understood these concepts and made the decision to proceed in propria persona, unequivocally and with his eyes open. The grant of a new trial by the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\n<em>SUGGS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The record evidences a proper waiver of counsel by the defendant in substantial compliance with the procedures set forth by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The trial record evidences the defendant\u2019s unequivocal waiver of counsel. When the court asked Mr. Suggs if his intention was to represent himself, Mr. Suggs answered in the affirmative and immediately began to \u201ctry\u201d his case. The court indicated to the defendant that the waiver procedures needed to be finished. The defendant and the court engaged in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-7\"><em>The Court. </em>You still wish to represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\"><em>The Defendant. </em>Yes. Your Honor, you recall when I dismissed the attorney, Mr. Craig Daily, I sent a letter to the Court besides the letter I sent to Craig Daily explaining to the Court why I was dismissing Craig Daily. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want an attorney to represent me, it\u2019s just that Craig Daily never spoke to me. I had a trial date and never had a chance to talk to my attorney. I couldn\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s unprofessional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Look, I am telling you I do not have a problem with you representing yourself and recognizing the fact that there is case law that says you can. I am also obligated to tell you the problems and pitfalls of that and have you unequivocally indicate on the record you understand those and you do wish to represent yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-10\"><em>The Defendant. </em>I understand \u2014 I understand what you said, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-11\"><em>The Court: </em>Okay, fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">Although at first glance the defendant\u2019s response indicates hesitation, the trial judge again asked the defendant if he understood that he had to indicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>unequivocally on the record in order to be allowed to proceed pro se. The defendant indicated that he understood what the judge said. The defendant also responded affirmatively to the judge\u2019s concluding remarks requiring the defendant to clearly indicate whether he wished to represent himself.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The judge also told the defendant that he had a right to an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\">The trial record establishes that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. The court explained to the defendant that he was not schooled in the Rules of Evidence and that Mr. Moore would help him to comply with these rules. The court also warned the defendant about the dangers inherent in self-representation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-4\">Do you further understand there is an inherent danger in you representing yourself. Those include not asking proper questions. It may include not being able to make a proper statement or misstatement about the manner in which you represent yourself or cross-examine a witness. There may be a lot of inherent possibilities there in representing yourself. Do you understand that those things do exist and that you will not be able to raise issues, you know, later on that were matters that might have been better handled by an attorney representing you, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The defendant\u2019s behavior is also relevant to our conclusion that he knowingly waived his right to counsel. In this case, the record indicates that the defendant proceeded in propria persona, in part, for tactical reasons. While evidence that a defendant chose to proceed in propria persona for a tactical reason does not eliminate the need for other explanations about the hazards of self-representation, it may serve to bolster a trial judge\u2019s assessment that a defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel. See <em>Sandies, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In <em>United States v Bell, </em>901 F2d 574, 579 (CA 7, 1990), the court found that the defendant\u2019s decision to proceed in propria persona for a tactical reason was a relevant factor in establishing that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing. In <em>Bell, </em>the defendant\u2019s decision was the result of his attorney\u2019s unwillingness to present an alibi defense. Mr. Suggs\u2019 decision to proceed in propria persona was for a similar reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Although we do not have the letter that defendant Suggs sent to the court regarding his dissatisfaction with Mr. Daly, the waiver proceedings lead to the inference that the defendant wanted to provide a consent defense at trial. Throughout the waiver proceedings, the defendant interrupted the court with questions about the presentation of his defense. The defendant apologized to the court for interrupting and assured the judge that he would speak to Mr. Moore \u201cabout how better to present the substance of his interruptions.\u201d It appears that the substance of the discussion involved Mr. Suggs\u2019 unsuccessful attempt to establish that the victim had an abortion. The defendant\u2019s theory was that he was a scapegoat for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the victim\u2019s unwanted pregnancy. Consequently, we believe the defendant\u2019s preparation of his consent defense bolsters the trial judge\u2019s assessment that the defendant\u2019s waiver was knowingly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\">The record establishes that the court made a thoughtful inquiry into the defendant\u2019s ability to abide by courtroom procedures. The judge explained the courtroom protocol that Mr. Suggs would be expected to follow.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-4\">Now, do you further understand that I must make a determination throughout what would disrupt and inconvenience and unduly burden the Court and the Court\u2019s business, I realize it is that of judgment call and it depends on you conducting yourself in the proper manner. I realize you are not trained in the law and won\u2019t be able to represent yourself the same as a lawyer would represent you. There are some procedure rules and you have to follow the rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The defendant responded that he understood and agreed to abide by the courtroom procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">We recognize that the judge did not note his reasons for finding a proper waiver as did the court in <em>Adkins. </em>However, in light of both the defendant\u2019s eagerness to proceed with his case as a tactical decision and the thorough judicial compliance with the other procedures, the judge\u2019s oversight in this matter is also not enough to defeat a finding of substantial compliance with the waiver of counsel procedures in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The trial court substantially complied with MCR 6.101(C)(3), the waiver of counsel court rule at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>time of the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> At sentencing, the judge indicated to the defendant that he had the right to counsel on appeal and strongly advised the defendant to consider exercising this right. The fact that the judge did not have the defendant reaffirm his right to counsel before sentencing is not enough to defeat a finding of substantial compliance with the waiver of counsel procedures in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In light of this analysis, we believe that the judge substantially complied with the requirements of <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005. We conclude this because the judge conveyed the substance of both <em>Anderson </em>and the court rule to the defendant. Further, the defendant understood these concepts and made the decision to proceed in propria persona unequivocally and with his eyes open. The grant of a new trial by the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\">In light of this analysis, the Court of Appeals decisions granting new trials in <em>Adkins </em>and <em>Suggs </em>are reversed and the convictions reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b827-4\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle, Riley, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\"> The night before, Mr. Adkins expressed his dissatisfaction with Mr. Ellis\u2019 representation.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">This emphasized language, and the trial judge\u2019s complete disregard of it, indicates that defendant\u2019s attempted dismissal of Mr. Daly was not the result of his unequivocal desire to represent himself, but was instead the result of a justifiable dissatisfaction with that attorney\u2019s failure to consult with him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This understanding of defendant\u2019s actual motivation is an integral factor in the analysis of his alleged waiver of counsel immediately before trial on June 19, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">On March 17, 1989, immediately after granting Mr. Daly\u2019s request to be excused from his appointment as defendant\u2019s counsel, the trial judge, without any recourse to the procedural safeguards of <em>Anderson </em>or MCR 6.005(D), said to defendant: \u201cMr. Suggs, I\u2019m going to \u2014 you can represent yourself if you want to. . . . I\u2019m going to appoint at least advisory counsel to assist you and you can, you and that counsel can discuss whatever you might want to do in representing yourself.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 715, n 8. On June 19, immedi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ately before trial began, the following exchange occurred between the trial judge and the attorney appointed as \u201cadvisory counsel\u201d on March 17:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Understanding, Mr. Moore, that Mr. Suggs wishes to represent himself and proceed in pro per?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\"><em>\u201cMr. Moore: </em>That is my understanding.\u201d <em>[Ante, </em>p 716.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">In light of the trial judge\u2019s statement on March 17 and the majority\u2019s acknowledgment that it was not until immediately before trial began on June 19 that defendant made his \u201cinitial attempt at waiving his right to counsel,\u201d <em>id., </em>it is clear that the trial judge simply (and erroneously) assumed that defendant wanted to represent himself and that this understanding was unquestioningly conveyed to replacement counsel, Mr. Moore, right from the start.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">The majority correctly notes that \u201c[application of the waiver of counsel procedures is the duty of the court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 723. However, the majority fails to heed the real import of this principle. The burden is on the trial court to determine inter alia that a defendant\u2019s attempt to waive his right to counsel is unequivocal, not on the defendant to prove that an alleged waiver was not unequivocal. The right to counsel, as a guarantor of a fair trial, is a fundamental right that should not be deemed waived unless the record clearly and unequivocally evidences such waiver, a record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>must be made by the trial judge\u2019s diligent inquiiy into the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In <em>Suggs, </em>then, where the trial court, without conducting the proper inquiry, operated at all relevant times under the mistaken and uninvestigated assumption that defendant had unequivocally waived his right to counsel and asserted his right to self-representation, and where the defendant explicitly stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want an attorney to represent me,\u201d neither the first prong of the <em>Anderson </em>inquiry nor the requirements of MCR 6.005(D) have been complied with, substantially or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Levin, J. (dissenting). Because <em>People v Anderson, </em>398 Mich 361; 247 NW2d 857 (1976), and MCR 6.005(D), require that a waiver of counsel be unequivocal before it will be given effect, I agree with Justice Cavanagh\u2019s conclusion in <em>People v Suggs </em>that Suggs\u2019 waiver of his right to counsel was not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">On the day the trial was to begin, two days after Suggs stated that he did not wish to proceed with his court-appointed lawyer, the judge explained to Suggs that he had a right to represent himself. He questioned Suggs concerning whether he understood this right. The judge asked Suggs, \u201cYou still wish to represent yourself?\u201d Suggs responded \u201cYes,\u201d and then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">Your Honor, you recall when I dismissed the attorney, Mr. Craig' Daily [sic], I sent a letter to the Court besides the letter I sent to Craig Daily explaining to the Court why I was dismissing Craig Daily. <em>It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want an attorney to represent me, </em>it\u2019s just that Craig Daily never spoke to me.

Do you have any other preliminary issues that you want to bring up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-7\"><em>Die Defendant: </em>No, Your Honor. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The judge\u2019s response to Suggs\u2019 statement that he did not \u201cwant\u201d to represent himself indicates either that he was not paying attention to what Suggs said or that he chose to ignore what he said. Either way, the equivocation in Suggs\u2019 answer is undeniable.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The majority dismisses Suggs\u2019 statement that he did not really want to continue alone as a mere \u201chesitation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It further states that any equivocation was removed by Suggs\u2019 subsequent responses indicating his preference for proceeding in propria persona.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">Suggs\u2019 answer was not a mere hesitation. It was a clear and unequivocal statement that he did <em>not </em>want to represent himself. Although Suggs subsequently indicated on some level that he wished to proceed in propria persona, this indication should be discounted both because his later statements at most make his earlier statement that he did not want to represent himself equivocal and because the leading manner in which the judge posed the questions suggested to Suggs that the judge expected an affirmative answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">I also part company from the majority in assessing the trial judge\u2019s conduct respecting defendant Adkins. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Although Adkins\u2019 waiver was unequivocal, it was not knowing, intelligent, or voluntary as required by this Court in <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">This Court stated in <em>Anderson, supra </em>at 368, that \u201c[t]he trial court must make the <em>pro se </em>defendant aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u201d According to the court rule, making a defendant sufficiently knowledgeable includes advising him of the charge, the maximum and mandatory minimum prison sentences, and determining whether the defendant understood the risk of representing himself. MCR 6.005(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">The judge did not apprise Adkins of the possible range of sentences associated with the offense. He failed to particularize the risks involved. The majority acknowledges these deficiencies, but dismisses them as inadequate to disturb what was otherwise \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the waiver procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The majority writes, \u201c[p]roper compliance requires that the court engage, on the record, in a <em>methodical </em>assessment of the wisdom of self-representation by the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) The majority further asserts that \u201c [substantial compliance requires that the court discuss the substance of both <em>Anderson </em>and MCR 6.005(D) in a short colloquy with the defendant, and make an express finding that the defendant fully understands, recognizes, and agrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>to abide by the waiver of counsel procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cmethodical assessment\u201d or \u201cshort colloquy\u201d with Adkins consisted only of the judge\u2019s admonition that this \u201cis a very serious case\u201d and a solitary question asking Adkins whether he understood \u201cthat there is always a hazard in representing yourself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In addition to the cursory nature of the questioning, the judge exacerbated this flimsy questioning by phrasing the question asking Adkins whether he understood the hazards of self-representation in a leading manner and including it in a sentence that also contained two other questions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While there is no rule against using compound or leading questions in this type of proceeding per se, it is noteworthy that such questions provide grounds for objection during a trial because they are considered confusing and suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Given the importance of the questioning conducted by the judge and the limited cognitive skills of many defendants, one would expect that the judge would have phrased his questions in a form that is clear and readily understood. Instead, it is apparent from the judge\u2019s method of questioning that he treated the proceeding much as one might treat a trip to the supermarket \u2014 perfunctorily checking things off the shopping list as he went along, with his mind as much focused on the next errands as the task immediately before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The majority finds the judge\u2019s efforts sufficient to effectuate a knowing and intelligent waiver. Apparently, the majority believes either that Adkins knew or should have known exactly to what \u201chazards\u201d the judge was referring, or that warning a defendant that there is, generally, \u201ca hazard in representing [one]self,\u201d is enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The fallacy of either belief is clear on its face, and only becomes clearer once the particulars of this case are considered. Adkins stated during questioning that he only had a tenth grade education and that until recently he had held only odd jobs. Actually, Adkins was functionally illiterate. It is clear that Adkins had no idea what he was about to face in the forthcoming trial when he opted to represent himself. Nor was he aware of how his case might be prejudiced if he proceeded without legal counsel, the judge\u2019s \u201cwarning\u201d notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Adkins was, by all accounts, quite inept in representing himself. While cross-examining the victim, Adkins prefaced a question stating, \u201cWhen I was making love . . . .\u201d The prosecutor objected on the ground that Adkins was stating facts not in evidence. An obviously frustrated Adkins then rephrased the question, \u201cWhen I was raping you . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Even if Adkins\u2019 inability to understand the perils of self-representation was not so profound, it is incorrect to equate a question asking whether Adkins understood the \u201chazard\u201d involved with a sufficiently detailed colloquy in which the judge explains what the risks axe.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The colloquy was so inadequate that the majority could not properly conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>judge \u201cindulge [d] every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, I can scarcely imagine a judge doing less to ensure that a defendant is making his decision with his \u201ceyes open.\u201d Substantial compliance requires at least what those words imply. It demands that some, i.e., a \u201csubstantial,\u201d effort be made to ascertain whether in fact this particular defendant actually understands the consequences of his decision to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The majority\u2019s approval of this most cursory of questioning does not comport with the approach in other jurisdictions. The plurality opinion in <em>People v Dennany, </em>445 Mich 412; 519 NW2d 128 (1994), contains a comprehensive review of what the federal courts require.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Federal trial judges employ an outline in a bench book (appendix A) as a guide to ensure that the waiver of the right to counsel is knowing and voluntary. The bench book suggests that the judge not only apprise the defendant of the crime of which he is charged, and the maximum and minimum sentences, including the possibility of consecutive sentencing, but also admonishes the judge to warn the defendant that he may not provide the defendant with any advice concerning how to try the case, and encourages the judge to advise the defendant that he \u201cwould be far better defended by a trained lawyer . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AmN\">Similarly, the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice provides that \u201c[a]n accused should not be deemed to have waived the assistance of counsel until the entire process of offering counsel has been completed and a thorough inquiry into the accused\u2019s comprehension of the offer and capacity to make the choice intelligently and understandingly has been made.\u201d To satisfy this guideline, the commentary on the standard notes that \u201cthe court should inquire whether the accused apprehends the nature of the charges, the offenses included within them, the allowable punishments, possible defenses to the charges, and circumstances in mitigation thereof, among other factors.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>Requiring, at a minimum, some discussion of the risk involved is currently the policy both in federal and other state courts. Recently, in <em>United States v Moscovits, </em>86 F3d 1303 (CA 3, 1996), the defendant sought a new trial on the ground that the colloquy with the judge regarding waiver of the right to counsel did not include a discussion of the possible range of punishments. The court agreed that the absence of such a discussion rendered the proceedings inadequate. It wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">To ensure that a defendant \u201ctruly appreciates the \u2018dangers and disadvantages of self-representation,\u2019 ... \u2018[a defendant\u2019s] waiver must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, [and] the range of allowable punishments thereunder.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 1306, quoting <em>United States v Welty, </em>674 F2d 185, 188 (CA 3, 1982), quoting <em>Faretta v California, </em>422 US 806, 835; 95 S Ct 2525; 45 L Ed 2d 562 (1975), and <em>Von Moltke v Gillies, </em>332 US 708, 724; 68 S Ct 316; 92 L Ed 309 (1948) (plurality).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">We should require that this approach, as spelled out in the federal bench book and the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice and applied in <em>Moseovits, </em>be followed by Michigan judges. Taking the little time needed at the trial level to apprise the defendant of the specific risks involved provides some assurance that the defendant has not lightly waived his right to proceed with counsel. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-7\">[T]he more searching the inquiry at this stage the more likely it is that any decision on the part of the defendant is going to be truly voluntary and equally important that he will not be able to raise that issue later if he does then decide to represent himself. It is simply a question of taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>enough time at the moment to make a meaningful record and thus to avoid the very real dangers of reversal should the defendant not prove himself up to the task of his own self-defense. <em>[United Stales v McDowell, </em>814 F2d 245, 252 (CA 6, 1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The more searching inquiry approach has been employed in the past by Michigan trial judges. See, e.g., colloquy between Branch Circuit Judge Michael Cherry and the defendant in <em>People v Lane, </em>453 Mich 132; 551 NW2d 382 (1996) (attached as appendix B). We should expect other trial judges in this state to follow the same approach of their colleagues and judges in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">h</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">I also question the majority\u2019s assertion that <em>\u201cAnderson </em>does not favor a litany approach\u201d because of the difficulty of assuring compliance by the trial court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>every instance and the likelihood that an omission may create an appellate parachute for the defendant.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The majority operates under a misconception that the litany is somehow arduous or long. It is not. The only requirements laid out in MCR 6.005(D)(1) are that the trial judge apprise \u201cthe defendant of the charge, the maximum possible prison sentence for the offense, any mandatory minimum sentence required by law, and the risk involved in self-representation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that a litany approach has somehow been universally discredited is without support. The majority relies in large part on federal cases that admittedly, do not adhere to this strict approach. There is a good reason for such departure, however. In contrast with MCR 6.005(D)(1), which occupies a mere four lines, the bench book sets forth sixteen questions or comments that a trial judge is expected to ask or make before approving the waiver of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is thus understandable that on review an appellate court might not require the trial court to have phrased the questions exactly as they read on their face.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The majority also relies on <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), for support. However, like the bench book, the litany involved when a defendant pleads guilty is substantially longer than that called for when a defendant seeks to represent himself. A minor deviation is thus again understandable for reasons not applicable in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Because we recognize, as the United States Supreme Court has, \u201cthe enormous importance and role that an attorney plays at a criminal trial,\u201d this Court has a responsibility to assure that a defendant waives his right only after he is fully apprised of the risk that he is taking.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For this reason, a trial court\u2019s primary function should be to assure that the defendant is making the decision to proceed alone only after he has been apprised of all necessary and relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The majority stresses that the defendant made the request to proceed in propria persona as part of a \u201cintentional manipulation\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of the judicial system. There should be but one paramount concern for the trial judge as he questions the defendant regarding his desire to proceed in propria persona, however. That is whether his waiver is unequivocal and knowing, intelligent and voluntary. Resolving the question whether defendant is seeking to proceed in propria persona in an effort to manipulate the system is not of the same level of concern as the <em>Anderson </em>factors or even the substance of MCR 6.005(D)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">I also question the deferential treatment the majority accords the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was attempting to delay the start of the trial and manipulate the system when he sought to represent himself. While it is true that Adkins did not previously bring to the court\u2019s attention his disapproval of Ellis\u2019 representation, nor did he provide any concrete rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>sons for his disapproval when he ultimately did address this issue, this aspect of Adkins\u2019 conduct is at best only marginally probative of bad intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Adkins had only a minimal educational background. It is thus likely that Adkins delayed in bringing his concerns to the judge\u2019s attention, and failed to express them in a detailed and articulate fashion once he did, simply because he lacked the intelligence level and verbal skills that more highly educated persons, judges included, often take for granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">The record contains precious little that would suggest an intent to manipulate or delay. The record is devoid of evidence that Adkins made any motions for an adjournment or obviously frivolous motions. Rather, the record shows that Adkins only moved to have his bail reduced and have evidence suppressed, both of which were understandable under the circumstances, as well as fairly routine given the type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The majority also points to Adkins\u2019 motion to move the case to another courtroom.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The impetus for this request was Adkins\u2019 attorney Ellis, not Adkins himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">The majority opines that \u201c[t]he <em>Anderson </em>and court rule requirements are merely vehicles to ensure that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived counsel with eyes open.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> They are much more, however. They are, in fact, under these circumstances, the guardians of defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>The majority today, by excusing the woefully inadequate procedures undertaken by these trial judges, condones sloppy conduct. It condones a process that fails to assure that a defendant will proceed without counsel only when he has indicated a desire to do so knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and unequivocally.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">VOLUME 1, BENCH BOOK FOR UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGES,</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\u00a7 1.02, ASSIGNMENT OF COUNSEL OR PRO SE REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">3. If defendant does not wish counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">An accused has a constitutional right to represent himself if he chooses to do so. A defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel must, however, be knowing and voluntary. This means that you must make clear on the <em>record </em>that the defendant is fully <em>aware of hazards </em>that he faces and the disadvantages of self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">When a defendant states that he wishes to represent himself, you should therefore ask questions similar to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-11\">(a) Have you ever studied law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-12\">(b) Have you ever represented yourself or any other defendant in a criminal action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-13\">(c) You realize, do you not, that you are charged with these crimes: (Here state the crimes with which the defendant is charged.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-14\">(d) You realize, do you not, that if you are found guilty of the crime charged in Count I the court must impose an assessment of $50 ($25 if a misdemeanor committed before Nov. 18, 1988; $25 if a Class A misdemeanor, $10 if Class B. $5 if Class c or infraction committed on or after Nov. 18, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>1988)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and could sentence you to as many as_years in prison and fine you as much as $_.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">(Then ask him a similar question with respect to each other crime with which he may be charged in the indictment or information.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-7\">(e) You realize, do you not, that if you are found guilty of more than one of those crimes this court can order that the sentence be served consecutively, that is, one after another?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-8\">(f) [If the conduct occurred Nov. 1, 1987, or later] You realize, do you not, that the United States Sentencing Commission has issued sentencing guidelines that will affect your sentence if you are found guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-9\">(g) You realize, do you not, that if you represent yourself you are on your own?

I think it is unwise of you to try to represent yourself. You are not familiar with the law. You are not familiar with court procedure. You are not familiar with the rules of evidence.

See also <em>United States v Gallop, </em>838 F2d 105, 109-110 (CA 4, 1988); <em>Wiesner v Abrams, </em>726 F Supp 912, 917 (ED NY, 1989), aff'd without opinion 909 F2d 1473 (CA 2, 1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\">Several courts have stated that a waiver hearing expressly addressing the disadvantages of a pro se defense is much preferred but not absolutely necessary. See, e.g., <em>Fitzpatrick v Wainwright, </em>800 F2d 1057, 1064 (CA 11, 1986); <em>United States v Bailey, </em>219 US App DC 67, 78, n 17; 675 F2d 1292 (1982), cert den 459 US 853 (1982); <em>Tuitt v Fair, </em>822 F2d 166 (CA 1, 1987), cert den 484 US 945 (1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit now requires trial judges to follow the model inquiry set forth in 1 Bench Book for United States District Judges (3d ed), 1.02-2 to 1.02-5. See <em>United States v McDowell, </em>814 F2d 245 (CA 6, 1987),. cert den 484 US 980 (1987). Other examples of a model inquiry format are set forth in <em>People v Arguello, </em>772 P2d 87 (Colo, 1989); and <em>People v Lopez, </em>71 Cal App 3d 568, 571-573; 138 Cal Rptr 36 (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-8\">The common thread that can be gleaned from these cases is that \u201c[t]he ultimate test is not the trial court\u2019s express advice, but rather the defendant\u2019s understanding.\u201d <em>Fitzpatrick, supra, </em>p 1065. See also <em>United States v Harris, </em>683 F2d 322 (CA 9, 1982), appeal after remand 726 F2d 558 (CA 9, 1984).
