In furtherance of this goal, the PERA imposes a duty on public employers to bargain in good faith over \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment . . . .\u201d MCL 423.215(1); MSA 17.455(15)(1). The parties do not dispute the general principle that \u201c[a] past practice which does not derive from the parties\u2019 collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>agreement may become a term or condition of employment which is binding on the parties.\u201d <em>Amalgamated Transit Union v Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority, </em>437 Mich 441, 454; 473 NW2d 249 (1991). Rather, the question presented is whether a past practice that is contrary to clear contract language can create a term or condition of employment. We hold that the unambiguous contract language controls unless the past practice is so widely acknowledged and mutually accepted that it amends the contract. The party seeking to supplant the contract language must show the parties had a meeting of the minds with respect to the new terms or conditions so that there was an agreement to modify the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In 1978, the Port Huron Education Association and the Port Huron Area School District negotiated and signed a collective bargaining agreement. The agreement contained a clause providing that health insurance benefits would be prorated<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for teachers who work less than a full year. Specifically, the agreement provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">Continued coverage shall be provided to all contracted teachers on a twelve (12) month annual basis or a prorated portion of the year for teachers who work less than a full work year. [Article VII, \u00b6 Q, \u00a7 6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>This language was placed in each succeeding agreement, including the agreement, for the 1987-88 school year \u2014 -the year the current dispute arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">The record is unclear whether there were any teachers hired for less than a full year before the 1983-84 school year. From 1983 to 1987, however, eleven teachers were hired midyear.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district did not prorate insurance benefits for any of these midyear hires, but rather, paid the health insurance premiums for each of the new teachers from the date they were hired through July and August.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">During the 1987-88 school year, the district hired eight new teachers after or near the end of the first semester. The unusually large number of midyear hires prompted the district to reexamine the agreement and notice the proration provision. In March, 1988, the district notified the eight new teachers by letter that, in accordance with the agreement, benefits would be prorated because they worked less than a full year and that the district would not provide health insurance benefits for the month of August.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In response to the district\u2019s proration notice, the association simultaneously filed a grievance<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a demand that the district bargain before enforcing the proration provision. The association was unsuccessful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>at the first two stages of the grievance process and withdrew the grievance before arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The district responded to the association\u2019s demand to bargain by noting that because the proration issue had already been negotiated and included in the collective bargaining agreement, it had no further duty to bargain. The association then filed an unfair labor practice charge, alleging that the district refused to bargain in violation of \u00a7 10(l)(e)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the pera.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The matter was heard before a hearing referee on September 29, 1988. The association alleged that \u201c[notwithstanding any term of the existing and prior collective bargaining agreements between the parties,\u201d payment of full insurance benefits was an established past practice that could not be varied without bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The hearing referee recommended dismissal of the association\u2019s charge, concluding that the district did not have a duty to bargain about prorating insurance benefits because it had already done so when the agreement was negotiated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hearing referee further reasoned that the district\u2019s failure to prorate benefits before 1988 was simply a mistake or oversight, not a conscious decision by the district to amend or alter the agreement. There was no evidence the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>trict was aware it had not followed the express language of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\">The association filed exceptions to the hearing referee\u2019s decision with the MERC.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Relying on <em>Mid-Michigan Ed Ass\u2019n v St Charles Community Schools, </em>150 Mich App 763; 389 NW2d 482 (1986), the MERC reversed the hearing referee\u2019s decision and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">Clearly, Respondent either knew or should have known that it was paying insurance benefits to its teachers without regard to hire date. Contrary to the [hearing referee], we find that the parties in this case had tacitly accepted the benefits as a term of employment. [1990 MERC Lab Op 903, 909.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">After deciding that payment of insurance benefits for the entire summer established a term of employment, the MERC concluded that the district had a duty to bargain because the proration language in the agreement was ambiguous and therefore did not amount to a waiver by the association of its right to bargain.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">In the instant case we believe the parties\u2019 \u201cproration\u201d language is inherently ambiguous. The contract clause nowhere specifies how benefits will be \u201cprorated.\u201d Moreover, as in <em>Mid-Michigan, </em>the parties here entered into a new contract with the same identical insurance language after the practice began. Because of the ambiguity of the clause and the bargaining history, the insurance clause here did not demonstrate a clear and unmistakable waiver of the right to bargain. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed the merc\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district then. filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court. Retaining jurisdiction, we vacated the Court of Appeals decision and remanded to the MERC for further consideration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Specifically, we directed the MERC to consider the effect of art VII, \u00b6 H of the agreement regarding its conclusion that the proration language was ambiguous. Paragraph H states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">The figure of 185 total duty days for a school year will be the basis for computing earned leave time, salary deductions, and pro-rations of benefits for those working less than a full year, or part-time, it being understood that pro-rations for part-time will be made on less than a full-day basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">On remand, the MERC requested and received additional briefing from the parties. After reviewing the briefs, the merc concluded that \u00b6 H, removed any ambiguity by clarifying the meaning of the proration provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">Article VII, Section H, clearly provides that teachers hired for less than a full year will receive benefits, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>health insurance, for that portion of the nonschool year (i.e. July and August) which corresponds to the proportion of the number of days worked compared to 185. . . . Those teachers hired prior to the beginning of the second semester, i.e. those who worked more than half of the 185 day school year, were entitled to benefits for the full summer. Those who were hired after the beginning of the first semester and who worked less than half of the 185 days were entitled to benefits for only half the nonworking summer months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-4\">[W]hen Article V[II], Section Q [the proration provision] is read together with Article VII, Section H, the parties\u2019 contract contains no inherent ambiguity. [1995 MERC Lab Op 42, 45.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">On September 21, 1995, we granted the district\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Public employers have a duty to bargain over \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment . . . .\u201d MCL 423.215(1); MSA 17.455(15)(1). Under the pera, an employer commits an unfair labor practice if, before bargaining,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it unilaterally alters or modifies a term or condition of employment,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> unless the employer has fulfilled its statutory obligation or has been freed from it. <em>Amalgamated, supra </em>at 450; <em>Ottawa Co v Jaklinski, </em>423 Mich 1; 377 NW2d 668 (1985). The employer can ful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>fill its statutory duty by bargaining about a subject and memorializing resolution of that subject in the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Gratiot Community Hosp v NLRB, </em>51 F3d 1255, 1261 (CA 6, 1995); <em>NLRB v United States Postal Service, </em>303 US App DC 428, 432; 8 F3d 832 (1993).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">An employer may defend against a charge that it has unilaterally altered working conditions by arguing that it has fulfilled its duty to bargain or that the union has waived its right to demand bargaining.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The statutory duty to bargain may be fulfilled by \u201cnegotiating for a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that fixes the parties\u2019 rights and forecloses further mandatory bargaining . . . .\u201d <em>Local Union No 47, Inti Brotherhood of Electrical Workers v NLRB, </em>288 US App DC 363, 368; 927 F2d 635 (1991). In that case, the matter is \u201ccovered by\u201d the agreement. Alternately, the employer may be freed from its duty to bargain if the union has waived its right to demand bargaining. The procedure for determining whether an employer must bargain before altering a mandatory subject of bargaining involves a two-step analysis: is the issue the \u201cunion seeks to negotiate .. . \u2018covered by\u2019 or \u2018contained in\u2019 the collective bargaining agreement; and, if not, [did] the union . . . somehow relinquish] ] its right to bargain[?]\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy v Federal Labor Relations </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>Authority, </em>295 US App DC 239, 247; 962 F2d 48 (1992); <em>United States Postal Service, supra </em>at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-3\">There is a significant difference between whether a subject is \u201ccovered by\u201d a collective bargaining agreement and whether the right to bargain about a mandatory subject has been waived by the agreement. In <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy, supra, </em>Judge Harry T. Edwards, a noted labor law scholar, examined the distinction between \u201ccovered by\u201d and \u201cwaiver\u201d in great detail. His analysis merits significant quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\">A waiver occurs when a union knowingly and voluntarily <em>relinquishes </em>its right to bargain about a matter; but where the matter is covered by the collective bargaining agreement, the union <em>has exercised </em>its bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">Indeed, the difference between the two concepts goes to the structural heart of labor law. When parties bargain about a subject and memorialize the results of their negotiation in a collective bargaining agreement, they create a set of enforceable rules \u2014 a new code of conduct for themselves \u2014 on that subject. Because of the fundamental policy of freedom of contract, the parties are generally free to agree to whatever specific rules they like, and in most circumstances it is beyond the competence of the Authority, the National Labor Relations Board or the courts to interfere with the parties\u2019 choice. ... On the other hand, when a union <em>waives </em>its right to bargain about a particular matter, it surrenders the opportunity to create a set of contractual rules that bind the employer, and instead cedes full discretion to the employer on that matter. For that reason, the courts require \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d evidence of waiver and have tended to construe waivers narrowly. <em>[Dep\u2019t of Navy, supra </em>at 248.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Our precedent reflects the same approach. We analyze whether the term is covered by the contract<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and require unmistakable evidence to support a claim that the union has waived the statutory right. <em>Amalgamated, supra </em>at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The district argues that the authority to prorate benefits is covered by the agreement. The association replies, admitting that the agreement provides for prorationing insurance benefits, but contends that the district\u2019s payment of insurance benefits for the entire summer, regardless of the date of hiring, does not conflict with the proration language. As alleged in its grievance and argued before the MERC, the association contends that the proration language means \u201cteachers received coverage only for the period after their date of employment; they were not to receive benefits retroactively.\u201d The MERC, on remand, rejected this interpretation, and we affirm that conclusion, finding both that the association\u2019s argument is based on a strained reading of the agreement and, more importantly, that the topic is covered by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a particular course of conduct may violate contractual and statutory duties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">Hence, it has been made clear that in some circumstances the authority of the [National Labor Relations] Board and the law of the contract are overlapping, concurrent regimes, neither pre-empting the other. Arbitrators and courts are still the principal sources of contract interpretation, but the Board may proscribe conduct which is an unfair labor practice even though it is also a breach of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tract remediable as such by arbitration and in the courts. It may also, if necessary to adjudicate an unfair labor practice, interpret and give effect to the terms of a collective bargaining contract. <em>[NLRB v Strong, </em>393 US 357, 360-361; 89 S Ct 541; 21 L Ed 2d 546 (1968) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">In cases in which statutory and contractual issues overlap, the MERC, like the NLRB, must often review the contract to determine whether there is a statutory violation. The merc does not involve itself with contract interpretation when the agreement provides a grievance process that culminates in arbitration. <em>Sanilac Co Bd of Comm\u2019rs v Sanilac Co Employees, </em>1993 MERC Lab Op 750, 755; <em>Police Officers Ass\u2019n of Michigan v Romulus, </em>1992 MERC Lab Op 170. When the unfair labor charge is the failure to bargain, however, it is often necessary for the merc, like the nlrb, to review the terms of an agreement to ascertain whether a party has breached its statutory duty to bargain. See <em>Detroit Fire Fighters Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>408 Mich 663; 293 NW2d 278 (1980); Edwards, <em>Deferral to arbitration and waiver of the duty to bargain: A possible way out of everlasting confusion at the NLRB, </em>46 Ohio St L J 23, 24 (1985) (describing a similar requirement for the nlrb). In reviewing an agreement for any pera violation, the merc\u2019s initial charge is to determine whether the agreement \u201ccovers\u201d the dispute. If the term or condition in dispute is \u201ccovered\u201d by the agreement, the details and enforceability of the provision are left to arbitration.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Where there is a contract covering the subject matter of a dispute, which has provisions reasonably relied on for the action in question, and the contract also has a grievance procedure with final and binding arbitration, the Commission finds that the contract controls and no pera issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>presented. [St <em>Clair Co Rd, Comm v Local 516M Service Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>1992 MERC Lab Op 533, 538.]1<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The district\u2019s duty to bargain is the only provision of the pera implicated by the association\u2019s complaint in this case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See n 6. As this Court noted over twenty years ago, \u201c[a]fter the parties have met in good faith and bargained over the mandatory subjects placed upon the bargaining table, they have satisfied their statutory duty.\u201d <em>Detroit Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Detroit, </em>391 Mich 44, 55; 214 NW2d 803 (1974), citing <em>NLRB v American Nat\u2019l Ins Co, </em>343 US 395, 404; 72 S Ct 824; 96 L Ed 2d 1027 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">To determine whether the district violated the pera, the MERC on remand examined the agreement and concluded the proration provisions were unambiguous. As noted in <em>Amalgamated, supra, </em>\u201c[o]ur review of the commission\u2019s decision is circumscribed by the statutory mandate that factual findings by the commission are conclusive if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450, citing MCL 423.216(e); MSA 17.455(16)(e), Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. Courts do not accord legal rulings by the MERC the same level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>deference,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> however, and such determinations \u201care set aside if they are in violation of the constitution or a statute, or affected by a substantial and material error of law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing MCL 24.306(l)(a), (f); MSA 3.560(206)(l)(a), (f). <em>Southfield Police Officers Ass\u2019n v Southfield, </em>433 Mich 168; 445 NW2d 98 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">The initial question whether contract language is ambiguous is a question of law. If the contract language is clear and unambiguous, its meaning is a question of law. <em>Dykema v Muskegon Piston Ring Co, </em>348 Mich 129, 138; 82 NW2d 467 (1957). Where the contract language is unclear or susceptible to multiple meanings, interpretation becomes a question of fact. <em>Zinchook v Turkewycz, </em>128 Mich App 513; 340 NW2d 844 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In this case, the second merc panel concluded that the proration language was unambiguous as a matter of law. After reviewing the agreement, we find that the merc\u2019s decision regarding ambiguity is not affected by an error of law, nor is it in violation of any constitutional or statutory prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We agree with the merc that the association\u2019s interpretation of the proration language is illogical. The district could not provide health insurance coverage for losses previously incurred by the new teachers before being hired. The purpose of insurance is to cover contingent losses, not losses that are known with certainty to have already occurred. \u201cNo coverage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>exists for events that must happen or that have happened.\u201d <em>CPC Int\u2019l, Inc v Aerojet-General Corp, </em>825 F Supp 795, 809 (WD Mich, 1993), citing <em>Nash v New York Life Ins Co, </em>272 Mich 680, 682; 262 NW 441 (1935). Thus, because the district could not have provided retroactive coverage, the association\u2019s interpretation would render the proration provision superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">We do not address the outer limits of when a subject is \u201ccovered by\u201d an agreement. The language granting the district the right to prorate benefits in \u00b6 Q of the agreement, and the additional language in \u00b6 H identifying the method by which benefits will be prorated, does not implicate that question. The association does not dispute that prorationing of benefits is addressed in the agreement. Thus, under any reasonable definition of the term \u201ccovered by,\u201d we conclude the prorationing of insurance benefits is \u201ccovered by\u201d the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The association argues that, even if the agreement unambiguously grants the district the authority to prorate benefits, the conduct of the district established an enforceable past practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The association\u2019s unfair labor practice charge illustrates that the dispute in this case is not grounded in contract interpretation alone. Specifically, the association\u2019s charge alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\"><em>Notwithstanding any term of the existing and prior collective bargaining agreements between the parties, </em>it has been the established past practice of the Respondent to continue insurance benefits on a twelve month basis for all members of the Charging Party without regard to whether a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>member of the Charging Party has worked a full year. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Notwithstanding the unambiguous proration language in the agreement, the association\u2019s charge is that the district\u2019s previous method of paying insurance benefits throughout the summer created a term of employment that could not be altered absent waiver or bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The parties do not dispute the general principle that a past practice may create a term or condition of employment that cannot be altered unilaterally absent negotiation. The question in this case is whether a past practice supersedes express contract language to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In order to create a term or condition of employment through past practice, the practice must be mutually accepted by both parties. <em>Amalgamated, supra </em>at 454. Where the collective bargaining agreement is ambiguous or silent on the subject for which the past practice has developed, there need only be \u201ctacit agreement that the practice would continue.\u201d <em>Amalgamated, supra </em>at 454-455.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>the agreement unambiguously covers a term of employment that conflicts with a parties\u2019 past behavior, requiring a higher standard of proof facilitates the primary goal of the PERA \u2014 to promote collective bargaining to reduce labor-management strife. A less stringent standard would discourage clarity in bargained terms, destabilize union-management relations, and undermine the employers\u2019 incentive to commit to clearly delineated obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Requiring a higher standard of proof when there is express contract language to the contrary comports with previous Michigan cases regarding modification. Generally, parties are free to take from, add to, or modify an existing contract. <em>Soltys v Soltys, </em>336 Mich 693; 59 NW2d 54 (1953). However, in the same way a meeting of the minds is necessary to create a binding contract, so also is a meeting of the minds necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to modify the contract after it has been made. <em>Universal Leaseway System, Inc v Herrud &amp; Co, </em>366 Mich 473; 115 NW2d 294 (1962). A collective bargaining agreement, like any other contract, is the product of informed understanding and mutual assent. To require a party to bargain anew before enforcing a right set forth in the contract requires proof that the parties knowingly, voluntarily, and mutually agreed to new obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">We view this situation as being parallel to a waiver of the union\u2019s right to demand bargaining. That parallelism is noted by Judge Edwards in the passage quoted previously on page 319. Once the employer has fulfilled its duty to bargain, it has a right to rely on the agreement as the statement of its obligations on any topic \u201ccovered by\u201d the agreement. \u201c[T]he courts require \u2018clear and unmistakable\u2019 evidence of waiver and have tended to construe waivers narrowly. See <em>Metropolitan Edison Co v NLRB, </em>460 US 693, 708-709; 103 S Ct 1467; 75 L Ed 2d 387 (1983); <em>NLRB v Brown-Graves Lumber Co, </em>949 F2d 194, 198 (CA 6, 1991).\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy, supra </em>at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">While we acknowledge the inherent difference between unfair labor practice charges and contract arbitration, we also find support in labor arbitration opinions for requiring a higher standard of proof in situations where the agreement conflicts with the parties past actions. As the association notes, an arbitrator\u2019s conclusions regarding contract inteipretation are not binding in unfair labor practice proceedings. <em>Amalgamated, supra </em>at 452-453. However, we find no reason not to adopt the arbitrators\u2019 analysis regarding the relationship between clear contract language and the parties past actions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>To vary the clear written mandates of the contract, the understanding or past practice must be evidenced by substantially stronger evidence than when utilized to interpret ambiguous language or to fill in areas where the contract is silent. <em>[Buchholz Mortuaries, Inc v Embalmers Federal Labor Union No 21301, </em>69 Lab Arb (BNA) 623, 626 (Roberts, 1977).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The different standards of proof are well developed in labor-management arbitration. In labor arbitration, past practice is admissible for three primary purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">(1) to provide the basis of rules governing matters not included in the written contract; (2) to indicate the proper interpretation of ambiguous contract language; or (3) to support allegations that clear language of the written contract has been amended by mutual action or agreement.

In the present case, where the district\u2019s past payment of insurance benefits for the entire summer was in direct conflict with the agreement, a higher standard of proof is necessary to establish that the district\u2019s past actions superseded the agreement and created a term or condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>employment that could not be modified absent negotiation.

THE MERC\u2019S DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">On many occasions, this Court has recognized the merc\u2019s expertise and judgment in the labor relations area. This recognition is embodied in the rule that findings of fact made by the merc are conclusive if they are supported by substantial, material, and competent evidence on the record as a whole. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28, MCL 423.216(e); MSA 17.455(16)(e). However, the merc\u2019s legal rulings are not given the same level of deference; a court will set them aside if they are in violation of the constitution or a statute, or if they are affected by a substantial and material error of law. MCL 24.306(l)(a), (f); MSA 3.560(206)(l)(a), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>In its initial decision, the MERC found that the district\u2019s past practice of paying full benefits to all teachers regardless of the date of hiring established a binding term of employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would affirm this finding because the competent evidence on the record supports a finding that a past practice existed and rose to the level of a term of employment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Additionally, in its original decision, the MERC concluded that, as a matter of law, the proration language was ambiguous. However, after appellate proceedings, a majority of this Court vacated the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>sion of the Court of Appeals and remanded to the merc to consider another provision of the collective bargaining agreement that, although not cited by either party, may have removed the ambiguity by clarifying the meaning of the proration provision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">On remand, the merc concluded that the proration provision was unambiguous as a matter of law. I disagree with this legal ruling by the MERC, and with the majority\u2019s finding that the merc\u2019s decision regarding ambiguity was not affected by an error of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The merc was obligated to follow the precedent established in St <em>Charles, </em>but did not do so when it found that the contract language was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">n. <em>ST CHARLES</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In <em>St Charles, </em>the collective bargaining agreement contained a provision wherein the employer agreed to provide employees with hospitalization-medical insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>anee, provided that the employee was not covered by any other insurance carrier for such insurance. However, in spite of that provision, and for a period of about three years, the employer allowed coordination of benefits. The Court of Appeals held that the employer\u2019s past practice of allowing coordinated benefits, although contrary to the contract provision, constituted a term of employment that could not be changed unilaterally. The employer was required to provide the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain and could not simply revert to enforcing the language of the collective bargaining agreement. Because it did not provide notice and an opportunity to bargain, the employer had committed an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Court stated that \u201cwhen an employer implements and continues a practice which is contrary to a contractual provision, the practice may constitute a term or condition of employment which is not subject to unilateral change.\u201d <em>St Charles </em>at 769. Because the employer permitted the practice to continue, knowing that it was contrary to the contract, the employer could not then rely on the contractual language to unilaterally change the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">The MERC found that the contract did not clearly preclude coordinated benefits coverage. To support its finding it noted that the parties apparently believed that the language was sufficiently ambiguous to permit coverage because neither party attempted to change the language during later contract negotiations. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-8\">Although the contractual language, standing alone, is not inherently ambiguous, it becomes susceptible to interpretation when examined in connection with the parties\u2019 past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>practice. \u201cWhere past practice has established a meaning for language that is used by the parties in a new agreement, the language will be presumed to have the meaning given to it by past practice.\u201d Here, the parties\u2019 incorporation of the disputed contractual provision in their . . . collective bargaining agreement must be viewed in terms of the district\u2019s past practice of providing coordinated health care benefits. Accordingly, the union could have construed the provision as permitting the continuation of the practice. <em>[Id. </em>at 770 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In the instant case, the merc should have concluded that the proration provision was ambiguous when considered in conjunction with the parties\u2019 past practice. Even if the provision was not inherently ambiguous when considered along with another provision on remand, the proration provision was subject to interpretation because of the parties\u2019 past practice. Because the parties entered into a new contract each year after the employer had begun providing uninterrupted benefits for persons hired midyear, the employees could have interpreted the contract language as permitting the continuation of the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">As noted by the majority, when the collective bargaining agreement is ambiguous on the subject for which the past practice has developed, there need only be \u201ctacit agreement that the practice would continue.\u201d <em>Amalgamated Transit Union v Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority, </em>437 Mich 441, 454-455; 473 NW2d 249 (1991). I agree with and would affirm the merc\u2019s original finding that the parties in this case had tacitly accepted the benefits as a term of employment because that finding is supported by competent evidence on the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The merc committed a substantial and material error of law in failing to apply <em>St Charles </em>to the facts of this case. If it had been properly applied, the MERC would have concluded that the proration provision was ambiguous. Then, our holding in <em>Amalgamated </em>would have applied, and the MERC would have concluded that the district had committed an unfair labor practice when it unilaterally changed a term \u00f3f employment that the parties had tacitly accepted and reasonably believed would continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In this case, the employer had an obligation to bargain over changes in the past practice of providing uninterrupted insurance coverage for persons hired midyear <em>independent </em>of its contractual obligations. My resolution of this issue does not require the employer to provide this coverage. Further, it does not involve the remaking of the contract; nor does it force the employer to agree to a proposal or concession. However, it does require it to bargain with the union on this issue. This resolution will advance the basic goal of the public employees relations act: resolution of labor-management strife in the public sector through collective bargaining.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-11\"> I note that this is the specific holding.

In that order, I joined Justice Levin\u2019s statement in which he stated that he would have denied leave to appeal. As he indicated, the remand order would not assist in resolving the question whether the MERC erred in concluding that the practice superseded the specific language of the collective bargaining agreement. If this Court had wanted to resolve the question left open by <em>Amalgamated, </em>it could have done so without a remand. As Justice Levin noted, \u201cRemand might, however, bring about a change in the result at the MERC level because the entire membership of the MERC has changed since it issued its opinion in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 893, n 2. On remand, the MERC did change its legal ruling on the ambiguity issue. Thus, the MERC\u2019s conclusion regarding ambiguity depended on the composition of the board. Yet, the majority cursorily accepts the second MERC decision as \u201cnot affected by an error of law . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 323. Also, I note that on remand, the MERC did not comment on or reverse its initial decision that the district had committed an unfair labor practice.

An indication of this ambiguity can be found in the fact that it took the MERC several lines to explain what the provision means.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
