Plaintiff American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (afscme) is a voluntary, unincorporated association that represents public employees. Plaintiffs brought suit against the Department of Mental Health and the Civil Service Commission, arguing that proposed revisions of departmental guidelines and the standard form contract, which is incorporated by reference in the guidelines and is used whenever the department contracts with private residential mental health service providers, constitute \u201crules\u201d under the apa.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argued that as such, they must be promulgated pursuant to the specific rule-making procedures of the apa.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the department to enjoin the revisions of the guidelines.

In carrying out its statutory duty, the department has for many years provided care to individuals through various state institutions and programs. In the late 1970s, the department was involved in a lawsuit concerning the care of patients in state mental hospitals. A consent decree ended that lawsuit and provided that patients be cared for \u201cin the least restrictive setting.\u201d <em>Residential Systems Co v Int\u2019l Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America, </em>unpublished decision of the NLRB, Region 7, issued April 8, 1988 (Case No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>7-EC-18329). This resulted in a mass movement of former patients of state institutions into group homes that are owned and operated by private contractors. The Mental Health Code permits the department to carry out its duty to provide care to such patients by contracting with private operators. MCL 330.1116(j); MSA 14.800(116)0).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The department has utilized a standard form contract with hundreds of group home providers for the provision of care to developmentally disabled persons who in the past were cared for directly by the department. In 1990, the department issued a notice, in the form of a \u201cproposed guideline revision,\u201d indicating proposed changes to the standard form contract that is incorporated by reference and attached to the guidelines. The express purpose of the proposed guidelines was to rescind and replace the standard form contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">While the guidelines purport to allow modification of the standard contract terms upon \u201cprior written approval of the director,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the record indicates that, in reality, group home providers may only do business with the department if they agree to the standard form contract without modifications.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The following excerpt from proceedings in the circuit court is telling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\"><em>The Court: </em>The fact of the matter is, Mr. Gartner, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, isn\u2019t this an either/or situation? The Department says, if you want to do business with us, here are the conditions of this contract, and you either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>agree with those conditions or we will not be doing business with you; isn\u2019t that a fact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-4\"><em>Mr. Gartner: </em>That\u2019s not unusual; sure, that\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\"><em>The Court: </em>My question wasn\u2019t how unusual it was, my question was, is it true that the Department says here are the standards, either you comply with them or we have no contract; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\"><em>Mr. Gartner: </em>Sure, it\u2019s true.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">In light of this background, we think it fairly obvious that the department may not do by contract what it could not do if it were providing these residential mental health services itself. If the department did not contract for these services, it would have to comply with the relevant apa procedures before making the types of substantive changes relating to the provision of care in group homes that it is attempting in the proposed guidelines and standard form contract. It defies reason to allow the department to do indirectly what it could not do directly; namely, prescribe policies and standards affecting the care it is statutorily required to provide without complying with apa procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The contract involved here is not for the provision of light bulbs, laundry services, or the proverbial widget. Rather, many of the provisions in this standard form contract, and the changes to those provisions, go to the heart of the department\u2019s statutory mandate. The following sampling of the proposed changes to the contract are instructive: (1) The omission of language requiring group homes to comply with all Department of Mental Health guidelines and directives, (2) the omission of language prohibiting certain monies intended for direct-care worker training and wages from being used for administrative employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>bonuses, (3) the omission of language requiring homes to submit staff verification reports, (4) the addition of a new provision permitting up to five percent of certain monies for direct-care workers training and wages to be used for other purposes, (5) the omission of provisions requiring certain minimum preemployment inquiries of persons applying to work at a group home, (6) the omission of a provision that required continued in-service training of direct-care staff, (7) the omission of language requiring group homes to periodically evaluate their direct-care staff in order to assess and improve their job performance, and (8) the omission of a provision requiring staff who are involved in passing out medication to successfully complete an in-service training program. It is evident from this sampling that many of the contract\u2019s provisions set forth departmental policy and standards that have a direct effect on the care provided in group homes, care that the department is statutorily mandated to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The guidelines and standard form contract constitute \u201crules\u201d within the APA definition. Pursuant to the apa, a \u201crule\u201d is: (1) \u201can agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling, or instruction of general applicability,\u201d (2) \u201cthat implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or that prescribes the organization, procedure, or practice of the agency . . . .\u201d MCL 24.207; MSA 3.560(107).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Many provisions of the standard form contract set forth the department\u2019s standards and policy concerning the care administered in group homes in the state. As such, the guidelines and contract provisions imple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ment and apply the Mental Health Code\u2019s requirement that the department provide mental health services appropriate to the public\u2019s needs and prescribe the department\u2019s procedure relevant to these services. Further, they have direct applicability to all those who reside and work in these homes. The \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d requirement does not exclude from the definition of a rule those rules that are directed at particular persons rather than the public at large. See Bonfield, State Administrative Rule Making, \u00a7 3.3.2(b), pp 78-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">The dissent concludes that the proposed guidelines and standard contract are merely \u201cguidelines\u201d or an \u201cinterpretive statement\u201d and do not constitute \u201crules\u201d because they do not affect the rights of the general public, but only the rights of those who voluntarily enter into a contractual relationship with the department. This conclusion is factually and legally in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The label an agency gives to a directive is not determinative of whether it is a rule or a guideline under the APA. <em>Detroit Base Coalition for the Human Rights of the Handicapped v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>431 Mich 172, 188; 428 NW2d 335 (1988). Instead, we must review the \u201cactual action undertaken by the directive, to see whether the policy being implemented has the effect of being a rule.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Schinzel v Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>124 Mich App 217, 219; 333 NW2d 519 (1983). See also Bienenfeld, Michigan Administrative Law, p 4-5. Likewise, an agency may not circumvent apa procedural requirements by adopting a guideline in lieu of a rule.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> MCL 24.226; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>MSA 3.560(126). Further, in order to reflect the apa\u2019s preference for policy determinations pursuant to rules, the definition of \u201crule\u201d is to be broadly construed, while the exceptions are to be narrowly construed. <em>Detroit Base Coalition, supra </em>at 183-184.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">In contrast to a rule, the apa defines a \u201cguideline\u201d as \u201can agency statement or declaration of policy which the agency intends to follow, which does not have the force or effect of law, and which binds the agency but does not bind any other person.\u201d MCL 24.203(6); MSA 3.560(103)(6). The standard form contract is not a \u201cguideline\u201d because, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertions, it does bind other persons, namely, the private group home operators who seek to provide residential mental health services under contract with the department. As noted earlier, the standard form contract is in reality an all or nothing proposition. Group home providers, many of whose sole purpose for organizing is to provide residential mental health services under contract with the department, simply do not have the bargaining power to negotiate deviations from the standard terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The contention that the standard contract is merely a guideline because it only binds providers if they voluntarily enter into a contract with the department is effectively refuted by the Court of Appeals holding in <em>Delta Co v Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>118 Mich App 458; 325 NW2d 455 (1982). In <em>Delta Co, </em>the dnr argued that the trial court erred in finding that the apa was violated when the dnr conditioned issuance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>license to operate a solid waste disposal area on \u201cguidelines, drawings and policies, and engineering expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">Here, the license was conditioned on compliance with 31 stipulations which were departmental guidelines and internal policies. Clearly, then, these guidelines were binding. Therefore, they effectively were rules under the guise of guidelines and policies. They did not fall within the exceptions to the rule. The \u201cstipulations\u201d did affect the rights and practices available to the public. The rights of the public may not be determined, nor licenses denied, on the basis of unpromulgated policies. <em>[Id. </em>at 468.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">As in the present case, the agency\u2019s directives in <em>Delta Co </em>could only be binding if the plaintiff voluntarily chose to seek licensure. However, it is clear from the Court of Appeals holding that this did not render the agency\u2019s directive to be any less binding. Similarly, the Department of Mental Health\u2019s standard form contract and guidelines are not \u201cguidelines\u201d merely because a plaintiff can choose not to contract with the department. That \u201cchoice\u201d for the plaintiff here is even more ludicrous than for the plaintiff in <em>Delta Co. </em>While the county could seek another landfill, the group home provider\u2019s sole purpose of formation is often to provide services pursuant to contract with the Department of Mental Health. By \u201cchoosing\u201d not to contract, the provider chooses to go out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The dissent also argues that the guidelines and standard contract are not rules because they are an \u201cexercise of permissive authority that is expressly excused from the apa\u2019s definition of rule.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 21. The dissent reasons that because the department may choose whether to enter into contracts for the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sion of residential services, the standard form contract cannot be a rule. The error in this reasoning is that while the department has discretion regarding <em>whether </em>to contract for the provision of statutorily mandated services, once it chooses to do so, it cannot abdicate its responsibilities under the Mental Health Code and the APA and set the standards and policies that regulate the provision of such services without complying with the apa\u2019s procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Spear v Michigan Rehabilitation Services, </em>202 Mich App 1; 507 NW2d 761 (1993), makes precisely this point. In <em>Spear, </em>the plaintiff contended that the agency reduced and terminated her benefits pursuant to an agency policy of eligibility based on need and means that should have been, but was not, adopted as a rule consistent with the requirements of the apa. The Court of Appeals agreed, reversing, in a unanimous decision, the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that because it was within the agency\u2019s discretionary powers whether to apply a \u201cneeds test\u201d for determining eligibility, the policy need not be promulgated by a rule. The Court reasoned that while the initial determination whether to apply a needs test was discretionary, once the agency decided to employ such a test, the policies implementing it were not an exercise of discretion and did constitute a rule. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">It does not constitute the decision to exercise discretionary statutory authority under subsection j, rather it is an agency policy of general applicability implementing a law enforced or administered by the agency where the agency has chosen to implement a needs test. That is, while the agency\u2019s decision to employ a needs test represents the discretionary exercise of statutory authority exempt from the definition of a rule under subsection j, the test itself, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>is developed by the agency, is not exempt from the definition of a rule and, therefore, must be promulgated as a rule in compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act. <em>[Id. </em>at 5.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">That reasoning applies equally here. While the department can choose not to contract with private group home providers in order to fulfill its duties under the Mental Health Code, once it chooses to do so, the terms of the standard form contract that govern the provision of care to group home residents that are developed and set by the department must be promulgated as a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Finally, the dissent\u2019s policy argument, <em>post </em>at 23, that requiring the guidelines and standard form contract to be promulgated as a rule would \u201csubject! ] literally thousands of present and future contracts with the state to an unnecessarily burdensome process\u201d is unconvincing for two reasons. First, only those contract provisions that serve to implement an agency\u2019s statutory duties or mission can be deemed a rule under the apa definition. Incidental contract provisions, such as for the provision of laundry services at a state mental institution, do not \u201cimplement! ] or appl[y] law enforced or administered by the agency\u201d or \u201cprescribe! ] the organization, procedure, or practice of the agency\u201d and therefore do not come within the definition of a rule.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Second, and perhaps more fundamental, it is crucial that standard contracts that prescribe an agency\u2019s policies regarding the implementation or application of its statutory duties be subjected to the democratic process contemplated by the apa. Justice Riley, in her partial concurrence and dissent in <em>Clonlara, Inc v State Bd of Ed,</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>442 Mich 230, 255-256; 501 NW2d 88 (1993), explained the important democratic function served by the APA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">In Michigan, the exercise of legislative authority duly delegated to administrative agencies is referred to as rule making, and the apa prohibits rule making without undergoing strict public scrutiny through \u201cpublic hearings, public participation, notice, approval by the joint committee on administrative rules, and preparation of statements, with intervals between each process.\u201d <em>Detroit Base Coalition for Human Rights of Handicapped v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>431 Mich 172, 178; 428 NW2d 335 (1988).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">The extensive notice and hearing procedures mandated by the apa \u201c \u2018are calculated to invite public participation in the rule-making process, prevent precipitous action by the agency, prevent the adoption of rules that are illegal or that may be beyond the legislative intent, notify affected and interested persons of the existence of the rules, and make the rules readily accessible after adoption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-190, quoting Bienenfeld, Michigan Administrative Law (1st ed), \u00a7 4, p 4-1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">More important, the APA is essential to the preservation of a democratic society. Put simply, without public oversight and scrutiny of legislative action undertaken by administrative agencies, such agencies would rule without the normal safeguards of our republic. Indeed, the apa is a bulwark of liberty by ensuring that the law is promulgated by persons accountable directly to the people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The apa\u2019s function in this regard is especially crucial here, where an agency is relegating to private entities the performance of duties it was entrusted with by statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For all these reasons, we hold that those provisions of the Department of Mental Health\u2019s proposed revised guidelines and standard form contract prescribing departmental policies for the provision of care to group home residents constitute rule making under the apa. Consequently, the department was required to follow the procedural requirements designed to afford the interested parties notice and an opportunity to be heard before implementing them. We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals decision and remand for consideration of the appropriate remedy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We further order that any contracts currently in force remain binding on the parties until the trial court reaches its ultimate disposition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Levin, Cavanagh, and Boyle, JJ., concurred with Mallett, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\"> For example, one proposed change would require that only direct-care staff \u201cwho work independently with recipients\u201d need to complete eighty credit hours of training.

Section 7 of the apa defines a \u201crale\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">\u201cRule\u201d means an agency regulation, statement, standard, policy, ruling, or instruction of general applicability that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>implements or applies law enforced or administered by the agency, or that prescribes the organization, procedure, or practice of the agency, including the amendment, suspension, or rescission thereof ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Relevant exceptions to the statutory definition of a \u201crule\u201d include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(g) An intergovernmental, interagency, or intra-agency memorandum, directive, or communication that does not affect the rights of, or procedures and practices available to, the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">G) A decision by an agency to exercise or not to exercise a permissive statutory power, although private rights or interests are affected. [MCL 24.207; MSA 3.560(107).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The revised guidelines and standard form contract used by the department are excused from the apa\u2019s rule-making procedures by virtue of these two exclusions. The guidelines do not affect the rights of the general public, but only the rights of the parties who voluntarily enter into a contractual relation with the department. Furthermore, the standard contract itself is the means and manifestation of the department\u2019s exercise of permissive statutory authority. Because the department\u2019s decision to contract with private providers is a permissive exercise of statutory power, and the guidelines do not affect the public under MCL 24.207Q); MSA 3.560(107)0), the standard contract and guidelines are not rules. Thus, I would hold that the revisions of the guidelines and standard contract do not constitute rule making, but fall under the list of statutory exceptions to the apa definition of a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>m</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The apa defines the term \u201cguideline\u201d to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">an agency statement or declaration of policy which the agency intends to follow, which does not have the force or effect of law, and which binds the agency but does not bind any other person.1<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In <em>Clonlara, Inc v State Bd of Ed, </em>442 Mich 230; 501 NW2d 88 (1993), this Court determined that compliance procedures are not rules and need not be promulgated in conformity with APA rule-making requirements even when the compliance procedures are communicated to the public.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Clonlara:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">Communication to the public does not convert an interpretive statement into an independently enforceable rule. Rather, informing the public is one of the purposes of interpretive \u201crules.\u201d \u201cInterpretive rules are statements as to what the agency thinks a statute or regulation means; they are statements issued to <em>advise </em>the public of the agency\u2019s construction of the law it administers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">Further, the fact that persons may conform their behavior to the interpretations does not mean that the interpretations are legislative rules. The \u201cpragmatic consequences\u201d of interpretive \u201crules\u201d is that they are published as \u201cdeclara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tion[s] of the proper interpretation of the law, and those affected will normally conform . . . <em>[Id. </em>at 243-244 (citations omitted). ][<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">Likewise, in the instant case, the act of supplying guidelines to those private mental health providers who choose to enter into a contractual arrangement with the department does not convert the guidelines into <em>legislative</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rules. Rather, the guidelines are interpretive<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> rules that inform providers of the standards the department expects and demands from its providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">I would further find that the use of a standard form contract, and the revisions the department chose to make to that contract by virtue of the revised guidelines, is an exercise of permissive authority that is expressly excused from the apa\u2019s definition of rule. MCL 24.207Q); MSA 3.560(107)0). Indeed, the Legislature has granted the department permissive statutory power to contract with any public, or nonpublic entity to provide residential services for mentally disabled persons. As a public entity, the department could choose to provide these constitutionally and statutorily mandated services itself, or it could exercise its permissive authority to contract these services out. Similarly, none of the potential providers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>are bound to provide services to the department, nor are they prohibited from \u201chard bargaining\u201d for terms different from those offered in the standard contract.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, modifications to the standard contract are authorized pursuant to provisions within the guidelines.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">This Court has, in the past, discussed the highway department\u2019s use of standard specifications in highway construction contracts. <em>Greenfield Construction Co v State Hwy Dep\u2019t, </em>402 Mich 172; 261 NW2d 718 (1978).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Justice Coleman\u2019s concurrence expressed her concerns with some of her brethren advocating an abandonment of standard specifications for state contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">[A]nalysis would force state agencies either to discard standard specifications or move to adopt them as rales under the APA. The former is inefficient, costly in both time and money. The latter is cumbersome and would subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the policy and contract decisions of state agencies to frequent circuit court review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">- This last point is of great concern to me. Our decision cannot be limited to the highway department. It would apply to all the many agencies of state government. It would significantly increase the caseload of an already overburdened circuit court. Delay, confusion, frustration are predictable. <em>[Id. </em>at 199.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In the instant case, the majority\u2019s finding, that the guidelines and standard contract are rule making, subjects literally thousands of present and future contracts with the state to an unnecessarily burdensome process.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As this Court recently recognized, agency action statutorily exempted from the apa definition of a \u201crule\u201d represents the Legislature\u2019s best effort to balance the need for adequate procedural protections for rule adoption with \u201cthe conflicting need for workable, efficient, economical, and effective government on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the other.\u201d <em>Detroit Base Coalition for the Human Rights of the Handicapped v Social Services Dep\u2019t, </em>431 Mich 172, 184; 428 NW2d 335 (1988), citing Bon-field, State Administrative Rule Making, p 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s finding, the revised guidelines and standard form contract do not constitute \u201crules\u201d within the definition of the apa. Defendant Department of Mental Health\u2019s choice of whom to contract with is a permissive exercise of its statutory power. Should plaintiffs seek such a contractual relationship, they are free within the parameters of bargaining to change or accept any of the terms of the proposed contract, and, upon acceptance and receipt of the contract, the terms of the guidelines. Because the guidelines and standard contract do not constitute \u201crules\u201d and are exempt from the formal adoption requirements of the APA, I dissent and would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b114-8\">Brickley, C.J., and Riley, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-7\"> 206 Mich App 382; 522 NW2d 657 (1994).
