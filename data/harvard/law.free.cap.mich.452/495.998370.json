The Court of Appeals, in an unpublished opinion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirmed the decision of the circuit court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">In 1983, Rivergate Manor applied to the Michigan Department of Public Health, pursuant to part 221 of the Public Health Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a certificate of need to permit it to construct a 223-bed nursing home in the City of Riverview. The department denied Rivergate\u2019s application on the ground that it had failed to show a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>need for the proposed home in the subarea where Riverview is situated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The Certificate of Need Board reversed the department\u2019s decision and, in October, 1987, issued a certif\u00ed-cate of need to Rivergate.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Rivergate then entered into an agreement with Senior Services Development Associates to transfer its common stock to Senior Services for $125,000 if Rivergate was able to have the certificate of need amended to allow construction of a nursing home in Westland,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is located in a different subarea than Riverview.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In July 1990, Rivergate communicated with the Department of Public Health in an effort to have the certificate of need modified. The department responded that the certificate of need was site specific and not transferable. After Rivergate asked for clarification, a department representative responded that because the certificate had been granted by the Certificate of Need Board and not by the department, the department was \u201cwithout authority\u201d to modify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Rivergate then requested a modification of the certificate from the Certificate of Need Board, explaining why it thought it would be appropriate for the board to modify the certificate of need to allow the project to be built in the northwest Wayne, rather than the southwest Wayne, subarea. On October 2, 1990, the board held a public meeting at which Rivergate\u2019s request was discussed in some depth. Twenty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>later, the board granted Rivergate the requested modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">After the release of the board\u2019s decision, Rivergate and Senior Services completed the sale of Rivergate\u2019s common stock at a lower purchase price. The closing included an immediate nonrefundable payment of $25,000 from Senior Services to Rivergate.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">On January 16, 1991, the Department of Public Health filed a complaint in the Ingham Circuit Court, seeking an order of superintending control over the Certificate of Need Board on the ground that the procedure it employed in reviewing Rivergate\u2019s request was contrary to law. After both parties filed motions for summary disposition, the circuit court granted summary disposition for the department under MCR 2.116(C)(10). Stating that the board must \u201cact in accordance with law and only to the extent of its statutory authority,\u201d the court vacated the board\u2019s order granting the modification of Rivergate\u2019s certificate of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We first consider whether the circuit court had jurisdiction under the circumstances to superintend the Certificate of Need Board. We conclude that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Revised Judicature Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provide that the circuit court has superintending control over inferior courts and tribunals subject to rules promulgated by this Court. This power of superintending control, enforced by an order of superintending control,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is available only in a limited number of circumstances. \u201cAn order of superintending control . . . traditionally has been used only to determine \u2018if the inferior tribunal, upon the record made, had jurisdiction, whether or not it exceeded that jurisdiction and proceeded according to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re People v Burton, </em>429 Mich 133, 139; 413 NW2d 413 (1987), quoting <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>386 Mich 672; 194 NW2d 693 (1972).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">An order of superintending control will not be granted when the party seeking the order is entitled to pursue an appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor will an order of superintending control be issued where the petitioner seeks to employ the court\u2019s power to superintend as a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>stitute for an appeal or to evade a statutory prohibition of an appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Both parties concede that the Department of Public Health is precluded by statute from appealing the Certificate of Need Board\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The department asserted in its complaint for superintending control that \u201cthe CON Board has acted contrary to law,\u201d and \u201cviolated its clear legal duty\u201d by making its decision to modify Rivergate\u2019s certificate of need without observing the requisite procedural safeguards. The department did not take issue with the substantive merits of the board\u2019s decision to modify Rivergate\u2019s certificate. We conclude that under the circumstances, the circuit court had jurisdiction to consider the department\u2019s complaint seeking superintending control.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Rivergate and Senior Services assert that an order of superintending control nevertheless is not available, arguing that \u201csuperintending control is an inappropriate remedy where an appeal has been specifically precluded by the Legislature.\u201d They rely on <em>In re People v Burton, </em>in which this Court concluded that the Court of Appeals improperly exercised superin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tending control authority when it reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>In re People v Burton </em>and <em>Michigan Affiliated Healthcare System v Dep\u2019t of Public Health, </em>209 Mich App 699; 531 NW2d 722 (1995), also cited by River-gate and Senior Services, dealt with situations in which superintending control was sought to review a lower court\u2019s or tribunal\u2019s decision on the merits, not to inquire whether a lower court or tribunal had the authority to act in the manner in which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The situation here is somewhat similar to that in <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, supra </em>at 684. There, the judge had the power or jurisdiction to amend the information to add a related offense with a lesser penalty, and to accept a plea of guilty to the lesser offense, but did so without the consent, and over the objection, of the prosecutor. This Court held that because the \u201cjudge acted without authority in amending the information over the objection of the prosecutor,\u201d a writ of superintending control would issue vacating the decision of the judge. We conclude, as set forth in part ih(a), that the Certificate of Need Board has the power (jurisdiction) to modify a certificate of need, but, as set forth in part m(B), failed to notify the department and minimally provide it with an opportunity to object to the modification. The board, much like the Genesee circuit judge, \u201cacted without authority in amending\u201d (modifying) the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We turn to the question whether the circuit court, which we have found had jurisdiction to issue an order of superintending control, properly exercised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>its power in this case. \u201cWhether an order of superintending control should issue depends upon the circumstances in the specific case.\u201d <em>In re People v Burton, supra </em>at 142. We conclude that the Certificate of Need Board exceeded its authority when it granted the requested modification without observing the requisite procedural safeguards. The circuit court acted properly in issuing the order of superintending control order under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The Department of Public Health argues that the Certificate of Need Board lacked the power to modify Rivergate\u2019s certificate of need. There is, indeed, nothing in part 221 of the Public Health Code that explicitly stated that the board is provided such power. The closest the act came to addressing the authority to modify was \u00a7 22123(2)(d), which provided that the Department of Public Health was to promulgate rules necessary to implement part 221, which could \u201cinclude: . . . [t]he duration, <em>modification, </em>and extension of certificates issued under this part.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The absence of an explicit grant of authority is not dispositive. This Court, in <em>Coffman v State Bd of Examiners in Optometry, </em>331 Mich 582, 590; 50 NW2d 322 (1951), said \u201cpowers [of administrative boards] are limited by the statutes creating them to those conferred expressly <em>or by necessary or fair implication.\u201d </em>Quoting 42 Am Jur, \u00a7 26, pp 316 ff (emphasis added). The Certificate of Need Board, by necessary and fair implication, had the power to modify a certificate of need that it had previously granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The language of \u00a7 22123(2)(d) respecting \u201cmodification\u201d evidences that the Legislature intended that the power to modify certificates of need would be exercised by some administrative body, either the Certificate of Need Board or the Department of Public Health. The department\u2019s failure to promulgate rules clarifying under what circumstances, if any, a certificate of need may be modified, does not negate the legislative expectation that, in appropriate circumstances, modification is permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">We conclude that the Certificate of Need Board, the tribunal that issued the certificate of need, had the authority to modify its earlier decision. \u201cEvery tribunal, judicial or administrative, has some power to correct its own errors or otherwise appropriately to modify its judgment, decree, or order.\u201d 2 Davis, Administrative Law, \u00a7 18.09, p 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Although the Certificate of Need Board possessed the power to modify its decision, it was required to exercise that power in an appropriate manner. In this case, the board was presented with a request to change the specifics of the original certificate, to substitute a new location in a different subarea for the original, and to modify the project costs. This was not a minor or insignificant request. To the contrary, when a request for modification by the certificate holder seeks permission to build the proposed facility in a different subarea, all prior considerations regarding need, made by the board in the context of the original application, are rendered largely irrelevant. The central statutory issue whether there is a need, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the question at the core of the certification process,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> must be reevaluated, focusing on the new locale.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Section 22121(3) provided that the appeals hearing held by the Certificate of Need Board \u201cshall be conducted pursuant to the administrative procedures act of 1969.\u201d MCL 333.22121(3); MSA 14.15(22121)(3). It is not claimed that the 1987 board hearing failed to satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The modification hearing conducted by the board did not, however, comply with the Administrative Procedures Act. While it may not be necessary to observe APA procedural requirements when the modification issue is relatively minor, when the issue involves a change in subarea, the board was required to observe the same standards required in the initial review. A request for modification involving a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>subarea raises the same need-related issues that were present in the earlier appeals hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The hearing conducted by the board to review Rivergate\u2019s and Senior Services\u2019 request for modification failed to observe the APA requirements in two respects. First, no notice of Rivergate\u2019s request to modify was given to anyone at the Department of Public Health.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The request was only added to the October 2, 1990, agenda after the board\u2019s meeting had already begun. This was contrary to apa, \u00a7 82.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, the board\u2019s brief decision granting the requested modification did not include \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of law,\u201d nor was it \u201csupported by and in accordance with the competent, material, and substantial evidence\u201d as required by \u00a7 85. Rather, the board released a decision that only served to provide notice of the outcome and, as is clear from a reading of the transcript of the hearing, the decision was based solely on the representations of Rivergate\u2019s agent that the Westland subarea was in need of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">We now address Rivergate\u2019s and Senior Services\u2019 contention that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed because the department\u2019s complaint for superintending control was barred by laches and equitable estoppel or, in the alternative, because the department lacks the authority to challenge the Certificate of Need Board\u2019s approval of Rivergate\u2019s modification request because it failed to promulgate a state medical facilities plan as required by the certificate of need statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Rivergate and Senior Services base their laches claim on the department\u2019s eighty-six-day delay before filing a complaint seeking superintending control. In the interim, the two apparently finalized their transaction with Senior Services, paying Rivergate a nonrefundable down payment of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The doctrine of laches is a tool of equity that may remedy \u201c \u2018the general inconvenience resulting from delay in the assertion of a legal right which it is practicable to assert.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lenawee Co v Nutten, </em>234 Mich 391, 396; 208 NW 613 (1926). It is applicable in cases in which there is an unexcused or unexplained delay in commencing an action and a corresponding change of material condition that results in prejudice to a party. <em>Lothian v Detroit, </em>414 Mich 160, 168; 324 NW2d 9 (1982); <em>McGregor v Carney, </em>271 Mich 278, 280; 260 NW 163 (1935); 11A Callaghan\u2019s Michigan Pleading &amp; Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 92.12, p 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Assuming that the department\u2019s delay in filing its complaint for superintending control can be considered unacceptably long, we conclude that the doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>trine of laches does not invalidate the decision of the circuit court because Rivergate and Senior Services cannot show sufficient prejudice. The basis for the claim that Rivergate and Senior Services suffered harm from the delay is Senior Services\u2019 assertion that it has already paid a nonrefundable $25,000 down payment to Rivergate, and is obligated to purchase Rivergate\u2019s now worthless common stock for $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Equity, by its veiy nature, requires the weighing of often competing interests to reach an outcome that is fair and just to all involved. Even if Senior Services\u2019 assertion that it will lose $25,000 and is obligated to pay another $100,000 because of its agreement with Rivergate is accurate, we are unable to conclude that such a result is \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cunjust\u201d in the light of the comparatively greater injustice to the citizenry of licensing a health care facility in what may well be an already over-bedded region. See <em>Bennington Twp v Maple River Inter-Co Drain Bd, </em>149 Mich App 579, 588; 386 NW2d 599 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Rivergate and Senior Services also assert that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed by the application of the doctrine of equitable estop-pel. Because equitable estoppel, like laches, requires a showing of prejudice, we similarly reject Rivergate\u2019s and Senior Services\u2019 equitable estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Finally, Rivergate Manor and Senior Services contend that the Court of Appeals decision should be reversed because the Department of Public Health is powerless to challenge the Certificate of Need Board\u2019s approval of Rivergate\u2019s requested modifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>tions because the department failed to properly publish a state medical facilities plan.

Both were intended to contain rising health care costs and avoid unneces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>sary duplication of facilities and services while continuing to provide for the health of citizens. See Shannon, <em>Certificate of need: Where it has been and where it is going, </em>67 Mich B J 592 (1988). The Legislature declared that the certificate of need program was established in order to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">(a) Provide for <em>review and determination of need </em>before new institutional health services, facilities, and organizations are offered or developed or substantial expenditures are undertaken in preparation for the offering or development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">(b) Provide that <em>only needed services, facilities, and organizations </em>shall be offered or developed in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">(c) Meet the policies and procedures governing the issuance of certificates of need required for projects under federal grant-in-aid programs and federal loan guarantee programs. [MCL 333.22111; MSA 14.15(22111) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The Court of Appeals has noted that the <em>underlying purpose </em>of the legislation was <em>to prevent </em>\u201cthe construction of unneeded health facilities.\u201d <em>Greenbriar Convalescent Center, Inc v Public Health Dep\u2019t, </em>108 Mich App 553, 558; 310 NW2d 812 (1981). To that end, the state established subareas designated by county, except Wayne, which is divided into three subareas. Determinations of the existence of a need for health facilities was then evaluated by subarea. MCL 333.22131(1); MSA 14.15(22131)(1) established a litany of criteria that the department and a health systems agency must consider when determining whether to issue a certificate of need. The criteria is weighted on a scale of one to three.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>criteria were given a weight of three, i.e., \u201cvery important\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">(c) <em>The need of the population served </em>or to be served for the health care facilities or services being reviewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(d) The feasibility and availability of less costly alternatives or more effective methods of providing the health care facilities or services being reviewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">(e) The relationship of the health care facilities or services being reviewed to the existing health care systems of the health services <em>areas </em>in which the facilities or services are provided or proposed, including the probable impact on the costs of providing health services in the <em>areas </em>served. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Mindful of the evaluating criteria and, hence, the specific purposes of the legislation, we must closely review Rivergate\u2019s request in this case. After the department denied Rivergate\u2019s certificate of need, Rivergate appealed to the Certificate of Need Board. On October 28, 1987, the board granted a certificate of need to Rivergate, stating that \u201c[t]his project involves the construction of a long-term care facility which would be licensed for 200 long-term nursing care beds and 23 home for the aged beds. The facility would be located on a site which fronts on Pennsylvania Avenue and is adjacent to Fort Street in Riv-erview (Wayne County).\u201d In 1990, Rivergate requested that the location of the project be changed from the City of Riverview to the City of Westland, which is located in a different subarea, and changed the project costs from $5.4 million to approximately $7 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Rivergate\u2019s request to change the subarea in the existing. certificate of need would require a totally new evaluation using the criteria listed in MCL 333.22131(1); MSA 14.15(22131)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This request for \u201cmodification\u201d strikes at the very heart of the legislation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given that the entire purpose of the legislation was to control the number of beds in a given subarea, to allow such a modification by amendment of an existing certificate of need would frustrate the purpose of the act. Such a modification would not only extend the \u201cscope\u201d of the project,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it contemplates a totally new project that would require a wholly new determination of the need for such a facility in the proposed subarea. This would require the same process previously used by Rivergate to obtain the original certificate of need. Accordingly, Rivergate\u2019s request to build a facility in a different subarea should have been in the form of a new certificate of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Finally, having characterized Rivergate\u2019s request as more than a mere modification or amendment, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>unnecessary for me to decide whether the Certificate of Need Board had the authority to modify the certificate of need. In this case, the board exceeded its authority by approving what was essentially a new certificate of need. The request to change subareas should have been in the form of a new certificate of need submitted to the department and then, if denied, appealed to the Certificate of Need Board. Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals on this basis.</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-5\">Weaver, J., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> See 1986 AACS, R 325.9208.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> See <em>Downriver Nursing Associates v Public Health Dep\u2019t, </em>193 Mich App 594; 484 NW2d 748 (1992), in which the Court of Appeals rejected the argument that a certificate of need could be modified to change the site of a proposed nursing home even though the proposed change was within the same subarea as the specified city in the original certificate of need.
