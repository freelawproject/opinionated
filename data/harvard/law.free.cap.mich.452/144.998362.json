Twenty-five percent of the Big Boy restaurants are company owned and operated. The remaining seventy-five percent are franchised. Food for both company-owned and franchised restaurants is produced at a facility called the Commissary, which Elias Brothers owns and operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We are asked to determine whether the cost of equipment and supplies used at Elias Brothers\u2019 Commissary for production of food and beverages for its company-owned restaurants is exempt from use tax.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find that Elias Brothers is exempt from use tax for these costs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The Department of Treasury allowed Elias Brothers\u2019 industrial processing exemption claim only with regard to the equipment and supply costs attributable to its franchised restaurants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The department denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>an exemption for the proportionate cost of equipment and supplies attributable to company-owned stores. It claimed such cost was incurred in the \u201cpreparation of food and beverages by a retailer for retail sale,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which is specifically excluded from the industrial processing exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In response to the department\u2019s assessment, Elias Brothers filed a use tax assessment appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Tax Tribunal canceled the tax assessments by the department and found that Elias Brothers could claim an industrial processing exemption with respect to the cost of the food processing equipment and related supplies attributable to production of goods for company-owned restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The department appealed the Tax Tribunal\u2019s opinion in the Court of Appeals. In an unpublished opinion per curiam, the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">We hold that Elias Brothers is entitled to an industrial processing exemption for the cost of equipment and supplies used by the Commissary and attributable to company-owned restaurants. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Commissary is a 250,000 square foot food processing and distribution facility located in Warren, Michigan. The Commissary produces virtually all the food and beverages prepared and ultimately sold to consumers at both company-owned and retail restaurants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The food-processing equipment used by the Commissary is of a type and size not found in a typical restaurant, but in a food-processing business that sells to retail establishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The department concedes that Elias Brothers is an industrial processor with respect to the Commissary\u2019s production for franchised restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Elias Brothers treats the Commissary as a distinct operation and profit center, separate from its company-owned restaurants. It is physically separate and distinct from any individual restaurant. Elias Brothers maintains separate billing records, income statements, and asset listings for the Commissary.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The Commissary\u2019s internal procedures and operations are the same both for company-owned and franchised restaurants. Its ordering, processing, handling, delivery, invoicing, billing, and sales procedures are identical for company-owned and franchised restaurants. The two types of restaurants pay the same price for the food and beverages processed by the Commissary.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The department asserts that Elias Brothers cannot claim an industrial processing exemption when it produces food and beverages at the Commissary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>then transfers them to customers in company-owned restaurants. According to the department, when Elias Brothers \u201csells\u201d or transfers to itself, it is merely a \u201cretailer\u201d preparing its own food for retail sale and, therefore, is specifically excluded from the industrial processing exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Whether the cost of equipment and supplies used by the Commissary attributable to company-owned restaurants is exempt under the \u201cindustrial processing\u201d exemption or excluded from the exemption by the restaurant food preparation exclusion, as the \u201cpreparation of food and beverages by a retailer for retail sale,\u201d both contained in \u00a7 4(g)(1) of the Use Tax Act, is a question of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As currently written, \u00a7 4(g) (i) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">The tax levied does not apply to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">(g) Property sold to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">(i) An industrial processor for use or consumption in industrial processing .... <em>Industrial processing does not include ... the preparation of food and beverages by a retailer for retail sale. </em>As used in this subdivision, \u201cindustrial processor\u201d means a person who transforms, alters, or modifies tangible personal property by changing the form, composition, or character of the property for ultimate, sale at retail or sale to another industrial processor to be further processed for ultimate sale at retail.1<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Because tax exemptions are disfavored, the burden of proving entitlement to an exemption rests on Elias Brothers, the party asserting the right to the exemption. <em>Tercheck v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>171 Mich App 508, 510-511; 431 NW2d 208 (1988). While we recognize that tax exemptions are strictly construed against the taxpayer because exemptions represent the antithesis of tax equality, we interpret statutory language according to common and approved usage,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> unless such construction is inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Understanding the purpose of, and the distinction between, the industrial processing exemption and the restaurant food preparation exclusion is crucial to the resolution of the controversy before this Court. Because the act fails to define key terms within the statute, and because the application of the statute to the facts presented is ambiguous, it is necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>ascertain the legislative intent behind the industrial processing exemption:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The act does not define the terms \u201cretailer\u201d or \u201cretail sale.\u201d Neither does it explain the distinction between industrial processing and the mere act of food and beverage \u201cpreparation,\u201d which falls under the restaurant food preparation exclusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Having no statutory definition of \u201cretailer,\u201d the department has broadly defined the term to include \u201call persons who sell to the last or final buyer, user or consumer.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Such administrative interpretations are accorded deference. However, the department\u2019s definition of retailer, as applied in this case, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>unfairly broaden the scope of the restaurant food preparation exclusion<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, ultimately, contravene legislative intent, as shown below.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">The industrial processing exemption is, in part, the product of a targeted legislative effort to avoid double taxation of the end product offered for retail sale or, in other terms, to avoid \u201cpyramiding the use and sales tax.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Pyramiding occurs when both use and sales taxes are imposed on the production and sale of retail goods. A 1987 Senate Fiscal Agency bill analysis described the purpose of the industrial processing exemption as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">[I]f the end product is taxed, the components used or consumed in its production are not taxed so that the product is not subject to double taxation.'<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">If this Court were to apply the department\u2019s definition literally, Elias Brothers would be subject both to sales and use tax on each food item or beverage sold at the company-owned restaurants. However, production costs and sales to franchisees would not be subject to such tax \u201cpyramiding\u201d despite the identical prices charged and procedures employed by the Commissary, such as in production, invoicing, and delivery. Because there was no showing that Elias Brothers would gain an unfair competitive advantage or a windfall if exempted, the department\u2019s assessment appears to contravene the clear and fundamental leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>islative intent to avoid a pyramiding of sales and use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Because the Use Tax Act fails to define terms central to the inquiry, it is instructive to look to the Sales Tax Act.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The provisions in the Sales Tax Act are relevant to use tax determinations because the sales and use tax provisions are complementary and supplementary.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Both statutes contain a \u201crecognition in each of the provisions and operation of the other.\u201d <em>Don McCullagh, Inc v Revenue </em>Dep\u2019t, 354 Mich 413, 425; 93 NW2d 252 (1958).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The Sales Tax Act has an industrial processing exemption identical to the industrial processing exemption for the use tax.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Sales Tax Act defines a \u201csale at retail\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>[A] transaction by which the ownership of tangible personal property is transferred for consideration, if .the trans- \u2022 fer is made in the ordinary course of the transferor\u2019s business and is made to the transferee for consumption or use, <em>or for any purpose other than for resale . . . J</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em>1</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Because the company-owned restaurants purchase the Commissary\u2019s goods for the sole purpose of <em>resale </em>to customers, the Commissary\u2019s transfer to company-owned stores is not a <em>sale at retail </em>under this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Under the Sales Tax Act, the right to an exemption is not decided by \u201cwhat type of business the taxpayer is engaged in, but rather upon what use his patron or customer makes of the product which the taxpayer sells.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Research &amp; Development Corp v Revenue Dep\u2019t, 25 </em>Mich App 8, 11; 181 NW2d 53 (1970). In this case, both company-owned and franchised restaurants purchase almost all wholesale items from the Commissary at the same price and for subsequent retail sale to patrons. Both company-owned and franchised restaurant patrons constitute \u201cthe last or final buyer, user, or consumer.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Consequently, Elias Brothers is not a retailer and does not make a sale at retail when its Commissary produces goods and transfers them to company-owned restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Nevertheless, the department claims Elias Brothers is a retailer when its Commissary transfers to company-owned restaurants because intracorporate sales are not taxable events. It further claims the only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u201csale,\u201d the character of which determines whether the Commissary\u2019s activity falls under the industrial processing exemption or the restaurant food preparation exclusion, occurs when Elias Brothers\u2019 company-owned restaurants make retail sales to their customers. We disagree. Nowhere in the statute is there a requirement that there must be a \u201csale\u201d by the industrial processor to qualify for this exemption.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Elias Brothers has established that transfers to company stores do not go unrecognized, but are accounted for and effectuated in the same manner as transfers or sales to franchised restaurants.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the statutory language and the facts of this case, the department\u2019s distinction between the Commissary\u2019s transfer to company-owned restaurants and franchisees is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Contrary to the position of the department, the industrial processing exemption does not depend on the nature or existence of a transaction between the processor and the retailer. Rather, the application of the industrial processing exemption depends on the use to which equipment is put. The intent of the Legislature in enacting the restaurant food preparation exclusion supports this conclusion. In 1969 the department and the Senate Taxation Committee adopted a bill analysis that made the following comment regarding the purpose of the restaurant food preparation exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u25a0 The purpose of this amendment is to limit the exemption to persons who are actually engaged in the manufacturing of a product for resale!<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">This bill analysis indicates that the cost of equipment and supplies purchased by manufacturers is exempt only if used for activities that are integral in industrial processing. The bill analysis in no way suggests that the restaurant food preparation exclusion should apply to a company simply because that company has a retailing division.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Thus, to determine whether the industrial processing exemption applies, it is necessary to consider the activity in which the equipment is engaged and not the character of the equipment-owner\u2019s business. The department admits that Elias Brothers is entitled to the industrial processing exemption for the portion of production dedicated to franchisees. Elias Brothers\u2019 Commissary uses equipment in the same manner and for the same purpose when it prepares goods that are identical for its company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants. This Court finds that when Elias Brothers processes and transfers to company-owned restaurants, it uses the Commissary\u2019s equipment in a manner covered by the industrial processing exemption, rather than the restaurant food preparation exclusion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Finally, because this Court finds that Elias Brothers\u2019 Commissary is an entirely separate and distinct operation, the exemption applies to the Commissary\u2019s equipment \u201cactually engaged in the manufacturing of a product for eventual resale\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> to company-owned restaurants. Michigan common law recognizes that taxpayers often engage in both taxable and nontaxable transactions. As long as taxpayers operate and substantiate the nontaxable activity in a distinct, identifiable, and clearly severable manner, Michigan courts uphold exemptions for the portion of exempt activity. See <em>RCA Service Co Div v Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>135 Mich App 807; 355 NW2d 679 (1984). See also <em>Kal-Aero v Treasury </em>Dep\u2019t, 123 Mich App 46; 333 NW2d 171 (1983). Elias Brothers engages in both industrial processing and retail sales with respect to its ownership and operation of company-owned restaurants. While Elias Brothers is a single corporate entity, the Commissary is physically, operationally, and financially distinct and separate from Elias Brothers\u2019 company-owned restaurants.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The distinct, iden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>tillable, and clearly severable activity of the Commissary entitles Elias Brothers to an industrial processing exemption for equipment and supply costs associated with production for company-owned, restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Given the particular circumstances of this taxpayer and the legislative intent of the industrial processing exemption, we hold that Elias Brothers is entitled to the industrial processing exemption for the cost of equipment and supplies used by the Commissary in production for company-owned restaurants. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b249-6\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin and Riley, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-8\"> Michigan Use Tax Act, 1937 PA 94, MCL 205.91 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 7.555(1) <em>et seq. </em>The Use Tax Act, as amended, is an \u201cexcise\u201d or \u201cprivilege\u201d tax that covers transactions not subject to the general sales tax. <em>Tercheck </em>v <em>Treasury Dep\u2019t, </em>171 Mich App 508, 510; 431 NW2d 208 (1988).

See, generally, <em>HED, Inc v Powers, </em>84 NC App 292; 352 SE2d 265 (1987) (equipment used to prepare food items sold <em>on premises </em>of individual restaurant was not exempt from use tax); <em>McDonald\u2019s Corp v Oklahoma Tax Comm, </em>563 P2d 635, 636 (Okla, 1977) (shake station, central island counter drink dispenser, and soda factory, grills, toasters, french fry assembly, etc., were not equipment used \u201cin manufacturing or processing\u201d).

The New York court\u2019s determination was based on New York State Tax Law 1115(a)(12), which exempts from use tax, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">(m)achinery or equipment for use or consumption <em>directly and predominantly </em>in the production of <em>tangible personal property . . . for sale, by manufacturing </em>.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">That court held that the requisite sale occurred only at retail stores at which time processed goods were \u201crestaurant food,\u201d which, under New York common law, was not \u201ctangible personal property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806. Therefore, the court denied any exemption from use tax for the cost of equipment and supplies, but allowed a twenty-four percent deduction for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>cost of electricity, etc., used in producing goods sold to independent restaurants.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Michigan\u2019s industrial processing exemption is significantly different from New York\u2019s exemption, and, if applied to similar facts, would arguably dictate a different outcome. Michigan\u2019s industrial processing exemption does not require \u201cdirect and predominant use\u201d of \u201cequipment\u201d in production. Michigan\u2019s industrial processing exemption applies to costs for equipment <em>and supplies </em>used, at some point, in the production process. Michigan\u2019s exemption requires an \u201cultimate sale,\u201d as distinguished from New York\u2019s requirement that there be a direct \u201csale, by manufacturing.\u201d Finally, Michigan' law does not currently impose a strict distinction between restaurant food processing and tangible personal property.

However, if not all the departmental operations are really engaged in manufacturing-type processes, but instead are engaged in service-type food preparation, then the industrial processing exemption should not apply.

[Anno: <em>What constitutes manufacturing and who is a manufacturer under tax laws, </em>17 ALR3d 7, \u00a7 3, pp 23-25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Similarly, the use tax statute provides that an \u201cindustrial processor\u201d is one who \u201ctransforms, alters, or modifies tangible personal property.\u201d MCL 205.94(g); MSA 7.555(4)(g). As a rule, restaurant food is not considered to be tangible personal prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>erty because it is a combination of food <em>and service * </em>Additionally, industrial processing means \u201cchanging the form, composition, or character of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>What the Department of Treasury and the majority have failed to address is whether all the instant taxpayer\u2019s activities are really \u201cchanging the form, composition, or character\u201d of the food products with which it starts into something different, as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">FOOD AND BEVERAGE PREPARATION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The use tax statute excepts from the industrial processing exemption retail food and beverage preparation. MCL 205.94(g); MSA 7.555(4)(g).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The underlying rationale is that many techniques for preparing and cooking various foods are not manufacturing-type processes, but rather service-type activities. See 17 ALR3d 7, \u00a7 29, pp 76-83.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Perhaps more significantly, the industrial processing exemption also now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>expressly excepts \u201c[s]ales to a person performing a service who does not act as an industrial processor while performing the service . . . MCL 205.94(g)(i); MSA 7.555(4)(g)(i). I believe that in deciding whether the taxpayer will be entitled to the industrial processing exemption, in whole or in part, the focus should be on the statutory distinction between manufacturing-type processing and service activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Many courts have addressed various food production methods in relation to tax law. The <em>process </em>by which a taxpayer changes the starting product into the final product determines whether the taxpayer is engaged in a manufacturing-type activity or merely food preparation service activity. My research has revealed what can be described as a continuum, with highly technical operations at one end qualifying as manufacturing-type processes,* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and simple washing and serving at the other end being labeled as simple food preparation activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">An instructive case is <em>Phillips Harborplace, Inc v State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation, </em>65 Md App 461; 501 A2d 92 (1985). There, the restaurant specialized in crab dishes.

The character of the product\u2014 its freshness, its natural taste \u2014 enforces this linkage. Stuff-ings and other additives may enhance the flavor of the food, but do not change its essential character. The reason fish, crabs, and the like are delivered to Phillips is that they will be used as food, and this use remains unchanged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">We hold that it would be stretching the plain and popular meaning of the word past its breaking point if we were to say that appellant uses its kitchen equipment in the \u201cmanufacturing\u201d of seafood.

Consequently, the court determined that processing honey was not manufacturing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Likewise, preparing salads and similar foods, including potato, macaroni, bean, and egg salads, pudding, and clam chowder, have been found not to be manufacturing because the final product retains the same essential qualities as its ingredients. <em>Van Bennett Food Co v City of Reading, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>87 Pa Commw 30, 37-38; 486 A2d 1025 (1985), explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">Thus, we must determine first whether the preparation methods used for the food products at issue consists of the application of a high degree of skill, science and labor; and second, whether there has been a substantial transformation in form, qualities and adaptability in use so as to produce a new, different and useful article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">With respect to the food products at issue in the instant case, the record indicates that the preparation of cole slaw, pepper cabbage, health salad, tuna salad, and cranberry relish all involve a similar process consisting of cutting, chopping or dicing the primary ingredients, blending them together in a prepared dressing and packaging the final product. We do not find that the preparation of these products constitutes \u201cmanufacturing\u201d as that term has been defined. We fail to see how the preparation of these products requires a high degree of skill, science or labor. It can certainly be done in the home on a smaller scale. <em>Moreover, although the method of preparation altered the size, shape and, in some instances, color of the original ingredients, these ingredients had not been changed to new and useful articles, substantially different in qualities and adaptability in use. The ingredients retained their same essential qualities and surely the final product is not to be put to a use not intended for the original ingredients. </em>[Emphasis added, citation omitted.][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ELIAS BROTHERS</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In the instant case, the parties stipulated that \u201c[t]he food processing activities include a bakery, meat department, sandwich department, ice cream plant, seafood processing department, and a department that produces soup, salad dressing, and pie fillings.\u201d Rather than viewing the Commissary as a single entity, as the majority and the Department of Treasury have done, I think it should have been broken down into departments, with each department analyzed in accord with the cases discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Additionally, I would reject the majority\u2019s rationale that a taxpayer can escape otherwise applicable use taxes simply because it performs the taxable activity at another site and creates a sufficient paper trail to document \u201ctransfer\u201d of the food to the site of the sale to the consumer. This argument was rejected in <em>In re Marriott Family Restaurants v New York Tax Appeals Tribunal, </em>174 AD2d 805; 570 NYS2d 741 (1991). There, the taxpayer manufactured a variety of food products for restaurants. It shipped seventy-six percent of its products to its own restaurants and twenty-four percent to other restaurants operated by licensees. The New York taxing authority allowed a manufacturing exemption from use tax for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>twenty-four percent, but disallowed it for the seventy-six percent. The taxpayer argued that all the activity should be exempt because \u201cthe food [wa]s processed in a manufacturing facility that [wa]s entirely separate and distinct from the restaurant premises where the food [wa]s ultimately sold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807. The court affirmed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">Notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s argument to the contrary, we find nothing irrational in respondent\u2019s interpretation insofar as it results in similar treatment for machinery and equipment regardless of whether it is used in processing food on the restaurant premises or at a separate facility. <em>Whether the food is processed at a separate facility belonging to petitioner and shipped to petitioner\u2019s restaurants for final preparation or the food processing and preparation occurs entirely within the restaurant, the taxable event is the sale in the restaurant of a combination of food and service, which respondent could rationally view as a \u201chybrid\u201d transaction rather than the sale of tangible personal property </em>.... <em>[Id. </em>at 807-808 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In contrast, the majority here would arguably allow a restaurant to move its kitchen across the street, or even next door, to a \u201cphysically\u201d distinct location, and, as long as it creates a sufficient paper trail of \u201csales\u201d to itself, it will escape otherwise applicable use taxes because its kitchen is a \u201cdistinct, identifiable, and clearly severable activity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 158-159.
