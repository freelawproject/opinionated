The relevant section of the statute leaves the decision to allow grandparent visitation to the discretion of the parents of the grandchild, whether they are married or unmarried, as long as the parents are living and at least one parent has custody of the grandchild.

At the time of Dustin\u2019s birth, plaintiff Gina Frame, his mother, was unmarried and living with defendant Jay Nehls. When plaintiff and defendant ended their relationship, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Kalamazoo Circuit Court to determine paternity. The complaint alleged that defendant, Jay Nehls, was the father. Defendant admitted paternity of Dustin. The circuit court entered an order of filiation, awarding plaintiff custody and awarding defendant regular visitation. Appellee, Stephen Nehls, Dustin\u2019s paternal grandfather, then petitioned the circuit court for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Plaintiff moved for summary disposition of appel-lee\u2019s petition on the basis of the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Nelson v Kendrick, </em>187 Mich App 367; 466 NW2d 402 (1991). <em>Nelson </em>held that a complaint for determination of paternity does not constitute a \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d within the meaning of the grandparent visitation statute.

The Court reasoned that the grandparent visitation statute violated the Equal Protection Clause under the federal and state constitutions. US Const, Am XIV; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2. It had determined that <em>Nelson </em>was not binding because that Court did not address a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>statutory section in the grandparent visitation statute that the Court in <em>Frame </em>believed was necessary for the full resolution of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">We granted plaintiffs application for leave to appeal to determine the scope, as well as the constitutionality, of the grandparent visitation statute. 449 Mich 851 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">THE STATUTORY CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The familiar interpretive principles need no citation. The goal of statutory construction is to effect the intent of the Legislature. If the statute is clear, we enforce its directive. Judicial construction is authorized only where a statute is unclear and susceptible to more than one interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The legislative purpose behind the Child Custody Act is to \u201cpromote the best interests and welfare of children.\u201d <em>Fletcher v Fletcher, </em>447 Mich 871, 877; 526 NW2d 889 (1994). The act directs that it is \u201cequitable in nature and shall be liberally construed and applied to establish promptly the rights of the child and the rights and duties of the parties involved.\u201d MCL 722.26(1); MSA 25.312(6)(1). Section 7b of the Child Custody Act deals specifically with grandparent visitation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MCL 722.27b(3); MSA 25.312(7b)(3). The grandparent visitation statute is consistent with the general purpose of the act, in that it permits a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>to enter a grandparent visitation order \u201cif the court finds that it is in the best interests of the child\u201d to do so. MCL 722.27b(3); MSA 25.312(7b)(3). However, before such a determination may be made, the court must first resolve a threshold matter: whether the parties before it have standing. The Legislature has granted grandparents standing to petition for visitation of their grandchildren only in \u201ccarefully limited circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsection 1 of the grandparent visitation statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Except as provided in this subsection, a grandparent of the child may seek an order for visitation in the manner set forth in this section only if a child custody dispute with respect to that child is pending before the court. If a natural parent of an unmarried child is deceased, a parent of the deceased person may commence an action for visitation. Adoption of the child by a stepparent . . . does not terminate the right of a parent of the deceased person to commence an action for visitation. [MCL 722.27b(l); MSA 25.312(7b)(l).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">This subsection announces the general rule that a grandparent has standing to seek visitation only if a child custody dispute is pending.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>this rule is created for cases in which the child of the grandparent (the parent of the grandchild) is deceased. This first subsection clearly and unambiguously presents the only two situations in which grandparent visitation can be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Because Dustin\u2019s father is alive, appellee, Dustin\u2019s paternal grandfather, can only seek visitation if a \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d involving Dustin is pending. Subsection two defines child custody dispute clearly and unambiguously. That subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">As used in this section, \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d <em>includes </em>a proceeding in which any of the following occurs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">(a) The marriage of the child\u2019s parents is declared invalid or is dissolved by the court, or a court enters a decree of legal separation with regard to the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">(b) Legal custody of the child is given to a party other than the child\u2019s parent, or the child is placed outside of and does not reside in the home of a parent, excluding any child who has been placed for adoption with other than a stepparent, or whose adoption by other than a stepparent has been legally finalized. [MCL 722.27b(2); MSA 25.312(7b)(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Appellee argues that it is ambiguous whether the statute\u2019s definition of \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d should be read expansively or narrowly. He contends that liberal construction of the act and use of the word \u201cincludes\u201d require that the definition of child custody dispute be read to embrace situations not specifically enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 2(a) and 2(b). A review of the text of the Child Custody Act, as well as the legislative history of the grandparent visitation statute, leads to the opposite result.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">When used in the text of a statute, the word \u201cincludes\u201d can be used as a term of enlargement or of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>limitation, and the word in and of itself is not determinative of how it is intended to be used. <em>Belanger v Warren Bd of Ed, </em>432 Mich 575, 587, n 25; 443 NW2d 372 (1989). The term \u201cchild custody dispute,\u201d or a variation thereof, is used in virtually every section of the Child Custody Act. Nowhere but in the grandparent visitation section, however, is the term defined.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As recognized by the Court of Appeals in <em>Nelson v Kendrick, supra, </em>other sections of the act use the term broadly to mean any action or situation involving the placement of a child. 187 Mich App 370. We agree with the <em>Nelson </em>Court that, unlike other sections of the act, the specific definition provided in the grandparent visitation statute must be interpreted as a limitation on the term\u2019s broad general usage. <em>Id. </em>at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">The legislative history of the grandparent visitation statute supports a narrow reading of the term. Senate Bill 316, introduced in 1991, proposed to amend the grandparent visitation statute to \u201cadd to the conditions under which a grandparent may seek visitation rights . . . .\u201d Senate Fiscal Agency Analysis, SB 316-317, May 21, 1991, p 1. The bill, which failed to pass, would have amended the current statute by adding five new subsections to the definition of child custody dispute, one of which would have conferred standing upon grandparents \u201cif the parents [of the grandchild] were never married and were not living in the same household.\u201d Had SB 316 passed, this proposed subsection would have conferred grandparent standing under the facts in this case. If the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>ture intended the present definition of \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d to confer standing in situations other than those specified in the provision here in issue, such an amendment would have been unnecessaiy. The proposed amendment of the grandparent visitation statute supports the conclusion that the Legislature intended the current definition of child custody dispute to encompass only those situations specifically enumerated in subsection 7b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">In light of the statute\u2019s text and legislative history, we hold that the most reasonable reading of this definitional section is that grandparents who are unable to establish that they fall under one of the situations listed in subsections 2(a) and 2(b)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> cannot seek visitation by claiming their grandchild is the subject of a child custody dispute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Under subsection 2(a), a child custody dispute occurs when the marriage of a child\u2019s parents is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>annulled or ends in divorce, or the child\u2019s parents are legally separated. A child custody dispute exists under subsection 2(b) when legal custody of the child is given to someone other than a parent, or the child is placed outside the home of a parent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In sum, the specific situations in which the Legislature permits grandparents to seek visitation are: (1) if the grandparent\u2019s child dies, (2) if the grandchild\u2019s parents\u2019 marriage is annulled, (3) if the grandchild\u2019s parents are divorced, (4) if the grandchild\u2019s parents are legally separated, (5) if legal custody is awarded to a third party, and (6) if the child is placed outside the home of a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We also decline appellee\u2019s invitation to construe subsection 3 of the statute, MCL 722.27b(3); MSA 25.312(7b)(3), as creating a third source of standing for grandparents seeking visitation. Appellee points to the language regarding putative<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> fathers and contends that if the grandparent visitation statute did not apply to paternity cases, then subsection 3 would not mention putative fathers. We disagree. Subsection 3 is procedural. It applies only to grandparents who have established standing under subsections 1 and 2 either because their child is deceased or a child custody dispute involving their grandchild is pending. As indicated below, grandparents of both legitimate and illegitimate children may be entitled to visitation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>this statute, thus explaining the reference to putative fathers. The sentence appellee specifies places a further limitation on grandparents of illegitimate children \u2014 it requires a putative father to acknowledge paternity or otherwise recognize his child before the paternal grandparents can seek visitation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The sentence is one of limitation; it does not create another situation in which visitation may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Our reading of the grandparent visitation statute is consistent with the legislative approach to third-party custody issues, which we have found limit a nonparent\u2019s right to seek custody. <em>Ruppel v Lesner, </em>421 Mich 559, 565-566; 364 NW2d 665 (1984); <em>Bowie v Arder, </em>441 Mich 23, 48-49; 490 NW2d 568 (1992); <em>In re Clausen, </em>442 Mich 648, 683-684; 502 NW2d 649 (1993). As stated by <em>Ruppel, </em>\u201cnothing in the Child Custody Act, nor in any other authority of which we are aware, authorizes a nonparent to create a child custody \u2018dispute\u2019 by simply filing a complaint in circuit court alleging that giving custody to the third party is in the \u2018best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruppel, supra </em>at 566. Likewise, we decline to create a right to seek grandchild visitation where the statute does not do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellee has failed to establish that he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>standing to seek an order of visitation under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Appellee next argues that the grandparent visitation statute deprives appellee of equal protection under the law. The Court of Appeals found that the statute created classifications on the basis of illegitimacy, a quasi-suspect class, and thus was subject to heightened scrutiny. The Court concluded that the Legislature\u2019s classification, \u201cseemingly based upon the fortuity of a marriage contract,\u201d was not related to an important governmental interest. 208 Mich App 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Equal protection of the law is guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The Michigan and federal Equal Protection Clauses offer similar protection. <em>Doe v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>439 Mich 650, 670-671; 487 NW2d 166 (1992). Unless the discrimination impinges on the exercise of a fundamental right or involves a suspect class, the inquiry under the Equal Protection Clause is whether the classification is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 662. When determining the constitutionality of a statute, a court must not be \u201c \u2018guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy . . . <em>Gomez v United States, </em>490 US 858, 864; 109 S Ct 2237; 104 L Ed 2d 923 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Grandparent visitation is not encompassed within the definition of a \u201cfundamental right\u201d explicated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The right of visitation is one created by statute. OAG, 1981-1982, No 5,903, p 193 (May 15, 1981).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Ruppel, supra </em>at 565, n 6 (\u201cThe Child Custody Act does not create substantive rights of entitlement to custody of a child. . . . The single exception to this principle is in the limited rights of visitation for grandparents created by 1982 PA 340, MCL 722.27b; MSA 25.312[7b].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Moreover, the statute does not involve historically disparaged classifications. Appellee contends that the statute creates two classes: grandparents who have legitimate grandchildren and grandparents whose grandchildren are illegitimate. Because the classification is based on legitimacy, appellee asserts that intermediate scrutiny must be used. <em>Clark v Jeter, </em>486 US 456, 461; 108 S Ct 1910; 100 L Ed 2d 465 (1988); <em>Dones v Thomas, </em>210 Mich App 674, 677; 534 NW2d 221 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>A review of the statute as a whole, however, indicates that the Legislature did not create classifications using legitimacy as a factor. Nowhere in the statute is a distinction made between children bom in wedlock and children bom out of wedlock. Subsection 1 of the grandparent visitation statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\">Except as provided in this subsection, a grandparent of the child may seek an order for visitation in the manner set forth in this section only if a child custody dispute with respect to that child is pending before the court. If a natural parent of an unmarried child is deceased, a parent of a deceased person may commence an action for visitation. Adoption of the child by a stepparent . . . does not terminate the right of a parent of the deceased person to commence an action for visitation. [MCL 722.27b(l); MSA 25.312(7b)(l).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">This subsection presents two situations in which a grandparent may seek visitation of a grandchild: when a child custody dispute with respect to that grandchild is pending, or when the grandparent\u2019s child (the parent of the grandchild) is deceased. Stated otherwise, on its face, the section does not contemplate a grandparent visitation order if there is no custody dispute and the grandparents\u2019 child is still alive, whether or not the grandchild is bom legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In the case before us, both of Dustin\u2019s parents are alive. Thus, the focus is on whether a child custody dispute involving Dustin is pending. Subsection 2 defines \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d for purposes of grandparent visitation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">As used in this section, \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d includes a proceeding in which any of the following occurs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>(a) The marriage of the child\u2019s parents is declared invalid or is dissolved by the court, or a court enters a decree of legal separation with regard to the marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">(b) Legal custody of the child is given to a party other than the child\u2019s parent, or the child is placed outside of and does not reside in the home of a parent, excluding any child who has been placed for adoption with other than a stepparent, or whose adoption by other than a stepparent has been legally finalized. [MCL 722.27b(2); MSA 25.312(7b)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">This definitional section does not posit a judicially enforceable right that distinguishes between children who are bom in wedlock and those born out of wedlock. As drafted, the definition of \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d under subsections 2(a) and 2(b) could be met whether the grandchild is legitimate or illegitimate. In a hypothetical situation,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> where the child\u2019s mother and father marry, the child is bom in wedlock, and the parents divorce, the existence of a \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d under subsection 2(a) authorizes the grandparents to petition for visitation. Subsection 2(a) could still apply to permit grandparent visitation if the hypothesis is altered to assume a child bom out of wedlock, whose parents marry, and later divorce. The statute as drafted would not preclude an order of visitation. Because the marriage of the child\u2019s parents was dissolved by a court, the grandparents could peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tion for visitation of their illegitimate grandchild.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, subsection 2(a) does not classify on the basis of legitimacy \u2014 it permits grandparent visitation when the grandchild is either legitimate or illegitimate as long as its terms are met.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A facial examination of the language of subsection 2(b) similarly does not support the contention that the legislation classifies by illegitimacy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where the parental rights of a legitimate child\u2019s parents are terminated and the child is placed with a third party, subsection 2(b), as drafted, authorizes visitation at the request of the grandparents of the legitimate child. When the hypothesis is altered to assume an illegitimate child of a mother whose parental rights are terminated and the child is placed outside the home, subsection 2(b) authorizes visitation because the illegitimate child resides with neither parent.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">It is true that, in the instant case, had Dustin\u2019s parents married, then divorced, instead of simply living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>together unmarried, the result would be different. If a divorce were involved, a \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d would exist under subsection 2(a) and appellee could seek visitation. However, this distinction does not arise from a classification based on legitimacy. Had Dustin\u2019s parents married after Dustin was bom, and then divorced, a \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d would exist under subsection 2(a) even though Dustin was bom out of wedlock.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Appellee has failed to show that the legislation has a substantial disparate effect on a disadvantaged class. Grandparents of a legitimate child are denied standing where neither subsections 2(a) nor 2(b) are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>satisfied,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> while grandparents of an illegitimate child can claim a right to visitation if subsections 2(a) or 2(b) are satisfied. The incidental effect on illegiti-mates as a class \u201cis not sufficient\u201d to warrant heightened scrutiny analysis. <em>Califano v Boles, </em>443 US 282, 296; 99 S Ct 2767; 61 L Ed 2d 541 (1979).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The classifications created under the grandparent visitation statute are grandparents whose child is deceased or involved in a custody dispute (who may seek visitation), and grandparents whose child is alive or not involved in a custody dispute (who may not seek visitation).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Because there is no fundamental right or suspect classification involved, a rational basis test is used. Under this test, the grandparent visitation statute will be upheld as long as the classifications therein are rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. <em>Doe, supra </em>at 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>There is a rational basis for creating these classifications and thus limiting the situations in which a grandparent may seek visitation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Legislature might have determined that unlimited resort to judicially enforced grandparent visitation might infringe on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise a child without interference from the government,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that unlimited jurisdiction over grandparent visitation might invite legal disputes over issues that are more appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>priately resolved outside the legal forum, or that because visitation disputes by definition involve interfamily conflict, expansive jurisdiction would not serve the minor\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In relying on the married status of a child\u2019s parents in subsection 2(a) to determine whether a grandparent has standing to seek visitation, the Legislature may have reasonably concluded that parents who decide to marry, whether before or after their child is bom, have an established relationship, and that the relationship between the parents of the child\u2019s father and mother should be protected, despite the parents\u2019 divorce, separation, or annulment. In contrast, parents who conceive a child, but do not marry, may have no established relationship at all.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> These legislative goals are not insubstantial, and the means chosen are rationally related to their promotion.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The Legislature\u2019s classifications are rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

In fact, no hearing was held because appellee satisfied none of the six ways of establishing standing. See <em>supra </em>at 181. The dissent improperly focuses solely on \u00a7 2(a), which concededly uses the parents\u2019 marital status as a means of separating those grandparents who may seek visitation and those who may not. However, as established above, <em>supra </em>at 186-187, the classification set forth in \u00a7 2(a) adversely affects grandparents who seek visitation both of legitimate and illegitimate grandchildren. Simply because Dustin happens to be illegitimate and appellee\u2019s situation does not fulfill the statute\u2019s standing requirements does not mean the statute classifies on the basis of legitimacy. Read as a whole, the classifications within the statute are constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Nor does our reading of the statute disproportionately affect illegitimate children. Under this analysis, the party challenging the law must prove discriminatory motive or intent. <em>Arlington Heights v Metropolitan Housing Development Corp, </em>429 US 252, 264-265; 97 S Ct 555; 50 L Ed 2d 450 (1977).

The dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Trimble </em>illustrates that it misconstrues the focus of the statute. Subsection 2(a) of the statute does not classify on the basis of legitimacy; therefore, <em>Trimble </em>is inapposite. Rather, subsection 2(a) creates classes on the basis of the marital status of the parents with respect to the grandparents, not with respect to the grandchild.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\"> In <em>Lockhart v Lockhart, </em>603 NE2d 864 (Ind App, 1992), the Indiana Court of Appeals likewise engaged in rational basis review of a grandparent visitation statute that was challenged on equal protection grounds. The dissent cites <em>Lockhart </em>for the rationale that court uses to uphold the classes created in the Indiana statute, and adopts that rationale to support its interpretation of the Michigan statute. <em>Post </em>at 202. The Indiana statute draws a line between the parents of the custodial parent and the parents of the noncustodial parent. Similarly, in Michigan, subsection 2(b) prohibits a petition for grandparent visitation unless the child resides with neither parent. The language the dissent quotes from <em>Lockhart </em>does not resolve whether subsection 2(b) discriminates against illegitimates; however, because grandparents of both legitimate and illegitimate children are treated similarly under subsection 2(b), neither group of grandparents may petition for visitation unless the grandchild resides with neither parent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that parents have a constitutionally protected interest, with certain constraints, in raising their children without state interference. <em>Lehr v Robertson, </em>463 US 248, 256-262; 103 S Ct 2985; 77 L Ed 2d 614 (1983); <em>Bellotti v Baird, </em>443 US 622, 638; 99 S Ct 3035; 61 L Ed 2d 797 (1979); <em>Parham v JR, </em>442 US 584, 602; 99 S Ct 2493; 61 L Ed 2d 101 (1979); <em>Wisconsin v Yoder, </em>406 US 205, 232-233; 92 S Ct 1526; 32 L Ed 2d 15 (1972); <em>Pierce v Society of Sisters, </em>268 US 510, 534-535; 45 S Ct 571; 69 L Ed 1070 (1925); <em>Meyer v Nebraska, </em>262 US 390, 399; 43 S Ct 625; 67 L Ed 1042 (1923).

In <em>Brooks, </em>the Georgia Supreme Court determined that in order to protect parents\u2019 constitutional right to raise their children free from undue state interference, its grandparent visitation statute must be struck down as unconstitutional. The statute provided no limitation on grandparent standing and permitted a court to grant visitation \u201cupon proof of special circumstances which make such visitation rights necessary to the best interests of the child.\u201d Ga Code Ann 19-7-3(c). The court concluded that \u201cstate interference with parental rights to custody and control of children is permissible only where the health or welfare of a child is threatened.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\"> Comment, <em>The coming of age of grandparent visitation rights, </em>n 12 <em>supra, </em>601; note, <em>The constitutional constraints on grandparents\u2019 visitation statutes, </em>86 Colum LR 118, 124 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\"> Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, the paternity action was sought by plaintiff Gina Frame and not by the father, defendant Jay Nehls. Jay Nehls did admit paternity in this case. However, it does not follow that fathers who admit paternity when faced with a paternity complaint and DNA testing universally accept responsibility for rearing their children. According to the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the statute, the p\u00e1rente of a recalcitrant father whose paternity is only established by a court proceeding would have a right to seek visitation upon the establishment of their child\u2019s paternity even though they have no relationship whatsoever with their grandchild. Such a prospect might discourage women from seeking to establish the paternity of absentee fathers. The Legislature may reasonably have wished to preclude this possibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> The dissent contends that there is no explanation for the classifications set forth in the grandparent visitation statute. The lines are drawn where they are because the Legislature put them there. As long as these lines survive rational basis review, which they do, this Court must defer to the legislative policy choices. In <em>Mathews v Lucas, </em>427 US 495, 515; 96 S Ct 2755; 49 L Ed 2d 651 (1976), two illegitimate children challenged certain provisions of the Social Security Act under the Equal Protection Clause. Under the act, illegitimate children may only collect death bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>fits upon a showing that they were dependent on the deceased wage earner. The statute, however, had in place certain presumptions that relieved some illegitimate children of the burden of setting forth proof of dependency. In upholding the statute, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">[T]he constitutional question is not whether such a presumption is required, but whether it is permitted. Nor, in ratifying these statutory classifications, is our role to hypothesize independently on the desirability or feasibility of any possible alternative basis for presumption. These matters of practical judgment and empirical calculation are for Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">Likewise, the judgment of the Legislature reflected in the statute is that, where the parents are living and have not married, grandparent visitation should be determined outside the judicial forum.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b282-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac8\">(dissenting).

Because \u00a7 7b defines \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d as <em>\u201cinclud[ing]\u201d </em>the death, divorce, and legal separation of the parents, the Legislature did not intend to limit \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d to only those situations.

This general conclusion does not, however, absolve this Court from deciding whether an order of filiation providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>for custody and visitation might be within the narrower categories of \u201cchild custody dispute\u201d set forth in \u00a7 7b(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">The majority does not consider whether an order of filiation following separation of an unmarried couple is the substantive equivalent of a divorce proceeding. The import of the statute is that grandparents have the right to ask a court for visitation when a traditional family setting has broken down. In such a case, the grandparents are more likely to be squeezed out of meaningful communication with the grandchild, particularly if their child is not the custodial parent of the grandchild. Then the person who would otherwise provide the normal link between the grandparents and the grandchild might believe the visitation he has been authorized by the court provides inadequate time for both him and the grandparent, and, therefore, decline to share with the grandparents the limited time available with the grandchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Section 7b(2) provides for situations where, because of death or placement of the child with a nonfamily member, grandparents might again be deprived of communication by a person not inclined to share the child, particularly if a personality or child-rearing conflict develops between the grandparents and the person who has custody. The underlying principle is to allow grandparents to petition for visitation when circumstances make it unlikely they will obtain an appropriate opportunity to visit the grandchild.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The acrimony often present in divorces was, of course, one of the primary concerns of the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ture in enacting the grandparent visitation statute. To maintain a grandchild\u2019s continued communication with the extended family, the Legislature authorized petitions for visitation by grandparents likely to be caught in the middle of a difficult divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Indiana has a similar statute, and an appellate court has explained the statutory rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">In most instances, a parent who has custody of a child will allow grandparent visitation. When a parent loses his or her custodial rights as a parent, that parent has a reduced right to participate in child-rearing decisions. It is precisely when one parent has less legal control over the child that the grandparent-grandchild relationship may be jeopardized. A grandparent whose child is the noncustodial parent may have difficulty obtaining visitation with the grandchild. <em>[Lockhart v Lockhart, </em>603 NE2d 864, 865 (Ind App, 1992).[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">The same concerns of unreasonable denial of grandparent communication are present when the parents never marry, but an order of filiation that establishes custody and visitation has been entered. There are then the same risks of vindictiveness and limited visitation. The custody and visitation provisions in an order of filiation may indicate a breakdown in the relationship between the. unwed parents that can fuel the same sort of disagreements and denial of visitation that occur in a divorce. In short, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the reasons for allowing a petition for visitation in the context of a divorce, legal separation, or annulment are also present in the context of an order of filiation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The majority adverts to the Legislature\u2019s failure in 1991 to enact an amendment to the Child Custody Act that would have broadened the categories of grandparents entitled to petition for visitation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The failure of the Legislature to enact a bill often means nothing. Perhaps the amendment was not enacted because the Legislature thought it unnecessary, believing the additions were already implied in current law. Perhaps other provisions in the same bill were unpalatable.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Other issues may have been considered more pressing so that, even if a majority could have been mustered for the changes, the bill did not come to a vote because those favoring the changes preferred to spend the time and political capital necessary to enact another bill. As Sutherland noted, \u201cAction on a proposed amendment is <em>not </em>a significant aid to interpretation of an act that was passed years before.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AAv\">Because there are so many reasons for not enacting a postenactment amendment, no real guidance can be derived from such non-\u201cdecisions\u201d of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>F</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Section 7b(3) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">A grandchild visitation order shall not be entered for the parents of a putative father unless the father has acknowledged paternity in writing, has been adjudicated to be the father by a court of competent jurisdiction, or has contributed regularly to the support of the child or children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The majority declares that subsection 3 is procedural only, thus reading in still another limitation for grandparents whose son is the putative father \u2014 -having already required that the grandparents have standing as defined by the majority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under the majority\u2019s construction, the relevant portion of subsection 3 only applies to grandparents whose son has died, leaving behind an illegitimate child.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The only situation they posit when a grandparent would be able to petition, as contemplated by \u00a7 7b(3), for visitation of a child bom out of wedlock, whose father is alive, is when the parents later marry and then divorce. Under the majority\u2019s cribbed reading, subsection 3 applies only when a putative father has died, thus construing out of \u00a7 7b(3) any meaning for an illegitimate grandchild whose parents, who never married, are still alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">1994 PA 388 requires a circuit court to enter a custody and visitation award anytime an order of filiation is entered. The law amended sections of the Paternity Act and added MCL 722.717b; MSA 25.497(2), and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>If the court makes a determination of paternity and there is no dispute regarding custody, the court shall include in the order of filiation specific provisions for the custody and visitation of the child as provided in the child custody act of 1970, . . . being sections 722.21 to 722.29 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">This provision references the <em>entire </em>Child Custody Act as the basis for custody decisions under an order of filiation. This includes \u00a7 7b concerning grandparent visitation. This most recent amendment should be read to modify the less expansive definition the majority finds to be more specific in \u00a7 7b(2).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Court of Appeals observed that the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Clark v Jeter, supra, </em>p 461, declared that generally \u201ca level of intermediate scrutiny . . . has been applied to discriminatory classifications based on sex or illegitimacy,\u201d and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">To withstand intermediate scrutiny, a statutory classification must be substantially related to an important governmental objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">As set forth earlier at the conclusion of part I, no important governmental objective would be advanced by providing an opportunity for grandparent visitation when the union of the parents of a legitimate child has been dissolved, and denying such opportunity when the union of an illegitimate child\u2019s parents is dissolved. The act, correctly construed, is constitutional, but, as construed by the majority, denies equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The majority contends that only the illegitimate child, and not the grandparents, can assert an equal protection claim entitled to midlevel scrutiny. The short answer is to be found in <em>Glona v American Guarantee &amp; Liability Ins Co, </em>391 US 73; 88 S Ct 1515; 20 L Ed 2d 441 (1968), where the United States Supreme Court held that a wrongful death statute that authorized actions by mothers of legitimate children, but did not authorize actions by mothers of illegitimate children, denied the <em>mother </em>of an illegitimate child the equal protection of the laws. The United States Supreme Court would not distinguish between a mother and a grandmother or grandparents in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In the companion case of <em>Levy v Louisiana, </em>391 US 68; 88 S Ct 1509; 20 L Ed 2d 436 (1968), the Court held that a wrongful death statute that authorized actions in behalf of legitimate children, but did not authorize actions in behalf of illegitimate children, denied illegitimate children equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">While the <em>Glona </em>opinion employed the language of rational basis scrutiny, a substantive evaluation of that and other cases challenging distinctions based on illegitimacy supports the conclusion of hornbook writers that the United States Supreme Court was actually applying midlevel scrutiny before it formally adopted that level of scrutiny for illegitimacy classifications in 1988:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">This standard of intermediate scrutiny, which falls between the rational relationship test and the strict scrutiny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>test in terms of the strictness of the judicial review of classification, was not <em>formally </em>adopted for illegitimacy classifications until 1988. <em>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court\u2019s pre-1988 decisions are consistent with this form of intermediate standard of review. </em>[Nowak &amp; Rotunda, Constitutional Law (4th ed), \u00a7 14.14, p 719 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">This conclusion is bolstered by Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Clark </em>announcing the formal adoption of the heightened scrutiny standard. She noted that midlevel scrutiny \u201cgenerally has been applied to discriminatory classifications based on sex or illegitimacy.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There is no hint in that unanimous opinion that the Court was adopting a higher standard than it had imposed before; it simply recognized that its previous child illegitimacy decisions had in fact, if not in name, been applying midlevel scrutiny. See also <em>Pickett v Brown, </em>462 US 1, 8; 103 S Ct 2199; 76 L Ed 2d 372 (1983), \u201cIn view of the history of treating illegitimate children less favorably than legitimate ones, we have subjected statutory classifications based on illegitimacy to a heightened level of scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\"><em>Levy, </em>decided with <em>Glona, </em>also supports this conclusion because it distinguished the \u201cgreat latitude\u201d given social and economic legislation from the review it was exercising in that case where the rights being asserted \u201cinvolve the intimate, familial relationship between a child and his own mother.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A7u\">There is no reason to suppose that the United States Supreme Court would distinguish between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>bonds of mother and child and grandparent and child for purposes of equal protection analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Because the Child Custody Act expressly provides for visitation by parents of putative fathers whose paternity has been adjudicated, the problem with which the Court struggled in <em>Parham v Hughes, </em>441 US 347; 99 S Ct 1742; 60 L Ed 2d 269 (1979), and other cases there referred to, is not presented in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We acknowledge that the state can establish some requirements for the father of an illegitimate child to establish paternity because of the unique problems of proof such an inquiry creates. Jay J. Franklin Nehls is unquestionably the father of Dustin, so the concerns dealt with in <em>Parham </em>are inapposite, and, in all events, the requirements of the act have been met\u2014 an order of filiation was entered. The <em>Parham </em>line of cases is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The majority contends that, \u201c[n]owhere in the statute is a distinction made between children bom in wedlock and children bom out of wedlock.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We acknowledge that the act does not in terms draw a line between illegitimate and legitimate children. That line is drawn, rather, in the first part of the majority\u2019s opinion, where it holds, as a matter of statutory construction, that Dustin Nehls and those similarly situated, whose parents never marry, may not, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>lifetime of the father, be the subject of a grandparent\u2019s petition for visitation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">That line, drawn by the majority, is drawn solely on the basis of the marital status of the parents of the grandchild.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The line so drawn solely burdens children whose parents have not, before or after the child\u2019s birth, legally solemnized their union.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">While this line is not quite the same as the line drawn under earlier definitions of illegitimacy (where the child\u2019s status turned solely on the marital status of the parents at the child\u2019s birth), both parental groups are the same for equal protection analysis: As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>a result of state action, a child whose parents are not married \u2014 either at the time of birth or thereafter \u2014 is treated differently than a child whose parents have married.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Inheritance laws were often struck down as unconstitutional because they deprived a child who was bom to unmarried parents the right to inherit, even though the child could be legitimated by, e.g., the subsequent marriage of the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In <em>Trimble v Gordon, </em>430 US 762, 774; 97 S Ct 1459; 52 L Ed 2d 31 (1977), the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">If the decedent had written a will devising property to his illegitimate child, the case no longer would involve intestate succession law at all. Similarly, if the decedent had legitimated the child <em>by marrying the child\u2019s mother </em>or by complying with the requirements of some other method of legitimation, <em>the case no longer would involve discrimination against illegitimates. </em>Hard questions cannot be avoided by a hypothetical reshuffling of the facts. If Sherman Gordon [the putative father in Trimble] had devised his estate to Deta Mona this case would not be here. Similarly, in <em>Reed v Reed, </em>404 US 71 [92 S Ct 251; 30 L Ed 2d 225] (1971), if the decedent had left a will naming an executor, the problem of the statutory preference for male administrators of estates would not have been presented. The opinion in <em>Reed </em>gives no indication that this available alternative had any constitutional significance. We think it has none in this case. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Because the majority\u2019s only example of how this statutory provision, as misconstrued by it, does not exclude illegitimate children, involves the same legitimization of the grandchild found irrelevant in <em>Trim-ble, </em>thereby excluding every illegitimate child whose parents never marry from the protection of \u00a7 2(a) of the grandparent visitation statute, the classification is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>based on the legitimacy of the child, and needs to be evaluated under heightened scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The majority apparently believes that, because it construes the \u201cfocus\u201d of the act to be on the relationship of the grandparents to their children, rather than on the relationship of the grandchild to his parents, the classification\u2019s actual unconstitutional effect on illegitimates is somehow dissipated. The relevant constitutional inquiry, however, is not on the \u201cfocus\u201d of the statutory language, but whether the act creates an invidious classification based on the legitimacy of the grandchild. Because the majority\u2019s construction of the grandparent visitation statute does so classify, it is subject to heightened scrutiny and, once analyzed under that framework, unconstitutional. Neither \u201cbenign\u201d statutory language nor elaborate characterization removes the taint of an unconstitutional classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The majority\u2019s effort to distinguish this case, from <em>Trimble v Gordon, </em>underscores why constitutional law ignores superficial distinctions. The majority argues that the act discriminates on the basis of the marital status of the grandparents\u2019 child (the parent), rather than the marital status of the parents of the grandchild (the parent again).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because it is precisely this marital status that determines whether the grandchild is legitimate or illegitimate, however it is described, the majority\u2019s distinction is one without a difference. The result is the same: illegitimate children whose parents never marry will never be the subject of a grandparent petition for visitation while both parents are alive, unlike legitimate children. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>court cannot properly blind itself to the actual result of a statutory classification on the basis that the \u201cfocus\u201d of the words employed is not on the classification it produces.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Illegitimacy classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny because the United States Supreme Court has determined that it is not appropriate to penalize a child on the basis of the marital status of his parents, over which the child has no control. Those concerns are present here: Dustin and his grandparents are being deprived of the benefit of a best-interests hearing regarding grandparent visitation simply because his parents never married, over which he had no control. State-sanctioned deprivation of a statutory benefit on such a basis cannot be permitted absent a substantial relationship to an important governmental interest.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Under the majority\u2019s construction of the grandparent visitation statute, a line is drawn between children whose parents have divorced or separated sometime during the child\u2019s lifetime and those whose parents never married but an order of filiation was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The majority avoids discussing the propriety of drawing the line where it announces it shall be drawn by focusing on the rights of grandparents, rather than those of grandchildren. While only grandparents are given a right to petition for visitation, \u00a7 7b in particular and the Child Custody Act as a whole, is written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>for the benefit of children, including children who are grandchildren. The grandparents are given the right to petition for visitation because no two year old will hire a lawyer to vindicate his interests in visiting with his grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The image of such a grandchild-initiated lawsuit strains credulity. Moreover, the grandchild would not have standing under \u00a7 2. The grandparents are given the right to petition because they have the incentive to seek visitation, but grandparents will only succeed if the visitation is in the <em>child\u2019s </em>best interests. If the child would be harmed by grandparent visitation, no scenario envisionable allows a court to order visitation. The grandparents serve as legal surrogates for the grandchild\u2019s interests. A young child may not be deprived of that to which he is entitled simply because an adult is authorized to advocate and vindicate the child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>The Legislature has presumed that in certain situations parental control will best protect the rights of the child, while in other instances state intervention is required. When communication with grandparents might be unreasonably cut off, the grandchild is usually in no position to take action. The grandparents are, so the act gives them the right to vindicate the grandchild\u2019s interest in having communication with the child\u2019s extended family.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The majority claims that there is an insufficient, \u201cincidental effect\u201d on grandchildren to warrant heightened scrutiny analysis. Again, it is the act that forces the inquiry into an analysis of the effect on grandchildren. That effect cannot be seen as merely incidental if the grandchild is being wrongfully denied communication with his grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The majority cites <em>Califano v Boles, </em>443 US 282, 285; 99 S Ct 2767; 61 L Ed 2d 541 (1979), for the proposition that incidental effects on illegitimate children are insufficient to require heightened scrutiny.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In that case, a woman had been denied <em>\u201cmother\u2019s </em>insurance benefits\u201d because she was not divorced or widowed. The small effect that providing such benefits to the mother would have on the child prompted the Court to find any benefit to the child was limited and speculative. The Court observed that the Social Security Administration had not denied benefits to the illegitimate child.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, the child was protected even though the mother was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>Califano </em>never reached the issue whether denying benefits to an illegitimate child would deny equal protection, a situation much closer to the facts in this case, because the Social Security Administration was directly helping the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">No important governmental interest is advanced by denying illegitimate children the right to have their grandparents petition for custody. This not only fails heightened scrutiny, but, as the Court of Appeals noted, it fails rational basis scrutiny. \u201cThere appears to be no conceivable set of facts demonstrating that the legislative judgment reflected in the classification is rationally related to any legitimate governmental interest. We can envision no well-founded reason to treat the grandparents of children bom out of wedlock differently if paternity is established.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The majority, in finding a rational basis for the act, as it constmes it, asserts that the Legislature \u201cmight have determined that <em>unlimited </em>resort to judicially enforced grandparent visitation might infringe on a parent\u2019s fundamental right to raise a child,\u201d or that, for other reasons, the Legislature did not desire broad and expansive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> This general statement is irrelevant to the classification at hand: Are illegitimate children whose parents have sought and received an order of filiation any different, for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>poses of the grandparent visitation statute, than legitimate children whose parents have divorced or legally separated? There is no reason to distinguish the two cases, regardless of whether rational basis or heightened scrutiny review is employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The majority finds justification for a general policy of limiting visitation petitions, but this is too high a level of generality. The critical inquiry, for equal protection analysis, concerns the specific line drawn, not the general statutory framework. Under the correct analysis, the grandparent visitation statute, as construed by the majority, deprives Dustin Nehls and the Nehls grandparents and those similarly situated equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The majority\u2019s other attempts at finding a rational basis rely on stereotypes of unwed parents. Even rational basis requires some analysis, particularly where illegitimate children are involved.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The majority forgoes analysis by relying on uninformed stereotypes and conjecture. The lengths to which the majority has gone to justify its construction of the statute demonstrates the weakness of its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">We would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the circuit court for a hearing concerning whether visitation with his grandparents is in Dustin\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<judges id=\"b307-9\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> While Gina Frame\u2019s reply brief in this Court contains an affidavit denying these allegations, the trial court granted her motion for summary disposition.

It is for the circuit court, consistent with the statutory definition of best interests of the child, to determine where on the continuum any particular visitation request should fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The majority\u2019s claim that this opinion attempts to deceive the reader with respect to its true agenda is without basis and reflective of the majority\u2019s inability to deal with this issue in its proper legal context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b292-10\"> The majority asserts that this citation is inappropriate because Indiana\u2019s statute does not distinguish between married and unmarried parents. <em>Ante </em>at 190, n 23. We agree that the Indiana statute does not so distinguish, and this may explain why Indiana employed rational basis review and Michigan should employ heightened scrutiny. Nonetheless, the Indiana court\u2019s statement of the policy reasons for enacting a grandparent visitation statute are equally applicable to Michigan\u2019s grandparent visitation statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"> This dissent does not claim that <em>\u201cany </em>grandparent \u2018squeezed out\u2019 ... by the failure of the father or mother to grant visitation could claim that a functional divorce has occurred, separating him from the child . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 180, n 8 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Only because an order of filiation was entered that grants primary custody to the mother and limited visitation to the father is this case cognizable under the grandparent visitation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">If the grandchild\u2019s parents are still married and refuse to allow one or both sets of grandparents visitation, the statute provides no recourse. Similarly, before the entry of the order of filiation the grandparents here may have had no claim to seek visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The majority sets up a straw man and thereby fails to acknowledge that, in this case, there is no substantive difference, for purposes of the grandparent visitation statute, between divorce or legal separation proceedings and an order of filiation. This dissent would not provide all grandparents a judicial forum to petition for visitation; only those grandparents in the circumstances described in the statute envisioned by the Legislature and parallel circumstances would be entitled to petition for visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The majority also contends, \u201cThe fact that there are many situations in which the parents of an illegitimate child have never lived together as a family, despite an order of filiation, is one illustration of the obvious: an order of filiation is not the functional equivalent of a divorce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again, the majority misunderstands. The discussion of \u201ctraditional family settings\u201d is not meant to limit the instances when a grandparent might seek visitation. It was simply to help explain the evils the Legislature was seeking to address in providing for grandparent visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">If the same problem of grandparent exclusion due to acrimony between the parents exists, regardless of whether the parents had previously lived together, the statute should be read to cover such a situation. The inquiry should not be narrowly focused on the nature of the parents\u2019 relations before the entry of the order of filiation, but rather on the more complex task of evaluating the nature of the relationships and whether the grandparents are at risk of losing communication with the grandchild, not because the parents choose to exclude the grandparents on the basis of a joint decision of what is in the child\u2019s best interests, but because the custodial parent refuses to allow visitation because of reasons unrelated to the appropriateness of visitation or the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Nonetheless, even if this Court limited grandparent claims to those where the parents had something resembling a \u201ctraditional family setting,\u201d an inquiry that courts are able to make, Dustin\u2019s parents would probably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>qualify. They lived together with the child until shortly before Gina Frame sought the order of filiation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\"> <em>Ante </em>at 179-180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\"> The proposed amendment included provisions to allow a visitation petition \u201cif the grandparent has provided an established custodial environment for the grandchild ... at any time during the life of the grandchild\u201d; \u201cif a parent of a grandchild has withheld visitation opportunities with the child from a grandparent to retaliate against the grandparent for reporting child abuse or neglect to a governmental authority where the grandparent has reasonable cause to suspect child abuse or neglect\u201d; and \u201cif a parent of the grandchild is living separate and away from the other parent and grandchild for more than 1 year.\u201d SB 316.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b294-9\"> 2A Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction (5th ed), \u00a7 48.18, p 369 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> <em>Ante </em>at 181-182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b296-9\"> <em>Ante </em>at 176, n 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"> 486 US 461.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> 391 US 71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b299-10\"> <em>Ante </em>at 185.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\"> The majority argues that this result is unavoidable given the language of the statute.

Despite the majority\u2019s strained attempts to find an example of an illegitimate child who qualifies under \u00a7 2(a), the majority can only fathom one instance: where an illegitimate child\u2019s parents later marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">As the United States Supreme Court has held, this is an example that effectively only allows illegitimate children the protection of the statute if they have been legitimated, continuing to burden illegitimate children unconstitutionally absent a justification that passes heightened scrutiny. <em>Trimble v Gordon, </em>430 US 762; 97 S Ct 1459; 52 L Ed 2d 31 (1977), and text accompanying n 22. However the majority categorizes it, the line it draws is based on the parents\u2019 marital status, over which Dustin has no control. The majority punishes him for his parents\u2019 decision not to marry.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">The majority claims this dissent \u201cimproperly focuses solely on \u00a7 2(a) . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 188, n 19. As the parties have conceded, however, and the majority recognizes as well, \u00a7 7b(2)(a) is the only prong of the grandparent visitation statute that is relevant in this case. We decline to address the other sections because they have no bearing on the issues. It does not matter if \u00a7 7b(2)(b) or some other portion of the grandparent visitation statute passes constitutional muster when what has been challenged is \u00a7 7b(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b300-12\"> The majority recognizes that this portion of the statute \u201cconcededly uses the parents\u2019 marital status as a means of separating those grandparents who may seek visitation and those who may not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\"> E.g., <em>ante </em>at 189, n 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\"> See <em>Clark v Jeter, supra </em>at 461, and <em>Dep\u2019t of Civil Rights ex rel Forton v Waterford Twp Dep\u2019t of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>425 Mich 173, 191; 387 NW2d 821 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> In <em>Levy v Louisiana, </em>the United States Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that prohibited illegitimate children from suing for the wrongful death of their mother.

If the corporation is not injured, the action cannot be sustained, even though the shareholder brings the action to protect his own interests. If the majority\u2019s analysis was taken seriously, courts would deny that the corporation is the real party in interest simply because the law, recognizing the impossibility of encouraging a corrupt board of directors or officers to bring suit against themselves, grants the shareholder the right to sue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> <em>Ante </em>at 189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Thus, the focus of <em>these </em>benefits [mother\u2019s insurance benefits] is on the economic dilemma of the surviving spouse or former spouse; the child\u2019s needs as such are addressed through the separate child\u2019s insurance benefits. <em>[Califano </em>at 294.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b306-9\"> 208 Mich App 416.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b306-10\"> <em>Ante </em>at 190-191.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b307-10\"> See text accompanying n 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
