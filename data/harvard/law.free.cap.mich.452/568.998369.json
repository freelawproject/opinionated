This claim requires examination of whether the Novi City Council\u2019s denial of Paragon\u2019s request to rezone its property was a final decision appealable to the circuit court. We find it was not, and that Paragon\u2019s constitutional claim is not ripe for review. The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Paragon Properties purchased a seventy-five acre parcel in 1980 for $150,000. The property was vacant, unimproved, and not served by city water or sewer. The property was zoned for large-lot, single-family residential use.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Paragon\u2019s property is located in the northwest corner of the City of Novi at the intersection of Napier and Twelve Mile Roads. Across Napier Road and to the west of Paragon\u2019s parcel in Lyon Township is an active gravel pit operation. The property to the north across Twelve Mile Road, located in the City of Wixom, is zoned for industrial use. The property to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the east and south of Paragon\u2019s parcel is located in the City of Novi. The property immediately to the east of Paragon\u2019s is undeveloped, but zoned for residential use, and the property to the south is zoned and developed for mobile home use.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In May 1984, Paragon submitted a request to the Planning Board of the City of Novi to rezone the property from a single-family residential zone to a mobile home district zone. The planning board held a public hearing in August 1984 and recommended that the rezoning request be denied. At a subsequent public hearing, the Novi City Council denied Paragon\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Paragon filed its initial complaint in Oakland Circuit Court in 1985. That case was dismissed without prejudice in February 1989. In June 1989, Paragon again filed a complaint in Oakland Circuit Court alleging that the property had no economic potential for development as zoned because of adjacent industrial uses and poor drainage conditions; the highest and best use of the property would be for mobile home development; as applied to the property, the zoning ordinance was unreasonable, confiscatory, discriminatory; and the ordinance unconstitutionally deprived Paragon of its property in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the Michigan and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Novi moved for summary disposition, arguing that the case should be dismissed because Paragon had failed to seek a use variance from the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals and, therefore, had not obtained a final decision regarding the potential uses of the property. The circuit court denied Novi\u2019s motion, holding that the finality argument had not been timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>raised<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, because this was a zoning case and not a variance case, Paragon had exhausted its administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The case proceeded to trial in July 1990. The circuit court held that the zoning ordinance as applied to Paragon\u2019s property effected an unconstitutional taking and entered a judgment against Novi for $198,930 plus attorney fees. Novi moved unsuccessfully for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial. Now then filed its appeal with the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court on the grounds that Paragon\u2019s constitutional claim was not ripe for review because Paragon had not sought a variance from the zoning board of appeals and had not brought a state inverse condemnation action. 206 Mich App 74; 520 NW2d 344 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The zoning of land is a reasonable exercise of government police power. <em>Village of Euclid, Ohio v Ambler Realty Co, </em>272 US 365; 47 S Ct 114; 71 L Ed 303 (1926). <em>Euclid </em>upheld the enforcement of a zoning ordinance, reasoning that modern pressures on land use have created sufficient public interest in the segregation of incompatible land uses to justify a diminution in property values. <em>Id. </em>at 386-390. The Michigan zoning enabling act, MCL 125.581 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2931 <em>et seq., </em>establishes procedures for the enactment, amendment, and administration of zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Because zones established by ordinance will not always reflect the realities of all land controlled by a zoning ordinance, the enabling act provides for administrative relief from the application of an ordinance. The discretionary authority to enact a zoning ordinance and to adopt a zoning map rests with the legislative body of a city or village. MCL 125.584(4); MSA 5.2934(4). The legislative body may amend a zoning ordinance by a text change or alter a zoning map through a rezoning. <em>Id. </em>The legislative body of a city or village may also have the discretionary authority to temper the effect of a zoning ordinance through special land use permits, MCL 125.584a; MSA 5.2934(1), or planned unit development, MCL 125.584b; MSA 5.2934(2). Further, the zoning board of appeals may grant administrative relief from the strict application of the ordinance in the form of land use variances. MCL 125.585(9); MSA 5.2935(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Pursuant to the enabling act, Novi\u2019s zoning ordinance reserves the power to rezone land within Novi to the Novi City Council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Also pursuant to the enabling act, Novi\u2019s zoning ordinance authorizes the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals to grant a land use variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>where \u201cit is clearly shown that the land cannot be used for a zoned use . . . Novi Zoning Ordinance, \u00a7 3104(1).

However, variances should be sparingly granted so that the grant of one variance in an area where many parcels are similarly situated does not result in a material change to the zoning district. <em>Puritan-Greenfield Ass\u2019n v Leo, </em>7 Mich App 659, 671; 153 NW2d 162 (1967). Although, the grant of a land use variance cannot change the zoning district classification or amend the zoning ordinance, the effect of a land use variance is similar to rezoning because variances typically run with the land. 2 Cameron, Michigan Real Property (2d ed), \u00a7 23.12, p 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Zoning ordinances, combined with mechanisms like land use variances, enable local governments to more adeptly manage land within their jurisdictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>use variances, when properly utilized, function interdependently with other zoning ordinance provisions to ensure that the \u201cspirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done.\u201d MCL 125.585(9); MSA 5.2935(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Although the police power allows the government to regulate land use, the Fifth Amendment requires that compensation be paid if a government regulation unreasonably shifts social costs to an individual or individuals. <em>Village of Euclid, supra </em>at 387. A claim for compensation may allege that an ordinance is confiscatory \u201cas applied\u201d or \u201con its face.\u201d A facial challenge alleges that the mere existence and threatened enforcement of the ordinance materially and adversely affects values and curtails opportunities of all property regulated in the market. <em>Id. </em>at 395. An \u201cas applied\u201d challenge alleges a present infringement or denial of a specific right or of a particular injury in process of actual execution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">A challenge to the validity of a zoning ordinance \u201cas applied,\u201d whether analyzed under 42 USC 1983 as a denial of equal protection, as a deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, or as a taking under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, is subject to the rule of finality. <em>Lake Angelo Associates v White Lake Twp, </em>198 Mich App 65, 70; 498 NW2d 1 (1993), citing <em>Williamson Co Regional Planning Comm v Hamilton Bank of John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>son City, </em>473 US 172, 186; 105 S Ct 3108; 87 L Ed 2d 126 (1985).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">[T]he finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive position on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury . . . <footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Finality is not required for facial challenges because such challenges attack the very existence or enactment of an ordinance. <em>Beacon Hill Farm Associates v Loudoun Co Bd of Supervisors, </em>875 F2d 1081 (CA 4, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><em>Williamson </em>articulated the need for finality in the context of land use regulation. In <em>Williamson, </em>a property owner obtained preliminary approval of a residential subdivision plat from the planning commission. The planning commission later amended its ordinance, reducing the allowable density permitted on the land, and, therefore, disapproved the property owner\u2019s subsequent plats. The property owner sued in federal district court, alleging that the ordinance effected an unconstitutional taking as applied to his property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, because the property owner in <em>Williamson </em>failed to seek alternative relief, in the form of variances, available under the zoning ordinance, the Court concluded that the property owner\u2019s claim was not ripe for review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Williamson </em>further requires that a landowner challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance as applied to pursue a state inverse condemnation claim before the claim will mature. <em>Williamson, supra </em>at 192-197.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court expressly adopted the <em>Williamson </em>finality requirements in <em>Electro-Tech, Inc v H F Campbell Co, </em>433 Mich 57, 81-91; 445 NW2d 61 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In <em>Electro-Tech, </em>a landowner claimed that the City of Westland had taken his property without just compensation or due process of law when it imposed several conditions on his development. The landowner later failed to submit a final site plan for approval. The Court held: \u201c[U]ntil . . . the council\u2019s objections . . . are addressed and finally resolved ... it is impossible to accurately determine the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s land retained any reasonable beneficial use or the extent to which the plaintiff\u2019s expectation interest had been destroyed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The finality requirement aids in the determination whether a taking has occurred by addressing the actual economic effect of a regulation on the property owner\u2019s investment-backed expectations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As noted in <em>Williamson, </em>factors affecting a property owner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>investment-backed expectations \u201csimply cannot be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Investment-backed expectations are distinguishable from mere financial speculation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Paragon claims that the Novi City Council\u2019s decision to deny Paragon\u2019s rezoning request was a final decision as contemplated by <em>Electro-Tech </em>because the city council is the initial decisionmaker regarding rezoning requests. For further support, Paragon attempts to distinguish the city council\u2019s \u201cunconditional\u201d denial of rezoning from the \u201cconditional\u201d approval of the site plan in <em>Electro-Tech, </em>which this Court held was not a final decision. However Paragon\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Electro-Tech </em>oversimplifies the legal finality issue and ignores a requisite inquiry into finality: whether the decision, conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>or unconditional, inflicted \u201can actual, concrete injury.\u201d Williamson, <em>supra </em>at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The City of Novi\u2019s denial of Paragon\u2019s rezoning request is not a final decision because, absent a request for a variance, there is no information regarding the potential uses of the property that might have been permitted, nor, therefore, is there information regarding the extent of the injury Paragon may have suffered as a result of the ordinance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While, the city council\u2019s denial of rezoning is certainly a decision, it is not a final decision under <em>Electro-Tech </em>because had Paragon petitioned for a land use variance, Paragon might have been eligible for alternative relief from the provisions of the ordinance.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">While Paragon correctly characterizes Novi\u2019s rezoning denial as a legislative act rather than an administrative decision, this distinction does not resolve the finality issue. Requiring Paragon to seek a variance from the zoning board of appeals after the city council\u2019s rezoning denial does not result in an invasion of the legislative authority of the city council to enact and amend zoning ordinances. That the zoning board of appeals does not have the statutory authority to amend a zoning ordinance does not render it incapa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ble of offering an alternative form of relief to Paragon.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The Legislature specifically intended that the zoning board of appeals have the administrative authority to permit uses that would otherwise not be permitted under a zoning ordinance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">If there axe practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, the board of appeals may in passing upon appeals vary or modify any of its rules or provisions relating to . . . the use of land ... so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The decision of the city council on the rezoning request in no way diminished the zoning board of appeals\u2019 authority to grant a variance if Paragon pursued that alternative form of relief. Were the zoning board of appeals to deny Paragon\u2019s request, relief in the form of an appeal to the circuit court is authorized by statute. MCL 125.585(11); MSA 5.2935(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Finally, Paragon asserts that it would have been futile to seek a use variance from Novi\u2019s Zoning Board of Appeals because the issues associated with its property affect other properties in the neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>hood.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The zoning enabling act allows for variances only when the ordinance as applied creates \u201cpractical difficulties or unnecessary hardship.\u201d MCL 125.585(9); MSA 5.2935(9). Paragon relies on <em>Puritan-Greenfield, supra </em>at 671, which construed the hardship requirement of MCL 125.585(9); MSA 5.2935(9) in conjunction with the general principle that variances should be sparingly granted, and concluded that the hardship must be \u201cunique or peculiar to the property for which the variance is sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The principle that variances should be sparingly granted is based on the possibility that granting a variance to a single landowner suffering a plight common to neighboring property could undermine the broad goals of a zoning ordinance by precipitating a series of variance requests. However, the statute does not require that \u201conly a single ownership parcel of land be affected by the unique circumstances in the neighborhood in order to qualify for relief . . . .\u201d <em>Beatrice Block Club Ass\u2019n v Facen, </em>40 Mich App 372, 381; 198 NW2d 828 (1972). The zones created by ordinance cannot be expected to conform exactly to the physical boundaries of \u201cproblems\u201d associated with land. It would be inappropriate and an undue limitation of the available statutory relief to strictly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>apply Puritan-Greenfield\u2019s uniqueness concept in this case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus we reject Paragon\u2019s futility argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Because Paragon failed to obtain a final decision from which an actual or concrete injury can be determined, its constitutional claim is not ripe for review.

Repeat after me: \u201cThis is a rezoning case. This case does <em>not </em>involve a request for a use variance. The city council <em>alone </em>has the power to rezone. The zoning board of appeals has <em>no </em>authority to rezone property.\u201d If these basic principles are kept in mind, the \u201cripeness\u201d argument is seen as the pointless waste of time and resources that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The majority holds that \u201c[b]ecause Paragon failed to obtain a final decision from which an actual or concrete injury can be determined, its constitutional claim is not ripe for review.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 583. Under longstanding precedent of this Court, the Novi City Council\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s rezoning request was a final decision on the actual issue presented by plaintiff\u2019s complaint in this case, i.e., the constitutionality of the challenged zoning ordinance. Furthermore, the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals is precluded by the zoning enabling act, MCL 125.581 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2931 <em>et seq., </em>and the Novi Zoning Ordinance from granting the relief sought. Accordingly, I dissent from the major<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ity\u2019s conclusion that the merits of plaintiffs constitutional challenge to the Novi Zoning Ordinance axe not ripe for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The statement of facts in the majority opinion contains what I perceive as the essential fact in resolving the case before us.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-8\">In May 1984, Paragon submitted a request to the Planning Board of the City of Novi to rezone the property from a single-family residential zone to a mobile home district zone. The planning board held a public hearing in August 1984 and recommended that the rezoning request be denied. At a subsequent public hearing, the Novi City Council denied Paragon\u2019s request. <em>[Ante, </em>p 572.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s request for rezoning is the accurate characterization of the substance of that request, a characterization that is the necessary prerequisite to a proper application of the relevant law. What plaintiff wants is its property rezoned from large lot, single family to mobile home, a totally distinct zoning classification and a difference that exceeds the applicability of a use variance. At the hearing on defendant\u2019s request for summary judgment, plaintiff\u2019s counsel specifically advised the trial court that plaintiff was not asking for a variance from the present zoning classification; rather, plaintiff sought to have the property rezoned to another, distinct zoning classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">In <em>Long v Highland Park, </em>329 Mich 146; 45 NW2d 10 (1950), the plaintiffs filed a complaint in circuit court, seeking a declaratory judgment that a zoning ordinance was unconstitutional. The defendant, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>appeal in this Court, claimed that the courts were without jurisdiction because \u201cthe plaintiffs had not exhausted their remedy under the provisions of the zoning ordinance by applying for a building permit, seeking relief from the zoning board of appeals, the zoning commission, and the common council of the city.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 149. This Court held that \u201c[t]here is no merit in the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court\u2019s conclusion was based, in relevant part, on the fact that the relevant municipal authorities \u201ccould not grant the relief here sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This exact situation obtains in the case at bar. Paragon\u2019s complaint alleged that \u201cthe zoning ordinance of the City of Novi as applied to Plaintiff\u2019s Property is unconstitutional and is void,\u201d that \u201cthe actions of the City of Novi in refusing to rezone Plaintiff\u2019s Property to permit the use as a mobile home park are unreasonable, oppressive and a discriminatory exercise of the City\u2019s police power insofar as it affects Plaintiff and Plaintiff\u2019s Property,\u201d and requested that the circuit court \u201center judgment finding that the zoning ordinance of the City of Novi as applied to Plaintiff\u2019s Property described in this Complaint is an unconstitutional abuse of the police power and is null and void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Plaintiff wants its property rezoned; it wants to use its property in accordance with a zoning classification (mobile home) that is wholly distinct from the zoning classification (large lot, single family) being challenged in this case. Rezoning is beyond the power of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>a zoning board of appeals, and the \u201cuse\u201d to which plaintiff wants to put its land is plainly beyond the permissible scope of any use variance the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals could grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The charter of the City of Novi enumerates those subjects that \u201cthe City shall have power with respect to\u201d and those that the city \u201cmay, by ordinance or other lawful acts of its officers, provide for . . . .\u201d Novi City Charter, \u00a7 2.2. Relevant to this case is subsection 1, which confers on the city the power of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">[establishing districts or zones within which use of land and structures, the height, the area, the size and location of buildings and required open spaces for light and ventilation of such buildings and the density of population may be regulated by ordinances in accordance with statutory provisions governing zoning; and to prescribe by ordinance, method of enforcement of conditions imposed by the Board of Appeals on applications for variances or for certificates or licenses under provisions of a zoning ordinance .... <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 2.2(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The legislative function of establishing land use zones by ordinance can be exercised only by the city through its legislative body, the city council.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>also within this legislative compass is the power to circumscribe the conditions under which a zoning board of appeals may grant use variances. Under the ordinances governing this case, the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals is unable to grant the relief plaintiff seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">The authority under which municipalities enact zoning ordinances is the state zoning enabling act. The provision of that act relevant to the issue before us states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">If there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the ordinance, the board of appeals may in passing upon appeals vary or modify any of its rules or provisions relating to the construction, or structural changes in, equipment, or alteration of buildings or structures, or the use of land, buildings, or structures, so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety secured, and substantial justice done. [MCL 125.585(9); MSA 5.2935(9).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Pursuant to this authority, the Novi City Council enacted \u00a7 3104 of its municipal code, which, as the majority duly notes <em>(ante, </em>p 575), provides that the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals may grant a land use variance where \u201cit is clearly shown that the land cannot be used for a zoned use . . . .\u201d A more complete quotation of \u00a7 3104, however, demonstrates the legal basis for my dissent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">The Zoning Board of Appeals shall not have the power to alter or change the zoning district classification of any property, nor to make any change in the terms of this Ordinance but shall have the power to authorize a use in a zoning district in which it is not otherwise permitted, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>it is clearly shown that the land cannot be used for a zoned use .... [Novi Zoning Ordinance, \u00a7 3104(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Plaintiff does not argue that the land cannot be used for large-lot, single family development. Rather, plaintiff\u2019s claim is that such development is not economically feasible. It, therefore, might even be questionable whether plaintiff would satisfy the threshold requirements for the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals to consider the possibility of granting a use variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Subsection 1(b) of \u00a7 3104 further specifies the permissible bases for the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals to grant a land use variance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-8\">To authorize, upon an appeal, a variance from the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of a specific piece of property at the time of enactment of this Ordinance or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary or exceptional conditions of such property, the strict application of the regulations enacted would result in peculiar or exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional undue hardship upon the owner of such property provided such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In my opinion, no plausible interpretation of these carefully defined and exacting standards could allow the Novi Zoning Board of Appeals to grant plaintiff\u2019s rezoning request in the guise of a use variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Disastrous results will flow from the majority\u2019s requirement that every rezoning request must be run through a zoning board of appeals. These boards are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>comprised of citizen appointees with no required expertise in land use or planning. They review each request for a variance as <em>presented. </em>They have no staff of expert or professional planners. They do <em>not, </em>nor are they required to, explore the variety of potential variances to which a petitioner might be able to establish an entitlement. Again, remember that this petitioner <em>does not want </em>a variance. When presented with this petitioner\u2019s request for rezoning to mobile home classification, this board <em>could do nothing </em>other than say, \u201cGet out of here. Go see the city council!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Another flaw in the majority\u2019s view of this case is the mistaken assumption that running every rezoning request through a zoning board of appeals will produce some definitive relief or establish some kind of binding determination. The majority states, \u201cThe City of Novi\u2019s denial of Paragon\u2019s rezoning request is not a final decision because, absent a request for a variance, there is no <em>information regarding the potential uses of the property </em>that might have been permitted, nor, therefore, is there <em>information regarding the extent of the injury </em>Paragon may have suffered as a result of the ordinance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ante, </em>p 580. As stated previously, this mistakenly assumes a zoning board of appeals considers, determines, or offers other potential uses. It does <em>not, </em>even when the petitioner is specifically seeking a particular variance, let alone as here where the petitioner does not want a variance but is seeking to rezone. Further, the information \u201cregarding the extent of the injury Paragon may have suffered as a result of the ordinance\u201d is the petitioner\u2019s burden to produce, as was done here, to the planning commission and the city council, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>then to the circuit court. Assuming this petitioner jumped through the unnecessary, unavailing hoop the majority requires, would any \u201cfinding\u201d by the zoning board of appeals be binding on a reviewing court? I hardly think so. The city would still have to present its expert testimony, as it did here, to satisfy the court that there were alternatives <em>within that zoning classification </em>to which the plaintiff could put its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Finally, I would be remiss if I failed to point out the majority\u2019s complete misunderstanding of the two cases on which it primarily relies, <em>Williamson Co Regional Planning Comm v Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, </em>473 US 172; 105 S Ct 3108; 87 L Ed 2d 126 (1985), and <em>Electro-Tech, Inc v HF Campbell Co, </em>433 Mich 57; 445 NW2d 61 (1989). Both cases are inappo-site to the situation here presented. In <em>neither </em>case was a <em>rezoning </em>sought or at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">In <em>Williamson, supra, </em>the developer\u2019s proposed plat did not comply with certain requirements of the current zoning ordinance. The Court stated at 188:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">It appears that variances could have been granted to resolve at least five of the Commission\u2019s eight objections to the plat. The Board of Zoning Appeals had the power to grant certain variances from the zoning ordinance, including the ordinance\u2019s density requirements and its restriction on placing units on land with slopes having a grade in excess of 25%. . . . The Commission had the power to grant variances from the subdivision regulations, including the cul-de-sac, road-grade, and frontage requirements. Indeed, the Temple Hills Committee had recommended that the Commission grant variances from those regulations. . . . Nevertheless, respondent did not seek variances from either the Board or the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Unlike here, the <em>Williamson </em>developer was not asking that the zoning classification be changed, and the zoning board of appeals had the authority to vary some of the current zoning classification\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The majority\u2019s other cornerstone, <em>Electro-Tech, </em>is also inapposite to this case. I signed Justice Brickley\u2019s dissent in <em>Electro-Tech </em>because I agreed with him that the majority seriously misread <em>Williamson. </em>But, putting aside that dispute, any reading of <em>Electro-Tech </em>would quickly disclose that it also did <em>not </em>involve a change in zoning classification. There was no question in that case that the petitioner\u2019s property was in the appropriate zoning classification for the use sought, i.e., another manufacturing plant behind the existing facility. Chief Justice Riley wrote for the majority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-5\">In the instant case, the council had imposed, in addition to the improper dedication requirement, four \u201cvalid\u201d conditions on the issuance of the permit. Because Electro-Tech failed to remedy these valid requirements or to submit a revised site plan evidencing compliance therewith, it was unclear whether or how much the improper condition interfered with the owner\u2019s investment-backed expectations. Electro-Tech\u2019s claim, therefore, was not ripe for review. See discussion of <em>Williamson, swpra, </em>in section n(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-6\">Because we conclude in section n(c), that the City of Westland had not made a final determination regarding the disposition of Electro-Tech\u2019s property, we need not decide at this time whether Electro-Tech has established an unconstitutional taking. [433 Mich 75.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Those conditions, prerequisites to issuance of building permits, clearly <em>could have been </em>altered, varied, or changed by the city council or the zoning board of appeals. Thus, the plaintiff having failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>request that relief, the <em>Electro-Tech </em>majority concluded that there had been no \u201cfinal\u201d determination by the city. The distinction between this case and both <em>Williamson </em>and Electro-Tech. could not be clearer. This plaintiff does not seek or wish any of the other (who knows how many) possible uses available to it in its current zoning classification. It sought a rezoning of its property so it could erect a mobile home park. This plaintiff received a \u201cfinal\u201d determination from the City of Novi when the city council, the only body able to grant the relief sought, denied the rezoning request. Plaintiff, then, bearing the very heavy burden of proving the city\u2019s action arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and confiscatory because it was deprived of all reasonable use of its property, could clearly seek redress in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In my opinion, the requirements in the zoning enabling act (\u201cthat the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed\u201d) and in the Novi Zoning Ordinance (that a use variance may be authorized only \u201cwithout substantially impairing the intent and purpose of this Ordinance\u201d) would not be satisfied by a use variance that gave plaintiff the relief it seeks. Therefore, because the Novi City Council\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s request to rezone its property constituted the final legal decision available with regard to the actual substance of plaintiff\u2019s request, plaintiff should not be required to seek a use variance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals that a final decision was not obtained and remand this case to the Court of Appeals for review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>of the merits of the circuit court\u2019s opinion and judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would also instruct the Court of Appeals to address the effect, if any, of the Novi City Council\u2019s subsequent rezoning of the property at issue to light industrial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b683-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-6\"> There is no indication in the <em>Long </em>opinion that the plaintiffs made a rezoning request to the Highland Park City Council. Because such a rezoning request was made in this case, there is no need to consider whether <em>Long </em>and other decisions of this Court should be overruled to require that there always be a request for rezoning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> Any such major change in the use of property, as requested here (i.e., single family residential to mobile home park), would also be subject to \u00a7 7.8 of the Novi City Charter, which allows objecting citizens to call for a referendum on such a legislative determination. If, as the majority thinks possible, the zoning board of appeals, without amendment of the current zoning ordinance, grants plaintiff the relief it seeks and allows its \u201cuse\u201d to be changed to mobile homes, there would be no ordinance regarding which objecting citizens could exercise their charter-based right of referendum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-7\"> At this point, I note my agreement with the majority that \u201c[t]his is not a case in which all development of the land was physically impossible by application of the ordinance\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p 580, n 14) because I think this factor is integral to ultimate resolution of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
