Under this statute, the people must prove that the driver had the general intent to drive while intoxicated and that this wrongful act, i.e., the <em>intoxicated </em>driving, must be the cause of the death. Because we conclude that this statute does not violate defendants\u2019 due process rights, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Lardie, </em>207 Mich App 615, 621; 525 NW2d 504 (1994), concluding that the statute was constitutional, and affirm the Court of Appeals order in <em>People v Hudick, </em>entered April 3, 1995 (Docket No. 176774), refusing to grant leave to defendant Hudick after the trial court approved the statute\u2019s constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE v LARDIE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On May 22, 1993, defendant Lardie drank alcohol and smoked marijuana at a party at his parents\u2019 home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was seventeen years old. He left his home at approximately 1:50 A.M. to give several people from the party a ride to one of their cars. From the physical evidence, defendant apparently drove the car off the paved road and traveled about 130 feet on the shoulder. The car hit a small tree and then, traveling another sixty or seventy feet, struck a larger one, killing the three passengers in the back seat, Jason Statesman, Kendra Tiernan, and Erinn Tompkins. Lardie had an estimated blood-alcohol level of 0.12 percent or greater at the time of the accident and tested positive for marijuana use. The medical expert testified that taking these two substances together creates a \u201csynergistic type impairment,\u201d multiplying the impairment rather than just adding to what each would cause alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">The people charged Lardie with three counts of causing death by operating a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4). He moved to dismiss the charges, claiming that the statute violated his right to due process because it did not require proof of either a mens rea or some form of negligence. The circuit court dismissed the counts against Lardie because it concluded that the statute was unconstitutional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>[H]olding the drunk driver accountable for incapacitating injury or death, without allowing the jury to examine his mental state, denies him basic due process, eliminates the jury as the arbiter of morally-culpable conduct, deprives the Court of facts necessary to fashion a proportional sentence, and erodes individual freedom. The record before this Court is insufficient to support such a draconian approach to this social problem created by drunk driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">If ouil Causing Death, a 15-year felony, is countenanced as consistent with due process requirements of the Michigan and United States Constitutions, then that determination must be made by an appellate court. This trial court sees neither a basis in law or principles of moral culpability, nor evidence of need for easier convictions that would justify holding a drunk driver accountable for a death -without allowing the jury to evaluate his mental intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The people appealed by right in the Court of Appeals. In an opinion per curiam, the Court of Appeals reversed because it concluded that the statute was constitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so concluding, the Court determined that the statute was not a codification of a common-law offense, but, rather, it characterized the statute as a \u201cstrict liability, public welfare offense\u201d without an element requiring the people to prove mens rea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Defendant Lardie appealed the decision to this Court, which granted leave. The case was argued with <em>Hudick.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\n<em>PEOPLE v HUDICK</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">On March 6, 1994, at approximately 1:30 A.M., on a rainy night, defendant Hudick was driving a truck in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the right lane of a four-lane highway. William Wien-claw, a pedestrian, was intoxicated and was standing in the right lane in the dark when Hudick struck him with his vehicle and killed him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hudick was given a Breathalyzer test at 2:45 A.M., which showed a blood-alcohol level of 0.13 percent. Another driver, Christa Holbrook, testified at the preliminary examination that she was driving on the road at the same time and did not see Wienclaw until she was about sixty or seventy feet away from him. She said she was able to see him because a vehicle turned out of a truck station across the street, crossed in front of her, and shined its lights on him. She crossed into the other lane nearer the median.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defendant was in the same lane as Holbrook when he hit Wienclaw.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The people charged Hudick with involuntary manslaughter with a motor vehicle and, under MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4), with causing death by operating a vehicle while intoxicated. At the preliminary examination, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional, claiming that it denied him due process by eliminating the need for finding a mens rea. The district court rejected this argument, concluding that the statute was not unconstitutional, and bound him over for trial on these charges. Hudick again moved to dismiss the charges in the Detroit Recorder\u2019s Court, but the court denied the motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and held the trial in abeyance pending the outcome of defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Hudick applied for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals. After holding the application in abeyance pending the outcome of <em>Lardie, </em>the Court denied the application on April 3, 1995. Hudick applied for leave to appeal in this Court, which granted leave to hear this case with Lardie,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">I. MENS REA OF THE. CRIME</p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The statute at issue, established by 1991 PA 98, provided at the time of these accidents in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">A person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles, including an area designated for the parking of vehicles, within this state, under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol, and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes the death of another person is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years, or a fine of not less than $2,500.00 or more than $10,000.00, or both. [MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4).][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>i</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The same statute, under subsection 6, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> made it a misdemeanor to drive while intoxicated, establishing a maximum penalty of imprisonment for ninety days or a fine between $100 and $500 for the first offense. Subsection 6 also provided for a one-year maximum sentence in prison and up to a $1,000 fine for a second violation within seven years, and for a five-year maximum sentence and $5,000 fine for a third violation if the two previous violations occurred within ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In order to determine whether a statute imposes strict liability or requires proof of a mens rea, that is, a guilty mind, this Court first examines the statute itself and seeks to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>People v Quinn, </em>440 Mich 178, 185; 487 NW2d 194 (1992). In interpreting a statute in which the Legislature has not expressly included language indicating that fault is a necessary element of a crime, this Court must focus on whether the Legislature nevertheless intended to require some fault as a predicate to finding guilt. <em>Id. </em>In this statute, the Legislature did not expressly state that a defendant must have a criminal intent to commit this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Criminal intent is ordinarily an element of a crime even where the crime is created by statute. <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>Rice, </em>161 Mich 657, 664; 126 NW 981 (1910). Statutes that create strict liability for all of their elements are not favored. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187. Nevertheless, a state may decide under its police power that certain acts or omissions are to be punished irrespective of the actor\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 186-187; <em>People v Hatinger, </em>174 Mich 333, 335; 140 NW 648 (1913). Many of the crimes that impose strict liability have been termed \u201cpublic welfare regulation.\u201d <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187; see also <em>Morissette v United States, </em>342 US 246, 255; 72 S Ct 240; 96 L Ed 288 (1952) (public-welfare offenses). Chief Justice Thomas Cooley succinctly described the general rule that a criminal statute requires a mens rea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">I agree that as a rule there can be no crime without a criminal intent; but this is not by any means a universal rule. One may be guilty of the high crime of manslaughter when his only fault is gross negligence; and there are many other cases where mere neglect may be highly criminal. Many statutes which are in the nature of police regulations . . . impose criminal penalties irrespective of any intent to violate them; the purpose being to require a degree of diligence for the protection of the public which shall render violation impossible. <em>[People v Roby, </em>52 Mich 577, 579; 18 NW 365 (1884).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Specific intent is defined as a particular criminal intent beyond the act done, whereas general intent is merely the intent to perform the physical act itself. <em>People v Beaudin, </em>417 Mich 570, 573-574; 339 NW2d 461 (1983); <em>People v Langworthy, </em>416 Mich 630, 639, 644; 331 NW2d 171 (1982).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For a strict-liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>crime, the people need only prove that the act was performed regardless of what the actor knew or did not know. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 188. On this basis, the distinction between a strict-liability crime and a general-intent crime is that, for a general-intent crime, the people must prove that the defendant purposefully or voluntarily performed the wrongful act, whereas, for a strict-liability crime, the people merely need to prove that the defendant performed the wrongful act, irrespective of whether he intended to perform it. Under MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4), this distinction is important only in the rare circumstances where a defendant was driving when he honestly did not know he had consumed alcohol, which subsequently caused him to be intoxicated, or where he was forced to drive for some reason despite his intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In both <em>Lardie </em>and <em>Hudick, </em>the people argue on appeal that the statute did require proof of a mens rea: The people claim that the statute requires proof that the defendant had the general intent to commit the underlying misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated. Where a statute is a codification of the common law and that common-law crime includes a mens rea as an element, this Court will interpret that statute to require a mens rea even if the statute is silent regarding knowledge as a necessary element. See <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 185-186. The people in <em>Lardie </em>claim that this statute was a codification of the common-law crime of involuntary manslaughter caused by intoxicated driving as articulated by this Court in <em>People v Townsend, </em>214 Mich 267, 273; 183 NW 177 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>(1921). The Court of Appeals decided that the statute was not a codification of the common law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In <em>Townsend, </em>the defendant was driving while intoxicated and struck and killed a pedestrian. This Court concluded that the information charging the defendant with involuntary manslaughter was sufficiently definite to inform him of the offense on which he would be tried because \u201c[t]he information clearly show[ed] that defendant was engaged in an unlawful and culpably negligent act and that such act directly contributed to the death of [the victim].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In so concluding, this Court reasoned that \u201c[i]t is gross and culpable negligence for a drunken man to guide and operate an automobile upon a public highway, and one doing so and occasioning injuries to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>another, causing death, is guilty of manslaughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273. This is what MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4) provides even though it does not term the crime a kind of involuntary manslaughter. The Court in <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 280, also approved<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the jury instructions given by the trial court, which provided that if the jury found that the defendant was driving while intoxicated, and by his intoxicated operation of the vehicle caused the victim\u2019s death, he was guilty of involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court reasoned that the intent to drive while intoxicated was irrelevant because involuntary manslaughter does not require proof of a criminal intent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The Court distinguished the case from an earlier involuntary-manslaughter case, in which the death was caused by a person speeding in an automobile, where the Court had found the instructions to be erroneous. In <em>People v Barnes, </em>182 Mich 179, 181; 148 NW 400 (1914), the trial court instructed the jury that it could convict the defendant of involuntary manslaughter if it found that he was exceeding the speed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>limit, which was an unlawful act, and thereby killed the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 188-189.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This Court reversed because it held, among other things, that violation of the speeding law, by itself, was not adequate to establish involuntary manslaughter, but, instead, the people must prove gross negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 192-193, 196-197, 199.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Townsend </em>distinguished <em>Barnes </em>by stating that the unlawful act in <em>Townsend </em>was malum in se (wrong in itself), as opposed to being malum prohib-itum (wrong because prohibited). See <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 280-281.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Thus, in <em>Townsend, </em>unlike <em>Barnes, </em>the people did not need to prove gross negligence because it was presumed, as a matter of law, from the malum in se act of driving while intoxicated. Or, on a different theory of common-law involuntary manslaughter, this Court in <em>Townsend </em>may have distinguished <em>Barnes </em>because the people in <em>Townsend </em>established involuntary manslaughter through evidence that the defendant killed another during the commission of an unlawful act when that misdemeanor was malum in se. Under either interpretation of <em>Townsend, </em>the statute at issue accomplishes the same basic end because it does not require a showing of gross negligence, but only that the defendant committed the underlying misdemeanor of intoxicated driving. Nevertheless, the statute does not appear to be a codification of the common law for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The statute is designed to deter motorists from deciding to drive after they have become intoxicated. Therefore, the culpable act that the Legislature wishes to prevent is the one in which a person becomes intoxicated and then decides to drive. The statute is not designed to prevent \u201cvoluntary intoxication.\u201d The Court in <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 272, not only addressed the evil of intoxicated driving, but also focused on the vice of voluntary intoxication, identifying it as a violation of common decency and good morals since the time of Noah. Unlike <em>Townsend, </em>the statute unambiguously seeks to punish the harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>caused by intoxicated driving, not voluntary intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Moreover, the statute at issue creates a threshold of 0.10 percent alcohol content, above which the defendant is considered to be in the same category as someone \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d This aspect of the statute does not come from the common law, but is a statutory creation.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Furthermore, the Legislature created its own statutory penalty for a violation of this statute. The statute does not adopt the manslaughter penalty provided by MCL 750.321; MSA 28.553.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Legislature would likely have referred to the manslaughter statute for the penalty for the crime if it wished to codify the crime from the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Finally, there is no basis from the legislative histoiy of this statute to conclude that the Legislature was attempting to codify <em>Townsend, </em>or the common law more generally, when it created this criminal offense. Consequently, we conclude that this statute was not codified from the common law, and so cannot look to it alone to determine if there is a mens rea requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Where the offense in question does not codify the common law and omits reference to the element of intent, this Court will examine the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the legislation to determine whether there is a mens rea requirement. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 186. Before the passage of 1991 PA 98, the people could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>charge an intoxicated driver who caused the death of another with involuntary manslaughter, as defined by the common law, the lesser charge of negligent homicide under MCL 750.324; MSA 28.556,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> or, of course, murder if warranted by the facts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> By statute, manslaughter (either voluntary or involuntary) is a felony that carries a maximum penalty of fifteen years imprisonment, or a fine of $7,500. MCL 750.321; MSA 28.553. Negligent homicide is a misdemeanor punishable by two years in prison, or by a fine of $2,000. MCL 750.324; MSA 28.556.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">For either of these crimes, the Legislature likely believed that under Michigan law the people must prove some form of negligence. For negligent homicide, the people must prove that the driver was negligent or driving at an unreasonable speed. See <em>People v Paulen, </em>327 Mich 94, 99; 41 NW2d 488 (1950). See also CJI2d 16.14.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> For involuntary manslaughter, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Court of Appeals held in 1987 that the people must prove that the driver was grossly negligent. See <em>People v Thinel, </em>160 Mich App 450, 455, 458; 408 NW2d 474 (1987),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> vacated on other grounds 429 Mich 859, 859-860; 412 NW2d 923 (1987).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See also CJI2d 16.12.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Under the plain language of MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4), there is no requirement that the people prove gross negligence or negligence in order to prosecute someone for causing another person\u2019s death by operating a vehicle while intoxicated. Thus, in light of <em>Thinel, supra, </em>and the standard jury instructions, the Legislature must have intended to eliminate this element as a requirement when it enacted the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We must then determine whether the Legislature intended to make this a strict-liability crime, not requiring proof of any fault other than the act of driving while intoxicated, when it eliminated the element of gross negligence. In interpreting this statute, the Court of Appeals in <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 618, concluded that the Legislature did not require the people to prove either general or specific intent, but imposed a penalty as a matter of strict liability. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the Legislature intended to create a strict-liability offense because it omitted any reference to criminal intent when it amended the statute.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>This Court examines the legislative history of a statute to determine whether the Legislature intended to eliminate the requirement that the people prove any element of fault. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 190-191.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>enacting 1991 PA 98, the Legislature must have been aware that under common-law involuntary manslaughter, gross negligence is equivalent to a criminal intent. <em>People v Datema, </em>448 Mich 585, 604; 533 NW2d 272 (1995), citing <em>Barnes, supra </em>at 198. In eliminating the issue of gross negligence as a question of fact for the jury, the Legislature essentially has presumed that driving while intoxicated is gross negligence as a matter of law. Once the people prove that a defendant was driving while intoxicated, the people need not prove the further point that the defendant\u2019s driving was grossly negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">In eliminating this requirement, the Legislature likely wished to require proof of a criminal intent for the criminal act of intoxicated driving. The presumption of gross negligence from the act itself is only reasonable if the defendant (1) <em>voluntarily </em>decided to drive and (2) drove <em>knowing </em>that he had consumed an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance and, therefore, knowing he could be intoxicated.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Under common-law involuntary manslaughter, the people must prove three elements in order to establish gross negligence to a jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">(1) Knowledge of a situation requiring the exercise of ordinary care and diligence to avert injury to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(2) Ability to avoid the resulting harm by ordinary care and diligence in the use of the means at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">(3) The omission to use such care and diligence to avert the threatened danger when to the ordinary mind it must be apparent that the result is likely to prove disastrous to another. <em>[People v Orr, </em>243 Mich 300, 307; 220 NW 777 (1928).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Under the statute at issue, the Legislature\u2019s determination that as a matter of law the act of driving while intoxicated is gross negligence would only satisfy this definition if the driver voluntarily chose to drive with the knowledge that he had consumed alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The Legislature may also have had reservations about the ability of the people to prove the third prong of the <em>Orr </em>test because a defendant\u2019s irresponsible decision to drive while intoxicated is not necessarily <em>\u201clikely </em>to prove disastrous.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See CJI2d 16.18(4).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The Legislature reasonably may have decided that the voluntary act of driving while intoxicated is grossly negligent because it \u201cshows a culpable indifference to the safety of others . . . .\u201d See <em>People v Campbell, </em>237 Mich 424, 428; 212 NW 97 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Moreover, in creating this irrebuttable presumption of gross negligence from the wrongful act, the Legislature intended to deter drunk driving and, therefore, must have intended that the people prove that the driver voluntarily, i.e., <em>\u201cwilling[ly],\u201d </em>decided to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>mit this culpable act.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Otherwise, the statute would impose a penalty on a driver who was forced to drive while intoxicated or honestly did not know that he had drunk alcohol before driving.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Such a result would not further the Legislature\u2019s intent to deter this gravely dangerous conduct because, in those circumstances, the act would not be willingly chosen.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Furthermore, this crime does not fit the definition of a public-welfare strict-liability offense despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>opposite conclusion of the Court of Appeals in <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 620. Generally, such statutes are designed to protect the public welfare by placing the burden of protecting society on a person \u201c \u2018otherwise innocent but standing in responsible relation to public danger.\u2019 \u201d <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187, quoting <em>United States v Dotterweich, </em>320 US 277, 281; 64 S Ct 134; 88 L Ed 48 (1943).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court explained that these regulatory statutes do not require a criminal intent because the accused generally is in a position to prevent the harm. <em>Morissette, supra </em>at 256.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">In <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187, this Court explained that a statute creating a misdemeanor with a maximum two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>year sentence for transporting a loaded firearm was a public-welfare regulation because \u201c[t]he statute does not punish crimes mala in se, but, rather, regulates conduct under the state\u2019s police power to promote the social good . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In contrast, the legislation in the present case seeks not to regulate the conduct of a <em>person who is otherwise innocent, </em>but punishes a person\u2019s gravely irresponsible act of operating a vehicle while intoxicated when that act causes another person\u2019s death. As this Court explained in <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 273, such conduct is malum in se.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Also, the penalties for public-welfare strict-liability crimes generally are \u201crelatively small\u201d and do no \u201cgrave damage to an offender\u2019s reputation.\u201d <em>Staples v United States, </em>511 US 600, 617-618; 114 S Ct 1793; 128 L Ed 2d 608 (1994), quoting <em>Morissette, supra </em>at 256.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Whereas, the penalties under this statute are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>relatively severe and are designed to harm a person\u2019s reputation, in order thereby to operate as a deterrent for others. Thus, we would not characterize this statute, creating a fifteen-year felony, as a public-welfare offense. See <em>Staples, supra </em>at 617-618.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Consequently, consistent with the Legislature\u2019s decision to presume gross negligence as a matter of law and its desire to deter intoxicated driving, the Legislature must reasonably have intended that the people prove a mens rea by demonstrating that the defendant purposefully drove while intoxicated or, in other words, that he had the .general intent to perform the wrongful act.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Where a statute requires a \u201ccriminal mind\u201d for some, but not all, of the elements of the crime, the statute does not impose strict liability. <em>Quinn, supra </em>at 187, citing <em>United States v Freed, </em>401 US 601; 91 S Ct 1112; 28 L Ed 2d 356 (1971). Because the statute requires proof of a mens rea, it does not impose strict liability. Rather, we conclude that the statute requires the people to prove that a defendant, who kills someone by driving while intoxicated, acted knowingly in consuming an intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, and acted voluntarily in deciding to drive after such consumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">H. CAUSATION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The statute provides that a defendant is guilty of this crime when, \u201cby the operation\u201d of his vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, he \u201ccauses the death of another person.\u201d MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4). The Legislature passed 1991 PA 98 in order to reduce the number of alcohol-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>related traffic fatalities.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The Legislature sought to deter drivers who are \u201cwilling to risk current penalties\u201d from drinking and driving.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In seeking to reduce fatalities by deterring drunken driving, the statute must have been designed to punish drivers when their <em>drunken </em>driving caused another\u2019s death.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Otherwise, the statute would impose a penalty on a driver even when his wrongful decision to drive while intoxicated had no bearing on the death that resulted. Such an interpretation of the statute would produce an absurd result by divorcing the defendant\u2019s fault from the resulting injury.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> We seek to avoid such an interpretation. See <em>Jennings v Southwood, </em>446 Mich 125, 141-142; 521 NW2d 230 (1994).<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Moreover, this interpretation would not directly further the Legislature\u2019s purpose of reducing fatalities because there is no reason to penalize an intoxicated driver with a fifteen-year felony when there is an accident resulting in a fatality if that driver, even if not intoxicated, would still have been the cause in fact of the victim\u2019s death. There would be no reason because it would not prevent that fatality from occurring again. Therefore, in proving causation, the people must establish that the particular defendant\u2019s decision to drive while intoxicated produced a change in that driver\u2019s operation of the vehicle that caused the death of the victim.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> In this way, the statute does not impose a severe penalty when the injury was unavoidable for that particular driver (regardless of whether he was intoxicated), because the statute ensures that the wrongful decision caused the death in the accident.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>On the basis of this analysis, the elements of the crime that the people would be required to prove are similar to those for involuntary manslaughter except that the people would not have to prove gross negligence. Hence, the people must prove that (1) the defendant was operating his motor vehicle while he was intoxicated,<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> (2) that he voluntarily decided to drive knowing that he had consumed alcohol and might be intoxicated,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and (3) that the defendant\u2019s intoxicated driving was a substantial cause of the vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Cf.

DUE PROCESS \u2014 SUFFICIENCY OF MORAL CULPABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Defendant Lardie argues that the general intent to commit a misdemeanor (the mens rea) cannot be transformed into the bad intent sufficient for due process purposes to justify a fifteen-year felony, unless the people demonstrate that this culpable decision (deciding to drive the vehicle while intoxicated) was the cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The United States Supreme Court has recognized that there are due process Umitations on the state\u2019s police power to impose a penalty for a violation of a law when a person charged with the crime did not have a criminal intent. See <em>Lambert v California, </em>355 US 225, 228; 78 S Ct 240; 2 L Ed 2d 228 (1957) (the defendant, a convicted felon, violated a Los Angeles ordinance requiring felons to register with the city when she failed to do so within five days of arriving because she had no actual knowledge of the provision).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> However, as we noted in part I, this is not a strict-liability statute. Therefore, any limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>articulated by the United States Supreme Court for a strict-liability offense as a matter of substantive due process do not apply to this statute. See also <em>Stanley v Turner, </em>6 F3d 399, 401-402 (CA 6, 1993).<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Defendant also relies on this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Datema, supra </em>at 602, and in <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672; 299 NW2d 304 (1980), in arguing that the statute violates due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>However, the Court in <em>Datema, supra </em>at 601, and in <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 721-729, was reviewing the question whether this Court should modify the common law by examining its treatment of the relationship between criminal intent and criminal liability. In those cases, the Court was not determining whether the common-law misdemeanor-manslaughter rule (Datema) or the common-law felony-murder rule <em>(Aaron) </em>violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States or Michigan Constitution. Rather, the Court was exercising its role in developing the common law. See <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 733. As the Court in <em>Aaron </em>noted, \u201c \u2018it is for this Court to decide whether a common-law rule shall be retained <em>unless </em>the Legislature states a rule that is inconsistent with or precludes a change in the common-law rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 723, n 112, quoting <em>Grushin v Fisher, </em>405 Mich 51, 58; 273 NW2d 893 (1979) (emphasis added). In the present case, this Court is reviewing a statute, and, therefore, we may not set aside the statute on due process grounds on the basis of this Court\u2019s authority to modify the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Moreover, even if the analyses of these cases were relevant to examining whether this statute violated defendants\u2019 due process rights, we do not believe that this statutory crime is inconsistent with the principles found in the common law as articulated by <em>Aaron </em>and <em>Datema</em><footnotemark><em>54</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>In <em>Aaron, supra </em>at 733, this Court struck down the common-law felony-murder rule because it violated \u201cthe basic premise of individual moral culpability upon which our criminal law is based\u201d by allowing proof of an intent to commit a felony as adequate to establish a defendant\u2019s liability for murder. In its place, the Court held that under common law, in order to prove that a defendant committed murder, the people must demonstrate that he either intended to kill or to inflict great bodily harm, or acted with a wanton and wilful disregard of the likelihood that the natural tendency of his conduct would be to cause death or great bodily harm. <em>Id. </em>The Court noted that the first-degree murder statute, MCL 750.316; MSA 25.548, would nevertheless continue to elevate murder to first-degree murder if the murder was committed during the perpetration or attempted perpetration of certain enumerated crimes. <em>Aaron </em>at 733-734.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In <em>Datema, supra </em>at 601-602, this Court examined the misdemeanor-manslaughter rule, which elevates a misdemeanor to involuntary manslaughter if that wrongful act causes another\u2019s death, in a case in which a defendant committed an assault and battery that unexpectedly resulted in the death of the victim. This Court upheld the common-law misdemeanor-manslaughter doctrine under the facts of the case because (1) \u201c[the] rule requires a jury finding beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>a reasonable doubt that there was a direct and proximate connection between the underlying crime and the resulting death\u201d and (2) assault and battery, the underlying misdemeanor, was a specific-intent crime in which the people must prove that the defendant had the intent to injure.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The statute at issue, like <em>Datema, supra </em>at 602, requires that there be a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the defendant\u2019s culpable state of mind, i.e., intentionally driving while intoxicated, and the resulting death. See part n.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In the present cases, however, the underlying crime, driving while intoxicated, is not a specific-intent crime. Nevertheless, the crime is malum in se as this Court explained in <em>Townsend, supra </em>at 273. The Court in <em>Datema </em>specifically decided not to address this question for the common law in which the underlying crime that caused the death was malum in se, but did not involve an intent to injure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">We do not resolve whether an act that was malum in se at common law but that does not involve the intent to injure can furnish the mens rea for involuntary manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">. . . Unanticipated and unusual situations arising from death caused by the commission of offenses defined as malum in se at the common law but that do not require an intent to injure must be dealt with case by case. <em>[Id. </em>at 607-608.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The statutory crime at issue in the present cases is analogous to common-law involuntary manslaughter in two different respects. Under the statute, a defendant is criminally responsible for causing death (1) by committing an unlawful act (driving while intoxicated) or (2) by performing a lawful act (driving) with gross negligence (presumed as a matter of law by the statute when a person drives while intoxicated). See <em>Datema, supra </em>at 595-596, quoting <em>People v Ryczek, </em>224 Mich 106, 110; 194 NW 609 (1923), for the general theories of involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The crime can analogously fit into either theory of common-law involuntary manslaughter. These theories are not mutually exclusive. <em>Datema, supra </em>at 596. Because the nature of the statute is to impose criminal liability on a defendant for the culpably (grossly) negligent decision to drive while intoxicated, which is an unlawful act, the statute includes both these theories of common-law involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In comparing this statute to gross-negligence involuntary manslaughter under the common law, we conclude that this statute does not conflict with the basic premise of \u201cindividual moral culpability\u201d from the common law articulated in <em>Aaron </em>even though it imposes a fifteen-year felony for an act that would only lead to a ninety-day misdemeanor (for a first-time offense) if it did not cause the death of another. The only difference between causing death by operating a vehicle while intoxicated and the crime of involuntary manslaughter with a motor vehicle is that under the common law the people must prove gross negligence, whereas under the statute the people <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>must prove that the defendant voluntarily drove, knowing that he might be intoxicated. The Legislature\u2019s decision to define the purposeful act of driving while intoxicated as gross negligence does not diminish a defendant\u2019s moral culpability. The moral culpability for the person who decides to drink and drive, where any reasonable person must recognize that he is creating a grave risk to himself and others, corresponds to the punishment of a fifteen-year felony when that decision causes the death of another.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> This is a just punishment. See Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), pp 890-896.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> The gravity of this crime, of course, depends on whether the guilty decision results in harm. Yet, this is the very nature of criminal negligence. The basic premise of Michigan criminal law from the common law requiring that the culpable mental state have a causal connection to the crime as stated in <em>Aaron </em>is not contradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">IV. APPLICATION TO <em>LARDIE </em>AND <em>HUDICK</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">In each of these cases, there is evidence that the driver was intoxicated while driving, his driving was impaired, and he killed another person while so driving. Lardie and Hudick do not claim that they did not voluntarily drive while intoxicated or that they did not know that they consumed alcohol before they drove. However, they may do so on remand. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>over, each party may raise a question at trial about whether the people have met their burden of proving that the particular driver\u2019s <em>decision to drive while intoxicated </em>was a substantial cause of the deaths. The question of causation is a factual one for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Although for different reasons than the Court of Appeals offered in <em>Lardie, </em>we affirm its decision to reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling. Moreover, in <em>Hudick, </em>the Court of Appeals properly denied leave to appeal after the trial court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The statute, MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4), creating a fifteen-year felony for death caused by intoxicated driving, is similar to common-law involuntary manslaughter except that it eliminates the people\u2019s need to prove gross negligence. By doing so, the Legislature instead has required that the people prove that the defendant had a general intent to commit the wrongful act: to drink and then drive. Thus, the statute does not impose strict liability. Moreover, the statute requires that the culpable mental state, the mens rea, have a causal relation to the harm that the statute seeks to prevent. The statute does not violate defendants\u2019 right of due process. We affirm the Court of Appeals decisions in <em>Lardie </em>and <em>Hudick.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b357-8\">Brickley, C.J., and Levin, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Mallett, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> At the time of these incidents, MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4) defined this condition as follows: \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\"> At the preliminary examination, James Raggett testified that Lardie had three cans of beer soon after Raggett first arrived at 7:30 P.M., drank three or four shots of whiskey at about 9:45 or 10:00 P.M., had another four or five shots at about 10:30 p.m., and was smoking marijuana at about 10:45 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b326-11\"> <em>Lardie, supra </em>at 621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b326-12\"> <em>Id. </em>at 620.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b326-13\"> 450 Mich 866 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b327-6\"> The officer described the area where Wienclaw was standing as providing \u201cpoor visibility.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\"> Holbrook confirmed that she would not have seen Wienclaw except that the car flashed its lights on him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b327-8\"> After Hudick hit Wienclaw, Holbrook toned her car around and parked in front of the body with the flashers on so that no one else would hit him.

He then collided with an oncoming car, killing a passenger in that vehicle. The defendant was charged with and convicted of involuntary manslaughter on the basis that he had possibly committed four separate misdemeanors, including speeding, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, operating a vehicle without reasonable control, and crossing a double yellow line.

To avoid this mistake, the third element should be more precisely defined as: that the <em>operation </em>of the vehicle by the defendant, <em>while \u201cunder the influence, </em>\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was a cause of the victim\u2019s death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>Further, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>would not require the prosecution to \u201cestablish that the particular defendant\u2019s decision to drive while intoxicated produced a change in that driver\u2019s operation of the vehicle that caused the death of the victim.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 258. The defendant\u2019s manner of driving, and any change in that manner attributable to the defendant\u2019s intoxicated state, is not an element of the statute. Rather, I would find that the causation element requires the people to prove that the death resulted from the defendant\u2019s commission of the culpable act prohibited by the statute, which occurs when \u201ca person becomes intoxicated and then decides to drive,\u201d and actually does so. <em>Id. </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The relevant parts of the statute, which established the third element, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\"><em>A person, </em>whether licensed or not, <em>who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway </em>or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles . . . within this state, <em>under the influence </em>of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol, <em>and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes the death of another person </em>is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years, or a fine of not less than $2,500.00 or more than $10,000.00, or both!<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This statute is the fourth of nineteen subsections within the driving while intoxicated, and reckless driving provisions, set forth in MCL 257.625; MSA 9.2325. Rules of statutory construction dictate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>this fourth subsection be construed as consistently as possible with the other subsections of MCL 257.625; MSA 9.2325.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The other relevant subsections of MCL 257.625; MSA 9.2325 included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">(1) <em>A person, </em>whether licensed or not, <em>shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway </em>or other place open to the general public or generally accessible to motor vehicles . . . within this state <em>if either of the following applies:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">(a) <em>The person is under the influence </em>of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">(b) <em>The person has a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more </em>by weight of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">(2) <em>The owner of a vehicle or a person in charge or in control of a vehicle shall not authorize or knowingly permit the vehicle to be operated upon a highway </em>or other place open to the general public . . . within this state <em>by a person who is under the influence </em>of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or who has a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">(3) <em>A person, </em>whether licensed or not, <em>shall not operate a vehicle upon a highway </em>or other place open to the general public . . . when, due to the consumption of an intoxicating liquor, a controlled substance, or a combination of an intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, <em>the person\u2019s ability to operate the vehicle is visibly impaired.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">(5) <em>A person, whether licensed or not, who operates a motor vehicle upon a highway </em>or other place open to the general public . . . within this state, <em>under the influence </em>of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol, <em>and by the operation of that motor vehicle causes a long-term incapacitating injury to another person is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>guilty of a felony, </em>punishable by imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or a fine of not less than $1,000.00 or more than $5,000.00, or both!<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">As the emphasized portions of these subsections indicate, none consider the <em>manner, </em>or the change in the manner, in which the vehicle is being operated. Instead, these companion provisions of the OUIL causing death statute turn on the driver\u2019s <em>condition </em>or <em>status </em>while operating the vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While the Court of Appeals was incorrect in concluding that the statute imposes strict liability, the Court was correct in asserting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">The crime of OUIL causing death contains the same elements as ouil with the only additional element being the aggravated circumstances of death resulting from the prohibited conduct</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">where the prohibited conduct was acting upon the decision to drive while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Absent clear legislative intent to the contrary, the section of MCL 257.625; MSA 9.2325 that includes the ouil causing death statute should be construed in accordance with its companion provisions so that the manner of operation, i.e., how the intoxicated defendant was driving, is not an element of the offense that the people must prove.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>The majority\u2019s definition of causation will require the people to \u201cestablish that the particular defendant\u2019s decision to drive while intoxicated produced a change in that driver\u2019s operation of the vehicle that caused the death of the victim.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 258. In other words, the people will have to prove that the intoxicated driver was not operating the vehicle as that person would have operated the vehicle if sober and driving under the same circumstances. Therefore, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the causation element in this statute requires the people to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) how the defendant typically drives when sober, taking into account any individual idi-osyncracies or limitations, (2) how that typical, sober manner of operation would affect the defendant\u2019s driving leading up to the fatal accident, (3) how the hypothetical results of the particular defendant\u2019s typical, sober manner of operation compare to the actual, intoxicated manner of operation and that there is an identifiable difference between the two <em>manners </em>of operation, and (4) that this difference in typical, hypothetical, sober driving and actual, intoxicated driving is \u201ca substantial\u201d cause in fact and \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the victim\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 258-260. As established below, this demanding burden of proof was not intended by the Legislature and is not found in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The plain language of the statute clearly indicates that the Legislature intended causation to turn on the fact that the defendant <em>operated </em>the vehicle while intoxicated, rather than the <em>changed manner in which, or how, the defendant operated </em>the vehicle while intoxicated. Therefore the defendant\u2019s culpability arises and should be evaluated in light of the defendant\u2019s culpable decision to drive while intoxicated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Unlike statutes, discussed below, that prohibit similar conduct, the clear language of the OUIL causing death statute contains no reference to the <em>manner </em>in which the defendant operated the vehicle. The Legislature has enacted the following statutes that, unlike OUIL causing death, do manifest an intent, through express language, that causation be strictly tied to the specific <em>manner </em>in which the defendant operated a motor vehicle. For instance, negligent homicide requires the people to prove that the driver operated the motor vehicle \u201cat an immoderate rate of speed or in a careless, reckless or negligent <em>manner </em>. . . .\u201d MCL 750.324; MSA 28.556 (emphasis added). Michigan\u2019s felonious driving statute, MCL 752.191; MSA 28.661, also specifically requires proof that the manner of operation caused the harm. That statute targets</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">[e]very person who drives any vehicle upon a highway <em>carelessly and heedlessly </em>in wilful and wanton disregard of the rights or safety of others, or without due caution and circumspection and <em>at a speed or in a manner </em>so as to endanger or be likely to endanger any person or property and thereby injuring .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Similarly, involuntary manslaughter requires proof that the defendant operated the motor vehicle \u201cin a grossly negligent <em>manner.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5B\">However, the OUIL causing death statute does not contain similar language that manifests a legislative intent to tie causation to the specific <em>manner </em>of oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ation. Instead, the language in this statute indicates that the people need only prove that the defendant\u2019s <em>operation </em>of the vehicle while intoxicated, not the defendant\u2019s <em>uncharacteristic and intoxicated </em>operation,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> was a cause of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In enacting this statute, the Legislature sought to prohibit and punish <em>all </em>intoxicated driving that results in a fatality, not just intoxicated driving that is performed in a manner that the people can prove is different from that particular defendant\u2019s typical and sober operation of a vehicle in the same situation. The statute is aimed at prevention and deterrence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the legislative analysis reveals, this statute was enacted because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201ctoo many drinkers axe irresponsible drivers who are <em>willing </em>to risk current penalties to get behind the wheel. The <em>proposed legislation will deter those drivers </em>by closing technical loopholes in the law, promising swift and sure punishment for drinking drivers . . .<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The majority\u2019s definition of causation creates an unintended loophole and diminishes the chances of swift and sure punishment by requiring the people to prove that, in a similar situation, that particular defendant, if sober, would not have caused the death.</p>\n<p id=\"A3W\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">there is no reason to penalize an intoxicated driver with a fifteen-year felony when there is an accident resulting in a fatality if that driver, even if not intoxicated, would still have been the cause in fact of the victim\u2019s death. There would be no reason because it would not prevent that fatality from occurring again.1<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The Legislature enacted the statute so that the burden of prevention rests clearly and heavily with the party most capable of avoiding fatalities, the intoxicated person who decides whether or not to drive. The Legislature drafted the statute so that the intoxicated driver would be responsible for <em>all </em>consequences that flow from his decision to drive while intoxicated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The majority\u2019s determination that the defendant\u2019s <em>\u201cdrunken </em>driving\u201d must be a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death significantly frustrates the Legislature\u2019s intent to prevent intoxicated driving, which always has the potential to result in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">In essence, Michigan law imposes two distinct duties on drivers \u2014 to drive reasonably<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and not to drive while intoxicated.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If, as the majority acknowledges, there is an \u201cirrebuttable presumption of gross negligence\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in driving while intoxicated, then intoxicated driving is <em>never </em>safe or reasonable conduct. Therefore, there is no such thing as safe or nonculpable driving while intoxicated. <em>Any </em>intoxicated driving is a violation of the duty all motorists owe to those with whom they share the road \u2014 to drive only when not intoxicated, or to suffer the consequences.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\"> <em>Ante at </em>259 and ns 49-50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b358-7\"> The majority opinion defines the third element as requiring the people to prove that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s intoxicated driving was a substantial cause of the victim\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 259-260.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> The terms \u201cunder the influence\u201d and \u201cintoxicated,\u201d as used in this opinion, refer to the condition, prescribed by the statute at the time of these incidents, of being: \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance, or a combination of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or with a blood alcohol content of 0.10% or more by weight of alcohol . . . .\u201d MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> It is unnecessary to impose the common-law interpretation of the causation element in criminal negligence offenses, as further defined in <em>People v Kneip, </em>449 Mich 83; 534 NW2d 675 (1995), because the plain language of this OUIL causing death statute clearly defines the causation element, including the \u201cscope and necessary connection between the act and the injury . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> 1991 PA 98, MCL 257.625(4); MSA 9.2325(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\"> 1991 PA 98, MCL 257.625(1&gt;(3), (5); MSA 9.2325(1)-(3), (5) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b361-10\"> The offense of OUIL, contained in MCL 257.625(1) and (3); MSA 9.2325(1) and (3) is a \u201cstatus crime\u201d that focuses on the fact that the defendant operated a vehicle while intoxicated and does not require that the people prove the defendant was observed driving in an abnormal fashion. <em>People v Crawford, </em>187 Mich App 344; 467 NW2d 818 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b361-11\"> <em>People v Lardie, </em>207 Mich App 615, 618; 525 NW2d 504 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b361-12\"> Michigan courts have recognized that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>defendant may be convicted of OUIL even if he is observed driving in a normal fashion. <em>People v Walters, </em>160 Mich App 396, 402-403; 407 NW2d 662 (1987).
