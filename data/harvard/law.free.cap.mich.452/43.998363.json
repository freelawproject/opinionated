In his first trial, defendant was convicted of simple possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine and acquitted of the charge of possession with intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine. The trial court vacated his conviction on the simple possession charge and granted defendant a new trial finding, sua sponte, that it had committed a prejudicial error while instructing the jury. Defendant was retried on the simple possession charge, but this trial ended in a hung jury. Before the third trial began, the trial court dismissed the simple possession charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>on double jeopardy grounds. On the people\u2019s appeal of the dismissal, the Court of Appeals refused to review the trial court\u2019s interlocutory decision to grant a new trial, but reversed the dismissal, remanding for a new (third) trial on the simple possession charge. Plaintiff appeals the Court of Appeals refusal to review the grant of a new trial, and defendant cross appeals the Court of Appeals decision to reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We hold that the people may properly raise the issue of a trial court\u2019s interlocutory decision, i.e., to grant defendant a new trial, in an appeal of right from the trial court\u2019s final order of dismissal. The Court of Appeals erred in deciding that it did not have jurisdiction to review this decision. Such an appeal does not violate defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy. We reverse and remand this issue to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On defendant\u2019s cross appeal, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court erred in concluding that defendant would suffer double jeopardy if he were retried on the charge of simple possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine. He was convicted of this very crime in his first trial. His retrial for that same crime does not violate his right against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Hence, we affirm in part and reverse in part the Court of Appeals decision and remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">On January 9, 1989, defendant Gavino Torres was involved in a drug transaction. According to the testimony produced at his first trial, defendant partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>pated in a conversation with Rodney Edwards, Antonio Olmeda, and Anthony Valentin about purchasing two kilograms of cocaine. Valentin and David Crowl had arranged to sell two kilograms of cocaine to Roberto Anaya, an undercover police officer, in the parking lot of a Burger King restaurant. Defendant accompanied Edwards, Olmeda, and Valentin when they went to obtain the cocaine for this sale from Edwards\u2019 supplier. Defendant was given the cocaine from Edwards\u2019 source and then traveled with the others to a supermarket parking lot near the Burger King. Valentin testified that defendant\u2019s role in controlling the cocaine in the car en route to the parking lot was to escape with the cocaine if they were stopped by the police.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Valentin also testified that he, Edwards, Olmeda, and Torres planned to split the profits of the cocaine sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">After arriving at the supermarket\u2019s parking lot, defendant, Edwards, Olmeda, and Valentin met another participant in the sale, Freddie Marshall. Defendant gave the cocaine to Edwards who, in turn, gave it to Valentin. After receiving the cocaine, Valentin left with Marshall to make the sale to Anaya, who was waiting with Crowl in the Burger King parking lot. Defendant was arrested after the sale, as were Crowl, Marshall, and Valentin.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine. MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i). At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>close of proofs in the first trial, the prosecutor asked the trial court to give the jury an instruction on the crime of simple possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine, a violation of MCL 333.7403(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7403)(2)(a)(i), as a lesser included offense. The trial court agreed to do so and defendant did not object.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court also instructed the jury that the simple possession charge was a \u201cless serious crime\u201d than the charge of possession with intent to deliver. Defendant was convicted of simple possession, but was not convicted, and was thereby acquitted, of possession with intent to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">On the day of sentencing, October 16, 1990, the trial court, sua sponte, decided to grant defendant a new trial because the court concluded that it erred in giving the simple possession charge as a lesser included offense where it carries the same penalty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as the possession with intent to deliver charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">My point is that when you ask for an instruction and the penalty is the same, at the very least the instruction should be [\u201c]you may consider a separate offense of so and so,[\u201d] possession of over 650 -grams in this case, rather than the language I gave them, [\u201c]you may also consider <em>the less serious crime </em>of 650 \u2014 possession of over 650 grams of cocaine. [\u201d] That is my point. . . . They had an alternative without a true alternative. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">On this basis, the trial court entered an order dated October 22, 1990, setting aside defendant\u2019s conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of simple possession of 650 grams of cocaine and ordering a new trial. The people moved for reconsideration, asking the trial court to reinstate the verdict. The trial court denied this motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAfx\">On November 30, 1990, the prosecutor filed a delayed application for leave to appeal this decision to the Court of Appeals, which denied the application on February 26, 1991 (Docket No. 135400). On May 3, 1991, this Court also denied the application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In May 1991, defendant was retried on the simple possession charge. The trial ended in a hung jury, and the trial court declared a mistrial. Thereafter, a third trial was scheduled. Before this trial began, defendant moved to dismiss the simple possession charge on the basis that another trial would violate his right protecting him from double jeopardy. At the hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>this motion, on February 7, 1992, the trial court concluded that the crime of possession with intent to deliver more than 650 grams of cocaine, .of which defendant was acquitted in his first trial, was the same charge as simple possession for double jeopardy purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">In . . . the case before the Court, there are no different transactions, no different facts, the retrial would be dealing with the same issues, the same circumstances, the same facts as the original trial on the original charge of possession with intent to deliver over 650 grams of cocaine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">On February 21, 1992, the trial court entered an order dismissing the simple possession charge against defendant because a retrial was barred by double jeopardy because of his prior acquittal on the possession with intent to deliver charge from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The prosecutor brought an appeal of right in the Court of Appeals from the February 21, 1992, order, challenging the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the simple possession charge. In that appeal, the prosecutor also asked the Court to reverse the trial court\u2019s October 22, 1990, decision granting a new trial. In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals decided that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the prosecutor\u2019s appeal of the interlocutory decision. Rather, it held that \u201ca prosecutor\u2019s appeal as of right from a final order in a criminal case does not allow appellate review of all previous orders issued in the case.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, the Court of Appeals did not address the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>However, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss the simple possession charge against defendant. The Court reasoned that the jury, by its verdict in the first trial, did not acquit defendant of the simple possession charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">A jury in the present case rationally could find that defendant possessed the cocaine, but that he did not have the intent to deliver it. Thus, the fact that defendant was acquitted of the charge of possession with intent to deliver cocaine does not bar retrial on the offense of simple possession of cocaine, pi</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal and remanded the case for a new trial of the simple possession charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Subsequently, we granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal whether the prosecutor may appeal the trial court\u2019s October 22, 1990, decision granting defendant a new trial. This Court also granted defendant\u2019s cross appeal in which he challenges the Court of Appeals ruling to remand for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">I. PEOPLE\u2019S RIGHT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF THE INTERLOCUTORY DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">The Michigan Constitution does not provide the people the right of appeal in criminal cases. <em>People v Cooke, </em>419 Mich 420, 424-425; 355 NW2d 88 (1984). Rather, the people may only file an appeal as provided by statute. MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109. MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109 provides that the people may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>take an appeal of right from a lower court\u2019s final order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), the people of this state may take an appeal of right in a criminal case, if the protection against double jeopardy under section 15 of article I of the state constitution of 1963 and amendment V of the constitution of the United States would not bar further proceedings against the defendant, from either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">(a) A final judgment or final order of the circuit court or recorder\u2019s court, except a judgment or order of the circuit court or recorder\u2019s court on appeal from any other court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">(b) A final judgment or order of a court or tribunal from which appeal of right has been established by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The statute also provides that the people may apply for leave to appeal an interlocutory order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">(2) The people of this state may take an appeal by leave in a criminal case, if the protection against double jeopardy under section 15 of article I of the state constitution of 1963 and amendment V of the constitution of the United States would not bar further proceedings against the defendant, from any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">(a) A judgment or order of the circuit court or recorder\u2019s court that is not a final judgment appealable of right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">(b) A final judgment entered by the circuit court or the recorder\u2019s court on appeal from any other court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">(c) Any other judgment or order appealable by law or rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">(d) A judgment or order when an appeal of right could have been taken but was not timely filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-14\">(e) A final order or judgment based upon a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or nolo contendere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-15\">An order granting a new trial is a nonfinal, interlocutory order. <em>People v Pummer, </em>399 Mich 326, 332; 249 NW2d 78 (1976), overruled on other grounds in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Cooke, supra </em>at 433. Thus, the trial court\u2019s October 22, 1990, decision to grant defendant a new trial was not a final order but was an interlocutory order. The prosecutor sought leave to appeal this decision, but it was denied by the Court of Appeals and by this Court. The trial court entered a final order on February 21, 1992, when it dismissed the simple possession charge against defendant on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In appealing the February 21, 1992, final order, the prosecutor asked the Court of Appeals to review the trial court\u2019s October 22, 1990, interlocutory decision granting a new trial even though this Court and the Court of Appeals earlier refused to grant leave. Thus, this Court must determine whether MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109 authorizes the people to raise the issue of an earlier interlocutory order when bringing an appeal of right from a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">On its face, the statute provides that the people may appeal of right a final order, but it does not state whether the people may also appeal a trial court\u2019s earlier decisions entered as nonfinal orders in appealing the final order. The statute, under subsection 2(a), does provide that the people may appeal by leave a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial for a defendant. However, this provision does not indicate that the people are forbidden from raising an interlocutory decision granting a new trial when they appeal a final order of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">In order to determine whether the Legislature intended to make an interlocutory order reviewable in an appeal of right, we may examine the statute\u2019s legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>lative history to understand its purpose. Before MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109 was revised in 1988, the statute only provided the people an appeal when a trial court construed the validity of a criminal statute or when a trial court decision was issued before jeopardy attached. <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>Cooke, </em>this Court held that the people could appeal a decision only in the limited circumstances provided by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 433. The decision in <em>Cooke </em>eliminated the possibility that the people could appeal by leave the decision of a trial court to grant a defendant a new trial. <em>In re People v Burton, </em>429 Mich 133, 141; 413 NW2d 413 (1987).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">As the Court of Appeals noted, prosecutors attempted to circumvent this limitation by filing a complaint for superintending control in order to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>test orders granting a new trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, in <em>Burton, supra </em>at 142-144, this Court concluded that an order of superintending control should not be used to circumvent the will of the Legislature. We held that this extraordinary remedy was not warranted where the people wished to appeal a trial court\u2019s order granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In response to this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Cooke, </em>the Legislature enacted 1988 PA 66, revising MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109, to give the people the same essential right to appeal and seek leave as a defendant enjoys, within the limits of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Since the Legislature intended to provide the people with the same right as a criminal defendant on appeal, we must examine the provisions that authorize a defendant to appeal a final decision in order to determine whether a defendant may appeal interlocutory decisions when he appeals a final order of light.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The Michigan Constitution provides in art 1, \u00a7 20 that \u201cthe accused shall have the right to . . . have an appeal as a matter of right . . . .\u201d In MCL 600.308; MSA 27A.308, the Legislature has provided for the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to hear appeals by a criminal defendant, as well as for parties in civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>cases generally. MCL 600.308; MSA 27A.308 enables a party to appeal of right a final order and apply for leave from an interlocutory order.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The bill essentially would ensure that the people of the State had the same right to appeal that a defendant has, within the limits of constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>In appealing a final order entering a conviction, a criminal defendant may raise certain trial court interlocutory decisions, e.g., admission of evidence during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>trial, that might have affected the outcome of the case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court of Appeals has also recently held that a party on appeal from a final order in a civil case is \u201cfree to raise on appeal issues related to other orders in the case.\u201d <em>Bonner v Chicago Title Ins Co, </em>194 Mich App 462, 472; 487 NW2d 807 (1992), citing <em>Dean v Tucker, </em>182 Mich App 27, 31; 451 NW2d 571 (1990).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The' Court in <em>Dean </em>had relied on <em>Comm\u2019r of Ins v Advisory Bd of the Michigan State Accident Fund, </em>173 Mich App 566, 589; 434 NW2d 433 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">However, the Court of Appeals in the present case refused to follow <em>Dean </em>in the criminal context, relying instead on <em>Adams v Perry Furniture Co (On </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Remand), </em>198 Mich App 1; 497 NW2d 514 (1993), and <em>Klco v Dynamic Training Corp, </em>192 Mich App 39; 480 NW2d 596 (1991), in which the Court declined to examine an earlier order.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals here apparently reasoned that <em>Dean </em>was no longer good law because the case on which it relied, <em>Comm\u2019r of Ins, supra, </em>was rejected by <em>Adams </em>and <em>Klco, supra</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Importantly, in <em>Comm\u2019r of Ins, supra </em>at 589, the plaintiff was appealing the final order and wished to raise an issue from a previous \u201cfinal order,\u201d i.e., an \u201cotherwise nonfinal order certified as a final order under MCR 2.604(A) . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This was the same situation in <em>Adams, supra </em>at 3-4, 8, and <em>Klco, supra </em>at 40-41. Thus, by statute, MCL 600.308; MSA 27A.308, and by court rule, MCR 7.203, the parties in <em>Comm\u2019r of Ins, Adams, </em>and <em>Klco, supra, </em>had a right to appeal the earlier decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In contrast, the plaintiff in <em>Dean </em>was appealing by right the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary disposition and, in doing so, also asked the Court to review the trial court\u2019s earlier decision refusing to extend the deadline for filing the witness list. There was no indication that this earlier decision was certified as a final order under MCR 2.604. Consequently, unlike <em>Adams, Klco, </em>and <em>Comm\u2019r of Ins, </em>there was no other opportunity of right for the party in <em>Dean </em>to appeal the trial court\u2019s decision because it did not dispose of any claims. See <em>Dean, supra </em>at 29-31.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Similarly, in this case, the people have not been accorded appellate review of the merits of this decision. The people attempted to do so by applications for leave, but each was denied.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, if this Court concludes that this issue is not reviewable, then the people will not have had an opportunity for appellate review of the trial court\u2019s October 22, 1990, decision granting defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In summary, a party in a civil action may raise previous interlocutory decisions when it brings an appeal of right from a final order. Likewise, a criminal defendant may raise an issue related to an interlocutory decision in its appeal of right from a final decision.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We conclude that the Legislature intended to provide this same right to the people in an appeal from a final order in MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109. Thus, the people have a right to raise issues related to earlier interlocutory orders in an appeal of right from the final order.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ab\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Defendant argues that this conclusion provides the people with a more generous opportunity to appeal than provided a defendant. On the basis of this Court\u2019s treatment of interlocutory decisions from a criminal defendant\u2019s appeal, defendant argues that the people\u2019s interests were adequately protected by the opportunity to seek interlocutory appeal, <em>People v Hall, </em>435 Mich 599; 460 NW2d 520 (1990), and by the opportunity to seek conviction by a retrial, <em>People v Thompson, </em>424 Mich 118; 379 NW2d 49 (1985). The general rule that we discern from these seminal cases is that this Court will only review an earlier interlocutory decision in an appeal from a final order where (1) an appellate court may fashion an appropriate remedy<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and (2) the error has not been cured, or rendered moot, by a later proceeding. On the basis of this rule, we conclude the people may properly ask this Court to review the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In <em>Hall, supra </em>at 602, this Court addressed a question where, in an appeal from his conviction, a defendant claimed that there was inadequate admissible evidence presented at his preliminary examination to bind him over for trial. We concluded that an error at the preliminary examination stage should be examined for harmless error. <em>Id. </em>We explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>\u201cthe availability of an interlocutory appeal affords protection in those cases where an innocent accused should have been screened out by the preliminary examination process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615. The preliminary examination process \u25a0 established by statute in Michigan under MCL' 766..1 <em>et seq:, </em>MSA 28.919 <em>et seq. </em>ensures that a defendant shall not suffer extended restraint of liberty following an arrest unless there has been a judicial determination of probable cause that he committed the crime for which he is held. <em>Id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">However, once the matter proceeded to trial in <em>Hall, </em>there was no way that this Court could provide a remedy specific to the harm the rule sought to avoid. In the present case, this Court could fashion an appropriate appellate remedy for the alleged trial court error by reinstating the conviction. Moreover, this Court did not state that such an error was not reviewable in <em>Hall, </em>but rather that this Court would only reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction if the error prejudiced the outcome of his trial. In the present case, if the trial court did abuse its discretion in granting a new trial, the people\u2019s interests were surely prejudiced because defendant\u2019s conviction on simple possession was vacated and this charge was ultimately dismissed without a jury reaching a verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">In <em>Thompson, supra, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony murder, but this conviction was reversed because of improper jury instructions. The defendant\u2019s second trial ended in a hung jury and a mistrial was declared. In his third trial, the defendant was again convicted of felony murder. This Court held that the retrial of defendant on the same charge after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>a mistrial because of a hung jury did not violate his double jeopardy or his due process protections under the Michigan Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 135-136. Also, in the second trial, the defendant moved for a directed verdict, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to convict him presented at that trial. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. This Court held that there is no requirement under art 1, \u00a7 15 (double jeopardy provision) or art 1, \u00a7 17 (due process) of the Michigan Constitution that this Court review the trial court\u2019s decision refusing to grant a directed verdict. <em>Id. </em>Defendant in the present case argues that this rule should be equally applicable to the people here, arguing that the people should not be able to appeal the trial court\u2019s nonfinal order from an earlier trial even though that decision could have prevented the retrial from occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">However, the trial at which the defendant moved for a directed verdict in <em>Thompson </em>ended in a mistrial. We stated in <em>Thompson </em>that \u201c[t]he general view of a hung jury mistrial has been that it is essentially a nullity and that the subsequent retrial determines a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135. This Court explained that a retrial following a mistrial is treated as \u201ca continuation of the same case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the error alleged from the second trial in <em>Thompson </em>was able to be rectified in the third trial, where the prosecution did produce sufficient evidence, because the third trial was considered a continuation of the second one.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>In contrast, a third trial here, as a constructive continuation of the second, would not rectify the trial court\u2019s possible abuse of discretion in reversing defendant\u2019s conviction from his first trial. The alleged error did not occur in a \u201cnullity,\u201d i.e., a trial that ended in a mistrial. Rather, the first trial was complete, and stands by itself. The error could not be corrected by the next trial. Hence, in this case, unlike <em>Thompson, </em>the error was not cured by later proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">n. REVIEW OF THE INTERLOCUTORY DECISION AND DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">Defendant argues that the decision to review an order after retrial violates his right to be free from double jeopardy because a successful appeal would mean reinstatement of his conviction from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">The United States and the Michigan Constitutions protect a person from being twice placed in jeopardy for the \u201csame offense.\u201d US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. The purpose of the double jeopardy provision is to prevent the state from making repeated attempts at convicting an individual for an alleged crime. <em>People v Dawson, </em>431 Mich 234, 250; 427 NW2d 886 (1988). The United States Supreme Court examined the origin and history of the rule in <em>United States v Green, </em>355 US 184; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>(1957). As this Court quoted in <em>Dawson, supra </em>at 251, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Green </em>concluded that \u201cthe State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d <em>Green </em>at 187-188. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause provides three related protections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cIt protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>[United States v Wilson, </em>420 US 332, 343; 95 S Ct 1013; 43 L Ed 2d 232 (1975), quoting from <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711, 717; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969), which was overruled in part on other grounds in <em>Alabama v Smith, </em>490 US 794, 802; 109 S Ct 2201; 104 L Ed 2d 865 (1989).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Defendant argues, as do the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan in their amicus curiae brief, that a defendant may not be subjected to a second trial after being validly convicted in the first one. They claim that the reinstatement of defendant\u2019s first conviction would render the second trial unnecessary and would violate defendant\u2019s right to be free from retrial after conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit rejected a similar argument in <em>United States v Martinez, </em>763 F2d 1297 (CA 11, 1985). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Martinez, </em>the defendant was convicted of cocaine distribution in his first trial, but the trial court granted his motion for a new trial. On retrial, in a bench trial, the defendant was acquitted. On appeal from the judgment of acquittal, the prosecution claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial. In determining whether its review of this claim would violate the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy protection, the Eleventh Circuit examined the United States Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the constitutional right and distilled this test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">[T]he test for whether a government appeal of a judgment of acquittal is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause is whether there will be any proceeding after a successful appeal that would require the resolution of further factual issues by the trier of fact. <em>[Id. </em>at 1309.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">On the basis of this test, the court held that the prosecution could appeal the defendant\u2019s conviction and seek reinstatement of his conviction without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause because \u201creversal on appeal will simply reinstate the prior judgment of conviction and not subject defendant to another prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1310. In fact, the court then determined that the trial court abused its discretion, reversed the judgment acquitting him, and reinstated the jury verdict finding him guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 1313, 1315-1316.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit adopted the <em>Martinez </em>rule in a factually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>similar case and also reinstated the jury verdict despite the subsequent acquittal in a bench trial. <em>United States v Leal, </em>781 F2d 1108, 1110 (CA 5, 1986) (\u201cThis appeal, like that of <em>Martinez, </em>does not effect double jeopardy because reversal would only require reinstating the jury verdict; further prosecution would be avoided\u201d), cert den 479 US 831 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><em>Martinez </em>is well grounded in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s examination of the Double Jeopardy Clause. In <em>Wilson, supra, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution could appeal a trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss an indictment against a defendant because of a preindictment delay even though the jury had already found the defendant guilty of that crime. The Supreme Court reasoned that review of the trial court\u2019s order would not offend the policy against multiple prosecutions \u201c[s]ince reversal on appeal would merely reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict . ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344-345. Relying on <em>Wilson, </em>the Supreme Court later stated that \u201cwhere a Government appeal presents no threat of successive prosecutions, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended.\u201d <em>United States v Martin Linen Supply Co, </em>430 US 564, 569-570; 97 S Ct 1349; 51 L Ed 2d 642 (1977). The Court in <em>Martin Linen </em>noted that the double jeopardy bar was not \u201cautomatically averted\u201d in its case because, unlike the present case, a successful appeal reversing the judgment of acquittal would necessitate another trial. <em>Id. </em>at 571. Also, in examining whether the prosecutor could appeal a trial court\u2019s decision (at the close of proofs but before a verdict) to dismiss because of the prejudice caused by preindictment delay, the Supreme Court explained that one of the principles of double jeopardy jurisprudence is that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u201cjudgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed and terminates the prosecution <em>when a second trial would be necessitated by a </em>reversal.\u201d <em>United States v Scott, </em>437 US 82, 91; 98 S Ct 2187; 57 L Ed 2d 65 (1978) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Defendant and the amicus curiae contend that the Eleventh Circuit in <em>Martinez </em>overlooked the Supreme Court\u2019s double jeopardy analysis in <em>Abney v United States, </em>431 US 651; 97 S Ct 2034; 52 L Ed 2d 651 (1977). In <em>Abney, supra </em>at 653, the Supreme Court examined the question whether a trial court\u2019s pretrial order refusing to dismiss an indictment on double jeopardy grounds was a final order from which a party in federal court had a right to appeal. The defendants were convicted in the first trial, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit had reversed the conviction because of an evidentiary error. Before retrial, the defendants moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that double jeopardy prevented their retrial. The Supreme Court noted that the double jeopardy protection is not just a prohibition of being twice punished, but also against being twice put in jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 661, citing <em>Price v Georgia, </em>398 US 323, 326; 90 S Ct 1757; 26 L Ed 2d 300 (1970). It explained that \u201cthe guarantee against double jeopardy assures an individual that, among other things, he will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>not be forced, with certain exceptions, to endure the personal strain, public embarrassment, and expense of a criminal trial more than once for the same offense.\u201d <em>Abney, supra </em>at 661. For this reason, the Court concluded that the pretrial order must be immediately appealable as a \u201cfinal decision\u201d under federal statutory law, otherwise the defendant\u2019s protection against double jeopardy would be lost:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">[T]he [double jeopardy] protections would be lost if the accused were forced to \u201crun the gauntlet\u201d a second time before an appeal could be taken; even if the accused is acquitted, or, if convicted, has his conviction ultimately reversed on double jeopardy grounds, he has still been forced to endure a trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prohibit. Consequently, if a criminal defendant is to avoid <em>exposure </em>to double jeopardy and thereby enjoy the full protection of the Clause, his double jeopardy challenge to the indictment must be reviewable before that subsequent exposure occurs. <em>[Id. </em>at 662 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).]1<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Martinez </em>is consistent with the reasoning of <em>Abney. </em>In <em>Abney, </em>the defendants did not have to endure a second trial before they brought their appeal. In <em>Martinez, </em>the prosecution brought the appeal. Because the prosecution succeeded in its claim that the trial court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial was an abuse of discretion, the remedy was to reinstate the verdict of the first trial. The appeal did not require a retrial. Like <em>Abney, </em>the defendant in <em>Martinez </em>did not have to endure personal strain, public embarrassment, and the expense of another criminal trial because he did not suffer another prosecution. The same would be true if the people prevailed on appeal in this case. Defendant, like the defendant in <em>Martinez, </em>would have already suffered the ordeal of a second trial.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">However, if defendant\u2019s conviction is reinstated, the analysis from <em>Abney, supra </em>at 662, suggests that defendant, like the defendant in <em>Martinez, </em>should not have had to endure a second trial. Yet, defendant did not ask the Court of Appeals or this Court to grant leave before the second trial. Defendant would have presented the situation from <em>Abney </em>if he had asked the Court of Appeals or this Court to grant leave on the people\u2019s appeal before retrial. He would not have had to ask an appellate court to reverse the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>court\u2019s decision, but could have asked that leave be granted to ensure that the issue was resolved before he was required to endure another trial that might otherwise be needless. However, defendant did not file a brief in response to the people\u2019s application for leave to the Court of Appeals (Docket No. 135400), and did not file a response to the people\u2019s application to this Court (Docket No. 91140). A defendant is responsible for the \u201cconsequences of his voluntary choice.\u201d See <em>Scott, supra </em>at 99. Defendant did not ask appellate courts to grant leave, even though under <em>Abney, </em>his right could only be vindicated by an immediate appeal.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Consequently, by failing to ask the appellate courts to review this decision interloc-utorily, defendant accepted the possibility that he would have his first verdict reinstated on a later appeal by the people by right. Therefore, he voluntarily endured the ordeal of a second trial, knowing that it might be needless if the first trial was determined to be fair.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Moreover, even if we concluded that defendant suffered a constitutional injury by enduring an \u201cunnecessary\u201d second trial (if the first trial was valid and fair), the injury itself would have already been sustained. This Court cannot change the reality that defendant was tried a second time. This Court cannot erase the embarrassment, expense, and ordeal of living in a continued state of anxiety created by the second trial. Our refusal to review the interlocutory decision, leaving unreviewed the trial court\u2019s determination that the first trial was unfair, would not undo the ordeal of the second trial, but would only prevent it from being (in retrospect) unnecessary. The Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to prevent the ordeal of a second trial; it is not designed to prevent such a trial from being rendered needless on appellate review. See <em>Abney, supra </em>at 661-662.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Defendant could only have avoided the second trial by seeking an immediate appeal. There is now no possible remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Defendant and the amicus curiae complain that the result from <em>Martinez </em>would mean that defendant suffered a retrial after he was convicted in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. However, he was only retried after the first conviction was vacated. There is no dispute that the retrial itself would not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>defendant\u2019s constitutional rights where the trial court concluded that defendant was prejudiced by erroneous jury instructions. See <em>People v Langley, </em>187 Mich App 147, 150; 466 NW2d 724 (1991), citing <em>Burks v United States, </em>437 US 1, 14-16; 98 S Ct 2141; 57 L Ed 2d 1 (1978). In fact, the United States Supreme Court explained that where the judicial process is defective in a fundamental respect, the accused has a \u201cstrong interest in obtaining a fair readjudication of his guilt free from error . . . .\u201d <em>Burks, supra </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On appeal, the people ask us to reinstate defendant\u2019s first conviction. As the Eleventh Circuit explained in <em>Martinez, </em>the reinstatement of his conviction would not offend defendant\u2019s constitutional rights because the <em>\u201c[g]ovemment appeal </em>presents no threat of successive prosecutions,\u201d <em>Martin Linen, supra </em>at 570 (emphasis added), and would not result in another prosecution, because \u201creversal on appeal would merely reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict . . . .\u201d <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 344-345. Moreover, the second trial, now examined in retrospect, does not represent a second opportunity for the people to convict defendant if the first conviction was reinstated because the people did not need, or seek, a new trial. There would be no multiple punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">We adopt the persuasive reasoning of <em>Martinez </em>as our understanding of the protections provided by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States and the Michigan Constitutions, at least in this circumstance where the second trial ended in a hung jury. However, we reserve for another day the question whether this holding would govern where the people seek to reinstate a conviction from the first trial after a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>was retried and <em>acquitted </em>by the bench, or by a jury,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> of the same crime in a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We conclude that the people may raise the issue of the trial court\u2019s October 22, 1990, decision to grant a new trial under MCL 770.12(1); MSA 28.1109(1) in its appeal of right of the February 21, 1992, final order. We reverse the Court of Appeals refusal to review the issue and remand the substance of the issue to give the Court of Appeals an opportunity to address it.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">m. DOUBLE JEOPARDY AND DEFENDANT\u2019S third trial</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">On cross appeal, defendant claims that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss before the third trial on double jeopardy grounds. The trial court relied primarily on <em>Brown v Ohio, </em>432 US 161; 97 S Ct 2221; 53 L Ed 2d 187 (1977), in which the Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for a crime where the defendant had already been convicted of a lesser included offense of that crime. The trial court also cited <em>Ashe v Swenson, </em>397 US 436; 90 S Ct 1189; 25 L Ed 2d 469 (1970), in which the Supreme Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause prevents a state from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution where an acquittal in the first trial resolved the factual question whether the defendant committed the crime charged in the second trial. Relying on these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cases, the trial court concluded that the crime of possession with intent to deliver was the same as simple possession for double jeopardy purposes and that defendant\u2019s acquittal of possession with intent to deliver barred a reprosecution for the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">As noted earlier, the United States and the Michigan Constitutions protect a person from suffering double jeopardy for the \u201csame offense.\u201d US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. The Court of Appeals has explained, however, that this rule is not violated where a defendant is retried after his conviction is set aside because of an error in the first trial, unless the error was that there was insufficient evidence of guilt to convict the defendant. See <em>Langley, supra </em>at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Defendant argues that he cannot be retried because the jury\u2019s acquittal of him on the possession with intent to deliver charge also logically required the finding that he did not possess the cocaine. Defendant explains that the jury could not rationally acquit him of possession with intent to deliver without also finding that he was not guilty of possession because the prosecution\u2019s sole factual theory alleged that defendant carried the cocaine with the intent of delivering it for the sale to Anaya. The Court of Appeals in the present case rejected this claim and distinguished <em>Ashe, supra, </em>as well as the subsequent Supreme Court case following it, <em>Turner v Arkansas, </em>407 US 366; 92 S Ct 2096; 32 L Ed 2d 798 (1972), by concluding that a rational jury could find that defendant possessed, but did not intend to deliver, the cocaine.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>However, this Court need not review this conclusion because there is a more basic reason to distinguish this case from the federal ones. In <em>Ashe </em>and <em>Turner, </em>the defendant was acquitted on the same factual theory that would logically require the jury to find that he had not committed the <em>uncharged </em>crime. However, in this case, the jury explicitly rejected this possibility by convicting defendant on the very charge that defendant now claims that the jury, by its verdict, must have acquitted him. A jury\u2019s verdict need not be rationally consistent in the light of its power of leniency. <em>People v Lewis, </em>415 Mich 443, 450-453; 330 NW2d 16 (1982); <em>People v Vaughn, </em>409 Mich 463, 466; 295 NW2d 354 (1980).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus, unlike <em>Ashe </em>and <em>Turner, </em>this Court cannot logically deduce from the first verdict that the jury acquitted defendant on this charge because it convicted him of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Moreover, in <em>Brown, </em>the defendant was convicted of the lesser included crime of joyriding and subsequently tried and convicted of auto theft. The Supreme Court concluded that the two crimes of which the defendant was convicted were the \u201csame offense\u201d for double jeopardy pmposes under the test of <em>Blockburger v United States, </em>284 US 299; 52 S Ct 180; 76 L Ed 306 (1932) (different offense where each crime requires proof of an element the other does not require). However, the crimes of possession with intent to deliver and simple possession cannot be the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy where the jury in the first trial acquitted defendant of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>charge and then convicted him on the lesser included offense.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The trial court erred in dismissing the simple possession charge on double jeopardy grounds. This Court affirms the Court of Appeals decision to reverse.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We conclude that, in an appeal of right from a final order, the people have the right to raise the issue of a trial court\u2019s earlier nonfinal decision to grant a new trial where that new trial ends in a hung jury. We remand the issue whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial to the Court of Appeals. Moreover, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision to reverse the trial court\u2019s decision dismissing defendant\u2019s conviction on double jeopardy grounds. Hence, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-7\">Brickley, C.J., and Boyle, Mallett, and Weaver, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\"> Valentin testified that he rebuked defendant for laying the cocaine on the front seat between defendant and Edwards asking, \u201cif the police pull us over, what are you going to do?\u201d Valentin said that defendant answered \u201cthat\u2019s what I am here for\u201d and explained that he would \u201cjump out and run\u201d if they were stopped by the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\"> In fact, defense counsel said, \u201cI have no problem with that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> At this time, these crimes carried the same penalty of life imprisonment without the opportunity for parole. This Court, in <em>People v Bullock, </em>440 Mich 15, 37; 485 NW2d 866 (1992), concluded that such a penalty for simple possession violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment. Therefore, this crime is now a parolable offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> At the November 9, 1990, hearing on the motion for reconsideration, the trial court stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">Two things then occurred as far as I am concerned. One, [the trial court] misled a jury when [the court] use[d] the term less serious offense and it is not a less serious offense. Had the Court said this is a lesser included offense, then [the prosecutor\u2019s] previous position, [which] I believe, is still his position that a lesser included is simply one that has less elements!,] would fly, would be meritorious. In this instance, the jury was not told that this was a lesser included. The jury was told this was a lesser, a less serious offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">The second problem that I have is that the prosecution had two chances to convict the defendant on the very same facts of an offense carrying . . . the same penalty. They had two cracks at a conviction carrying mandatory life on one set of facts. The jury in this case found the defendant guilty of possession of over 650 grams of cocaine, which meant that they did not believe that the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed with intent to deliver cocaine in an amount over 650 grams. In effect if this Court had not instructed on possession of over 650 grams, the jury might well have come back with a verdict of not guilty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\"> 437 Mich 987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b140-8\"> 209 Mich App 651, 658;

Thus, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that, when a retrial ends in a hung jury, a prosecutor has the right to appeal a trial court\u2019s earlier interlocutory order granting a new trial in its later appeal of right of the final order entered in the case. Rather, I would adopt the holding of the Court of Appeals that a prosecutor\u2019s appeal of right from a final order in a criminal case does not allow appellate review of all previous orders issued in the case. 209 Mich App 651, 658; 531 NW2d 822 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">I. legislative intent</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">As noted by the majority, the Michigan Constitution does not provide for appeals by the people. Rather, the people\u2019s right to appeal derives from statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, appeals by the people are strictly limited to appeals that fall within the express legislative grant. <em>People </em>v <em>Cooke, </em>419 Mich 420; 355 NW2d 88 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The statute governing such appeals, MCL 770.12(1); MSA 28.1109(1), provides an appeal of right from a final judgment or final order entered in a criminal case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While \u00a7 12(1) provides for appeals of right, \u00a7 12(2) provides the people with an appeal by leave in various circumstances, including an appeal from an interlocutory order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Moreover, \u00a7 12 clearly prohibits an appeal by the people if it would violate the defendant\u2019s right to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>free from double jeopardy. In this case, the defendant argues that the decision to review an order granting a new trial after retrial would violate his right to be from double jeopardy because a successful appeal would mean reinstatement of his conviction from the first trial. However, I would not decide the constitutional issue whether allowing such an appeal would violate the defendant\u2019s protections to be free from double jeopardy because I believe legislative intent and policy considerations should prevent the people from appealing in this instance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Clearly, \u00a7 12(2) contemplates an appeal by leave in an appeal by the people from an interlocutory order in a criminal case; \u00a7 12(1) does not provide for an appeal of right in this situation. Although the statute does not explicitly preclude the inclusion of this issue in an appeal by the people of right, I do not believe that the Legislature intended that an order granting a new trial could be appealed by the people of right, after retrial had occurred and the case had later reached final judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, I would hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>because the order granting a new trial was not final, the people could seek to appeal only by filing an application for leave with the Court of Appeals. The people should not be allowed to include that appeal in its later appeal of the final decision of right, because allowing such an appeal exceeds the scope of the express legislative grant providing for appeals by the people.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">II. POLICY CONSIDERATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Moreover, policy considerations clearly support this position. The strongest policy consideration supporting prohibition of the instant appeal is that the prosecution\u2019s interests are adequately protected by the ability to file an interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>even if the Court of Appeals and this Court, in the exercise of discretion, decide that the appeal is not worthy of interlocutory review,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the prosecution still has the opportunity to obtain a conviction following the retrial of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Additionally, there are also several other strong policy reasons for requiring a prosecutor to file only an appeal from an interlocutory order granting a new trial. If a prosecutor were allowed to include the new trial issue in a later appeal of right, then the retrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>could be rendered meaningless.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, this would subject the defendant to the personal strain, expense, and embarrassment at an unnecessary retrial. Second, allowing the delay in appeal will result in considerable expense to the state in bringing the defendant to retrial. Third, it will take up scarce judicial resources and time for a needless trial. Fourth, it will force jurors to spend their valuable time and energy in meaningless deliberations. Fifth, it will needlessly put witnesses and victims through the anxiety and trauma of having to testify or suffer through a retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The emotional and financial costs and waste of judicial resources can be prevented if the prosecution is required to appeal from an order granting a new trial immediately, if at all. Witnesses, victims, judges, jurors, attorneys, and defendants should not be forced to endure a retrial if that retrial can subsequently be rendered utterly meaningless. I believe these policy considerations support a rule that would require an appeal of an order granting a new trial before the new trial occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>in. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, which held that, under \u00a7 12, the prosecution may appeal an order granting a new trial only by application for leave to appeal. Legislative intent and policy considerations support this position. Further, I would affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that the trial court erred in dismissing the charge against the defendant on the basis of the double jeopardy provision. I would remand the case to the circuit court for a retrial of the charge of possession of over 650 grams of cocaine.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-6\">Levin, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\"> See part m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> See MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-11\"> See <em>ante, </em>pp 51-52 (providing the express statutory language).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-12\"> See <em>id. </em>Appeals by the people of right and by leave in criminal cases are also limited by defendants\u2019 protections against double jeopardy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> Although I would not decide that constitutional issue in this case, I have reservations about the majority\u2019s analysis and holding on this issue. The majority holds that such an appeal does not violate defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy, because he would not be subjected to a retrial; rather, the conviction at the first trial would be reinstated. The majority opines that at this point, the defendant would have already suffered the ordeal of a second trial. That being the case, there is now no possible remedy, because leaving unreviewed the trial court\u2019s determination that the first trial was unfair, would not undo the embarrassment, expense, and ordeal of the second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">My problem with that analysis is that it focuses on multiple prosecutions. However, in <em>Abney v United States, </em>431 US 651, 661; 97 S Ct 2034; 52 L Ed 2d 651 (1977), the Supreme Court stated, quoting <em>Price v Georgia, </em>398 US 323, 326; 90 S Ct 1757; 26 L Ed 2d 300 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201cThe [double jeopardy] prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice <em>put </em>in jeopardy .... The \u2018twice put in jeopardy\u2019 language of the Constitution thus relates to a potential, i.e., the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the \u2018same offense\u2019 for which he was initially tried.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Thus, the focus is on the <em>exposure </em>to the strain, embarrassment, and expense of a criminal trial more than once for the same offense, regardless of the result of the trial. By reinstating the defendant\u2019s conviction from the first trial, the court would be revalidating a trial that previously had been invalidated when the judge set it aside sua sponte because of erroneous jury instructions. Although the defendant impliedly consented to the setting aside of the conviction from the first trial, he did not do so with the knowledge that the second trial might be needless if the first trial was determined to be fair. The propriety of the inclusion of an appeal of the new trial order in an appeal by right from the final judgment is an issue of first impression in Michigan. Thus, I do not believe there is sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>port for the majority\u2019s position that the defendant \u201cvoluntarily endured the ordeal of a second trial, knowing that it might be needless if the first trial was determined to be fair.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">However, if the prosecution is allowed to appeal the new trial order other than interlocutorily, and if the court later determines that the new trial was erroneously granted, then that decision acts as a validation of the first trial and its resultant conviction. Double jeopardy protections are implicated because the defendant was already subjected to the second trial. In this case, the prosecution would be given two chances to convict the defendant: one, at the retrial, and two, by pursuing an appeal of the new trial order that could result in the reinstatement of the conviction. That is the scenario here. The prosecution failed to convict the defendant at the retrial and is now seeking to reinstate the original conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">What is important to recognize is that the defendant only consented to the retrial on the understanding that the conviction of the first trial was vacated and he would be starting with a clean slate at the retrial. If the prosecution is allowed to appeal the new trial order after the new trial occurs, the defendant\u2019s consent is vitiated. If the prosecution is allowed to take this belated appeal, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy protections are violated because he is forced to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity regarding his future freedom, a state that the clause seeks to prevent from occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The majority posits that because the retrial has occurred \u201c[tjhere is now no possible remedy.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 71. However, the appropriate remedy is to require the prosecution to appeal interlocutorily or not at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"> I note that Judge Bandstra, who was a panel member of the Court of Appeals in this decision, was a cosponsor of 1988 PA 66 (which revised MCL 770.12; MSA 28.1109 to broaden the scope of appeals by the people) when he was a state representative. Thus, I find persuasive his interpretation that the Legislature did not intend the statute to allow the people to include an appeal from the interlocutory order in its appeal of right of the final judgment or final order entered in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> Even where a party has a right to appeal from a final decision, this Court has limited the types of issues that may be raised in an appeal from a final decision in a criminal case. This Court has held that some issues must be raised in an interlocutory appeal, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">For example, in <em>People </em>v <em>Crawford, </em>429 Mich 151, 156-157; 414 NW2d 360 (1987), this Court held that a violation of the twelve-day limit for holding a preliminary examination cannot be raised on an appeal from a final judgment, but must be raised in an interlocutory appeal before the preliminary examination, if at all, by applying for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Similarly, in <em>People </em>v <em>Hall, </em>435 Mich 599; 460 NW2d 520 (1990), the majority (Cavanagh, J., dissenting), held that error in binding the defendant over for trial on the basis of inadmissible hearsay evidence did not require automatic reversal of the subsequent conviction because the defendant received a fair trial and was not otherwise prejudiced by the error. A majority of this Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for an analysis of whether the admission of hearsay evidence at the preliminary examination was harmless error. The majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">[W]e believe the availability of an interlocutory appeal affords protection in those cases where an innocent accused should have been screened out by the preliminary examination process. <em>[Id. </em>at 615.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">Thus, although this Court analyzed the issue, it in effect held that it was too late for the defendant to raise that issue and demand the relief of automatic reversal. Rather than providing the appropriate relief for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>defect in the preliminary examination process, this Court instead decided that a harmless error analysis should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Additionally, in <em>People </em>v <em>Thompson, </em>424 Mich 118; 379 NW2d 49 (1985), the defendant sought review of the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for directed verdict of acquittal in his appeal of right from the final judgment of conviction. Although the defendant had an appeal of right from the final judgment, the majority (Cavanagh, J., joined the opinion of Brickley, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) held that the defendant\u2019s interests were adequately protected by the subsequent retrial of the case, and that the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence in the prior trial that ended in a mistrial did not need to be reviewed. <em>Id. </em>at 134-135.1 note that three justices disagreed with that position and instead would have held that the defendant was entitled to appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence claim <em>before retrial. Id. </em>at 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">If, as the majority holds, an appeal from a final judgment allows the appellant to appeal prior interlocutory orders, these appellants should have been allowed to raise and receive a decision on the merits of those issues in their later appeals of right. The majority\u2019s attempts to distinguish these cases from the instant case are not persuasive. Rather, an appeal by the people from an order granting a new trial is the type that must be raised in an interlocutory appeal, or not at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">As stated in the amicus curiae brief of the Criminal Defense Attorneys of Michigan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">[I]f the retrial in <em>Thompson </em>adequately protected Mr. Thompson\u2019s right to be free of a conviction on inadequate evidence, it is impossible to understand how the retrial here did not protect the prosecution\u2019s right to seek a conviction based on the evidence. <em>[Id. </em>at 6.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b171-11\"> In fact, both the Court of Appeals and this Court denied the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b172-6\"> Contrary to what the majority posits in n 28, I do not ignore the fact that a third trial may not occur. However, a third trial would be required if, on remand, the Court of Appeals determines that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a new trial on the basis of erroneous jury instructions. If the new trial grant was proper, the guilty verdict of the first trial could not be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">However, even if the Court of Appeals determines that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial, the policy reasons still advance the dissenting position. What the majority ignores is that a retrial already has occurred in this case. If the conviction is reinstated, then the retrial is rendered meaningless. The ordeal, cost, and waste refer to that trial as well as to a possible third trial. Our proposed holding would prevent these costs of meaningless retrials from being realized in future cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
