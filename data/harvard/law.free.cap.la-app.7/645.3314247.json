Luella Morris, thus impleaded, excepted also upon the ground that plaintiff\u2019s petition disclosed no cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-18\">After hearing, the court maintained the exception and dismissed the suit and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">Plaintiff is mistaken in his allegation to the effect that no beneficiary is named in the policies. He doubtless means that no individual is named, for the policies plainly provide that the principal is to be paid twenty-five years after the date of the policies, as an endowment to the assured, if living, and \u201cif the insured shall die prior to the date of the maturity of the endowment to pay * * * to- the executor or administrator of the insured, unless payment be made under the next succeeding paragraph,\u201d which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-20\">\u201cThe company may make any payment or grant any non-forfeiture privilege provided herein to the insured, husband or wife, or any relative by blood or connection by marriage of the insured, or to any other person appearing to said company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>to be equitably entitled to the same by reason of having incurred expense on behalf of the insured, or for his or her burial; and the production of a receipt signed by either of said persons, or of other proof of such payment or grant of such privilege to either of them, shall be conclusive evidence that all claims under this policy have been satisfied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">It is not contended that plaintiff is the assignee, nor that he is the beneficiary, named in the policy, but the' paragraph we have quoted is relied on as establishing his right to the proceeds. In our opinion there is absolutely no foundation for this contention. The paragraph referred to confers certain privileges on the insurance company for its protection, or, what is known as the \u201cFacility of Payment Clause\u201d. It in no sense creates any obligation requiring the insurer to pay equitable claims against decedent. The discretion of this company in making such payments is conclusive. See Bass vs. Metropolitan Insurance Company, No. 7780 Orl. App. Opinion Book 56, and authorities there cited. Whatever may have been the indebtedness of George Morris to plaintiff at the time of his death, and no matter how benevolent or philanthropic plaintiff may have been, we cannot approve of the discharge of Morris\u2019 moral and financial obligations out of the avails of these policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We believe the exception of no cause of action was properly maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">As to Luella Morris, she will have to establish her claims, if she can, in other and appropriate proceedings, for whatever may be said of the regularity of the pleading by which she entered these proceedings, it is certain that with the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s suit as disclosing no cause of action, she and her \u201cintervening answer\u201d must also be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
