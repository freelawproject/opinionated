Berlin vs. Cusachs, 114 La. 741, 38 South. 539; Mayville Canal Co. vs. Lake Arthur Rice, Mill, 119 La. 459, 44 South. 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-23\">Plaintiff does not allege nor does he attempt to prove that any fixed remuneration was stipulated between himself and' defendant when he was employed, and therefore the amount of his demand must necessarily be fixed as in the ease of a demand based on a quantum meruit. The amount was fixed by the trial judge in accordance with the fees usually charged for such services as were rendered by plaintiff, as shown by the testimony of local members of the bar, and we believe it is fair to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-24\">It appears from the record that the defendant company had agreed to accept from a Mr. S. R. Morgan of Little Rock, Arkansas, an offer to purchase its ice plant together with all the accessories of the plant. The president of the company, Mr. G. A. Rodemacher, and Morgan, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>prospective purchaser, called on plaintiff for legal advice as to the proper mode to pursue, in order to carry out the offer and complete the sale. In this interview it was agreed that plaintiff would proceed to draw up all the necessary papers and documents, to liquidate the affairs of the corporation with a view of transferring all its assets to Morgan and dissolving its incorporation. In the meanwhile Rodemacher transferred enough of his stock to Morgan, to give the latter a controlling interest in the company. Meetings of the Board of Directors and of the stockholders were held, and at these meetings resolutions drawn up under the guidance and instruction of plaintiff were adopted. It seems that Morgan was buying with a view of reselling the plant to the Louisiana Public Utilities Co., Inc., and the latter company\u2019s attorneys, in order to safeguard their client\u2019s interest, and that they might acquire a valid title, had a good deal of correspondence with plaintiff pending the transfer of the property to Morgan. After Morgan had acquired the property, he refused to carry out the plan of liquidation mapped out by plaintiff and consented to by the Board of Directors and the stockholders. From that time plaintiff\u2019s connection with the transaction was terminated. Such are the facts as we gather them from the evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The trial judge rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff for one thousand and sixty dollars and we see no error in that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">For these reasons the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
