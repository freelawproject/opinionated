He raises two issues on appeal, contending that: (1) the retroactive application of the remedial holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), violates ex post facto and due process principles; and (2) his sentence, imposed by the district court after considering the sentencing guidelines as advisory, is unreasonable. Finding no merit to McClelland\u2019s claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In McClelland\u2019s first claim, he argues that his due process rights, in conjunction with ex post facto principles, are violated by the imposition of a sentence under the Supreme Court\u2019s remedial decision in <em>Booker </em>(referring to the Court\u2019s opinion expressed through Justice Breyer, which makes the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory), rather than under the mandatory guidelines applicable at the time of his offense. We have thoroughly reviewed McClelland\u2019s claim and find it to be without merit based on the reasoning of our sister circuits. <em>See United States v. Dupas, </em>419 F.3d 916, 919-21 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting ex post facto claim); <em>United States v. Jamison, </em>416 F.3d 538, 539-40 (7th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Lata, </em>415 F.3d 107, 110-12 (1st Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>411 F.3d 572, 576 (5th Cir.2005) (same); <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1306-OS (11th Cir.) (same), <em>cert. denied, </em>126 S.Ct. (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Turning to McClelland\u2019s second claim, we note that McClelland\u2019s sentencing occurred on March 16, 2005, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker. </em>The court sentenced McClelland only after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2005), as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>The court sentenced McClelland at the bottom of the applicable guideline range and well within the twenty-year statutory maximum. We cannot conclude under these circumstances that McClelland\u2019s 57-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">Accordingly, we affirm McClelland\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
