Whavers argues, in reliance on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. The instant appeal is barred, however, by the plain language of Whavers\u2019s knowing and voluntary appeal waiver in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 545-46 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir.2005). The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-23\">MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b345-21\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
