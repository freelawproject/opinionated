These offenses included, inter alia, possession of fifty or more grams of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine with intent to distribute, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000), and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(I) (2000). Because Nowell has prior drug convictions, the former carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\u00ae (2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. II 2002). The latter carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months, to be served consecutively to the sentence for the underlying drug crime. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The district court consequently imposed a 300-month sentence. Nowell filed a motion for a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0 and 5H1.4, which the district court denied. Nowell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">We affirm. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201cdid nothing to alter the rule that judges cannot depart below a statutorily provided minimum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005). Departure below a statutory mandatory minimum is authorized only on a motion by the government based upon a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. <em>See id.; see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (Supp. II 2002). The government made no such motion here, and the district court correctly recognized that it therefore had no authority to reduce Nowell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
