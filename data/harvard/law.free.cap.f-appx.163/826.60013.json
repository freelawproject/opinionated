In 1996, Brown was convicted of: (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute approximately two kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (Count 1); (2) attempted possession with intent to distribute approximately two kilograms of cocaine, in violation of \u00a7 846 (Count 2); and (3) using a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count 4). The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) noted that Brown\u2019s offense involved \u201capproximately 4 kilograms of cocaine hydrochloride,\u201d and calculated his base offense level as 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), the applicable guideline for a violation of \u00a7 846. We affirmed Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence, concluding that the evidence supported both the convictions and the district court\u2019s determination of the drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>In June 2005, Brown filed the instant <em>pro se </em>motion for reduction of sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c), arguing that, based upon the retroactive application of Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines, his sentence should be reduced. According to Brown, the sentencing court determined, contrary to the drug amount set forth in his indictment, that his offense involved at least 3.5 kilograms of cocaine, and, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(5), calculated his base offense level as 30. Brown argued that Amendment 591 \u201csuperceded\u201d this approach, requiring the sentencing court to determine the applicable base offense level only using the offense of conviction, and his offense of conviction solely established an incomplete attempt to possess with intent to distribute approximately 2 kilograms of cocaine, which should have resulted in a base offense level of 26, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). The district court summarily denied Brown\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Because Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of the base offense level within the applicable offense guideline, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Brown\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which was based upon his claimed entitlement to a different base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
