Smith, Jr., appointed counsel for Michael Headrick in this direct criminal appeal, filed a renewed motion to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We denied counsel\u2019s renewed motion without prejudice and ordered him to provide a transcript of the Rule 11 change-of-plea hearing. Counsel has now supplemented the record on appeal with the requested transcript, and we construe this filing as a resubmission of his renewed motion to withdraw and <em>Anders </em>brief. Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Headrick\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
