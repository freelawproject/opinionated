Gul, an immigration detainee, filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he challenged his continued detention under <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), argued that he received inadequate medical care, and alleged that he was a United States citizen. The district court denied the continued detention claim, construed the medical care claim under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), and dismissed it without prejudice due to improper venue, and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the citizenship claim. Gul timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">We note first that the Real ID Act<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> stripped the district courts of jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>over 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petitions attacking removal orders. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 735-36 (5th Cir.2005). To the extent that Gul\u2019s petition challenged his continued detention rather than the final order of removal, nothing in the Real ID Act precluded the district court from adjudicating the claim. Gul argues that his continued detention following his March 22, 2004, removal order is unlawful because he has been detained for longer than the six month period that the Supreme Court held was reasonable in <em>Zadvydas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The district court held, and the record shows, however, that Gul hampered his own removal in August 2004 by claiming that he had pending litigation in the Supreme Court and that he knew the whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden, thereby extending the removal period of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(A). <em>See Balogun v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 347, 350-51 (5th Cir.1993). Nevertheless, Gul is still in detention over one year after this interference. The Government does not claim that Gul has continued to hinder removal efforts and offers no explanation for the continued delay. Therefore, we vacate and remand to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether \u201cthere is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future\u201d given the current state of the case. <em>Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 701, 121 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">With the benefit of liberal construction, Gul also challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his inadequate medical care claims. However, he does not brief the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal, namely improper venue, and the claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing those claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Finally, Gul asserts that he is a United States citizen, having signed naturalization paperwork in 1985 while serving in the army. Gul unsuccessfully raised this claim before the Bureau of Immigration Affairs. To the extent that it challenges the removal order, this claim was subject to transfer to the court of appeals for treatment as a petition for review, and we now construe it as such a petition. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) <em>&amp; </em>(b)(5); Real ID Act, Pub.L. 109-13, Div. B, Title I, \u00a7 106(c). Petitions for review must be \u201cfiled in the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2) (1999 &amp; Supp.2005). Because Gul\u2019s removal proceedings were completed in Atlanta this court is not the proper venue. <em>See id. </em>Due to the unfairness of requiring the parties to relitigate this issue in a new forum, however, we will not raise the non-jurisdictional venue issue sua sponte. <em>See Jama v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 230, 231 (5th Cir.2005). We conclude that Gul has failed to show that he is a United States citizen. Gul fails to show that his naturalization application was ever granted, and he derives no special benefit from his military service during a period not specified by statute. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1440(a); <em>see also Petition of Yiu Nam Donn, </em>512 F.2d 808, 810 (3d Cir.1975). His petition for review is therefore DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">Gul\u2019s motions to stay deportation pending appeal, to file a supplemental brief, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>expedite the appeal, and for bail pending appeal are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
