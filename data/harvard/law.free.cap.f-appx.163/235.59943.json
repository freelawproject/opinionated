We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On appeal, Guzman-Balbuena first contends that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is an unconstitutional sentencing provision and that the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which supports the provision, should be questioned in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We disagree. The constitutionality of increasing penalties based on prior convictions, as prescribed by \u00a7 1326(b)(2), was upheld in <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>As the Appellant concedes, this court has recently acknowledged the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). We therefore find that this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Guzman-Balbuena next argues that his sentence was unreasonable. After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guidelines range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2004), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)). If a court imposes a sentence outside the guidelines range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Id. </em>This court should review a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 3553 to determine whether it is reasonable. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">The district court imposed a sentence within the advisory guideline range and below the statutory maximum for the offense and considered the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553. Guzman-Balbuena identifies no persuasive reason why the sentence imposed was not reasonable. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-65, 767) (noting after <em>Booker, </em>sentencing courts should calculate the guideline range, consider the other factors under \u00a7 3553, and impose a reasonable sentence within the statutory maximum). Accordingly, we affirm Guzman-Balbuena\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
