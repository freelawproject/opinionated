In 1998, White was convicted of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). He now argues that he is entitled to relief based on the change made by Amendment 591 to \u00a7 lBl.l(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines requiring that the applicable guideline section be determined by the offense of conviction. He claims that because no drug quantity was found by the jury in his case, his base offense level under the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, should be lowered because he should have been sentenced under the provision of \u00a7 841 which carries a 20-year statutory maximum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has discretion to reduce the term of imprisonment of an already incarcerated defendant when that defendant was sentenced based on a sentencing range that was subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). However, \u00a7 3582(c) does not grant the district court jurisdiction to reconsider all original sentencing determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 781-82. Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c), the district court may not modify an imposed term of imprisonment upon motion of the defendant unless the defendant\u2019s sentencing range was subsequently lowered by an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">Amendment 591 became effective on November 1, 2000, and is retroactively applicable. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Under the amendment, U.S.S.G, \u00a7 lBl.l(a) instructs the district court to \u201cdetermine, pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.2 (Applicable Guidelines), the offense guideline section from Chapter Two (Offense Conduct) applicable to the offense of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 591. Furthermore, Amendment 591 changed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a), in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>structing the sentencing court to \u201c[r]efer to the Statutory Index (Appendix A) to determine the Chapter Two offense guideline, referenced in the Statutory Index for the offense of conviction.... For statutory provisions not listed in the Statutory Index, use the most analogous guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(amending U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a)). The amendment was designed to rectify confusion among circuits as to whether the sentencing court should apply a guideline section referenced in the Statutory Index, rather than selecting the guideline section based on the defendant\u2019s actual conduct, even if uncharged. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 591, \u201cReason for Amendment.\u201d The Statutory Index indicates that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 is the applicable guideline section for \u00a7 841(a) offenses. U.S.S.GApp. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Amendment 591, however, only applies to the selection of the relevant offense guideline, not the selection of a base offense level within the applicable offense guideline; it \u201cdoes not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant guideline.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219-20 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying White\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> White\u2019s base offense level was initially determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which is the applicable guideline section for \u00a7 841(a) offenses. U.S.S.GApp. A. As the Statutory Index contains an applicable guideline section for White\u2019s offense of conviction, there is nothing in the text of Amendment 591 that impacts his sentence. White argues that because the drug quantity in his case was not determined by a jury, he should have been sentenced pursuant to a different offense of conviction and, therefore, received a lower base offense level. However, <em>Moreno </em>is directly on point, and clearly rejected such an argument. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220. Therefore, this portion of White\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">White was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Under \u00a7 4B1.1, if the offense statutory maximum is life, the offense level is 37 while if the offense statutory maximum is 20 years, the offense level is 32. Even so, \u00a7 4B1.1 does not appear in the Statutory Index. (See <em>generally </em>U.S.S.GApp. A). Moreover, the selection of \u00a7 4B1.1 was not based upon actual conduct which was uncharged, but upon White\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Even if, as White argues, he should have been sentenced under the provision of \u00a7 841 which carries a 20-year statutory maximum, Amendment 591 would only affect selection of the proper base offense level guideline, not the selection of the correct base offense level within that guideline. <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219-20. Moreover, even if the district court used the wrong statutory maximum in computing White\u2019s base offense level under \u00a7 4B1.1, Amendment 591 does not address that error, but only addresses the improper consideration of actual, but uncharged, conduct in selecting the applicable guideline. Thus, Amendment 591 does not apply to the instant case, and provides no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>basis for a sentence modification pursuant to \u00a7 3582.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Because Amendment 591 had no impact on White\u2019s sentence, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying White\u2019s motion to modify or reduce his term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-11\">. The government asks us to hold that discretionary rulings made under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are unreviewable pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and to dismiss White\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We refuse to hold as the government urges. We have jurisdiction over White\u2019s appeal because it is a final order denying White's motion for reduction of sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We have also routinely handled \u00a7 3582 appeals. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b864-6\">. The district court denied White\u2019s motion in an endorsed order. We have, in the past, noted our disapproval of the district court\u2019s use of endorsed orders. <em>See In re Ford Motor Co., 345 </em>F.3d 1315, 1317 (11th Cir.2003) (admonishing district court not to enter summary orders and to provide \"a meaningful explanation of its decisionfs]\u201d). However, the law, record, and briefs of the parties allow for meaningful appellate review in this case despite the endorsed order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
