On appeal, Scott argues that this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>399 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir.2005), holding that the possession of a firearm by a felon is not a crime of violence, effectively overruled <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d 1371 (11th Cir.1998). <em>Johnson </em>is not directly on point, and therefore, because <em>Gilbert </em>remains good law, we affirm Scott\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-16\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. \u201d Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1372.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A district court generally may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence as a career offender \u201cif (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d has two possible definitions according to the career-offender guideline. The first defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any offense punishable for a term exceeding one year that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l). The second defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as any offense punishable for a term exceeding one year that \u201cis burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2). The Guidelines specifically exclude unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon from the definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, comment, (n.l).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-18\">We have previously ruled that carrying a concealed firearm is a crime of violence for purposes of the career-offender guideline. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>316 F.3d 1196, 1197 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 1007, 123 S.Ct. 1920, 155 L.Ed.2d 840 (2003); <em>Gilbert, </em>138 F.3d at 1371. We have made it clear that the law of the Circuit is \u201cemphatic\u201d that a prior panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>decision may only be overruled by the Supreme Court or by this Court when it sits <em>en banc. Adams, </em>316 F.3d at 1197 n. 1 (quoting <em>Cargill v. Turpin, </em>120 F.3d 1366, 1386 (11th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The record demonstrates that Scott had a prior conviction for carrying a concealed firearm, and the district court considered this conviction to qualify Scott a career-offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. This is the exact issue we decided in <em>Gilbert, </em>and <em>Gilbert </em>is binding precedent that determines this issue. <em>See Adams, </em>316 F.3d at 1197 n. 1. To the extent that Scott argues that <em>Johnson </em>effectively overruled <em>Gilbert, </em>his argument fails. Both the crime and statute in <em>Johnson </em>are different than the ones before us. <em>See Johnson, </em>399 F.3d at 1298-1301 (addressing the crime \u201cpossession of a firearm by a felon,\u201d as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. 3156(a)(4)). Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm Scott\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-13\">. <em>United. States v.
