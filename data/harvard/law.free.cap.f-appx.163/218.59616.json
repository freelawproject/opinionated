See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Luther El-Thomas Jones pled guilty to theft of firearms from a licensed firearms dealer, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(u) (2000). He was sentenced to 13 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. He appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Jones first argues on appeal that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement to his base offense level because the number of firearms stolen was more than eight but less than twenty-four, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(B) (2004), and a two-level enhancement based upon his role in the offense for using or attempting to use a person less than 18 years of age in the offense, USSG \u00a7 3B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Because Jones preserved these issues by objecting at sentencing based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), our review is de novo. <em>See United States v. Modems, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cIf a defendant has made a timely and sufficient Apprendi<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentencing objection in the trial court, and so preserved his objection, we review <em>de novo. </em>\u201d). When a defendant preserves a Sixth Amendment error, \u201cwe must reverse unless we find this constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, with the Government bearing the burden of proving harmlessness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005) (discussing difference in burden of proving that error affected substantial rights under harmless error standard in Fed. R.App. P. 52(a), and plain error standard in Fed. R.App. P. 52(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 746, 750, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2005) (requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. This remedial scheme applies to any sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines, regardless of whether the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 547 (citing <em>Booker, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>125 S.Ct. at 769 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Without the enhancements and without the reduction Jones received for acceptance of responsibility,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jones\u2019 offense level would have been twelve and, thus, his guideline range would have been ten to sixteen months of imprisonment. USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A (Sentencing Table). Because the thirteen month sentence Jones received is within that guideline range, we find no Sixth Amendment error. <em>Evans, </em>416 F.3d at 300-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Jones also argues the district court erred in applying the federal sentencing guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>Booker. </em>Jones set forth a general objection in the district court based on <em>Blakely. </em>The issue of whether a general <em>Blakely </em>objection raised at sentencing preserves for appellate review a claim that the district court erred in treating the guidelines as mandatory has not been decided. However, even assuming, without deciding, that the plain error standard \u2014 the more demanding standard for Jones \u2014 applies, we find Jones\u2019 sentence under the then-mandatory guidelines is in error. In <em>White, </em>we recognized that a sentence that does not violate the Sixth Amendment may involve cognizable plain error when it appears the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence if it had treated the guidelines as advisory. 405 F.3d at 223. Here, the district court announced a lower alternate sentence of five months that it might have imposed on Jones had the court not been under the now-erroneous understanding that application of the guidelines was mandatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore vacate Jones\u2019 sentence and remand the case for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction, but vacate Jones\u2019 sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-12\">. <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\">. <em>See United States v.
