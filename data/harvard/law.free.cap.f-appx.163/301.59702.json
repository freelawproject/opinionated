Because his petition was untimely, we DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b330-19\">A native and citizen of Mexico, Segovia-Rodriguez entered the United States without inspection in 1977. On July 30,1979, a Texas state court convicted Segovia-Rodriguez of felony unauthorized use of a vehicle. Three years later, an immigration judge ordered Segovia-Rodriguez deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-20\">Segovia-Rodriguez illegally reentered the United States in 1991 and filed various adjustment of status papers with the government. On February 26, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security denied his application for permanent residence. Subsequently, the Department issued a notice reinstating Segovia-Rodriguez\u2019s 1982 deportation. Segovia-Rodriguez was served with this notice of intent form on July 27, 2004. He filed a notice of appeal on August 27, 2004, thirty-one days after he was served with the form. A central issue in this case thus revolves around whether his appeal was timely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-22\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) provides that a petition for review \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d If the petition is untimely, this court has no jurisdiction to review the order of removal. A valid notice/decision of reinstatement, Form 1-871, is a final order of removal. <em>See Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 292, 294-95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>(5th Cir.2002). Segovia-Rodriguez filed his notice of appeal thirty-one days after he was served with Form 1-871, and accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to review his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Segovia-Rodriguez, however, contends that the Form is not complete, and therefore, cannot serve as a final order. Form 1-871 consists of three parts: 1) the facts that formed the basis of the determination to reinstate and the signature of \u201can immigration officer\u201d indicating that he communicated to the alien those facts and the alien\u2019s rights; 2) an acknowledgment and response by the alien; and 3) the \u201cDecision, Order, and Officer\u2019s Certification\u201d signed by an \u201cauthorized deciding INS official.\u201d In the instant case, the signature of an authorized deciding INS official was omitted from the third part. Segovia-Rodriguez would thus have this court use the Warrant of Removal as the final order, under which his petition for review would be timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">We disagree. The thirty-day period for filing a notice of appeal commences with the issue of the decision to reinstate the prior deportation order, not the issuance of a warrant to implement that decision. The first part of Form 1-871 is the conclusive determination of reinstatement; the second and third parts merely acknowledge what has already been decided. Indeed, the first part of Form 1-871 uses the word \u201cdetermination\u201d five times. <em>Ponta-Garca v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 341, 343 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In <em>Ponta-Garca, </em>the alien argued that his appeal was timely, despite its being filed more than thirty days after Form I-871 was completed, because he had sought reconsideration of the Form 1-871 decision through a letter to the government. The First Circuit held that the third part of the form \u2014 the certification by a second officer \u2014 was \u201creconsideration\u201d of the earlier \u201cdetermination\u201d of the earlier decision made in the first part of the Form. <em>Id. </em>at 343. Such a reconsideration is only necessary if the alien contests the officer\u2019s determination made in the first part. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8. Accordingly, the Form I-871 used in Segovia-Rodriguez\u2019s case is a final order that started the thirty-day clock, despite the fact that the bottom part of the form was not signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Because Segovia-Rodriguez was subject to a final order of removal on July 27, 2004, and because he did not file his notice of appeal until 31 days after that final order, this court is without jurisdiction to hear his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-23\">. In our briefing notice, this court urged the parties to brief this jurisdictional issue. Because we find it dispositive, we do not consider the merits of Segovia-Rodriguez's argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
