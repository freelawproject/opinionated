Counsel for Mosley filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mosley filed a pro se supplemental brief, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-29\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) recommended a base offense level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>of twenty-six for count one because Mosley had two prior felony convictions for \u201ceither a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,\u201d and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) violation involved a gun described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) (2000). <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l) (2004). The PSR also found that Mosley had been convicted of at least three prior convictions for a violent felony or serious drug offense or both, committed on occasions different from one another. The PSR found Mosley to be an armed career criminal within the meaning of USSG \u00a7 4B1.4, and his offense level was enhanced to thirty-four. The PSR gave Mosley a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and found a total offense level of thirty-one. Combined with Mosley\u2019s criminal history category of VI, the total offense level of 31 corresponded to a sentencing range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A, table.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Mosley\u2019s attorney first raises the issue of whether the court complied with Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. We have reviewed the record and conclude Mosley\u2019s plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Mosley next contends, through counsel and in his pro se supplemental brief, that his prior convictions were not \u201cviolent.\u201d The definitions of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d and \u201cviolent felony\u201d are derived from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). We have reviewed the record and conclude that Mosley\u2019s prior convictions meet the statutory definition of \u201cserious drug offense\u201d and \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e), notwithstanding Mosley\u2019s claim that he did not employ violence in the commission of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Next, Mosley alleges, both through counsel and pro se, that the court erred under <em>Booker </em>by finding that he had at least three prior convictions for a serious drug offense or violent felony. Mosley argues he never admitted the prior convictions qualified as violent felony or serious drug convictions. In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 233-35, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions as a prerequisite for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. Although the opinion in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), expressed some uncertainty regarding the future vitality of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>this court has subsequently clarified that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi, </em>and remains the law. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). In <em>Cheek, </em>this Court concluded that Cheek\u2019s designation as an armed career criminal based on his prior convictions did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 247 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">In <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), the Supreme Court instructed that Sixth Amendment protections apply to disputed facts <em>about </em>a prior conviction that are not evident from \u201cthe conclusive significance of a prior judicial record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1262-63. Here, Mosley does not contest any facts about his prior convictions used to arrive at the armed career criminal designation. The court\u2019s determination that Mosley was an armed career criminal did not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005); <em>cf. United States v. Washington, </em>404 F.3d 834, 843 (4th Cir.2005) (finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>that district court\u2019s reliance on disputed facts <em>about </em>prior conviction to determine that it was crime of violence violated Sixth Amendment). Accordingly, Mosley\u2019s sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Neither do we find that there is a nonspeculative basis for remanding to the district court to determine whether Mosley was prejudiced by the mandatory application of the Guidelines to his sentence. <em>See United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
