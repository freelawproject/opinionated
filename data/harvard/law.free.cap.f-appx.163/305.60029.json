Dorise waived his right to counsel and proceeded to trial pro se. A jury convicted Dorise on all three counts. Dorise was sentenced to 411 months of imprisonment, five years of supervised release, $199 in restitution, and a $300 special assessment. Represented by appointed counsel, Dorise now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Dorise\u2019s sole issue on appeal is whether he was competent to waive his right to counsel. At the hearing on Dorise\u2019s motion for self-representation, Dorise responded appropriately and coherently to all of the magistrate judge\u2019s questions. The record reflects that Dorise had a good understanding of the proceedings against him. The magistrate judge did not err in finding that Dorise knowingly and willingly waived his right to counsel. <em>See Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960); <em>Dunn v. Johnson, </em>162 F.3d 302, 307-08 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
