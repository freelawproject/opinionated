His sentence was enhanced due to a prior California conviction of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, in violation of Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 261.5. Lopez-Garcia contends that the prior offense of conviction was neither a felony nor a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">The now-advisory federal sentencing guidelines define felony as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.2). Section 261.5(c) of the California Penal Code provides that a violation may be either misdemeanor or a felony punishable by imprisonment for an unspecified term. CalPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 261.5(c). The record shows that Lopez-Garcia faced up to three years of imprisonment and that he failed to get the offense reduced to a misdemeanor. He was thus convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">Lopez-Garcia contends also.-that his prior offense does not fall within the generic definitions of \u201cstatutory rape\u201d or \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d under the comments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. Our review of the prior offense may include reference to the charging papers. <em>See United States v. Calderon-Pena, </em>383 F.3d 254, 258 &amp; n. 5 (5th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1076, 125 S.Ct. 932, 160 L.Ed.2d 817 (2005). Lopez-Garcia\u2019s charging instrument alleged sexual intercourse with a minor who was not Lopez\u2019s spouse and who was more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>than three years younger than Lopez. Under a \u201ccommon sense\u201d approach, such an offense is \u201cstatutory rape\u201d as listed under the comment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 275 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also In re Jennings, </em>34 Cal.4th 254, 17 Cal.Rptr.3d 645, 95 P.3d 906, 921 (2004) (noting that statutory rape is now called unlawful sexual activity with a minor under CalPenal Code Ann. \u00a7 261.5). The offense also meets the common-sense definition of \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>See Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d at 275-76 (similar North Carolina crime); <em>United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2000) (similar Texas crime). Lopez-Gareia\u2019s pri- or conviction was for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">For the first time on appeal, Lopez-Garcia argues that the district court erred by imposing his sentence under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Lopez-Garcia arguably waived this issue in his plea agreement when he waived the right to have facts essential to punishment charged in the indictment or proved to a jury and when he agreed to be sentenced under the federal sentencing guidelines. We need not address the waiver, however, because Lopez-Garcia\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim fails under the applicable plain-error standard of review. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.) (plain error), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Although sentencing Lopez-Garcia under a mandatory guidelines scheme constituted error in light of <em>Booker, </em>his claim fails because there is no showing that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence under advisory guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 733; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 517-18, 521 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). In addition, Lopez-Garcia\u2019s argument that the error is structural and presumptively prejudicial is without merit. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Lopez-Garcia next argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he posits that <em>Apprendi </em>casts doubt on the continuing validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres. Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
