Paul Mitchell (\u201cMitchell\u201d) claims that Fortis Benefits (\u201cFortis\u201d) wrongfully terminated his long-term disability benefits, thus abusing its discretion, in violation of various procedures under ERISA and North Carolina law. Fortis appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment, the court\u2019s judgment in Mitchell\u2019s favor on his claim for disability benefits, and the awarding of attorney\u2019s fees to Mitchell. After careful review, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">Mitchell began working for Advanced Polymer, Inc. (\u201cAdvanced Polymer\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as a sales representative in the textile chemical industry on September 1, 1997. Mitchell\u2019s job involved a substantial amount of travel, , driving an average of five hours a day, for a total of approximately 1500 to 2000 miles per week. According to Mitchell, he began experiencing symptoms of back pain in June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">In April 1999, Mitchell\u2019s treating physician, Mark A. Goodson, M.D.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> determined that Mitchell suffered from chronic lumbar discogenic disease primarily due to degenerative changes in his lower back. Dr. Goodson advised Mitchell against surgical intervention. He did recommend a regular course of care with a chiropractor, physical therapy, a low impact exercise regimen, and anti-inflammatory medication. He further advised Mitchell \u201cthat 1500 miles per week in an automobile is certainly contraindicated for his low back problem\u201d and would likely \u201cadvance the progression of his disease.\u201d J.A. 897. Dr. Goodson suggested that Mitchell obtain a \u201csit down job where he would be able to stand up and walk around approximately every 20 minutes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">By November 1999, Mitchell\u2019s condition had worsened. He complained to Dr. Goodson that his back pain increased with prolonged sitting or prolonged driving and that he found it difficult to assume an erect posture after a long drive. Once again, Dr. Goodson recommended that he discontinue the extensive travel. On November 16, 1999, Mitchell submitted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>long-term disability claim based on complaints of chronic back pain. By November 17, 1999 he was no longer reporting to work. Mitchell underwent further testing on November 22, 1999 and radiology reports revealed that he suffered from mild scoliosis of the lumbar spine with slight retrolisthesis of L2 and L3. Later that month, Mitchell requested a prescription for pain from Dr. Goodson and was prescribed Darvocet-N 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">On December 6, 1999, Mitchell reported to Dr. Goodson that his pain, which he described as \u201ca burning type pain with an occasional \u2018numb\u2019 type pain,\u201d had improved since he had resumed physical therapy and quit working. Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry #22 at 542. On December 10, 1999, Mitchell saw T. Scott Ellison, M.D., an orthopedic specialist. Dr. Ellison obtained x-rays of Mitchell\u2019s back, which revealed a degenerative collapsing lumbar scoliotic pattern, apex to the left. He noted that Mitchell\u2019s disc spaces were fairly well preserved, with some narrowing of L4-5 with facet joint arthrosis. After reviewing Mitchell\u2019s MRI scan from February 16, 1999, Dr. Ellison indicated that there were degenerative disc signal changes at multiple levels. Dr. Ellison advised Mitchell that his symptoms could be caused by the degenerative disc in his back, but that his lifestyle habits, namely extensive driving could be the cause as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Mitchell\u2019s claim was referred to Fortis\u2019 Clinical Services Department (\u201cClinical Services\u201d) for review on March 6, 2000. Based on medical and physical-therapy notes from December 22, 1999 through February 23, 2000, Mitchell\u2019s condition had improved \u2014 he showed increased range of movement and his area of pain had diminished. However, Dr. Goodson determined on February 22, 2000 that he \u201chad suffered permanent partial impairment of his spine 5% relative to his lower thoracic and lumbar spine injuries requiring long-term pain management and likely long-term chiropractic manipulative care.\u201d J.A. 900. Nevertheless, Clinical Services reviewed Mitchell\u2019s medical records and concluded that no compelling medical information supported limitations from a primarily sedentary position that allowed for position changes. However, Clinical Services noted it \u201cappears pain would prevent claimant from performing his occupation on a full-time basis.\u201d Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry # 22 at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">On March 24, 2000, Clinical Services conducted a phone interview of Mitchell. Its report indicates that Fortis was aware that Mitchell\u2019s therapy was being phased out and that he was able to drive for 10-30 minutes at a time, but experienced significant pain when driving 30-45 minutes. Mitchell informed Clinical Services that he had discussed the possibility of another sedentary job with his employer and that he did not know whether Advanced Polymer would be willing to decrease the number of miles he had to travel. Clinical Services concluded that the medical information supported a finding that Mitchell\u2019s physical limitations prevented him from returning to work in his own occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">On March 28, 2000, Mitchell received notification of Fortis\u2019 decision to grant his claim for long-term disability. Fortis considered November 17,1999 as his disability onset date, commencing benefits on February 17, 2000 (following the three months expiration of his qualifying period, as described in the Plan). On May 11, 2000, Mitchell\u2019s case manager from Concentra Managed Care Services, Inc. (\u201cConcentra\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cordeila Bortner, accompanied him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>to his appointment with Dr. Goodson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. Bortner asked about the feasibility of Mitchell returning to work with a decreased route, given his improvement. Dr. Goodson prescribed a Functional Capacity Evaluation (\u201cFCE\u201d) to determine what level of activity Mitchell could tolerate. The following day, Fortis deferred all activity pending clarification of issues surrounding the worker\u2019s compensation claim filed by Mitchell, the recent medical records noting improvement, and their bearing on Mitchell\u2019s disability.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In May 2000, Mitchell participated in the FCE. Both Dr. Good-son, claimant\u2019s treating physician, and Dr. Craig S. Heligman, from Clinical Services, reviewed the results and generally found that Mitchell would be able to do light work.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Although, Mitchell\u2019s low back pain continued to improve, he reported to Dr. Goodson that he had developed pain over his left hip and buttocks. On January 19, 2001 Mitchell was diagnosed with moderate degenerative joint disease of the hip. Dr. Goodson noted that he remained active and was not taking Darvocet, but remained on Neurontin. Dr. Goodson advised his patient to continue chiropractic care, his home exercise program, and the Neuron-tin. Mitchell continued to see Dr. Goodson on a regular basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In January 2001, a nurse with Clinical Services reviewed Mitchell\u2019s file and found that based upon the \u201cavailable medical records\u201d and multi-discipline reviews, including the peer review performed by Dr. Heligman, his condition had improved such that he had the physical capacity to perform light work demands and could return to his own occupation. Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry # 22 at 275-76. In the latter part of February 2001, Mitchell reported to Dr. Goodson that \u201chis pain had significantly decreased since he quit working, that he shifts positions frequently, that he never sits for more than 20 minutes at a time, that he never drives for more than 60 minutes at one time without having an extended rest, ... and that his hips were bothersome.\u201d J.A. 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">On March 9, 2001 Fortis advised Mitchell that he no longer met the requirements for long-term disability benefits under the Plan and that benefits would cease immediately. Fortis contended in its letter denying further benefits that Mitchell was able to perform at least light-duty work with recommendations to allow for position changes every 25-30 minutes. Fortis stated that, \u201c[p]er a discussion with Kuni Nakamura, of Advanced Polymer, [Mitchell] was allowed to take rest breaks at will.\u201d Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry # 22 at 263. The letter also stated that Mitchell\u2019s \u201cemployment as a Salesman is defined as a LIGHT physical occupation by both the Department of Occupational Titles and the Department of Labor Standards, under the occupation of Network Control Operator.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 264. Fortis\u2019 letter concluded by stating that Mitchell\u2019s records did not indicate any medical conditions that would physically limit him from performing his own occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Mitchell appealed Fortis\u2019 denial of further benefits, and on July 11, 2001, Fortis arranged for an independent medical examination before Robert Saltzman, M.D., an orthopaedic surgeon. Based on his review of the medical records and his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>examination, Dr. Saltzman concluded that Mitchell was capable of medium duty work, 8 hours per day in a 40 hour work week. The only limitation placed on Mitchell was for him to alternate between sitting and standing as he felt necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On August 29, 2001, Fortis notified Mitchell that it had completed review of his first appeal from the claim denial and concluded that the decision to deny the claim was appropriate. The letter referred to the updated medical records, the result of the independent medical examination, and a labor market survey. According to Fortis, the medical records revealed no abnormal neurological findings, no muscle weakness or atrophy, and an ability to work at a light-duty level, if not higher. The labor market study, according to Fortis, identified sales positions \u2014 classified as light duty, in Mitchell\u2019s geographical area that could accommodate his need to alternate positions, which Fortis asserted confirmed Mitchell\u2019s ability to perform the material duties of his occupation. Therefore, Fortis affirmed the decision to deny further benefits. Fortis concluded its letter by notifying Mitchell that he had one further level of appeal prior to exhausting his administrative reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Mitchell appealed the second denial of his claim through his attorney, who argued that his client was incapable of performing the material duties of his prior job. On December 5, 2001, in its response to Mitchell\u2019s final appeal, Fortis notified him that his disability claim must be based on an inability to perform the material duties of his occupation and not his specific job with his former employer. The letter further explained that the FCE and independent medical examination confirmed Mitchell\u2019s ability to work at least at the light duty level. Based on this, Fortis upheld its decision to deny further benefits and advised Mitchell that he had exhausted all administrative reviews. Mitchell responded by filing this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Generally, we review a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. Buzzard v. Holland, </em>367 F.3d 263, 268 (4th Cir.2004). However, when a plan grants discretionary authority to the decision maker, the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review applies to our review of the eligibility decision. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)). Under this deferential standard of review, a fiduciary\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary decision will not be disturbed if reasonable, even if the court itself would have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Smith v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>369 F.3d 412, 417 (4th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Booth v. Wal-Mart, Inc. Assocs. Health &amp; Welfare Plan, </em>201 F.3d 335, 341 (4th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">In this case, the Plan contains the following language explicitly granting discretionary authority to Fortis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkS\">we have the sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility for participation or benefits and to interpret the terms of the Policy. All determinations and interpretations made by us are conclusive and binding on all parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">J.A. 121. The Plan defines \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d as Fortis Benefits Insurance Company. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">However, the deference owed to a plan fiduciary\u2019s decision is tempered when the fiduciary is operating under a conflict of interest. <em>Smith, </em>369 F.3d at 417. When the decision to deny benefits impacts the fiduciary\u2019s financial interests, as in the case of a plan insurer, that conflict is weighed by the court as a factor in deciding whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Bernstein v. CapitalCare Inc., </em>70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>F.3d 783, 787 (1995). In other words, if a plan administrator acts as both the fiduciary making claim decisions and the insurer paying claims, an inherent conflict of interest exists. Accordingly, deference to the plan administrator will be lessened, but only \u201cto the degree necessary to neutralize any untoward influence resulting from the conflict.\u201d <em>Doe v. Group Hospitalization and Med. Serv., </em>3 F.3d 80, 87 (4th Cir.1993). Under no circumstances may the court deviate entirely from the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Ellis v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>126 F.3d 228, 233 (4th Cir.1997). Instead, the \u201cmore incentive for the administrator or fiduciary to benefit itself by a certain interpretation of benefit eligibility or other plan terms, the more objectively reasonable the administrator or fiduciary\u2019s decision must be and the more substantial the evidence must be to support it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case it is undisputed that a conflict exists, because Fortis functions as both the Plan Administrator and the insurer, thus deference to Fortis must be tempered.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Fortis contends that the district court erred: (1) by reviewing Fortis\u2019 claim decision <em>de novo </em>rather than determining if the decision to deny the claim was reasonable; (2) by disregarding the language in the policy and Fourth Circuit precedent when considering Mitchell\u2019s specific job duties rather than the \u201cmaterial duties\u201d of his \u201cregular occupation,\u201d when concluding that he was disabled; (3) as a matter of law, by accepting the inconsistent opinion of Mitchell\u2019s treating physician over other substantial evidence, including the FCE, a peer review, and an independent medical examination, which it argues supported the denial of benefits; (4) by ignoring the language in the policy and refusing to give Fortis a credit for an overpayment, as well as calculating benefits to include amounts that are not allowed under the policy; and (5) by granting attorney\u2019s fees to Mitchell, because he should not have prevailed on his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Fortis contends that the district court misapplied the abuse of discretion standard discussed <em>supra. </em>Fortis alleges that the district court substituted its own judgment for that of Fortis, the Plan Administrator. Further, Fortis asserts that the court gave little to no deference to Fortis\u2019 conclusions based on the court\u2019s perception that Fortis\u2019 conduct constituted \u201cbad faith.\u201d Fortis disputes the court\u2019s assertion that \u201cfailure to provide Plaintiff with any notice that termination of his disability benefits was being considered suggests bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> J.A. 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The district court stated that it had \u201cquestions about Defendant\u2019s own financial interest as the insure[r] and administrator [which] require this Court to hold Defendant to a higher standard in terms of its objective medical evidence and give less deference to Defendant\u2019s discretionary acts.\u201d J.A. 938-39. Specifically, the district court discussed the standard of review of a Plan Administrator\u2019s decision when it functions as both the insurer and the Plan Administrator. The court also noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">In determining the reasonableness of a fiduciary\u2019s discretionary decision, a court applying the modified abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>discretion standard may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">(1) the language of the plan; (2) the purposes and goals of the plan; (3) the <em>adequacy </em>of the materials considered to make the decision and the degree to which they support it; (4) whether the fiduciary\u2019s interpretation was consistent with other provisions in the plan and with earlier interpretations of the plan; (5) whether the decision making process was <em>reasoned and principled; </em>(6) whether the decision was consistent with the procedural and substantive requirements of ERISA; (7) any external standard relevant to the exercise of discretion; and (8) the fiduciary\u2019s motives and any <em>conflict of interest </em>it may have. <em>Booth v. Walr-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 335, 342-343 (4th Cir.2000) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">J.A. 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Using the above criteria, the district court reviewed Fortis\u2019 decision for reason-ability \u2014 determining whether the decisions and interpretations made by Fortis were supported by the evidence. For example, the district court found that it was reasonable, pursuant to the Plan, for Fortis to review Mitchell\u2019s eligibility on a month-to-month basis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, Fortis was not bound to its original determination that Mitchell was eligible for long-term disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">A thorough reading of the district court\u2019s opinion demonstrates that it reviewed Fortis\u2019 decisions by looking at its interpretations and finding them reasonable when Fortis\u2019 interpretations were supported by other language in the Plan or was consistent with other outside information upon which they purported to rely.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we find that the district court did use the proper modified abuse of discretion standard of review in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">To qualify for long-term disability benefits, Mitchell must satisfy the Plan\u2019s Occupation Test and demonstrate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">during the first 36 months of a <em>period of disability </em>(including the <em>qualifying </em>period), an <em>injury, </em>sickness, or pregnancy requires that you be under the <em>regular care and attendance </em>of a <em>doctor, </em>and prevents you from performing at least one of the <em>material duties </em>of your regular occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">Record on Appeal, <em>Doc. </em>Entry # 22 at 10. Therefore, to cease paying disability benefits, after initially finding Mitchell eligible, there must be evidence in the record to support Fortis\u2019 determination that Mitchell could now perform all the \u201cmaterial duties\u201d of his \u201cregular occupation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">We first consider the Plan\u2019s language. The Plan does not include a definition of \u201cyour regular occupation.\u201d However, the district court agreed with Fortis that \u201cyour regular occupation\u201d did not mean Mitchell\u2019s specific job with Advanced Polymer, but rather referred to a position more specific to Mitchell than \u201cgainful occupation\u201d, which is the language used in the Plan to test when a claimant qualifies for being disabled for more than three years.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>J.A. 919. We also consider the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Kinstler v. First Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>181 F.3d 243 (2nd Cir.1999), which interpreted \u201cregular occupation\u201d as \u201ca position of the same general character as the insured\u2019s previous job, requiring similar skills and training, and involving <em>comparable duties.\u201d Id. </em>at 252 (emphasis added). The court explained that the \u201cterm is defined more narrowly than any means for making a living, but it is not limited to the insured\u2019s particular job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, a reasonable description of a claimant\u2019s regular occupation must also take into account the specific nature of the claimant\u2019s prior employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On appeal, Fortis argues that extensive driving is not a material duty of Mitchell\u2019s regular occupation and asserts that the district court substituted its own judgment for the labor market survey provided by Fortis.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Plan defines \u201cmaterial duties\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">[T]he sets of tasks or skills required generally by employers from those engaged in a particular occupation. One material duty of your regular occupation is the ability to work for an employer on a full-time basis as defined in the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtF\">Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry # 22 at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Fortis claims that because it provided a survey that identified \u201cnumerous\u201d sales positions in Mitchell\u2019s geographical area that were suitable to Mitchell\u2019s background, which did not require \u201cextensive travel,\u201d there was thus, substantial evidence that traveling approximately 1500 miles per week was not a material duty of Mitchell\u2019s occupation. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Fortis\u2019 attempt to use a labor market survey to demonstrate that driving or traveling is not a material duty of Mitchell\u2019s regular occupation is insufficient. By using limiting criteria applicable to Mitchell (light-duty, no lifting over twenty pounds, and the ability to change positions every thirty minutes), Fortis guaranteed that it would find at least a few jobs that Mitchell could possibly engage in with his physical limitations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the labor market survey does not support Fortis\u2019 determination that driving or extensive travel was not a general skill required by employers in Mitchell\u2019s occupation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">Consequently, we consider objective information to determine if Fortis\u2019 determination was reasonable. The United States Department of Labor in its Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d) defines a Chemical Sales Representative as \u201cLight Work \u2014 Exerting up to 20 pounds of force occasionally, and/or up to 10 pounds of force frequently, and/or a negligible amount of force constantly (Constantly: activity or condition exists 2/3 or more of the time) to move objects. Physical de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>mand requirements are in excess of those for Sedentary Work.\u201d Dictionary of Occupational Titles 262.357-010. The Department of Labor, in its Occupational Outlook Handbook, states that \u201cSales representatives spend much of their time traveling to and visiting with prospective buyers and current clients.\u201d Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Handbook 412 (2004-05). The Department of Labor continues, stating\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqV\">After the sale, representatives may make followup visits to ensure that the equipment is functioning properly and may even help train customers employees to operate and maintain new equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">Working Conditions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">Some sales representatives have large territories and travel considerably. A sales region may cover several States, so they may be away from home for several days or weeks at a time. Others work near their \u201chome base\u201d and travel mostly by automobile. Due to the nature of the work and the amount of travel, sales representatives may work more than 40 hours per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">Although the hours are long and often irregular, most sales representatives have the freedom to determine their own schedule. Sales representatives often are on their feet for long periods and may carry heavy sample products, which necessitates some physical stamina.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">The Department of Labor\u2019s in-depth explanation of the travel required by a sales representative supports the district court\u2019s finding that driving was a material duty of Mitchell\u2019s regular occupation. The DOT\u2019S description of a Chemical Sales Representative requiring the exertion of at least \u201ca negligible amount of force constantly\u201d \u2014 like the force necessary to drive a car \u2014 further supports the district court\u2019s finding that driving was a material duty. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding and conclude that it was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion for Fort is to find that extensive travel was not a material duty of Mitchell\u2019s regular occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">We now review Fortis\u2019 determination that Mitchell was able to perform the material duties of his regular occupation, including extensive travel. Our review, like the district court\u2019s, is limited to evidence that was in the administrative file when the Plan Administrator rendered its decision to terminate Mitchell\u2019s benefits. <em>Bernstein v. CapitalCare, Inc., </em>70 F.3d 783, 788 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">The information Fortis had prior to the March 9, 2001 decision to cease disability benefits to Mitchell was: (1) the FCE, which concluded that Mitchell was unable to sit still for any length of time and suffered from a burning sensation in his lower back when sitting and typing; (2) Dr. Heligman\u2019s review of the FCE and his opinion that the \u201cclaimant has the capacity for light work and would be able to perform his occupation of sales representative,\u201d Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry # 22 at 333; (3) Dr. Heligman\u2019s recommendation that Mitchell limit his lifting to between 10 and 25 pounds, and that he change his position frequently \u201cevery 30 minutes or so,\u201d <em>Id.; </em>and (4) Dr. Goodson\u2019s review of the FCE and his finding that Mitchell was capable of light duty work with restricting his lifting to 20 pounds, changing positions every 20-30 minutes, and sitting no more than six hours in a 24 hour period, and if driving is involved\u2014 \u201climit driving to a max. of 2 hours per 24 hours with a max. of 10 hours per. week. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>While driving he should stop every 30 nain. and walk around the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In addition, the record indicates that in January 2001, Dr. Goodson scheduled Mitchell for x-rays to investigate his complaints of hip pain. Mitchell was diagnosed with moderate left hip degenerative joint disease. In February 2001, after the June 2000 FCE, but before the March 9, 2001 denial of benefits, Dr. Goodson opined that Mitchell would not be able to \u201cmaintain gainful employment without significant increase in pain symptoms making him totally non-functional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The medical evidence does not reasonably support Fortis\u2019 finding that Mitchell was capable of doing all material duties of his occupation. It was unreasonable for Fortis to find that Mitchell could drive extensively every day if he could only drive a maximum of 30 minutes at a time with a significant rest afterward. It would be almost impossible, even given an extended work day, for Mitchell to timely attend his appointments. Further, the facts support the district court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe record demonstrates that there was never an official RTW [\u201creturn to work\u201d] proposal made or rejected.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 923. Finally, the medical evidence is not in conflict, both Dr. Heligman and Dr. Goodson limited Mitchell\u2019s ability to sit or drive to 30 minutes or less at a time. Therefore, we find that Mitchell was unable to perform a material duty of his occupation, and that even giving Fortis the appropriate deference it was unreasonable for Fortis to find otherwise on March 9, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">After the March 9, 2001 denial, Mitchell appealed and Fortis gathered more medical evidence, presumably to re-evaluate the decision denying Mitchell long-term disability benefits. In August 2001, Dr. Saltzman conducted a physical examination, reviewed \u201call available medical records,\u201d and found in his independent medical evaluation that the \u201cobjective findings are not consistent with the patient\u2019s subjective symptoms. The objective findings are minimal (i.e. his scoliosis compared to a subjective inability and there is no muscle weakness nor atrophy).\u201d J.A. 141. Dr. Saltzman opined that Mitchell was capable of performing \u201cmedium category work level for an 8-hour day, 40-hour week, with the ability to sit and stand, alternating as he feels necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Saltzman was aware that Mitchell\u2019s prior position as a sales representative involved driving and frequent sitting. Dr. Saltzman also estimated Mitchell\u2019s level of ability as \u201cthere were no tasks that I think the claimant would be unable to perform, other than lifting more than 40-lb on more-than-occasional basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Dr. Saltzman indicates that he reviewed Mitchell\u2019s medical records from 1998 until February 2001, however, it is also plain that Dr. Saltzman had incomplete medical information, for example \u201cno x-rays were made available for review.\u201d J.A. 140. Nevertheless, Dr. Saltzman concludes that his objective findings were inconsistent with Mitchell\u2019s subjective complaints, Dr. Saltzman did \u201crecommendf ], however, that updated MRI\u2019s of the thoracic and lumbar spine be obtained and x-rays, plain films of the thoracic and lumbar spine be obtained. It may be advantageous to get EMGs of the (L) lower extremity to detect and denervation to the muscle since clinically none are noted.\u201d J.A. 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In contrast, both Dr. Heligman and Dr. Goodson opined that Mitchell had some limitations in his abilities and necessitated the ability to change positions every 20-80 minutes. In addition, Dr. Ellison recognized that Mitchell\u2019s extensive driving may have caused (or exacerbated) the degenerative disc in his back. Further, the FCE supported the findings and recommendations made by Dr. Ellison, Dr. Goodson, and Dr. Heligman. The only evidence in the record that clearly supports Fortis\u2019 determination is Dr. Saltzman\u2019s opinion. With an incomplete record and without any further tests, Dr. Saltzman\u2019s opinion\u2014 that Mitchell was able to perform all tasks except lifting in excess of 40 pounds \u2014 does not outweigh the medical opinions of Dr. Goodson, Dr. Ellison, and Dr. Heligman who limited Mitchell\u2019s abilities to sit and drive to 80 minutes. Thus, we find that Dr. Saltzman\u2019s opinion cannot alone provide enough reasonable support for Fortis\u2019 decision, even according Fortis tempered deference. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s findings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Next, Fortis contends that the district court erred when the court failed to offset for the Social Security benefits that Mitchell received, when it added to the benefit calculation money received by Mitchell as a \u201cbonus\u201d, and when the district court granted Mitchell benefits beyond what was remaining in the first thirty-six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">First, despite Fortis\u2019 assertion to the contrary, the court did offset the benefits payment by the Social Security benefit Mitchell received. The district court awarded Mitchell $108,241.00 for the total amount of past-due disability benefits owed under the terms of the Plan.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court determined that $3,820.00 was the initial monthly benefit for the period of May 2001 until May 2002. In May 2002 Mitchell began receiving Social Security disability benefits, thus the district court reduced the monthly benefit owed by Fortis to Mitchell to $2,590 per month for the period of May 2002 until February 16, 2004.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Second, Fortis does not cite to any language in the district court\u2019s opinion to support its assertion that a \u201cbonus\u201d was included in the court\u2019s calculations of Mitchell\u2019s benefits. Further, the record shows that Fortis determined in an internal memo, dated August 22, 2001, that $4,830 was commissions and should be added to Mitchell\u2019s income. Fortis originally calculated the \u201cadjusted pre-db [\u201cpre-disability\u201d] earnings $69,000/12 = $5,750 + 214.80 (2,577.63/12) = $5,964.80 \u2014 release underpayment to claimant.\u201d Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry # 22 at 145. The district court calculated Mitchell\u2019s monthly disability benefits to be considerably lower, as described above. Thus, the record does not support Fortis\u2019 contention that the district court included a \u201cbonus\u201d in its calculation of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">Finally, Fortis is correct in its contention that the district court granted Mitchell \u201cReinstatement of disability benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>under the Plan, in the amount of $2,590 per month, from February 17, 2004, through the present,\u201d J.A. 1040, in the amount of $129,795.93 which is in direct conflict with the Plan. According to Fortis\u2019 Plan language, \u201cafter 36 months of <em>disability, </em>an injury, sickness, or pregnancy prevents you from performing at least one of the <em>material duties </em>of each <em>gainful occupation </em>for which your education, training, and experience qualifies you.\u201d Record on Appeal, Doc. Entry #22 at 10. The district court did not make a finding that Mitchell satisfied the Plan\u2019s requirement that he be unable to perform a material duty in his \u201cgainful occupation\u201d, making him eligible for disability benefits after the initial thirty-six months. In fact, the district court specifically recognized the difference between qualifying for disability for the first thirty-six months and qualifying later after the initial thirty-six months. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of $129,795.93 for disability benefits after February 17, 2003.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Fortis argues that because Mitchell should not have prevailed in his claim, the district court\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees was in error. We review the district court\u2019s award for abuse of discretion. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Pettit, </em>164 F.3d 857, 865 (4th Cir.1998). In awarding attorney\u2019s fees, a district court should use the five factors articulated in <em>Quesinberry v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., </em>987 F.2d 1017, 1029 (4th Cir.1993) (en banc), as a guide, keeping in mind the remedial purposes of ERISA. The five factors are: (1) degree of the opposing parties\u2019 culpability or bad faith, (2) the ability of opposing parties to pay fees, (3) whether the fee award would deter others similarly situated, (4) whether the parties requesting fees sought to benefit other claimants or to resolve a significant ERISA-related legal question, and (5) the relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Although the district court did not go into great detail about the basis for granting Mitchell attorney\u2019s fees we can surmise that the court found that Fortis\u2019 actions suggested bad faith and that the evidence Fortis purported to rely on in making its claims decision was not substantial and supportive of its decision to terminate Mitchell\u2019s disability insurance benefits as of March 2001. Accordingly, granting of attorney\u2019s fees would likely deter Fortis from making future hasty and unsupported decisions. Therefore, we find that attorney\u2019s fees were properly granted to Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Fortis also disputes the district court\u2019s calculation of $120,000 for attorney\u2019s fees. Mitchell\u2019s counsel asserts that he spent approximately 542.10 hours on this case at a rate of $275 an hour and requested $149,077.50 in attorney\u2019s fees. A court may award, in its discretion, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to a prevailing plaintiff in a ERISA action. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1) (2005). Thus, we review the amount of the award for abuse of discretion. <em>See Johnson v. Hugo\u2019s Skateway, </em>974 F.2d 1408, 1418 (4th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">In calculating an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, a court should usually \u201cdetermine! ] a \u2018lodestar\u2019 figure by multiplying the number of reasonable hours expended times a reasonable rate.\u201d <em>Daly v. Hill, </em>790 F.2d 1071, 1077 (4th Cir.1986). The district court should generally be guided by the particular factors articulated in <em>Barber v. Kimbrell\u2019s, Inc., </em>577 F.2d 216, 226 n. 28 (4th Cir.1978), when deciding what constitutes a \u201creasonable\u201d number of hours and rate. <em>See also Brodziak v. Runyon, </em>145 F.3d 194, 196 (4th Cir.1998). Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>have only affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that Fortis wrongly denied Mitchell benefits during the initial thirty-six months period and the district court has given us little information on how it determined the amount of fees, we find that the district court must re-calculate the amount of the award of attorney\u2019s fees using the above cases as guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that Fortis abused its discretion when it terminated Mitchell\u2019s long-term disability benefits during the initial thirty-six months of disability and its finding that Mitchell was eligible to receive attorney\u2019s fees in this case. We vacate the district court\u2019s decision that Mitchell was eligible to receive long-term disability benefits after the initial thirty-six months period and we remand for recalculation of the amount of attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\">.

According to Fortis, the Plan does not require prior notice that the Plan is considering terminating benefits and Fortis exceeds the review requirements of the ERISA statute.

The district court\u2019s comments that Fortis\u2019 actions \"suggested bad faith\u201d and \"indicate bad faith\u201d were made at the conclusion of the court\u2019s opinion and were not the standard upon which the court reviewed Fortis\u2019 decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b217-18\">.
