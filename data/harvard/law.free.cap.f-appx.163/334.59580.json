Lachney, </em>119 Fed.Appx. 640 (5th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Lachney v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2276, 161 L.Ed.2d 1054 (2005). We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">Lachney acknowledges that his challenge under <em>Booker </em>is subject to plain error review because in the district court he did not object to the sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds. \u201cAn appellate court may not correct an error the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless there is \u2018(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-22\">The government agrees that Lachney satisfies the first two parts of the plain error test, because the district court imposed a sentence under guidelines it considered binding at the time of the sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He fails on the third prong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>however, because he cannot show an error affecting substantial rights. That is because there is no \u201cindication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise that gives us any clue as to whether [the judge] would have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The only \u201cindication\u201d that might be gleaned from the court\u2019s remarks cuts against Lachney, because the judge found that the guideline range was insufficient in view of Lachney\u2019s criminal history and the severity of the charged conduct, so the court imposed a substantial upward departure. Lachney cannot show that the sentence would have been lower if the guidelines had been voluntary at the time of sentencing. Indeed, in a commendable exercise in candor, Lachney\u2019s attorney, in her supplemental letter brief, acknowledges that \u201cthe record ... does not support that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence if the guidelines had been advisory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Nonetheless, Lachney urges that the error of applying the sentencing guidelines as mandatory, in contravention of <em>Booker, </em>constitutes structural error and thus must be deemed to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test. This court has rejected the argument that such <em>Booker </em>error is structural. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, 163 L.Ed.2d 352 (2005). \u201c[W]e reject [the] argument that <em>Booker </em>error is structural.... \u201d <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">Finally, Lachney asserts that even if the error is not deemed structural, \u201cit should be considered as among the class of errors that are \u2018presumed prejudicial\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 735, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). We have dismissed this contention as well. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(\u201c[W]e reject [the] argument ... that <em>Booker </em>error should be deemed prejudicial.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
