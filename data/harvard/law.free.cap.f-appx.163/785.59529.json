No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">In 1993, Fayne initially was sentenced concurrently to (1) 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to defraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, (2) 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for credit card fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(2), (3) 125 months\u2019 imprisonment for bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344, and (4) 3 years\u2019 supervised release on each count. After revoking Fayne\u2019s supervised release in 2004, the district court imposed consecutive sentences of 24 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of the conspiracy and credit card fraud convictions and 36 months\u2019 imprisonment for the bank fraud conviction, for a total term of imprisonment of 84 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-16\">Fayne argues that her sentence is unreasonable when compared with sentences imposed on defendants who allegedly committed more egregious conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-17\">Before <em>Booker, </em>we reviewed a federal sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release using the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4). <em>United States v. Scroggins, </em>910 F.2d 768, 769 (11th Cir.1990). But in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court excised \u00a7 3742(e), which contained standards of review, from the Sentencing Reform Act and replaced it with a reasonableness standard. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-66. After <em>Booker, </em>other circuits have determined that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>reasonableness standard is the same as the \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard in \u00a7 3742(e)(4). <em>See United States v. Tedford, </em>405 F.3d 1159, 1161 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>399 F.3d 913, 916 (8th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 99 (2d Cir.2005). So, we will review Fayne\u2019s sentence for reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">After determining that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e). The sentencing court \u201cshall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">We cannot say that the district court acted unreasonably when, after Fayne violated conditions of her supervised release, the court sentenced her to two years\u2019 imprisonment for each of the conspiracy and credit card fraud convictions and three years\u2019 imprisonment for the bank fraud conviction. Fayne admitted that she violated some of the supervised release conditions, including that she used computer equipment and an internet service to obtain funds from and make contact with persons. The district court noted that, in 2003, Fayne had a revocation hearing based on a minister\u2019s accusation that Fayne had defrauded him of $20,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the instant revocation hearing, the district court deemed credible the testimony of a person who stated that, after responding to a personal ad Fayne had placed on an internet dating service, he gave Fayne approximately $230,000 in what he thought were loans, but that Fayne lied about why she needed the money and did not repay him. An investigating agent described Fayne as \u201cone of the most dangerous women I have ever investigated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">And the district court set forth specific reasons for the imposition of the sentences, including Fayne\u2019s criminal history and her threat to the public. The district court indicated that it had taken the Guidelines\u2019 policy considerations into account and recognized that the Guidelines called for a substantially less sentence of 7 to 13 months. The court stated that it believed only imprisonment would stop Fayne from committing future frauds, because Fayne had not shown that imprisonment had deterred her from operating as a \u201ccon-artist and a flimflam operator\u201d since age 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Further, although the sentences imposed were above the recommended Guideline range, these sentences were within the applicable statutory m\u00e1ximums for revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>United States v. Hofierka, </em>83 F.3d 357, 362-63 (11th Cir.1996) (stating that, on revoking supervised release, district court may impose sentence in excess of recommended Guideline range as long as sentence is within statutory maximum). And we entrust to the district court\u2019s discretion whether to impose these sentences consecutively. <em>See United States v. Quinones, </em>136 F.3d 1293, 1295 (11th Cir.1998). In sum, each of Fayne\u2019s sentences was within the applicable statutory maximum and was reasonable in the light of the evidence of Fayne\u2019s conduct while on supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Fayne next challenges the constitutionality of the supervised release system; she cites <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). She asserts that the district court lacked authority to sentence her to additional imprisonment \u2014 after she had served the statutory maximum sentences for the conspiracy and credit card fraud convictions\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>without affording her a jury trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">To the extent that Fayne challenges her original term of supervised release, she \u201cmay not challenge, for the first time on appeal from the revocation of supervised release, [her] sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. White, </em>416 F.3d 1313, 1314 (11th Cir.2005). And we have written that, even where a defendant has served the statutory maximum prison term for an offense, the district court may sentence the defendant to an additional term of imprisonment for breaching the terms of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Proctor, </em>127 F.3d 1311, 1313-14 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Further \u2014 assuming that <em>Booker </em>applies to sentences imposed after the revocation of supervised release \u2014 Fayne failed to raise her <em>Booker </em>objection in the district court. We review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Fayne admitted to violating terms of supervised release: no Sixth Amendment violation occurred. <em>See White, </em>416 F.3d at 1318. Also, no statutory <em>Booker </em>error occurred due to the mandatory application of the Guidelines. The portion of the Guidelines pertaining to supervised release revocation is advisory, not mandatory. <em>See id. </em>And the evidence does not show that the district court perceived the Guidelines as mandatory: to the contrary, we note that the district court sentenced Fayne above the recommended Guideline range. In other words, the district court committed no reversible error under <em>Booker </em>in sentencing Fayne upon revocation of her supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-12\">. The factors the district court must consider are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-14\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed [treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>ment]; ... (4) the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established for ... (B), in the case of a violation of ... supervised release, the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission ...; and (5) any pertinent policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\">. The minister recanted his story and told law enforcement that he willingly had parted with the money. The district court did not revoke Fayne\u2019s supervised release at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\">. Fayne concedes that the Supreme Court has noted in <em>dicta </em>that supervised release violations need not be criminal acts and need not be proved to a jury for a defendant to be imprisoned for these violations. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 1800, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b816-9\">. On plain error review, a defendant must show \"error\u201d that is \"plain\u201d and that \u201caffect[s] substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). It is only after these conditions have been satisfied that an appellate court then may exercise its discretion and correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
