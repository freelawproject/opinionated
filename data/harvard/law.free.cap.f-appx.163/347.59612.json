Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-23\">Meyer\u2019s claimed disability relates to problems with her back and hip. Meyer asserts that the ALJ rejected the opinion of her treating physician Dr. Randle without performing the detailed analysis required by 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d). This regulation provides that the Social Security Administration will always give good reasons in its notice of determination or decision for the weight given the claimants\u2019 treating physician\u2019s opinion and lists factors the ALJ must consider to assess the weight to be given the opinion of the treating physician when the ALJ determines that the opinion is not entitled to \u201ccontrolling weight.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-24\">Athough the ALJ specifically stated that he gave \u201csignificant weight to Dr. Randle\u2019s findings on his clinical examination of Ms. Meyer,\u201d Meyer argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>ALJ implicitly rejected Dr. Randle\u2019s opinion that Meyer needs the opportunity to change positions at will, i.e. from sitting to standing or walking, including the need to move around even if it means being away from a work station, and that Meyer was likely to be absent from work more than four days per month. The basis of Meyer\u2019s position is that Randle\u2019s opinions were posed as factual hypothetical to a vocational expert and the ALJ stated that the hypothetical were \u201cunsubstantiated by the evidence of record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Meyer relies on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448 (5th Cir.2000), in which the ALJ rejected a treating physician\u2019s opinion that the claimant could not perform sedentary work, despite a lack of competing first-hand medical evidence. We reversed and remanded the denial of benefits because the ALJ failed to give sufficient weight to the opinion of the plaintiffs treating physician without performing the detailed analysis of the treating physician\u2019s views under the criteria set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We view this case as factually distinct from <em>Newton. </em>First, the ALJ explicitly gave the clinical opinion of Dr. Randle \u201csignificant weight.\u201d The only opinion the ALJ rejected was Dr. Randle\u2019s opinion that Meyer\u2019s was disabled, a decision reserved to the Commissioner. In <em>Newton, </em>the ALJ gave the opinion of the treating physician no weight. <em>Id. </em>at 455. Second, it is clear from the ALJ\u2019s decision that the ALJ rejected the factual basis of the hypothetical on the basis of evidence other than Dr. Randle\u2019s opinion, i.e. competing first hand medical evidence and Ms. Meyer\u2019s testimony about her daily activities. The decision states that because Meyer\u2019s conditions did not qualify as a listed impairment, the ALJ considered her testimony and her condition\u2019s impact upon work to determine her residual functional capacity. The ALJ cited the following evidence to reject the hypothetical: \u201cMs. Meyer\u2019s condition is fairly stable as her visits with neurosurgeon Randal are once every three months. Ms. Meyer has a very full day with her activities of daily living despite her complaints of drowsiness. Ms. Meyer admits that she is not always in constant severe pain.\u201d In <em>Newton, </em>in contrast, the ALJ rejected the opinion of the treating physician based on the opinion of a non-treating, non-examining physician, which is improper. <em>Id. </em>at 456-57. In this case, the magistrate judge noted that the ALJ\u2019s findings were consistent with the opinions of Meyer\u2019s other treating physician, Dr. Tanhui. In summary, the ALJ did not reject the opinion of Meyer\u2019s treating physician and the cited regulation requiring further analysis does not apply. Accordingly, the Commissioner did not apply an improper legal standard in its analysis of Meyer\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 452. We note also that it is clear from the record that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, including the testimony of one of her treating physicians, Dr. Tanhui.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b375-15\">.
