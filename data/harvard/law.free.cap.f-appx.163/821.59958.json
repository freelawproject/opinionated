Tiemann, Southern District of Alabama Federal Defender Org., Mobile, AL, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b850-4\">David Andrew Sigler, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office \u2014 Southern Dist. of Alabama, Mobile, AL, Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b850-6\">Before TJOFLAT, ANDERSON and BIRCH, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b850-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">On January 28, 2005, appellant pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). On May 6, 2005, the district court sentenced appellant to a prison term of 41 months. He now appeals. He contends that the district court erred when it refused to decrease his base offense level by two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7), which is available to defendants who qualify for a \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction. According to appellant, by the time of the sentencing hearing, the cut-off time for qualifying for the reduction, he provided the Government with a complete and truthful statement about his involvement in the offense conduct. In addition, he submits that he demonstrated his willingness to cooperate with the authorities by the fact that (1) he confessed to committing the offense at the time of arrest, (2) he made himself available for debriefing, and (3) his attorney submitted a letter to the Government in which appellant denied that the drugs at issue were his, and that he was merely transporting them for someone named \u201cFito.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 for clear error, <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997), giving due regard to the opportunity of the sentencing judge to assess the credibility of witnesses. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>901 F.2d 1075, 1083 (11th Cir.1990). We also note that the defendant has the burden of proving his eligibility for relief under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(7) provides that if the defendant meets the criteria set forth in subdivisions (l)-(5) of subsection (a) of \u00a7 5C1.2, he should get a two-level reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7). Because there is no dispute as to whether appellant satisfied the first four criteria of \u00a7 5C1.2, we need not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">Section 5C1.2(5) states, \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan,....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(6). To satisfy \u00a7 5C1.2(5), the defendant \u201cmust demonstrate to the court that he has made a good faith attempt to cooperate with the authorities.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557. \u201c[I]t is the offense for which the defendant is convicted that determines the scope of information which the defendant must disclose.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2004). mere the offense is the possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, the scope includes \u201cinformation relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1557.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">We have held that \u201cnothing in the statute suggests that a defendant who previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>ously lied or withheld information from the government is automatically disqualified from safety-valve relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2000). However, evidence of defendant\u2019s previous untruthfulness is not completely irrelevant, but becomes \u201cpart of the total mix of evidence for the district court to consider in evaluating the completeness and truthfulness of the defendant\u2019s proffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Appellant has failed to show that the district court clearly erred when it found that he was not eligible for the \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction. First, it was reasonable for the district court to expect that he had additional information about the chain of the narcotics distribution, which he did not provide to the Government. Second, in determining whether he made a good faith attempt to truthfully provide the Government with all relevant information, the district court properly considered as part of the total mix, the fact that he made contradictory statements to authorities regarding his level of involvement in the offense conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">In sum, appellant has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in finding that he was not interested in cooperating with the Government by truthfully providing it with all relevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
