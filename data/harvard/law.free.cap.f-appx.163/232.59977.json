The district court concluded that under the relevant offense levels and criminal history, the appropriate sentencing range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines was 151 \u2014 188 months. Campos, however, had a prior conviction in May 2001 in New Jersey for possession of more than fifty grams of marijuana. The government accordingly sought the twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence for persons with a \u201cprior conviction for a felony drug offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 851(a)(1). The district court concluded that defendant\u2019s New Jersey conviction was for a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d because it was punishable by more than one year of imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 802(44); N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2C:35-10(a)(3), 2C:43-6. It thereafter sentenced Campos to the twenty-year mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">Campos first contends that the Sixth Amendment required a jury, rather than a judge, to determine that he had been previously convicted of a felony drug offense in New Jersey. We disagree. As we made clear in <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.2005), it remains true after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that proof of a prior conviction need not be presented to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). This is especially the case where, as here, defendant objects only to the district court\u2019s purely legal finding that his state conviction constituted a \u201cfelony drug offense.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44) (defining \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">Campos next argues that the district court erred in holding that his New Jersey conviction was a \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Section 802(44) defines \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d as \u201can offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana ... or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44). Campos was convicted in 2001 for possession of a controlled substance under a New Jersey statute with a maximum sentence of eighteen months in prison. <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2C:35-10(a)(3), 2C:43-6. This was accordingly a \u201cprior conviction for a felony drug offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). That Campos was sentenced to less than one year in prison for his New Jersey conviction is immaterial, because \u00a7 802(44) refers to offenses \u201cpunishable\u201d by more than one year imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
