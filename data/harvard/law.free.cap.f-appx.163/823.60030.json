Watkins, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Southeastern Newspapers, Inc.\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment in a <em>pro se </em>action for copyright infringement, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 <em>et seq. </em>Watkins alleged that Southeastern infringed his copyright in a book he had written, <em>King\u2019s Last Visit to Augusta (He Was Persona Non Grata) </em>(hereinafter \u201cthe book\u201d), by (1) using a copy of a photograph of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (hereinafter \u201cthe photograph\u201d) which was contained in the book in a newspaper article it published, and (2) selling copies of the photograph on the Internet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Watkins argues that the district court erred when it granted Southeastern\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on a letter from the U.S. Copyright Office, which indicated that Watkins had not registered his copyright in the book, because (1) the letter was inadmissible hearsay, and (2) Southeastern did not disclose the name of the witness who wrote the letter, or the letter itself, as it was required to do pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-14\">I. Admissibility of the letter from the Copyright Office</p>\n<p id=\"b852-15\">As an initial matter, because Watkins did not challenge the admissibility of the letter from the Copyright Office based on Southeastern\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of Fed. R.Civ.P. 26(a)(1) before the district court, Watkins has waived any argument on this issue, and we will not consider it on appeal. <em>See Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526-27 (11th Cir.1994) (noting that, except for limited exceptions which are not applicable in this case, issues not raised in the district court generally are not considered on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-16\">Hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d and generally is not admissible unless it falls under an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) and 802. There is an exception to the hearsay rule for public reports and records. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C). That exception provides, in relevant part, that \u201c[rjecords, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth ... factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>authority granted by law,\u201d are admissible \u201cunless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have explained that \u201cRule 803(8)(C) allows into evidence public reports that (1) set forth factual findings (2) made pursuant to authority granted by law (3) that the judge finds trustworthy,\u201d unless the evidence is otherwise inadmissible because it is irrelevant or is more prejudicial than probative. <em>Hines v. Brandon Steel Decks, Inc., </em>886 F.2d 299, 302 (11th Cir.1989). The district court has broad discretion to admit or exclude evidence, and that decision \u201cwill not be reversed absent a clear showing of abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In this case, the district court did not err in considering the letter from the Copyright Office, which is a report from a public office or agency, because it falls under the public-reports-and-record-exception to the hearsay rule <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(C). First, the letter sets forth factual findings. Second, those factual findings resulted from an authorized search of the copyright registration records. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(c) (authorizing the Copyright Office to \u201cmake a search of its public records, indexes, and deposits,\u201d for, among other things, information regarding the registration of copyrights). Third, there was no evidence presented contradicting the information in the letter, and there were no other circumstances indicating that the document otherwise lacked trustworthiness. Finally, the letter is relevant and is not more prejudicial than probative, and therefore, is not otherwise inadmissible. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it considered the letter from the Copyright Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">II. Summary judgment was proper</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment, applying the same legal standards as the district court. <em>See Miller v. King, </em>384 F.3d 1248, 1258 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together -with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">The Copyright Act provides, in relevant part, that \u201cno action for infringement of the copyright in any United States work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the copyright claim has been made____\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a). This Court has held that \u201c[t]he registration requirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an infringement suit.\u201d <em>M.G.B. Homes, Inc. v. Ameron Homes, Inc., </em>903 F.2d 1486, 1488 (11th Cir.1990); <em>see also Brewer-Giorgio v. Producers Video, Inc., </em>216 F.3d 1281, 1285 (11th Cir.2000) (describing this rule as \u201cwell settled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">In this case, because the evidence in the record shows that Watkins failed to register the copyright in his book before bringing his copyright infringement claims, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Watkins\u2019s claims, and therefore, did not err in granting Southeastern\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment. <em>See M.G.B. Homes, </em>903 F.2d at 1488.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b852-12\">. In his complaint, Watkins also raised a claim for common law plagiarism. On appeal, Watkins does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that this claim was preempted by the Copyright Act, and therefore, he has abandoned any argument on this issue. <em>See, e.g., Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
