She makes the following arguments: (1) her conduct did not constitute a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2), as amended in 2003; (2) the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction; (3) the Government withheld evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); and (4) the district court engaged in judicial misconduct. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Siverand\u2019s contention that, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2) was intended to apply only to club owners, rave promoters, or persons who profit from the sale and use of drugs is not supported by either the plain language of the statute or the legislative history. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2)(2005); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, at 68 (2003); <em>United States v. Orellana, </em>405 F.3d 360, 366 (5th Cir.2005). We therefore reject her contention that the charged conduct did not fall within the ambit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">We further hold that evidence of Siverand\u2019s collection of <em>\u201cyard </em>fees\u201d from the dealers who sold crack from her yard supported a finding that she \u201cintentionally ... made available for use, ... [a] place for the purpose of unlawfully ... distributing or using a controlled substance,\u201d and we therefore reject her sufficiency-of-theevidenee argument. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(2); <em>United States v. Chen, </em>913 F.2d 183, 190 (5th Cir.1990). We also reject Siverand\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim; the Government\u2019s at-trial disclosure of Leroy Washington\u2019s recantation did not violate <em>Brady. See United States v. Walters, </em>351 F.3d 159, 168 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Siverand\u2019s contention that the district court\u2019s supplemental jury instructions, to which she did not object, were inconsistent with its written charge and, therefore, confused the issue of intent is not borne out by our reading of the record. She has therefore not demonstrated error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Partida, </em>385 F.3d 546, 559 (5th Cir.2004). Finally, the eomplained-of remark made by the district court was not so prejudicial that it denied Siverand a fair trial. <em>See United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1569 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
