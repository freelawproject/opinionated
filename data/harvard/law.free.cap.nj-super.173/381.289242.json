A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"A2D\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">I am constrained to dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">In my view the opinion of the court below, which the majority affirms, fails to take into account the distinction, which has been adopted in strong dicta by our Supreme Court, between an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u201caccidental means\u201d and \u201caccidental result\u201d policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has indicated that a policy allowing compensation for \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d is an \u201caccidental result\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Moreover, an insured purchasing a policy with the \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d language in it may be said, as a matter of law, reasonably to have expected 'that a 44-year-old man, in the patently healthy condition of this insured prior to the incident here involved, would be compensated under this type of policy for a totally unexpected death that resulted from his voluntary overexertion through strenuous exercise. By affirming the judgment below the majority opinion effectively has obliterated the distinction between an accidental means and an accidental result policy in this area of the law and, as I see it, has adopted the converse of Justice Cardozo\u2019s suggested rule in his dissent in the <em>Landress </em>case, infra, at least in heart cases. Thus, in effect, the majority holds that any accidental benefit policy, irrespective of whether the language therein is means- or result-oriented, bars recovery for this type of unexpected heart death simply because it is brought about by voluntary excessive exertion of an overtly healthy man with a latent unknown heart or vascular disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Obviously, there are gradations of factual patterns, and not every insured who suffered a myocardial infarction could recover under these policies. The matter would depend upon such things as the age, the apparent and known or unknown physical condition of the insured, and other factors, which will vary from case to case. Moreover, the issue of the reasonable expectation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of an insured may involve the resolution of a question of fact, rather than law. See <em>Perrine v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>120 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In her complaint plaintiff alleged that, as beneficiary under four life insurance policies issued by defendant Penn Mutual and one policy issued by defendant Prudential, she was entitled to accidental death benefits as the result of her husband\u2019s fatal heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Defendants denied liability, principally on the ground that no coverage was intended for death resulting from voluntary exertion as opposed to some unforeseen and unexpected \u201caccident.\u201d The evidence was undisputed that decedent\u2019s death was caused by acute myocardial infarction following his voluntary participation in a vigorous basketball game. Plaintiff conceded below, as she does on appeal, that the death was not, therefore, caused by accident. Her position has been, however, that the policies herein insured not only against injuries from accidental <em>causes, </em>but also against accidental <em>results, </em>regardless of the cause. Since the heart attack here is an accidental result, she reasons, defendants are liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The facts concerning the circumstances and cause of her husband\u2019s death were essentially undisputed. At the time of his death he was a 44-year-old comptroller for the Singer Company. On Saturday morning, May 4, 1974, he went to his office to tender his resignation, apparently after having been unhappy in his job for some time. He had already located a new job in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Upon returning home that afternoon he worked in his yard for about three hours. He and his wife then attended a dinner party at a friend\u2019s house. At about 9 p. m. a \u201clight dinner\u201d consisting of bouillabaisse was served. After dinner, at about 11 p. m., decedent and two other men played a vigorous 30-45-min-ute game of basketball against three teenagers. The host had a basketball court at the base of a slight hill on the side of his house. When the game was over decedent walked up the incline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>to the house. He then began to moan, his face became white and he slumped into his chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Plaintiff, decedent\u2019s wife, noticed that when decedent returned to the house he was sweating \u201cprofusely,\u201d had \u201clost his color\u201d and was \u201cvery clammy.\u201d He was dead on arrival at the hospital at 12:03 a. m., May 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">According to plaintiff, decedent enjoyed generally good health and had never experienced heart problems before. Nor had she observed anything unusual on the day in question. Decedent was very active athletically throughout his life, and at the time of his death he was active in golf, tennis, volleyball and swimming.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The death certificate indicated the cause of death as \u201cacute myocardial infarction.\u201d The only other medical evidence was the testimony of Dr. Goodman, a specialist in internal medicine and a subspecialist in heart and lung disease, who testified on behalf of plaintiff. Dr. Goodman had never examined decedent. On the basis of the death certificate and a hypothetical question incorporating the circumstances of the death, the doctor stated that the cause of death was acute myocardial infarction. He described the mechanics of decedent\u2019s death as follows: All males have a \u201ccondition\u201d known as coronary arteriosclerosis, which develops at about the age of 20 and progresses with age. This \u201ccondition\u201d does not become a \u201cdisease\u201d until certain symptoms develop. In the case of decedent the combination of the dinner, the basketball game and the walk up the incline caused the \u201ccondition\u201d to become a \u201cdisease\u201d resulting in the myocardial infarction. Decedent\u2019s sweating and paleness just before his death were the symptoms of this process. The doctor further stated that death would not have occurred when it did but for decedent\u2019s strenuous activity after dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The testimony for the defense was limited to that of decedent\u2019s secretary and supervisor, both of whom stated that on the day before and the morning of his death, decedent\u2019s lips were blue. While the secretary felt decedent did not look well, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>supervisor testified that on the morning of his death decedent was a \u201cpicture of health,\u201d except for the blue color of his lips.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">All policies herein purport to extend coverage for \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d (or \u201cinjuries\u201d). This choice of language is critical. The trial judge deemed this phrase to be equivalent in effect to policies insuring against injuries caused by \u201caccidental means\u201d or causes, ruling that where the injury, as here, was not caused by accident, there could be no liability under an \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d clause. Plaintiff contends that the two concepts should be distinguished, such that, under the language used in the policies by these defendants, only an accidental result need be shown.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In its written opinion, on the basis of which the majority affirms the judgment below, the trial judge reviewed the well-established case law with respect to \u201caccidental means\u201d policies as requiring some unforeseen and unexpected event which precedes and produces the injury. It rejected plaintiff\u2019s attempted distinction between the language of the policies in question\u2014 \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d\u2014and other cases involving policies framed in terms of \u201caccidental means.\u201d It ruled that no such distinction existed, and therefore plaintiff could not avoid what it considered the clear line of precedents suggesting that a heart attack following voluntary exertion could not qualify under provisions requiring death by accident, regardless of whether the policy referred to \u201caccidental bodily injuries\u201d or \u201caccidental means.\u201d Accordingly, the judgment was entered in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>While the distinction between accidental means and accidental injury has been criticized as illusory, it has been accepted in some jurisdictions. New Jersey has never directly considered the question in the context of an \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d policy. It has, however, developed well-defined principles applicable to \u201caccidental means\u201d policies. The chief task for this court is to decide whether \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d insurance insures against a risk which is any different from that covered by insurance against injury by \u201caccidental means\u201d or causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The seminal case in this area is <em>Mutual Accident </em>Ass\u2019n v. <em>Barry, </em>131 <em>U.S. </em>100, 9 <em>S.Ct. </em>755, 33 <em>L.Ed. </em>60 (1889), which set forth the majority view that \u201caccidental means\u201d policies require that the injury be caused by something unforeseen, and that if the injury was an unexpected result of voluntary conduct during which nothing unusual occurred, no recovery could be had. The contrary minority view derives from Justice Cardozo\u2019s dissent in <em>Landress v. Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>291 <em>U.S. </em>491, 498, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>461, 463, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>934 (1934), in which he assailed the <em>Barry </em>approach with the following oft-quoted phrase: \u201cThe attempted distinction between accidental results and accidental means will plunge this branch of the law into a Serbonian Bog.\u201d 291 <em>U.S. </em>at 499, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 463. Justice Cardoza reasoned that the average policyholder would justifiably think that an \u201caccidental means\u201d policy would insure against accidental results, even though no outward accident occurred in the usual sense. <em>Ibid. </em>Hence, the cause of death therein\u2014sunstroke while playing golf\u2014should be covered since it was an accidental result, albeit of ordinary conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 501, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">While the <em>Barry </em>view represents the majority, the modern trend is in favor of the Cardozo approach. 10 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d, \u00a7 41.28 at 47-50, \u00a7 41.30 at 53-55 (1962); 44 <em>Am. </em>Jur.2d, Insurance, \u00a7 1221 at 67-69; Annotation \u201cInsurance: \u2018accidental means\u2019 as distinguishable from \u2018accident,\u2019 \u2018accidental result,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>\u2018accidental death,\u2019 \u2018accidental injury,\u2019 etc.,\u201d 166 <em>A.L.R. </em>469 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In the leading New Jersey case, <em>Linden Motor Freight Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>40 <em>N.J. </em>511 (1963), however, our Supreme Court expressly adopted the <em>Barry </em>approach. There decedent suffered a myocardial infarction after picking up some fallen cartons in the warehouse where he worked. Nothing unusual happened while he lifted the cartons, although he developed a coughing spell and collapsed later that night. The insurance policy required bodily injury effected through \u201cexternal, violent and accidental means.\u201d After reviewing the relative merits of the <em>Barry </em>and Cardozo approaches, the court adopted the former. The court held that a heart attack following voluntary exertion during which no mishap occurred could not warrant recovery under an \u201caccidental means\u201d policy. <em>Id. </em>at 526, 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Plaintiff herein relies upon two instances of dicta in <em>Linden </em>which allegedly indicate the court\u2019s intention to distinguish \u201caccidental means\u201d policies from \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d policies. First, in criticizing the Cardozo test because it ignores the contract language by reading in the policyholder\u2019s perhaps contradictory expectations, the court reasoned that the outcome under that view</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">* * * has to be the same whether the key words of the contract are \u201caccidental bodily injuries\u201d\u2014now used in some accident insurance policies, * * where Cardozo\u2019s criterion is perhaps more fitting\u2014or the obviously narrower terminology * * * of \u201cbodily injuries effected * * * through * * * accidental means,\u201d * * *. <em>[Id </em>at 523, citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">I agree with plaintiff that the import of the above dictum is that \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d might insure against a broader risk than that covered by only \u201caccidental means.\u201d I also agree that the trial judge misinterpreted this reference as expressing the court\u2019s view that the outcome should be the same regardless of which phrase is used. To the contrary, from the context it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>clear that the court was condemning such a view as being the logical result of the Cardozo analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">In addition to the foregoing dictum plaintiff cites the <em>Linden </em>court\u2019s further apparent approval of her position in the following footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">Where policies provide benefits in the event of \u201caccidental bodily injuries,\u201d as distinct from those, as in the case at bar, conditioning payment upon sustainment of injuries \u201ceffected * * * through * * * accidental means,\u201d coverage has been found in the event of heart injury occurring as the result of a voluntary act, although the particular jurisdiction recognizes the distinction between accidental death and death resulting from accidental means. See e. <em>g., Love v. American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pa., </em>113 <em>U.S.App.D.C. </em>195, 306 F.2d 802 (D.C.Cir. 1962); <em>Pledger v. Business Men\u2019s Accident Ass\u2019n., </em>228 <em>S.W. </em>110 (Tex. Comm, of Appeals, adopted by Sup.Ct.1921). <em>[Id. </em>at 527, n. 4]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial court rejected the persuasiveness of this reference as overlooking the context in which the cases were cited. To the contrary I think the footnote supports plaintiff\u2019s position that the Supreme Court perceived (albeit via dicta) the distinction she urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">The first case cited, <em>Love v. American Cas. Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>306 F.2d 802 (D.C.Cir. 1962), involved an \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d police. Decedent died from an acute myocardial infarction after riding through an exceptionally severe storm which caused her to be buffeted by high winds and rain. On appeal from the trial court\u2019s granting of the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the court reversed, holding that a fact question existed as to whether decedent suffered \u201caccidental bodily injury,\u201d a broader and more inclusive concept than injury caused by \u201caccidental means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804-805.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In the other case cited in the <em>Linden </em>footnote, <em>Pledger v. Business Men\u2019s Accident Ass\u2019n., </em>228 S.W. 110 (Tex.Comm. of App. 1921), the court ruled that where the policy insured against accidental death, as opposed to death by accidental means, a death caused by heart attack after voluntary exertion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>covered, since the means were irrelevant. <em>Id. </em>at 113.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court applied the distinction urged by plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">* * * there is a well-recognized distinction between accidental death and death resulting from accidental means. In the former, death is accidental if the result is an accident, whether due to accidental means or not. In the latter, regardless of whether the means by which death is produced be voluntarily employed, the result is due to accidental means, if in the act preceding the injury something unforeseen, unusual, and unexpected occurs which produces the result. . . Death caused by accidental means is an accidental death; but an accidental death may or may not be the result of accidental means, [Ib/d]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The trial judge cited two cases in support of his conclusion that the concept of \u201caccidental injury\u201d necessarily implies an element of <em>causation\u2014Schwartz v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>96 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520 (Law Div.1967), aff\u2019d 99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223 (App.Div.1968), certif. den. 51 <em>N.J. </em>393 (1968), and <em>Chelly v. Home Ins. Co., </em>285 A.2d 810 (Del.Super.1971), aff d o. b. 293 A.2d 295 (Del.Sup.Ct.1972). However, I find neither case apposite. In <em>Schwartz, </em>unlike here, there was clearly a causing accident, and the policy in <em>Cheliy </em>was one of \u201caccidental means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Also relied upon by the trial court is <em>Harris v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>565 (1964), in which plaintiff suffered a myocardial infarction while engaged in his regular work, no mishap occurring during the performance thereof. The policy applied to bodily injury as the result of an accident, language which the court equated to an \u201caccidental means\u201d policy, as opposed to one insuring \u201cmerely against an accidental result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, citing the aforementioned <em>Linden </em>footnote, 40 <em>NJ. </em>at 527, n. 4. Where the policy thus requires some accidental cause, the test is whether the events preceding the injury would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>perceived by an average policyholder as \u201caccidental,\u201d in light of \u201cthe limiting language of the insuring clause.\u201d 41 <em>N.J. </em>at 568. The court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">Where the resultant injury is to the heart, brought on by reason of exertion from activity, voluntarily pursued, in which nothing unexpected or unforeseen occurs beyond the injury itself, and there is nothing which a layman would understand to be an accident, the average policyholder could not reasonably reach a conclusion of coverage, [/bid]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">By acknowledging that a policy might insure against accidental results rather than against the more \u201climiting\u201d concept of injury caused by accident, the <em>Harris </em>court arguably recognized the distinction urged by plaintiff. Thus, regardless of the <em>Harris </em>ruling that a heart attack such as occurred herein could not be caused by accident, a heart attack nonetheless might trigger liability where the policy speaks not of causation, means, or the result of an accident, but rather of \u201caccidental bodily injury.\u201d <em>Cf. Cattani v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retire. Sys., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 586 (1976); <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142, 154 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">To summarize New Jersey\u2019s experience, no case has held that the language \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d insures against an accidental injury not caused by accidental means. But such a distinction has at least been postulated in case involving \u201cmeans\u201d policies. In addition to the cases already discussed, see <em>Dikowski v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J.L. </em>124, 126 (E. &amp; A. 1942) and <em>Kennedy v. U. S. Fidelity, etc., Co., </em>113 <em>N.J.L. </em>431, 437 (E. &amp; A. 1934), in which the court acknowledged the distinction between an injury which is accidental and one caused by accidental means; but the distinction was not determinative in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Both parties invoke cases from other jurisdictions which support their respective positions. Compare <em>Kearbey v. Rel. L. Ins. Co. of Webster Groves, </em>526 <em>S.W.2d </em>866 (Mo.Ct.App.1975) and <em>Johnson v. National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>92 <em>Ga.App. </em>818, 90 S.E.2d 36 (Ga.Ct.App.1955) (both suggesting that \u201caccidental injury\u201d is a different risk than injury caused by accident) with <em>Nicholas v. Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co., </em>451 F.2d 252 (6 Cir. 1971) (construing \u201caccidental bodily injuries\u201d as requiring accidental cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The majority opinion seeks support from cases in other jurisdictions denying recovery for injuries due to heart attack following voluntary exertion. See Annot., \u201cHeart attack following exertion or exercise as within terms of accident provision of insurance policy,\u201d 56 A.L.R.2d 800 (1957). A review of virtually all of those cases, however, reveals that either they involved \u201caccidental means\u201d or causation policies (see, e. <em>g., Smith v. Continental Casualty Company, </em>203 A.2d 168 (D.C.Ct. of App.1964); <em>Miller v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, </em>183 <em>Kan. </em>667, 331 P.2d 310 (Sup.Ct.1958), or, while involving \u201caccidental bodily injuries\u201d policies, they grounded their decisions upon earlier \u201caccidental means\u201d cases without acknowledging the distinction. See e. <em>g. Gilmour v. Security Mutual Casualty Company, </em>348 <em>Mass. </em>785, 204 <em>N.E.2d </em>502 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1965); <em>Goldstein v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, </em>164 So.2d 576 (Fla.Dist.Ct. of App. 1964), <em>cert. </em>den. 170 So.2d 587 (Fla.1964). We note that <em>Goldstein </em>relies on this State\u2019s <em>Linden </em>case, <em>supra, </em>even though <em>Linden </em>involved an \u201caccidental means\u201d policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In my view, the reasonable expectation of a policyholder, faced with the facts in this case (including the lack of knowledge of any preexisting disease), is that a heart attack following strenuous physical activity, even though voluntary, would constitute an \u201caccidental bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I have concluded that, under the present status of New Jersey law, the distinction urged by plaintiff best achieves the reasona<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ble expectations of a policyholder, especially in view of our Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgment of such a distinction in <em>Linden, supra. </em>As I have indicated, from the standpoint of the average insured, the phrase \u201caccidental bodily injury\u201d would be deemed to include a heart attack following strenuous physical activity, under the circumstances here involved, even if that activity is voluntary. To be distinguished, among other situations, would be a heart attack while at rest. A death therefrom cannot be a predicate for recovery, since there would be no unusual causing incident in the eyes of the average insured; it would be considered \u201cnatural\u201d rather than \u201caccidental.\u201d Additionally, death, even under the circumstances of the instant case, of a 65 year old man might not justify recovery under the policies before us, either as a matter of fact or law. Thus, defendants\u2019 fear that a decision for plaintiff would render all sudden deaths accidental is without basis. In any case, insurers can easily avoid coverage for such injuries or deaths by adopting language requiring accidental causation or means. <em>Cf. INA Life Insurance Company v. Brundin, </em>533 P.2d 236, 243 (Sup.Ct.Alaska 1975); <em>Tomaiuoli v. U. S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>75 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192, 205-207 (App.Div.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In view of the trial court\u2019s ground of decision, it did not reach the additional issues of whether coverage was defeated by other provisions in the policies relied on by defendants. I deem a remand unnecessary on these issues, since the record is sufficient to warrant the exercise of our original role in making findings. <em>R. </em>2:10-5. <em>Cf. Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 490 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">All of the policies in their insuring clauses permit recovery only where the death resulted directly \u201cand independently of all other causes\" from the accidental bodily injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Defendants contend that there is evidence that prior to the precipitating event in this case, decedent was working long hours, unhappy in his work and under a very great strain, and on the morning of the day when he suffered his heart attack, he had advised his employer that he was leaving for another job; that plaintiffs expert had testified that physiological changes attendant upon a heart attack could be produced by emotional strain, as well as physical exertion; and that in an action against decedent\u2019s employer, plaintiff had claimed that the heart attack resulted from the stress and strain occasioned by his difficulties at work. They also assert that there was evidence from decedent\u2019s coemployees that his lips were blue on the day before, and the morning of, the day he suffered the attack; and that plaintiff\u2019s expert stated that such a condition was a manifestation of cyanosis, frequently a circulatory disorder. All of this evidence, it is said, demonstrates that the fatal heart attack was caused, at least in part, by coronary arteriosclerosis of sufficient severity to produce a coronary occlusion, thus barring recovery on the policies as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">I disagree. From the proofs the only reasonable inference is that not withstanding his arteriosclerosis, the infarction would not have occurred when it did but for decedent\u2019s exertion, and that prior to his death decedent had not known of, or experienced or been treated for, any heart, arteriosclerotic or similar problems or symptoms. It is patent that the exertion after dinner was the sole proximate cause of the infarction, acting on an underlying passive arteriosclerotic condition that became a \u201cdisease\u201d only when such exertion resulted in the development of the symptoms thereof. Under these circumstances, the al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>leged emotional strain and the severity of decedent\u2019s arteriosclerosis cannot fairly be said to be a contributing or proximate cause of his death. To conclude otherwise on this record is to engage in sheer speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Where, as here, a latent, inactive condition or disease, not known to the insured, is not accompanied by any symptoms and is precipitated or activated by an accident or accidental bodily injury into a resulting disability or death, such condition or disease is neither an independent cause under the insuring clause, nor a disease such as to defeat coverage under the exclusion clause, involved in the instant ease. <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protect. Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 483-489, and cases cited therein. See also <em>Boring v. Haynes, </em>209 <em>Kan. </em>413, 496 P.2d 1385 (Sup.Ct.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I see no merit in defendants\u2019 endeavor to distinguish <em>Kievit, supra, </em>from <em>Tomaiuoli v. U. S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co., </em>75 <em>N.J.Super. </em>192 (App.Div.1962) on the ground that where the underlying condition is arteriosclerosis, <em>Kievit </em>is inapplicable and coverage must be denied. Indeed, <em>Kievit </em>discussed cases involving arteriosclerosis where recovery was allowed. See 34 <em>N.J. </em>at 486-487. Moreover, we specifically distinguished <em>Kievit </em>in <em>Tomaiuoli </em>by stating that the disease in the matter before us was active, known and symptomatic before death; we characterized the distinction as one \u201cbetween an <em>active, patent </em>progressive disease which in its very nature is competent to contribute to death, and a <em>latent or dormant, symptom-free </em>condition, possibly aggravated or exacerbated by bodily injury.\u201d 75 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 197, 203, 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Accordingly, I have concluded that in the present case, the death resulted directly and independently of all other causes from the accidental bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Defendant Penn Mutual claims that there is a further bar to recovery on its policies by virtue of another provision thereof. The insuring clause requires that the accidental bodily injury be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>evidenced by a \u201cvisible contusion or wound on the exterior of the body (except in the case of drowning or of internal injury revealed by an autopsy) . . .\u201d The policies also granted Penn Mutual \u201cthe right and opportunity to examine the body and to make an autopsy unless prohibited by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">No autopsy was performed. Plaintiff testified that her rabbi informed her that an autopsy was forbidden by her religion. Penn Mutual introduced no medical proofs and never requested an autopsy. The record is barren of the reason for the lack of any such request. But Penn Mutual contends that it \u201cprobably didn\u2019t even know of [the] death until long after burial. When it did later learn of his death, it had no reason to request an autopsy,\u201d since \u201cthe plain language of its policies placed upon the beneficiary the burden of demonstrating an internal injury revealed by an autopsy if that fact were to be relied upon.\u201d It is unfair, it is argued, to shift that burden by substituting the opinion evidence of a physician\u2014plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2014, who had never examined the insured, for an autopsy which might well have shown that the arteriosclerosis may have been such that death would have occurred without any considerable physical exertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The undisputed testimony of the physician establishes that an internal injury did in fact occur. He stated that the infarction involved the death of all or a part of the heart muscle; and that there was a rupturing or breaking away of a plaque in a coronary artery which caused the artery to be blocked, thus shutting off the blood supply to the heart muscle and preventing it from further functioning. The inference that an internal injury occurred and caused death is, therefore, inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The purpose of a visible wound or mark clause, such as that in the instant case, is to protect the insurer against fabricated or simulated claims; it should be given a reasonable and practical construction. See 44 <em>Am.Jur.2d Insurance, </em>\u00a7 1224, at 73 (1969). See also Annot., \u201cConstruction and effect of \u2018Visible Sign of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Injury\u2019 and similar clauses in accident provision of insurance policy,\u201d 28 <em>A.L.R3d </em>413, 420 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Where, as here, death resulted from an undisputed heart attack involving internal injury, there is no danger of simulation. The insurer could have produced medical testimony to show that the arteriosclerosis was such that death would have occurred without any significant physical exertion; or it could have requested an autopsy which might have supported that thesis. It did neither. The danger against which the autopsy clause was designed to guard was not present in this case. Penn Mutual should not be permitted to leave unchallenged plaintiff\u2019s evidence that a fatal injury occurred and then to seek refuge in the autopsy clause as a bar to a finding of the existence of that injury. The defense that no internal injury was revealed by an autopsy must fail, whether the legal theory precluding its assertion be designated waiver or simply fairness to the insured. See 44 <em>Am.Jur.2d, Insurance, </em>\u00a7 1227 at 75; 23 A.L.R.3d, <em>op. cit., </em>at 425; Annot. \u201cTime for making autopsy or demand therefor under insurance policy,\u201d 30 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>837, 838-842 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">I would reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff and against defendants with respect to all of the policies.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Dicta which, particularly as here, has been repeated in a number of Supreme Court cases, may serve as a significant guide as to what that court would decide were the issue squarely presented to it.
