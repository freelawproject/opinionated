A.

Hermann and Mereschak and nurses Bastinelli and Boyle.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">At the time the summary judgment motion was argued the record consisted of the Warren Hospital chart for decedent\u2019s admission on February 20, 1976, an affidavit of Marie Soto, another patient who shared decedent\u2019s room 413, the depositions of nurses Boyle and Bastinelli, Dr. Hermann, the attending physician, plaintiff Edwin Maslonka, decedent\u2019s husband, the medical reports of plaintiff\u2019s proposed expert witnesses, Gerson Weiss, M.D., of the New York University Medical Center, and nurse Alisan Bennett, a self-styled \u201cconsultant in health and related fields,\u201d and the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">Plaintiff relied principally upon the report of Dr. Weiss in resisting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Most of the facts pertinent to the ruling on defendants\u2019 motion are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>summarized in Dr. Weiss\u2019 report as follows: Decedent was a 33-year-old woman with a past obstetrical history of three vaginal deliveries, the last in 1965. She had experienced one spontaneous miscarriage in 1961. The subject pregnancy was described as \u201cbenign\u201d and her past medical history as \u201cnoncontributory to the present situation.\u201d Labor began spontaneously at 3:30 a. m. Decedent was admitted to Warren Hospital at 5:30 a. -m. By 6:15 a. m. she was fully dilated. She was taken to the delivery room where, at 6:30 a. m., a spontaneous vaginal delivery occurred. The seven-pound, six-ounce child was normal and the anesthesia was stopped at 6:45 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">At 7:30 a. m. decedent was transferred to semi-private room 413 for postpartum care. Following delivery, Methergine, a medication which has the occasional side-effect of increasing blood pressure in conjunction with the desired effect of contracting the uterus and decreasing uterine bleeding, had been given. Dr. Weiss interpreted the hospital chart as showing that decedent\u2019s blood pressure increased from 130/90 shortly after admission to 180/100 by 6:45 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">At 7:30 a. m. the patient was noted to be bleeding moderately and passing clots. At 7:45 a. m. Dr. Weiss observed that the bleeding was noted to be moderate and the patient had vomited. By 8:30 a. m. the nurses\u2019 notes stated that decedent was pale and restless, with labored respiration. At this time no blood pressure or pulse could be obtained. A chest x-ray was reported as \u201chighly compatible with massive pulmonary embolization.\u201d However, the electrocardiogram, according to Dr. Weiss, did not show changes compatible with this diagnosis. Emergency resuscitative efforts failed and the patient was pronounced dead at 9:30 a. m. An autopsy was offered by Dr. Hermann but was rejected by plaintiff husband about one-half hour after death. Dr. Hermann thereafter notified the County Medical Examiner, Dr. Marlott, of the death and of plaintiff\u2019s wish that no autopsy be performed. At 12:15 p. m. Dr. Marlott telephoned Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Hermann and advised that no autopsy was necessary under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Dr. Weiss\u2019 report then stated the following analysis of the cause of death and defendants\u2019 alleged breaches of duty to the decedent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">While Mrs. Maslonka was not a high risk patient, very rapid delivery of a large baby in a multiparous woman over the age of 30 is usually grounds for at least a careful monitoring of the patient\u2019s condition in the post-delivery period. The observations of Mrs. Soto suggest that all was not right with the patient from the time she was placed in Room 413. It is <em>possible </em>that her bleeding was excessive, it is <em>possible </em>that she was having respiratory difficulties or internal <em>bleeding\u2014but we will never know these answers, nor will we ever know why Mrs. Maslonka died. </em>If she had a massive pulmonary embolization, one would have expected electrocardiographic changes and one would have expected this to be an acute problem, rather one that was progressive for at least an hour while she was in Room 413. Other <em>possibilities </em>as to the cause of her death include things like an amniotic fluid embolization at the time of delivery which produced respiratory embarrassment and bleeding from intravascular coagulation, <em>possible </em>internal bleeding from a ruptured uterus which would result in a restless, agitated patient with a greater or lesser amount of external bleeding who would then have cyanosis and respiratory difficulty, or <em>even </em>a death from eclampsia. One might consider this in view of the fact that the patient was seen to have a seizure and it is possible from the record that the last blood pressure was indeed quite elevated. We <em>will never know why Mrs. Maslonka expired because we do not have enough information. We will never know whether her death could have </em>[been] <em>prevented because we will not know what caused her death. </em>The only fact that is quite clear from the record is that there is minimal documentation of her condition from the time of delivery to the time when she was found to be without blood pressure. During this critical postpartum period, not one blood pressure was recorded, not one pulse was taken, and not one observation of her condition was made except for the few statements in the nurses\u2019 notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">It should be noted in Dr. Hermann\u2019s discharge summary that he was not at all clear as to the problem with Mrs. Maslonka after her blood pressure could not be obtained. He ordered intravenous pitocin which is the medication that one gives to increase uterine contractions if one feels there is excessive bleeding. This certainly then must have been one aspect of the case which one does not see from the chart. In addition, he ordered blood for type and crossmatch which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>would indicate that he thought either she would come to immediate surgery or she was losing blood. He states that the cervix and the vagina were inspected but there is no notation as to whether the uterine cavity was inspected or whether there was evidence of internal bleeding. <em>In light of the uncertainty as to the cause of death, it is quite surprising that the coroner did not request an autopsy. </em>I am not familiar with the rules in [New Jersey] but certainly in New York City all maternal deaths are immediate medical examiner\u2019s case and an autopsy is required in every case. It has been shown again and again that this is the only way that one can learn and profit by previous poor results. <em>Without the information obtained at an autopsy, ail we can state for certain is that it is not clear as to why Mrs. Maslonka died. </em>We can also unequivocally state that she was poorly attended in her postpartum period. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Nurse Bennett\u2019s report was also relied upon by plaintiff to resist the summary judgment motion. She characterized decedent as a \u201chigh risk patient despite the reference to the contrary in Gerson Weiss\u2019 report,\u201d because of her age, her problem pregnancy in 1961 and her \u201creproductive system conditions\u2014 chronic cervicitis in 1973 and endometrial polyp in 1961 in addition to right salpingoopharitis in 1969.\u201d Nurse Bennett concluded that the nurse-defendants\u2019 depositions and the nurses\u2019 notes evinced poor postpartum care because (1) the notes were poorly kept, (2) the notes were possibly made after the pronouncement of death, (3) the notes suggested poor communication among the nursing staff about the patient\u2019s care and condition, (4) the patient\u2019s vital signs were poorly monitored, and (5) \u201ca nursing diagnosis . . . could have led [nurse] T. Bastinelli to conclude hemorrhage was possible.\u201d Nurse Bennett concludes her analysis by saying that nurse Bastinelli \u201chas not exercised all of the skills and knowledge that she should have gained as part of her basic professional training in behalf of the decedent, Patricia Maslonka. The NPN [nurses progress notes] depict her neglect of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We accept plaintiff\u2019s contention that the experts\u2019 reports of Dr. Weiss and nurse Bennett establish a deviation from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>standard of postpartum care which these defendants owed to decedent. The problem inherent in plaintiff\u2019s thesis that the materials in opposition to the motion for summary judgment created a case for the jury is the absence of any expert opinion that a professional deviation probably was a cause of death. The record is barren of expert opinion on causation of death or of any factual analysis relating any breach of duty to the mechanism of death. As we view the record, unless we hold that this is a case of res <em>ipsa loquitur, </em>e. <em>g., Steinke v. Bell, </em>32 <em>N.J.Super. </em>67 (App.Div.1954), or a case of common knowledge which we do not \u201cbelieve to be beyond the ken of the average layman,\u201d <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>128, 143 (1961), or an extraordinary case where the burden of exoneration should be shifted to defendants upon the mere showing of a medical accident because some defendant must be at fault, under the doctrine of <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Somberg, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>291 (1975) (three dissents), the judgment in defendants\u2019 favor must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Every untoward result of medical treatment does not, without expert testimony, present a <em>prima facie </em>case of liability. <em>Sanzari v. Rosenfeld, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>at 141. This court considered a somewhat similar case in <em>Parker v. Goldstein, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472 (App.Div.1963). There the plaintiff\u2019s decedent expired from a pulmonary embolism which occurred during Caesarean section. We stated that \u201c[t]he obligation devolving upon a plaintiff to prove through expert testimony a deviation from recognized standards as a basis of liability, necessarily included a showing directly, or by legitimate inference, that the departure from a standard was causally connected with the death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 480. In <em>Parker v. Goldstein, </em>plaintiff produced a qualified expert who reached this conclusion as to the reason for death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">And so, in my whole opinion, it is that from the time of her admission to the hospital until the time of her death it was the deviation of not taking care of this patient in the proper manner to do the Caesarean section at the time of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>admission or soon thereafter that <em>led eventually to the death with pulmonary embolism. [Id. </em>at 481; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">This court held that the expert\u2019s opinion as rendered was insufficient to create a jury issue on medical malpractice, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">The patient died as a result of a pulmonary embolism\u2014generically, a blood clot in the blood stream. What caused this condition to come into being? Was it the so\u2014called delay? If so, where is the proof in this case of such connection? If it be found at all, it must be in Dr. Graubard\u2019s naked assertion that in the entire complex of the facts as given to him, the course of medical conduct pursued by the defendant \u201cled eventually to her death with pulmonary embolism.\u201d There was no word of testimony from the witness to explain the physiological reactions of the decedent to the alleged delay, or of the anatomical effect of the delay on the pulmonary structure of decedent. The opinion, thus, was what is commonly described as a \u201cnet opinion.\u201d [Id. at 483]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">And this court there further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">While in <em>Dwyer </em>[v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>487, 494-495 (1962)] the court was writing in the context of a weight of evidence problem, the basic thesis that an opinion is no stronger than the facts which support it, and the medical explanation of its basis, is apposite here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">Thus viewed, the complete absence of explanation by Dr. Graubard of how, and in what manner, the supposed delay caused or contributed to the pulmonary embolism left an irreparable void in plaintiff\u2019s proof. Acceptable medical opinion of causation supported by expert explanation was an integral and indispensable part of plaintiff\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">Consequently, we are obliged to conclude that plaintiff\u2019s case lacked the requisite expert opinion that in the known and uncontrovertible circumstances, defendant violated any medical standard or tenet which was proximately related to Mrs. Parker\u2019s death. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of involuntary dismissal should have been granted. [Id. at 484]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">In <em>Parker v. Goldstein, supra, </em>plaintiff\u2019s expert did not explain how the death from pulmonary embolism was caused by or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>related to the alleged negligent treatment. In the case before us Dr. Weiss is even uncertain about the cause of death and gives no reasoned conclusion on any nexus between the death and the alleged careless treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Nor do we consider <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Somberg, supra, </em>apposite. There plaintiff was injured when the cap of an angulated pituitary rongeur broke off in the spinal cord during a laminectomy. Plaintiff brought a malpractice-products liability action against the operating surgeon, the hospital, the medical supplier and the manufacturer of the rongeur. The Supreme Court held that in such a case, where the helpless plaintiff was fault-free and all potentially responsible parties were before the court, the burden of proof and risk of nonpersuasion was upon each of the defendants who were compelled to exonerate themselves before the jury or suffer a judgment for money damages. The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Anderson </em>was premised on the conclusion that the broken rongeur of necessity was either defectively made or carelessly employed by the defendant surgeon. The Supreme Court held that all of the potential malefactors were before the trial court. The majority of the Supreme Court there stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">In the ordinary case, the law will not assist an innocent plaintiff at the expense of an innocent defendant. However, in the type of case we consider here, where an unconscious or helpless patient suffers an admitted mishap not reasonably foreseeable and unrelated to the scope of the surgery (such as cases where foreign objects are left in the body of the patient), those who had custody of the patient, and who owed him a duty of care as to medical treatment, or not to furnish a defective instrument for use in such treatment can be called to account for their default. They must prove their nonculpability, or else risk liability for the injuries suffered. [67 <em>N.J. </em>at 298]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The Supreme Court then acknowledged the narrow application of the holding in <em>Anderson v. Somberg, supra, </em>to the extraordinary case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>. </em>The rule would have no application except in those instances where the injury lay outside the ambit of the surgical procedure in question; for example, an injury to an organ, when that organ was itself the object of medical attention, would not by itself make out a prima facie case for malpractice or shift the burden of proof to defendants. Farber v. <em>Oklon, </em>40 Cal.2d 503, 254 P.2d 520, 524 (1953). <em>[Id. </em>at 302.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">We view the present situation as falling within \u201cthe ordinary case\u201d wherein the law will not assist the plaintiff by shifting the burden of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 298. We cannot say on the record before us that there is any reasonable probability either that (1) one or more of defendants\u2019 alleged substandard treatment more likely than not caused Patricia Maslonka\u2019s death, or (2) that her death from uncertain cause was more likely than not the product of some defendants\u2019 malpractice. In <em>Anderson v. Somberg, </em>the Supreme Court found that there was a very high likelihood that either the defendant doctor was careless in the use of the rongeur or that the supplier or manufacturer of the rongeur was strictly liable for supplying a defective instrument. Only uncertainty, not probability, however, abounds on the record before us. We are therefore unable to say, as the Supreme Court did in <em>Anderson v. Somberg, </em>that plaintiff must necessarily prevail against some, or all, defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We acknowledge plaintiff\u2019s contention that the affidavit of Marie Soto, the other patient in semi-private Room 413, is some evidence for submission of the case to a jury. Soto describes what she observed from 7 a. m. when Patricia Maslonka was brought to the room until about 9:15 a. m. when Soto was removed from the room. Soto described decedent as extremely restless, constantly turning and moving, delirious, and bleeding. During this period she observed that decedent received some nursing attention but that no doctor came to the room until just before 9:15 a. m. The affidavit is factually supportive of the contentions of Dr. Weiss and nurse Bennett that decedent received inadequate postpartum care. But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Soto affidavit does no more for plaintiff\u2019s case than the experts\u2019 reports on the critical issue of whether the substandard care was a cause of death. Reading Marie Soto\u2019s nonexpert affidavit in the most indulgent light still does not make this a res <em>ipsa </em>case, \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d case, or bring it within <em>Anderson v. Somberg, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Plaintiff also contends that a probable violation of the State Medical Examiner Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-78 <em>et seq., L. </em>1967, c. 234, overcomes the causation hurdle. The act states that \u201can investigation shall be conducted in the manner hereinafter described in the case of all human deaths . . within 24 hours after admission to a hospital.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-86. When such death occurs \u201cit shall be the duty of the physician in attendance ... to notify immediately the county medical examiner and the county prosecutor ... of the known facts concerning the time, place, manner and circumstances of such death.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-87. The statute then places the following duty on the county medical examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">. Immediately upon receipt of such notification, the said medical examiner or his deputy or assistant shall go to the dead body and take charge of the same. He shall fully investigate the essential facts concerning the medical causes of death and take the names and addresses of as many witnesses thereto as may be practicable to obtain, and, before leaving the premises shall reduce such facts, as he may deem necessary to writing and file the same in his office and which shall be made available to the county prosecutor at his request. The police officer present at such investigation, or if no officer be present, then the medical examiner shall, in the absence of the next of kin of the deceased person, take possession of all property of value found on such person, make an exact inventory thereof on his report and deliver such property to the police department of the municipality wherein the death occurred, which shall surrender the same to the person entitled to its custody or possession. The medical examiner shall take possession of any objects or articles which, in his opinion, may be useful in establishing the cause of death, and deliver them to the county prosecutor. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-87]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The statute thereafter imposes alternative responsibilities upon the county medical examiner.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">If the cause of such death shall be established beyond a reasonable doubt, the county medical examiner shall reduce his findings to writing and promptly make a full report thereof to the State Medical Examiner and to the county prosecutor on forms to be prescribed by the State Medical Examiner for such purpose. If, however, in the opinion of the county medical examiner the State Medical Examiner, an assignment judge of the Superior Court, the county prosecutor or the Attorney General, an autopsy is necessary, the same shall be performed by (1) the State Medical Examiner or an assistant designated by him or by (2) the county medical examiner or a deputy or assistant county medical examiner provided either has the recognized training or experience in forensic pathology or by (3) such competent forensic pathologists as may be authorized by the State Medical Examiner. . . . <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-88]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">A violation of the act is punishable as a disorderly persons offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Without dispute, Edwin Maslonka refused to give Dr. Hermann, the attending physician, permission to have an autopsy performed on his wife\u2019s body. He may have been upset when he made this decision but his emotional state cannot alter the fact. Plaintiff criticizes Dr. Hermann for not pressing harder for permission to do an autopsy, or for not insisting that the county medical examiner perform an autopsy without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Dr. Hermann promptly notified the county medical examiner, Dr. Marlott, of the death. On deposition Dr. Hermann testified that he explained the case to the medical examiner \u201ccompletely, I told him what my impression was [massive pulmonary embolization]\u201d and that the husband would not consent to autopsy. Dr. Hermann described the following conversation with Dr. Marlott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">He asked me if the family wanted an autopsy and I said, \u201cNo, they don\u2019t, but I do.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>He says, \u201cWell I don\u2019t think an autopsy is necessary and if we do one against their consent, they will probably sue.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Under the statute the decision to perform an autopsy rests with the county medical examiner, not the treating physician, although the State Medical Examiner, the assignment judge, the prosecutor or the Attorney General may also authorize an autopsy. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>52.-17B -88. The undisputed facts show that Dr. Marlott concluded that an autopsy was unnecessary here. While the wisdom of his decision was surely questionable, we cannot hold that his decision, as made, operates to expose these defendants to civil liability for malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Dr. Hermann was in violation of the State Medical Examiner Act as he was obligated to notify immediately not only the medical examiner but also the county prosecutor. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-87. Dr. Marlott was also in violation of the statute because he did not \u201c[immediately upon receipt of such notification, . . . go to the dead body and take charge of the same\u201d and conduct a full investigation. However, these violations occurred after death and do not assist plaintiff\u2019s medical malpractice claim by establishing any causal relationship between the defendants\u2019 alleged professional misconduct and the death. It is axiomatic that a violation of a penal statute may be evidence of negligence for the jury to consider but proximate causation must connect the violation and the accident. <em>Moich </em>v. <em>Passaic Terminal &amp; Transp. Co., Inc., </em>82 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 369 (App.Div.1964). A permissible inference of causality is indispensable to admissibility. <em>Mattero v. Silverman, </em>71 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 9 (App.Div.1961). Noncompliance with the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Medical Examiner Act may be the subject of disciplinary action against the offending physician but does not here provide the missing causal link in a malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The dissent contends that \u201cthe case was clearly not ripe for summary judgment.\u201d (P. 584). Plaintiff did not make this contention in the Law Division. To the contrary, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated at the argument on the motion: \u201cI have no further expert reports that are going to be submitted, . There is just not enough information to establish any further information as to the cause of death, Your Honor, and that is what I plainly said to you on numerous occasions. We don\u2019t know the cause of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">There was no genuine issue of material fact below; all of the facts as contended by plaintiff were admitted for purposes of the motion. The judge was duty bound to rule on the summary judgment motion in this context. He could not decline to rule and hope that plaintiffs\u2019 cause would improve with age. \u201cThe judgment or order sought <em>shall be rendered forthwith </em>if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2; emphasis supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The dissent concludes that the neglect of the defendants doctors and nurses was a \u201cproximate cause of her bleeding to death.\u201d (P. 584). The dissent thus converts this into a \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d case not requiring expert testimony linking the alleged malpractice to the cause of death and relies on <em>Becker v. Eisenstodt, </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 246 (App.Div.1960), which gives examples of these situations \u201cwhich speak for themselves without the need of any expert testimony\u201d, <em>i. e., </em>a sponge left inside a patient\u2019s abdomen, the removal of or injury to an inappropriate part of the anatomy, dropping a tube down the windpipe, inflicting a serious burn or removing the wrong tooth. Where plaintiff\u2019s own qualified experts cannot say that it is more likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>than not that decedent exsanguinated as a result of the alleged negligent postpartum care by her doctors and nurses, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney admits in court that he can obtain no other experts on the point, we must agree with the Law Division judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[i]t just would leave the complete\u2014the case to go to speculation by the jury\u201d if the summary judgment was not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Where plaintiff\u2019s own proffered medical experts cannot say that to a reasonable degree of medical probability the defendant\u2019s alleged breaches of duty or any of them contributed to the death of Patricia Maslonka, we cannot say the matter is so obvious that a jury may decide it as within \u201cthe ken of the average laymen.\u201d <em>Sanzari v.

A. D.,</author>\n<p id=\"Art\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The summary judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint as against respondent doctors Hermann and Mereschak and nurses Bastinelli and Boyle should not have been granted for two obvious reasons, <em>viz., </em>(1) these defendants failed to sustain their burden \u201cto exclude any reasonable doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact,\u201d <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Westfield, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74 (1954), and (2) there is sufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could properly find: (a) that, as plaintiff charged, respondent doctors and nurses abandoned decedent and failed and neglected to provide her with the professional care and treatment that she required, and that they were duty-bound to provide, in the \u201cmost critical and dangerous\u201d postpartum period, and (b) that such abandonment and neglect were a proximate cause of the ensuing death. Beyond this, the trial judge failed in his obligation to detail reasons for his action, as required by <em>R. </em>4:46-2 and <em>R. </em>1:7-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Here we had a healthy 33-year-old woman, who had had three previous \u201cnormal full-term deliveries,\u201d admitted to defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>hospital at 5:30 in the morning for delivery of another child. Four hours later, after giving birth to a healthy baby girl and being provided with practically no postpartum care and treatment although in an apparent deteriorating condition, she was pronounced dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">In July 1975 Mrs. Maslonka employed Dr. Hermann to provide her with prenatal care, to deliver her baby and, following that event, to provide her with postnatal care. An hour after her admission to Warren Hospital, he delivered her healthy baby girl. The \u201cNurses Delivery Room Notes\u201d show Mrs. Maslonka\u2019s pre-delivery blood pressure to be 138/90. The \u201cObstetrical Anesthesia Chart\u201d shows that the delivery was concluded at 6:45 a. m., at which time her blood pressure reading was 180/100 to 180/95, which Dr. Weiss, plaintiff\u2019s expert, refers to as \u201cdangerously high levels.\u201d Despite this, after the delivery of her child Mrs. Maslonka was given Methergine, a drug which Dr. Weiss states \u201chas the property of sometimes increasing blood pressure as well as its desired effect of causing the uterus to contract vigorously and decrease uterine bleeding.\u201d At 7:30 a. m. Mrs. Maslonka was taken to a semi-private room in the hospital. The other patient in the room, Marie Soto, reported that \u201cDr. Hermann did not come in at any time after the delivery to check Patricia Maslonka\u2019s condition.\u201d Dr. Hermann says that at 8:30 a. m. the \u201cother patient in the room [undoubtedly Mrs. Soto] called the nurses\u2019 attention to the fact that the patient [Mrs. Maslonka] \u2018was restless.\u2019 The nurse saw the patient immediately, restless, labored respiration, color pale, somewhat cyanotic.\u201d Upon confirmation of these findings Dr. Hermann ordered the patient\u2019s blood pressure and pulse to be checked. However, by that time there was \u201c[n]o blood pressure or pulse.\u201d Dr. Hermann \u201chad the impression that th,e patient had had a pulmonary emobolus <em>[sic </em>].\u201d She \u201chad been put on critical prior to expiring, around 8:45 AM,\u201d and \u201cwas pronounced [dead] around 9:30 AM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Dr. Mereschak, who along with Dr. Hermann was duty bound to provide Mrs. Maslonka with proper medical care and treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>ment, says, in his certification, \u201cI never saw plaintiff\u2019s decedent during her February 20, 1976 admission to Warren Hospital prior to her death.\u201d However, Mrs. Soto, in her affidavit, details first Mrs. Maslonka\u2019s efforts and then her own efforts to secure some professional care for Mrs. Maslonka, who appeared to her to be in \u201ca half-conscious, delerious state,\u201d and was experiencing \u201cvery heavy bleeding.\u201d It is apparent from Mrs. Soto\u2019s account of what occurred that Dr. Mereschak did in fact make an appearance in the room shared by herself and Mrs. Maslonka, but only after Mrs. Maslonka\u2019s condition had thoroughly deteriorated. Thus, she says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">I called the nurses the third and final time. This was approximately ten minutes or more after the second call I made for Patricia. First I pulled the cable to call the nurses. Then right after pulling the cable, I was so concerned I got out of my bed, I rushed to the door and screamed for the nurses to come. By this time blood was covering both the front and the back of Patricia Maslonka\u2019s clothing and the sheets on her bed. This did not seem normal and no Doctor came to check her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">The same two nurses came into the room. One remained and the other nurse went to get a doctor. Doctor Mereschak came into the room. He then went to the telephone. Then an oxygen machine was brought into the room by other people. An oxygen mask was placed on Patricia\u2019s face. I then noticed that a needle with attached tubing looked like blood sample was stuck in the arm of Patricia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">It appears that until Dr. Mereschak made this belated entry into the room, no doctor had been there \u201cto check Patricia.\u201d It was not until \u201cquite a long while after Dr. Mereschak arrived\u201d that Dr. Hermann made his appearance in the room. Mrs. Soto was removed from the room at about 9:15 a. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">From the time Mrs. Maslonka was removed from the delivery room until her condition became so bad that there was \u201c[n]o blood pressure or pulse,\u201d no professional, not a physician or a nurse, bothered to check these important life signs. Both Dr. Hermann and Dr. Mereschak say that although they \u201cfeel that Patricia Maslonka\u2019s death was caused by a massive pulmonary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>embolus,\u201d they are \u201cnot able to state with reasonable medical certainty the cause of death\u201d because \u201can autopsy was declined by the patient\u2019s husband.\u201d Dr. Hermann testified at depositions that about half an hour after Mrs. Maslonka died he told her husband, the plaintiff, in the presence of \u201canother fellow\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">. what we thought it probably was and how these things can occur, the others were agreeing with me, but I wanted an autopsy, it\u2019s a routine that I wanted an autopsy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Plaintiff, in his deposition, gave quite a contrary version of what occurred. While he has a \u201cpersonal dislike of the concept of autopsies,\u201d there was another reason why he \u201cdidn\u2019t want an autopsy.\u201d The following colloquy on cross-examination is enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">Q Did you, at the time that the doctor told you that your wife had died, have a discussion with him as to what caused the death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">A I asked him what happened and he said the blood clot went to her lungs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">Q That was the sole extent of your discussion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">A That was the sole extent, really. Well, he came up to me and he said, Well, I have to ask you this question: Do you want an autopsy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">Q What did you say to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">Q You said you didn\u2019t want an autopsy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-13\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-14\">Q Did you discuss the decision you had to make as to whether or not you wanted an autopsy with Dr. Herman at the time that he asked you the question? A I asked him how he felt about it and he felt that I really didn\u2019t need one because he more or less knew what it was and at the time, I didn\u2019t really think I should have had one done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">In his report Dr. Weiss seriously questions the respondent physicians\u2019 \u201cfeelpng]\u201d that the cause of death was \u201ca massive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>pulmonary embolus.\u201d He indicates clearly that the sparse records in the case suggest otherwise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">If she had a massive pulmonary embolization, one would have expected electrocardiographic changes and one would have expected this to be an acute problem, rather [than] one that was progressive for at least an hour while she was in Room 413. . . . The only fact that is quite clear from the record is that there is minimal documentation of her condition from the time of delivery to the time when she was found to be without blood pressure. During this critical postpartum period, not one blood pressure was recorded, not one pulse was taken, and not one observation of her condition was made except for the few statements in the nurses\u2019 notes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">It should be noted in Dr. Herman\u2019s discharge summary that he was not at all clear as to the problem with Mrs. Maslonka after her blood pressure could not be obtained. He ordered intravenous pitocin which is the medication that one gives to increase uterine contractions if one feels there is excessive bleeding. This certainly then must have been one aspect of the case which one does not see from the chart. In addition, he ordered blood for type and crossmatch which would indicate that he thought either she would come to immediate surgery or she was losing blood. He states that the cervix and the vagina were inspected but there is no notation as to whether the uterine cavity was inspected or whether there was evidence of internal bleeding ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Dr. Weiss concludes \u201cunequivocally\u201d that Mrs. Maslonka \u201cwas poorly attended in her postpartum period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">I cannot agree that the obvious failures in this case to comply with mandatory provisions of the State Medical Examiner Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-78 <em>et seq., </em>were without substance of effect. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-87 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-88 clearly prescribe what must be done when a person dies \u201cwithin 24 hours after admission to a hospital.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-86(d). Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-87 states that upon such death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">. . . it shall be the duty of the physician in attendance, any law enforcement officer having knowledge of such death, the funeral director, or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>person present, to notify immediately the county medical examiner and <em>the county prosecutor </em>of the county wherein the death occurred of the known facts concerning the time, place, manner and circumstances of such death. <em>Immediately upon receipt of such notification, the said medical examiner or his deputy or assistant shall go to the dead body and take charge of the same. He shall fully investigate the essential facts concerning the medical causes of death </em>and take the names and addresses of as many witnesses thereto as may be practicable to obtain, <em>and, before leaving the premises shall reduce such facts, as he may deem necessary to writing and file the same in his office </em>and which shall be made available to the county prosecutor at his request. The police officer present at such investigation, or if no officer be present, then the medical examiner shall, in the absence of the next of kin of the deceased person, take possession of all property of value found on such person, make an exact inventory thereof on his report and deliver such property to the police department of the municipality wherein the death occurred, which shall surrender the same to the person entitled to its custody or possession. The medical examiner shall take possession of any objects or articles which, in his opinion, may be useful in establishing the cause of death, and deliver them to the county prosecutor. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">And <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:17B-88 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-5\">. If the cause of such death shall be established beyond a reasonable doubt, the county medical examiner shall reduce his findings to writing and promptly make a full report thereof to the State Medical Examiner and to the county prosecutor on forms to be prescribed by the State Medical Examiner for such purpose. <em>If, </em>however, in the opinion of the county medical examiner, the State Medical Examiner, an assignment judge of the Superior Court, the county prosecutor or the Attorney General, an <em>autopsy is necessary, the same shall be performed </em>by (1) the State Medical Examiner or an assistant designated by him or by (2) the county medical examiner or a deputy or assistant county medical examiner provided either has the recognized training or experience in forensic pathology or by (3) such competent forensic pathologists as may be authorized by the State Medical Examiner. <em>A detailed description of the findings written during the progress of such autopsy, and the conclusions drawn therefrom shall thereupon be filed in the offices of the State Medical Examiner, the county medical examiner and the county prosecutor. </em>It shall be the duty of any county medical examiner to call upon the State Medical Examiner or an assistant State medical examiner, or other person authorized and designated by the State Medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Examiner, to make an examination or perform an autopsy whenever he deems it necessary or desirable, and it shall be the duty of the State Medical Examiner or assistant State medical examiner to perform such examination, except in such cases as a competent pathologist is so authorized by the State Medical Examiner to perform such autopsy. The necessary expenses for transportation of a body for autopsy by the State Medical Examiner or an assistant State medical examiner or an authorized pathologist and such reasonable fee payable to the authorized pathologist as has been approved by the State Medical Examiner for each autopsy such authorized pathologist may perform shall be paid by the State. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">It is obvious that other than Dr. Hermann\u2019s perfunctory call to the county medical examiner, none of the above essential steps was taken. Having failed to comply with the terms of the statute in a most important respect, viz., notification of the county prosecutor, respondents cannot be given the protection they seek in their claim that the final death-determining factor is missing. We must assume that had the county prosecutor been properly notified he at least would have seen to it that there was full compliance with the pertinent provisions of the State Medical Examiner Act. Respondents may not, at the expense of plaintiff, seek comfort from their own dereliction.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">It is also obvious from the record before us in this case, including the report of nurse Bennett, plaintiff\u2019s expert on nursing care, Mrs. Soto\u2019s affidavit, and the hospital records, that nurse Bastinelli and nurse Boyle, the \u201crelief head nurse\u201d on the floor during the critical postpartum period who helped nurse Bastinelli \u201cchange the patient,\u201d deviated from the standards of nursing care which they were duty-bound to observe in the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In light of all of the above, I am satisfied that a reasonable jury could properly find from the evidence that respondent doctors and nurses abandoned Mrs. Maslonka in the critical post-delivery period and failed and neglected to provide her with the professional care and treatment that she required and that they were obligated to provide at the time; and that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>abandonment and neglect were a proximate cause of her bleeding to death. Plaintiff, who sues for damages for the wrongful death of a \u201cwholly faultless\u201d decedent, \u201cshould not fail in his cause of action by reason of defendants who have it within their power to prove nonculpability but do not do so.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Somberg, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>291, 305 (1975), <em>cert. </em>den. 423 <em>U.S. </em>929, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>279, 46 L.Ed.2d 258 (1975). Here, as in <em>Anderson, </em>\u201cthe balance of equities requires no less.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Beyond this, plaintiff\u2019s case is \u201cone within the field of legitimate inferences where a lay jury might properly conclude, from the established facts and in the absence of a satisfactory explanation by defendant[s],\u201d that they, the respondent doctors and nurses, departed from standards of professional care and treatment required in the circumstances, and that such deviations were a reasonably probable cause of Mrs. Maslonka\u2019s death. See <em>Becker v. Eisenstodt, </em>60 <em>N.J.Super. </em>240, 247 (App.Div.1960). From all of the circumstances disclosed in the record, a reasonable person could find that these respondents\u2019 want of due care \u201cwas more likely the probable cause\u201d of the patient\u2019s death. <em>Germann v. Matriss, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>193, 208 (1970).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">Doubtless, in many cases, only a medical man may speak with authority as to the exact cause of death, or, to put the matter in another way, to say what caused the heart to stop, but every layman knows that it can be caused by excessive loss of blood. <em>[Skeels v. Davidson, </em>18 Wash.2d 358, 139 P.2d 301, 304 (Sup.Ct.1943)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>See, also, Flentie v.
