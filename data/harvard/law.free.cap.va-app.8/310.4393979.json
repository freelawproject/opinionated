He contends that Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 required the commission to conclude that he had coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis because he proved both injurious exposure to coal dust and the existence of opacities in his lung that are characteristic of some type of pneumoconiosis.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He further contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>commission\u2019s pneumoconiosis guide is outdated because it w\u00e1s adopted for use in connection with Code \u00a7 65.1-56 and is inconsistent with Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis is a disease of the lung that results from the accumulation of coal dust in the lungs. <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. Chubb, </em>741 F.2d 968, 970-71 (7th Cir. 1984); 1BA. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 41.91(a) (1987). It can be diagnosed by a qualified physician through interpretation of radiographic images of the lungs. <em>See Chubb, </em>741 F.2d at 971-74. Dr. N. LeRoy Lapp, the author of numerous publications on the topic of lung disease, has described the radiology of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis in the following concise, understandable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">Simple [coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis] is classified into categories 1,2, and 3 according to the profusion (number per unit area) of small rounded opacities (shadows or nodules) in the lung fields of a radiograph of the chest. When the number of small opacities is insufficient to make a diagnosis of category 1, the file is classified as category 0 or negative (\u201cnormal\u201d). The International Labour Organization (ILO) made the first attempt to codify the interpretations of chest radiographs for pneumoconiosis in 1958. This was followed by a scheme devising a twelve-point elaboration of the ILO classification system that rendered it more sensitive for the purpose of reading radiographic progression. In this latter study, each major category, including zero, was divided into three subcategories, so that in the full elaboration there were 12 categories ranging from 0/- to %.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PROFUSION ON THE ELABORATED ILO U/C AND THE SHORT FORM CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION OF THE RADIO-GRAPHIC APPEARANCES OF THE PNEUMOCONIOSES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">0/0 0/1 1/0 1/1 1/2 2/1 2/2 2/3 3/2 3/3 3/4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGV\">Category 0 Category 1 Category 2 Category 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQux\">No Pneumoconiosis Definite Pneumoconiosis</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-18\">For example, when a radiograph is being classified and the reader initially considers category 1, but eventually decides there are too few opacities, causing the correct classification to be category 0, then the classification of that radiograph is 0/1. The same applies to categories <em>V2, </em>2, <em>2h, </em>3 and <em>l/\\. </em>The numerator represents the category in which the film is placed, and the denominator represents the category that was also considered. If the interpreter does not consider any other category but the one in which he places it, then the film is classified as 1, 2, or 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-19\">Small opacities are also classified as to whether they are regular (rounded) or irregular (linear, reticular). The regular or rounded opacities are primarily seen on the radiographs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>coal miners. The regular opacities are classified according to size, pinhead (p), ranging up to 1.5 mm. in diameter, micro-nodular (q), ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 mm. in diameter and nodular (r) ranging from 3.0 to 10.0 mm. in diameter. Irregular opacities are commonly seen in asbestosis and certain other interstitial reactions but are infrequent among coal miners. When present among coal miners, these irregular opacities relate more to cigarette smoking than to dust retention. The irregular opacities are also classified by size into (s), up to 1.5 mm., (t) between 1.5 and 3.0 mm., and (u) between 3.0 and 10.0 mm. in width, according to the latest classification scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Lapp, <em>A Lawyer\u2019s Medical Guide to Black Lung Litigation, </em>83 W. Va. L. Rev. 721, 729-31 (1981) (footnotes omitted). When the reader of a radiograph finds mixed shapes (or sizes) of small opacities, \u201cthe predominant shape and size is recorded first [and] [t]he presence of a significant number of another shape and size is recorded after the oblique stroke.\u201d Department of Labor, Criteria for Use of ILO 1980 International Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Issac Penley was employed as a coal miner by Island Creek Coal Company for approximately 28 years. Penley was first notified by Dr. J. P. Sutherland that a radiograph revealed \u201copacities in all six lung zones read by us according to the New ILO-80 Classification as % p Pneumoconiosis.\u201d Sixteen additional physicians interpreted the radiograph and submitted their diagnoses to the commission. Of the sixteen interpretations, the reports of seven unrelated physicians, Drs. DeRamos, Brandon, Fisher, Sutherland, Penman, Modi, and Aycoth, contained positive diagnoses of pneumoconiosis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Drs. Wershba, Gogineni, Nichols, Binns and Duncan, all of Kanawa Valley Radiologists, Inc., each reported \u201cno evidence of occupational pneumoconiosis.\u201d Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Zaldivar also reported that the radiograph showed neither \u201cpleural [nor] parenchymal abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis.\u201d Drs. Gaziano, Castle, Hippensteel and Stewart all identified \u201cparenchymal abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Based on this evidence, the deputy commissioner found that Dr. Sutherland and six other doctors diagnosed \u201cpositive for Stage 1 coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis,\u201d that five other doctors diagnosed \u201cnegative for occupational disease,\u201d and that Drs. Gaziano, Castle, Hippensteel, and Stewart made diagnoses \u201cconsistent with coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, however, their findings are below those required for Stage 1.\u201d Upon those findings the deputy commissioner concluded that Penley established by \u201ca preponderance of the evidence . . . Stage 1 coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis\u201d and awarded permanent partial disability benefits. Reversing the deputy\u2019s decision, the full commission concluded \u201cthat Dr. Castle, Dr. Gaziano, Dr. Hippensteel and Dr. Stewart\u2019s interpretations are negative findings, so [Penley] has not carried the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d In arriving at this conclusion, the commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">The \u201cs\u201d opacities are generally fine irregular or linear and not characteristic of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. The same comments apply to the \u201ct\u201d opacities which are somewhat larger than \u201cs.\u201d \u201cQ\u201d opacities are indicative of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. Drs. Castle and Gaziano reported a profusion of opacities which are not indicative of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis. Drs. Hippensteel and Stewart reported some opacities indicative of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, i.e., those identified as \u201cq\u201d and some which were not, i.e., those identified as \u201ct\u201d, but the profusion was not sufficient to establish coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis and, thus, the reading 0/1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 mandates that, \u201c[notwithstanding any other provisions in this Act, . . . any employee having a claim for coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis benefits shall be compensated\u201d according to the \u201ccategory\u201d of the disease as scheduled in the statute. In addition, the statute requires the commission to conclusively presume coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis \u201c[i]n any case where there is a question of whether a claimant with pneumoconiosis is suffering from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis or from some other type of pneumoconiosis\u201d and where that claimant has been \u201cinjuriously] exposure[d] to coal dust.\u201d Penley contends that the commission erred because, in determining that he had not proved coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, the commission did not give him the benefit of the conclusive presumption the General Assembly specifically enacted to address coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Both decisions below refer to a \u201cstage\u201d of pneumoconiosis (the terminology of the 1971 guide and Code \u00a7 65.1-56), rather than a \u201ccategory\u201d of pneumoconiosis (the terminology of Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1). The deputy commissioner considered the varying diagnoses of the several doctors \u201cin conjunction with the fact that [Penley] has worked approximately 28 years ... in the coal mines\u201d and concluded that \u201ca preponderance of the evidence establishes that [Penley] has contracted Stage 1 coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d The deputy entered an award \u201cfor Stage 1 coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis in the amount of $326, commencing November 2, 1987, and continuing for 50 weeks\u201d a period of time consistent with Code \u00a7 65.1-56(20)(a) first stage pneumoconiosis. On review, the full commission framed the issue raised by Island Creek as whether the \u201cevidence establishes the presence of first stage coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">By framing the issue in terms of \u201cstages\u201d (the terminology of Code \u00a7 65.1-56), the commission\u2019s decision implicitly brings into question whether Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 was considered in deciding Penley\u2019s claim. Whether the commission considered the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 is of significance because, unlike Code \u00a7 65.1-56, Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 contains the presumption Penley seeks. The record contains no express indication that the commission applied Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 in deciding this case. The commission made no specific finding in this regard, nor did it refer to the statute at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>point in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Even if we found from the record that the commission did apply Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1, the commission\u2019s statement of factual findings relevant to deciding whether the presumption should apply is inadequate. In its decision, the full commission discussed only the four diagnoses that the deputy commissioner described \u201cas being consistent with coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, however, . . . below . . . Stage 1.\u201d Although all four doctors reported \u201cparenchymal abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis\u201d the commission concluded that \u201cDrs. Castle and Gaziano reported a profusion of [\u201cs\u201d \u201ct\u201d] opacities which are not indicative of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis\u201d and \u201cDrs. Hippensteel and Stewart reported some opacities indicative of coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis . . . but the profusion was not sufficient to establish coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d These findings leave open the question whether, although not indicative of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, the opacities and profusion are indicative of some other form of pneumoconiosis. Such a finding would be significant because, in order to reap the benefits of the statutory presumption, Penley was required to prove, as a threshold matter, that he suffered from some form of pneumoconiosis. If in taking the series of reports as a whole, the commission could conclude that \u201cthere is a question of whether [Penley] ... is suffering from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis or from some other type of pneumoconiosis\u201d a conclusive presumption would arise that Penley suffered from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis because it is undisputed that he was injuriously exposed. On this record, we cannot say that the commission assessed the applicability of the presumption to Penley\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Moreover, we cannot conclude with any degree of confidence, based on the record before us, that the commission would find, as suggested by Island Creek, that whenever a pneumoconiosis reading is below first stage it is necessarily below first category. Uncertainty arises in attempting to align the \u201cstages\u201d with \u201ccategories.\u201d For example, it appears on this record that an opacity classification of 2 p would be indicative of first stage coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis using the 1971 guide. That same classification, however, would be indicative of the second category, as that term is used on the 1980 ILO Classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">In addition, the physicians\u2019 interpretations of the radiograph differed significantly. The commission may have considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>expertise of the several physicians in reaching its conclusion. The record reflects that Doctors Brandon and Fisher are \u201cB\u201d readers. The rating of \u201cB\u201d apparently denotes a reader of greater proficiency and experience than \u201cA\u201d readers. <em>Chubb, </em>741 F.2d at 971, n.2; <em>Sharpless v. Califano, </em>585 F.2d 664, 666 n.5 (4th Cir. 1978). The record does not reflect the ratings of any of the other physicians. Although all five physicians from the same medical group made identical negative diagnoses, we have no basis upon which to comment upon the proficiency of the physicians in interpreting the radiographs. <em>See generally </em>Morgan, <em>Proficiency Examination of Physicians for Classifying Pneumoconioses Chest Films, </em>132 Am. J. Roentgenology 094 803-08 (1979); Roger &amp; Morgan, <em>On the Factors Influencing Consistency in the Radiological Diagnoses of Pneumoconiosis, </em>102 Am. R. Respir. Dis. 905 (1970). Questions raised by conflicting medical opinions must be decided by the commission. <em>Dept, of Corrections </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>2 Va. App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). Whether Penley has sufficiently established pneumoconiosis, or whether the threshold requirement has been met to trigger the statutory presumption, is a factual finding that should be made by the commission based upon the evidence and the appropriate legal standard. Because we cannot on this record determine the basis of the commission\u2019s decision we must remand this appeal to the commission for reconsideration and for additional findings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Penley also contends that the 1971 pneumoconiosis guide is outdated and that the commission\u2019s continued use of that guide is inconsistent with Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1. Island Creek responds that we need not address Penley\u2019s contention because the majority of the doctors\u2019 interpretations \u201care neither [first] stage . . . nor [first] category, even if there is a difference between the stages and categories.\u201d For the reasons previously stated, we conclude that this question requires a factual finding by the commission. We find no evidence in the record, however, to suggest that the parties raised this issue before either the deputy or the full commission. Accordingly, we do not address this contention. Rule 5A:18. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>remand this case to the commission for further proceedings, the parties will have an opportunity to present this question to the commission and to adequately develop the factual issues on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Coleman, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-9\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-56.1 was enacted in 1972 and provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Act, on and after July 1, 1973, or any extended date allowed for state workers\u2019 compensation laws to comply with the standards imposed by the United States Department of Labor acting under the provisions of Title 4, part C, section 421</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">(a) of Public Law 91-173 (the 1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act) and any subsequent amendments thereto <em>[see </em>30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 901, <em>et seq.], </em>any employee having a claim for coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis benefits shall be compensated according to the following schedule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">(1) For coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis medically determined to be in the first category where there is no present impairment for work, 66 % percent of the average weekly wage during the three years prior to the filing date, for fifty weeks, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in \u00a7 65.1-54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">(2) For coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis medically determined to be in the second category where there is no present impairment for work 66 % percent of the average weekly wages for ninety weeks, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in \u00a7 65.1-54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">(3) For coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis medically determined to be in the third category and involving progressive massive fibrosis or medically classified as being A, B or C under the Unione Internationale Contra Cancer or International Labor Organization (hereafter referred to as U.I.C.C. or I.L.O.) classifications but where there is no apparent impairment for work, 66 2 3/s percent of the average weekly wages, for 200 weeks, up to 100 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in \u00a7 65.1-54.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">In any case where there is a question of whether a claimant with pneumoconiosis is suffering from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis or from some other type of pneumoconiosis such as silicosis it shall be conclusively presumed that he is suffering from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis if he has had injurious exposure to coal dust.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> In 1971 the Commission adopted a pneumoconiosis guide which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The Industrial Commission of Virginia has agreed [1971] to use the following as a means of medically determining the stages of the pneumoconioses as provided for by \u00a7 65.1-56, Code of Virginia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">ILO* UIC / CINCINNATI*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APx\">First Stage p I &amp; 2 Ml &amp; 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADE\">Second Stage P 3 m 2 &amp; 3 n 1, 2 &amp; 3 P 3 q 2 &amp; 3 r 1, 2 &amp; 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC4d\">Third Stage A B C A B C</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-25\">*ILO = International Labour Organization Classification (1958).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-26\">**UICC/CINCINNATI = International Union Against Cancer Classification (1968) (Unione Internationale Contra Cancer)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-27\">The Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Ann. 244 (Michie 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-28\">Code \u00a7 65.1-56(20) still contains the following reference to coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-29\">(20) For the pneumoconiosis, including, but not limited to silicosis, asbestosis, coal miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis and byssinosis, medically determined to be in the:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-30\">(a) First stage, sixty-six and two thirds percent of the average weekly wages during fifty weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-31\">(b) Second stage, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wages during 100 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-32\">(c) Third-stage, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wages during 300 weeks.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">.
