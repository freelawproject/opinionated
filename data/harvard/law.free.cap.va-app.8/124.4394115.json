Code \u00a7 65.1-99. Therefore, under the facts of this case, McIntosh was required to file her application by February 8, 1988. Although it was delivered to the commission\u2019s office in Alexandria on February 4, 1988, McIntosh\u2019s application did not reach the commission\u2019s Richmond office until February 10, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">The term \u201cfiled\u201d is specifically defined in Code \u00a7 65.1-2.1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">Filed as used in this Act shall mean hand-delivered to the Commission\u2019s office in Richmond; sent by telegraph, or posted at any post office of the United States Postal Service by certified mail or registered mail. Filing by first-class mail shall be deemed completed only when the application actually reaches the Commission\u2019s offices in Richmond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-15\">Based on this definition, we find that McIntosh did not file her application in a timely manner because her application did not actually reach the commission\u2019s offices in Richmond until February 10, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>We further find that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply in this case. \u201c[I]t is well settled that the doctrine of estoppel does not apply to the rights of a State when acting in its sovereign or governmental capacity. This is so because the legislature alone has the authority to dispose of or dispense with such rights.\u201d <em>Main </em>v. <em>Dept. of Highways, </em>206 Va. 143, 150, 142 S.E.2d 524, 529 (1965). In the case before us, a clerk of the commission allegedly told McIntosh\u2019s counsel that the application would be \u201cstamped\u201d as of the date it was delivered to the commission\u2019s Alexandria office. This alleged statement was unauthorized because it clearly contradicted the filing requirements set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-2.1. The commission, a governmental agency of the Commonwealth, cannot be bound by this unauthorized representation of its employee. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the commission is affirmed. The appellant shall pay to the appellees thirty dollars damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">This order shalll be certified to the Industrial Commission of Virginia.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
