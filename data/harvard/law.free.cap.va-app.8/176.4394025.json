For the reasons which follow, we reverse the convictions and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Jackson was tried by jury and convicted of both armed robbery of a store clerk and use of a firearm in the commission of the robbery. During the voir dire examination, the judge asked twenty members of the jury panel several questions regarding their abilities to render a fair and impartial verdict. When asked whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>they or any member of their immediate families had been the victim of a robbery, four of the persons responded affirmatively. One of the four stated that this circumstance would affect his ability to be fair; he was stricken from the panel and replaced. During voir dire, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney asked only one question of clarification to one of the three persons who previously had responded affirmatively to the judge\u2019s question. Defense counsel asked whether any panel members were related to a police officer or would favor the testimony of a police officer over other parties. Defense counsel also asked whether any panel member was employed by or related to an employee of the oil company that owned the store where the robbery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and defense counsel then exercised four peremptory challenges each to strike eight persons from the panel. Jackson, who is black, moved to dismiss the impanelled jury on the ground that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney unlawfully struck three black persons from the panel. Two black persons remained on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The trial judge inquired as to the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons for striking the three black persons from the panel. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: Judge, as in all strikes from the jury, they are based on subjective factors often, and not on objective factors in that the Commonwealth has four grantory strikes just like the defendant has without any cause whatsoever being shown. There are still blacks remaining on the jury. The Commonwealth could have struck even more blacks. But the Commonwealth chose not to do so. The Commonwealth, in fact, struck a white as well . . . Race had absolutely nothing to do with any . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyU\">COURT: Any subjective reasons that you could state along with what you have already said or articulated for the purposes of the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: ... I struck Mr. Sammy McQueen who looked to be about the same age as the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">COURT: All right, were there any others as related to your other two strikes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: The addresses, Judge, was [the] next consideration on those other two [jurors].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Defense counsel responded by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">I would like to submit to the Court that Mr. McQueen\u2019s age is no where near the defendant\u2019s age and that the addresses of the parties in question, that the alleged crime or anywhere near [sic] where this man lived at the time or any time prior thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Immediately following defense counsel\u2019s reponse, the trial court overruled Jackson\u2019s motion, finding that the Commonwealth \u201chas not systematically excluded members of the defendant\u2019s race from the jury panel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">The United States Supreme Court decision, <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79 (1986), provides the framework for disposition of this appeal. In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court reconsidered the rule of <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202 (1965), which held that purposeful or deliberate exclusion of blacks from jury participation violates the equal protection clause. <em>Swain, </em>however, held that in the absence of direct evidence of intentional discrimination, discriminatory intent or purpose could be inferred only by proof of a prosecution\u2019s systematic use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks in a series of cases. 476 U.S. at 90-92. Recognizing that the <em>Swain </em>rule \u201cplaced on defendants a crippling burden of proof,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 92, the Court in <em>Batson </em>stated: \u201cFor evidentiary requirements to dictate that \u2018several must suffer discrimination\u2019 before one could object would be inconsistent with the promise of equal protection to all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95-96 (citation omitted). The Court thus concluded that a defendant \u201cmay establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory challenges at the defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">In order to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, the defendant \u201cmust show that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, . . . that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory challenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant\u2019s race, . . . [and] that these facts and any other relevant circumstances raise an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ence that the prosecutor used that practice to exclude the veniremen from the . . . jury on account of their race.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also Taitano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 342, 346, 358 S.E.2d 590, 592 (1987)(applying <em>Batson). </em>In making a <em>prima facie </em>case, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact that peremptory challenges permit \u201c \u2018those to discriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 96 (quoting <em>Avery v. Georgia, </em>345 U.S. 559, 562 (1953)).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Once the defendant makes the requisite showing, the burden shifts to the Commonwealth to come forward with a racially neutral explanation for removing persons of defendant\u2019s race from the panel. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97. The Commonwealth may not rebut the defendant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case by stating merely that it challenged jurors of defendant\u2019s race on the assumption that they would be partial to the defendant based upon their shared race. <em>Id. </em>\u201cNor may the prosecutor rebut the defendant\u2019s case merely by denying that he had a discriminatory motive or \u2018affirm [ing] [his] good faith in making individual selections.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98 (quoting <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>405 U.S. 625, 632 (1972)). \u201cThe prosecutor therefore must articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried. The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the defendant has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The Commonwealth argues that, as a threshold matter, Jackson failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination because two blacks remained on the jury panel following exercise of all peremptory challenges. The record in the present case reveals that the trial court did not specifically rule on whether Jackson had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination. Acknowledging generally the <em>Batson </em>decision, the trial court merely inquired into the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s avowed \u201csubjective reasons\u201d for excluding the three black jurors, without either enumerating the <em>Batson </em>criteria or ruling on whether these criteria were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In <em>Taitano, </em>this Court left open the question whether the presence of members of defendant\u2019s racial group on the jury after exercise of all peremptory challenges precludes a finding of racial discrimination. 4 Va. App. at 347, 358 S.E.2d at 592. In <em>Taitano, </em>the Commonwealth had used all four of its peremptory challenges to strike black males from the jury panel. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 358 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>at 591. Three black females and two black males remained on the panel. <em>Id. </em>This Court assumed, without deciding, that Taitano had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, <em>id. </em>at 347, 358 S.E.2d at 592, but found the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons sufficient to rebut a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 347-48, 358 S.E.2d at 593. In the present case, the Commonwealth urges this Court to adopt the position that where members of a cognizable racial group remain on the impanelled jury, the defendant has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of racial discrimination. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court did not specify the quantum of proof necessary to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination. In implementing <em>Batson, </em>however, some courts have refused to find purposeful discrimination in cases where blacks remain on the jury after exercise of all peremptory challenges. <em>See, e.g., State v. Moore, </em>490 So. 2d 556, 558-59 (La. Ct. App. 1986) (where \u201cthe first jury member selected by both the State and defendant was a black man\u201d and \u201cthe State accepted [as a juror] a black woman who was then peremptorily challenged by the defendant\u201d); <em>Clay v. State, </em>290 Ark. 54, 60, 716 S.W.2d 751, 755 (1986)(no <em>prima facie </em>case where several black persons remained on ultimate panel, State had strikes remaining, and no indication of discrimination in record). Other courts have found that striking a single black juror could constitute a <em>prima facie </em>case even when blacks ultimately sit on the jury panel. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Clemons, </em>843 F.2d 741, 747 (3d Cir. 1988)(\u201cmere presence of a single black on the jury would not necessarily prevent a finding of a prima facie case\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>109 S. Ct. 97 (1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>817 F.2d 1538, 1541 (11th Cir. 1987)(\u201cthe striking of a single black juror for a racial reason violates the Equal Protection Clause, even where other black jurors are seated\u201d), <em>modified, </em>836 F.2d 1312 (1988); <em>State v. Slappy, </em>522 So. 2d 18, 21 (Fla.) (numbers alone are not dispositive of whether peremptory challenges are discriminatory, \u201cnor even the fact that a member of the minority in question has been seated as a juror\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>108 S. Ct. 2873 (1988). <em>Batson </em>itself presented a case in which the defendant was convicted by an all white jury, all blacks having been excluded from the jury through the exercise of peremptory challenges. 476 U.S. at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Nothing in <em>Batson </em>mandates, however, the \u201ccomplete exclusion of a racial group in order to prove discrimination.\u201d <em>People </em>v. Johnson, 159 Ill. App. 3d 991, 996, 513 N.E.2d 852, 855 (citing <em>People </em>v. Seals, 153 Ill. App. 3d 417, 422-23, 505 N.E.2d 1107, 1111 (1987)), appeal denied, 117 Ill. 2d 549, 517 N.E.2d 1091 (1987) , <em>cert. denied, </em>109 S. Ct. 84 (1988). To the contrary, under <em>Batson, </em>the trial judge is required to consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to (1) a pattern of strikes against persons of the cognizable racial group included in the particular venire, which might give rise to an inference of discrimination, and (2) the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s questions and statements during voir dire examination and in exercising his challenges. 476 U.S. at 96-97. Establishing some magic number or percentage to trigger a <em>Batson </em>inquiry would short circuit the case-by-case determination whether the \u201cfacts and any other relevant circumstances raise an inference\u201d of discrimination. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 76; <em>Clemons, </em>843 F.2d at 746; <em>see also United States v. Montgomery, </em>819 F.2d 847, 851 (8th Cir. <em>1987)(\u201c Batson </em>does not require that the government adhere to a specific mathematical formula in the exercise of its challenges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Just as the mere exclusion of one or more blacks from the jury does not always give rise to an equal protection violation, <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 101 (White, J., concurring), so too, the mere inclusion of blacks on a jury does not automatically preclude a finding of a <em>prima facie </em>case, especially where other facts and circumstances give rise to an inference of prosecutorial discrimination. <em>Clemons, </em>843 F.2d at 748. \u201c \u2018A single invidiously discriminatory governmental act\u2019 is not \u2018immunized by the absence of such discrimination in the making of other comparable decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 95 (quoting <em>Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 266, n. 14 (1977)); <em>see also Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 Md. 50, 72-73, 542 A.2d 1267, 1278 (1988) (\u201cquestion is whether the state exercised any of its strikes for a racially discriminatory reason, for if it did, <em>Batson </em>was violated\u201d). Because a single act of invidious discrimination may form the basis for an equal protection violation, adoption of a rule that precludes a finding of purposeful discrimination whenever a black remains on the jury could serve to insulate some types of discriminatory jury selection practices. Indeed, under such a rule, the Commonwealth would need only retain a single black juror, eliminating the rest, and thus immunize discriminatory challenges. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number><em>People v. Seals, </em>153 Ill. App. 3d at 423, 505 N.E.2d at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In the present case, a panel of twenty persons was qualified for selection on the jury. Discounting the challenges available to Jackson, a pool of sixteen persons was available to the Commonwealth, five of whom were black. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney exercised three of four peremptory challenges to exclude three of the five black jurors. The Commonwealth thus used a disproportionate number of its peremptory challenges against the defendant\u2019s racial group. <em>See id. </em>(ten challenges used to exclude six blacks, one latino, and three whites); <em>People v. James, </em>132 A.D.2d 932, 933, 518 N.Y.S.2d 266, 267 (1987)(defendant established <em>prima facie </em>case where five out of six blacks were peremptorily challenged by prosecutor, and fifty percent of his challenges were to black persons). The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s use of a disproportionate number of challenges to strike black jurors is a relevant circumstance that must be considered in assessing Jackson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The record further indicates that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney removed these three black persons virtually without questioning during <em>voir dire. See Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 97 (prosecutor\u2019s questions and statements during <em>voir dire </em>examination are relevant to determination of <em>prima facie </em>case). Furthermore, the excluded group consisted of males and females whose only apparent common characteristic was their shared race. <em>See People v. Seals, </em>153 Ill. App. 3d at 423, 505 N.E.2d at 1111 (disproportionate use of challenges coupled with lack of questions on <em>voir dire </em>established <em>prima facie </em>case). Under these circumstances, we find that Jackson satisfied the <em>Batson </em>standard for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case; accordingly, the Commonwealth was required to come forward with a neutral explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The next issue to be resolved is whether the Commonwealth articulated a racially neutral, non-pretextual reason for excluding the three black persons from the jury panel. As a preliminary matter, we agree with the Commonwealth that under <em>Batson, </em>trial court findings of fact are entitled to great deference on appeal. 476 U.S. at 98 n. 21. In the present case, however, the trial judge did little more than state a legal conclusion. The trial judge made no factual findings. Moreover, the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that members of the defendant\u2019s race were not \u201csystematically excluded\u201d is grounded in language reminiscent of the standard found in <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202 (1965). In <em>Batson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the Supreme Court \u201creject [ed] this evidentiary formulation as inconsistent with standards that have been developed since <em>Swain </em>for assessing a <em>prima facie </em>case under the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d 476 U.S. at 93. Jackson was not required to prove a systematic exclusion. If the Commonwealth \u201cexercised <em>any </em>of its strikes for a racially discriminatory reason, . . . <em>Batson </em>was violated.\u201d <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>542 A.2d at 1278. <em>Batson </em>requires the trial judge to evaluate the credibility of the asserted reasons based upon the totality of the circumstances of the case, as reflected in the record. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Slappy, </em>522 So. 2d at 22. Moreover, \u201c[t]he explanation offered for striking each black juror must be evaluated in light of the explanations offered for the prosecutor\u2019s other peremptory strikes.\u201d <em>Gamble v. State, </em>257 Ga. 325, 327, 357 S.E.2d 792, 795 (1987). The trial judge cannot merely accept at face value the reasons proffered but must independently evaluate those reasons as he would any disputed fact. <em>Slappy, </em>522 So. 2d at 22. Rubber stamp approval of all nonracial explanations will not satisfy the command of <em>Batson. </em>476 U.S. at 97-98; <em>Stanley, </em>542 A.2d at 1281 <em>(Batson </em>implicitly requires inquiry into legitimacy of reasons). The record must contain findings by the trial judge, not just a conclusion, in order to facilitate both the initial inquiry and appellate review. <em>Stanley, </em>542 A.2d at 1277; <em>see generally </em>Note, <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky and the Prosecutorial Peremptory Challenge: Arbitrary and Capricious Equal </em>Protection?, 74 Va. L. Rev. 811 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Under <em>Batson, </em>although the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s explanations need not rise to the level justifying challenge for cause, 476 U.S. at 97, they must be clear, reasonably specific, and related to the particular case to be tried. <em>Id. </em>at 98 n.20 (citing <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981)). In the present case, when requested by the trial judge to articulate his reasons for striking the three black jurors, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney initially stated, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth could have struck even more blacks,\u201d and that \u201c[rjace had absolutely nothing to do with any. . . .\u201d Finally, after some prompting, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cI struck Mr. Sammy McQueen who looked to be about the same age as the defendant\u201d and \u201c[t]he addresses, Judge, was [the] next consideration on those other two [jurors].\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s initial statement is simply nonresponsive to the trial judge\u2019s request. The second statement constitutes a general denial of discriminatory motive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>which is insufficient to rebut a <em>prima facie </em>showing of purposeful discrimination. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98; <em>Taitano, </em>4 Va. App. at 346, 358 S.E.2d at 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the explanations relating to a juror\u2019s age or address are specific, racially neutral considerations. Further, the Commonwealth argues that such considerations were held sufficient to rebut the defendant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>showing in <em>Taitano, 4 </em>Va. App. at 347, 358 S.E.2d at 592-93. This argument, however, misses the mark. It is not enough for the Commonwealth, in rebutting the defendant\u2019s case, to adopt rote \u201cneutral explanations\u201d which are only facially legitimate. <em>Stanley, </em>542 A.2d at 1281. If this were sufficient, the <em>Batson </em>inquiry would amount to little more than a charade. In <em>Taitano, </em>a panel of this Court held that the Commonwealth provided affirmative support for the asserted reasons and demonstrated as well specific relationships between the reasons proffered and the facts of the case. 4 Va. App. at 345, 358 S.E.2d at 591. By contrast, the record in this case simply contains the bare allegation that the jurors\u2019 ages and addresses were \u201cconsiderations,\u201d without an explanation why these facts were significant or how they related to the facts of this particular case. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s observation that McQueen \u201clooked to be about the same age as defendant\u201d amounts to nothing more than a conclusory allegation. ^Defense counsel responded by disputing the assertion that McQueen and the defendant were the same age. The trial judge made no finding concerning the relative ages of McQueen, the defendant, and other persons who were not struck from the jury, nor did the trial judge inquire further or make findings concerning the relevance of the age factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">As to the addresses, although the jury list does contain the jurors\u2019 addresses, the record does not disclose the defendant\u2019s address. Further, the Commonwealth did not articulate in what respect the addresses were relevant \u2014 whether due to their proximity to Jackson\u2019s address, the scene of the crime, or the scene of the arrest. <em>See Garrett </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>815 F.2d 509, 513 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>108 S.Ct. 233 (1987)(prosecutor\u2019s blanket assertion that three black jurors lacked \u201cbackground education and knowledge\u201d insufficient where unsupported by record). Significant too is the fact that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney did not question any of the jurors concerning their ages or addresses on <em>voir dire, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>yet he chose to exclude the three black members on this basis. <em>See People </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>42 Cal. 3d 711, 727, 726 P.2d 102, 111, 230 Cal. Rptr. 656, 665, (1986)(prosecutor\u2019s failure to engage black prospective jurors in more than desultory <em>voir dire </em>is a factor supporting inference of group bias). The trial court\u2019s immediate acceptance of these explanations at face value without inquiry into the ages or addresses of jurors who were and were not challenged, and without inquiring as to the relevance of those circumstances to the case, undermine the conclusion that the challenges were not discriminatory. <em>Id. </em>at 727-28, 726 P.2d at 112, 230 Cal. Rptr. at 666. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney did not \u201carticulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98. Furthermore, the explanations were vague enough that they \u201c \u2018demanded further inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Turner, </em>42 Cal. 3d at 728, 726 P.2d at 112, 230 Cal. Rptr. at 666 (quoting <em>People v. Hall, </em>672 P.2d 854, 858, 197 Cal. Rptr. 71, 76 (1983)). This record does not contain a factual basis to support the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s explanations and the trial judge\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In sum, we find that Jackson met his burden in establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination even though two blacks remained on the jury panel. <em>Accord United States v. Clemons, </em>843 F.2d at 747; <em>State </em>v. <em>Slappy, </em>522 So. 2d at 24; <em>People v. Seals, </em>153 Ill. App. 3d at 423, 505 N.E.2d at 1111. We further find that the Commonwealth\u2019s asserted reasons were insufficient to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>case. The conviction is therefore reversed and the case remanded for a new trial before a properly selected jury. <em>Gamble </em>v. <em>State, </em>257 Ga. at 330, 357 S.E.2d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Cole, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b213-8\">Baker, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The majority characterizes the prosecutor\u2019s statements as \u201cconclusory.\u201d I respectfully disagree. The prosecutor stated his reasons for using his strikes as he did and they were clear and uncontradicted by any evidence in this record. The prosecutor was the only person who could make the neutral explanation required by <em>Batson </em>and while it would have been a simple matter to have contested his statements had they not been true, Jackson made no proffer of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>We were instructed by the panel which granted this appeal to determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor did not systematically strike three members of the black race from the jury. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I am of opinion that the trial court could reasonably infer from the prosecutor\u2019s explanation that the Commonwealth\u2019s reason for exercising its peremptory strikes was that those prospective jurors might be acquainted with Jackson, his family or his friends. <em>See Taitano v. Common</em>wealth., 4 Va. App. 342, 346, 358 S.E.2d 590, 592 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">On this record, I cannot say that the judgment of the trial court was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Accordingly, I would affirm its judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
