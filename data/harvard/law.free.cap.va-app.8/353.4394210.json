We conclude that the defendant\u2019s physical appearance was sufficient evidence that he was over eighteen years of age. However, since the trial court did not rely on the defendant\u2019s physical appearance but instead relied on documents which were not evidence, we must reverse and remand the proceeding for a new trial. The defendant also argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove he wrote the letter which was the basis for his indictment and that the Commonwealth failed to establish his knowledge of the girl\u2019s age. We disagree with both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">While the defendant was an inmate at the Augusta County Jail, a twelve year old girl received a letter proposing sexual acts to her, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370. The letter had the defendant\u2019s return address.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">At trial, the defendant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence because the Commonwealth failed to introduce evidence that the defendant was over eighteen. The trial court denied the motion, and the defendant offered no evidence but again contended in his closing argument that the Commonwealth had failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>to prove that he was over eighteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge responded, saying: \u201c[T]he court . . . has several senses it can use, including that of sight. And this man looks like he\u2019s well beyond that.\u201d He then added, however, that he was \u201cnot relying on that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Instead, the trial judge relied on the official documents in the court\u2019s file which, he said, had been \u201cworked up in this court and also in the district court where he had a preliminary hearing.\u201d These documents included a fingerprint form containing the defendant\u2019s signature and a birth date of \u201c8/15/41\u201d and a uniform summons containing the same birth date. While apparently not relying on it, the trial judge also referred to a statement by the defendant that he was forty-five years of age. The defendant made this statement during the court\u2019s pretrial examination of him prior to accepting the defendant\u2019s plea. Neither the documents in the court\u2019s file nor the defendant\u2019s pretrial statement were offered or received into evidence. Thus, the only admitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s age which the trial court could have considered was his physical appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It is generally recognized that a defendant\u2019s physical appearance may be considered by a jury in determining his or her age. <em>Nebraska v. Lauritsen, </em>199 Neb. 816,__, 261 N.W.2d 755, 757 (1978); <em>see also State </em>v. <em>Richey, </em>_ W.Va. _, _, 298 S.E.2d 879, 888 (1982). Some courts, however, require other evidence of the defendant\u2019s age in addition to his appearance, <em>see, e.g., Nebraska </em>v. <em>Lauritsen, </em>199 Neb. at _, 261 N.W.2d at 757, when \u201cthe record does not reflect that the person whose age must be proved falls into a marked extreme.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pittman, </em>25 Mass. App. 25,_, 514 N.E.2d 857, 859 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Wigmore does not qualify the rule by requiring corroborating evidence of age in addition to physical appearance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">Experience teaches us that corporal appearances are approximately an index of the <em>age </em>of their bearer, particularly for the marked extremes of old age and youth. In every case such evidence should be accepted and weighed for what it may be worth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">2 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 222 (Chadbourn rev. 1970); <em>see also Wig-more, supra </em>at \u00a7 1154. In a related context Wigmore repudiates the suggestion that a fact finder\u2019s view should be \u201cexcluded as a method of proof because it is impossible to transmit to the higher court of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1168. He points out that in a like manner a \u201cwitness\u2019 countenance, tone of voice, mode and manner of expression, and general demeanor on the stand\u201d are also not transmittable on appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">When considered together these authorities provide an integrated rule: when proof is required that a person is above or below a given age, physical appearance may be considered as proof of that fact. If a criminal defendant\u2019s physical appearance indicates an age well above that required to be proven and the trial court determines that the fact finder is able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt from the defendant\u2019s physical appearance that he exceeds the age required to be proven, then the defendant\u2019s physical appearance alone is sufficient evidence of his age, and the fact finder may resolve that issue based only on the defendant\u2019s physical appearance. However, in less obvious cases, where the defendant\u2019s physical appearance does not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that his age exceeds that required, then physical appearance alone is insufficient evidence of his age and must be corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The physical appearance of the defendant in this case, according to the comments of the trial judge, was sufficient as a matter of law to determine that the defendant was over eighteen years old. The trial court did not err, therefore, in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">However, the trial court did not rely on the defendant\u2019s physical appearance for that determination but relied instead on documents not admitted into evidence. We cannot say that this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>harmless error. Although the trial judge found that the defendant\u2019s physical appearance was sufficient as a matter of law to present a factual issue, as the finder of fact he relied on matters not in evidence. We cannot conclude from this record that the trial judge would have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s physical appearance sufficiently proved the age requirement. Consequently, we must reverse the conviction; however, because of the trial judge\u2019s statement on the record that the defendant\u2019s appearance was sufficient proof of age, we remand the proceedings for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Next, we address the defendant\u2019s assertion that the Commonwealth failed to prove sufficiently that he was the one who wrote the letter violating Code \u00a7 18.2-370. The letter came in an envelope with the defendant\u2019s return address on it. Moreover, one of the comments in the letter was directly responsive to a statement made in the girl\u2019s earlier letter to the defendant. We recognize that \u201cit is not enough that the writing on its face purports to be from the sender.\u201d <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 385, 389, 131 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1963). However, the circumstantial evidence showing both the defendant\u2019s return address and the responsiveness of the defendant\u2019s letter to contents of the girl\u2019s letter sufficiently establishes that the defendant sent the letter to the girl. <em>See Duncan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. <em>717, </em>727, 347 S.E.2d 539, 544-45 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Whether the Commonwealth established the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the girl\u2019s age is not an issue which requires resolution on the merits. The record reveals that the defendant failed to raise this issue at trial. Therefore, since no good cause has been shown for addressing the merits, and since it is not necessary to do so to enable us to attain the ends of justice, this issue cannot now be considered as a basis for reversal. Rule 5A:18; <em>see Mounce v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 433, 435, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">For these reasons, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the proceeding for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Koontz, C.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-13\"> The defendant\u2019s motions to strike were sufficient statements of the defendant\u2019s objection and the grounds for the objection. Rule 5A: 18; <em>see also Head </em>v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 163, 167, 348 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1986). It would have been improper for the trial court to take judicial notice, as suggested in the dissent, of the defendant\u2019s age. <em>See Keesee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 174, 175, 217 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1975); <em>Sutherland v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 378, 383, 368 S.E.2d 295, 297 (1988). It would have been improper for the trial court to have taken judicial notice of the defendant\u2019s age for the first time when it announced its decision and the parties had no opportunity to object or refute the facts judicially noticed. <em>See State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>227 Va. 492, 497-98, 318 S.E.2d 393, 395 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Moon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2N\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the case should be reversed. The defense moved to strike the evidence because the Commonwealth did not introduce affirmative proof of Jewell\u2019s age. In response to the motion, the court commented that Jewell looked well over eighteen and that based upon documents in the file Jewell\u2019s birthdate was August 15, 1941. As I view what happened, the court in effect reopened the case and took judicial notice of evidence tending to prove appellant\u2019s age. Therefore, the issue is not whether the evidence was sufficient but rather should be whether the court could reopen the case and take notice of the facts that it did. However, to this action there was no objection. I believe appellant should have objected to the court\u2019s action and stated his reason therefor with specificity at the trial level as required by Rule 5A:18. Had he done so, the trial court might have sustained the objection and granted the motion to strike. <em>See, e.g., </em>C. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 284 (3d ed. 1988). On the other hand, the court could have reopened the case and called for evidence of Jewell\u2019s age. Reopening the evidence would be proper and within the discretion of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">When all the testimony in the trial of a case has been concluded and the witnesses for the respective parties have been excused from their attendance upon court, whether the court will allow the introduction of other testimony is a question addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, \u201cand unless it affirmatively appears that this discretion has been abused, this court will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-7\"><em>Williams </em>v. Commonwealth, 4 Va. App. 53, 77, 354 S.E.2d 79, 92 (1987) (quoting <em>Mundy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1049, 1065, 171 S.E.2d 691, 696 (1933)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Because there was no objection to the court\u2019s action, I would affirm the judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
