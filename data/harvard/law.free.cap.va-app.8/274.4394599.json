The father\u2019s employer, arguing that a putative father\u2019s pre-birth acknowledgement of an illegitimate child may not establish dependency under Code \u00a7 65.1-66(3), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>contends that the commission erred in awarding benefits for the child. The employer also contends that, since the deputy commissioner found the child\u2019s mother unworthy of belief, the commission wrongly found that the evidence was sufficient to establish parentage and acknowledgement of the child. We conclude that a putative father\u2019s pre-birth acknowledgement of an illegitimate child may establish a child\u2019s dependency for purposes of awarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We further conclude that credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that the worker acknowledged the child as his own prior to the worker\u2019s death and prior to the child\u2019s birth, thus establishing dependency under Code \u00a7 65.1-66(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The worker was killed in a compensable accident while working for the employer. The worker was twenty-four years of age and unmarried. The child whose dependency is at issue was born three days after his death. The child\u2019s mother asserted a claim on behalf of the child but the deputy commissioner denied the claim on the ground that the evidence did not establish that the worker was the child\u2019s father. The full commission disagreed, reversed the deputy commissioner and made an award on the child\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">A child under the age of eighteen is conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent upon a parent for purposes of an award of compensation. Code \u00a7 65.1-66(3). Such a \u201cchild\u201d includes \u201ca posthumous child,\u201d and \u201can acknowledged illegitimate child.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-66. The only test for paternity under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is \u201cthe requirement of acknowledgement by the decedent.\u201d <em>Allstate Messenger Service v. James, </em>220 Va. 910, 911, 266 S.E.2d 86, 87 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">This statutory language is clear and unambiguous. A \u201cchild\u201d as described in the statute includes both \u201ca posthumous child\u201d and an \u201cacknowledged illegitimate child.\u201d The child in this case is both a posthumous child and an acknowledged illegitimate child. The legislature did not express an intention to exclude a child that fell into both categories; instead, the terms are mutually inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Since the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, judicial construction is not necessary. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). The general rules of statutory construction do not apply, and we may not \u201cresort to legislative history and extrinsic facts\u201d to interpret words whose meaning is clear. <em>Id. </em>We must \u201ctake the words as written\u201d and give them their plain meaning. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">An interpretation of the statute that would exclude an illegitimate child would violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. <em>See Weber </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>406 U.S. 164, 165 (1972). Under a state workers\u2019 compensation act, a posthumous, illegitimate child may not be denied benefits which a legitimate child would receive. <em>Id. </em>Since the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides benefits for a posthumous child, this provision must be construed to include a posthumous, illegitimate child; to rule otherwise would violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Most jurisdictions have held that the terms \u201cposthumous child\u201d or \u201cposthumous children\u201d described as a dependent class in workers\u2019 compensation laws include posthumous, illegitimate children. <em>S.L.W. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bd., </em>490 P.2d 42, 46 (Alaska 1971); <em>Ezell-Titterton, Inc. </em>v. <em>A.K.F., </em>234 So. 2d 360, 365 (Fla. 1970); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>110 Ga. App. 23, \u2014, 137 S.E.2d 549, 550 (1964); <em>American Mutual Liability Co. v. Hogan, </em>91 Ga. App. 891, _, 87 S.E.2d 661, 664 (1955); <em>Hooley </em>v. <em>Hooley, </em>141 Ind. App. 101, 105, 226 N.E.2d 344, 346 (1967); <em>Green v. Burch, </em>164 Kan. 348,_, 189 P.2d 892, 898 (1948); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Susino Construction Co., </em>130 N.J.L. 418, _, 33 A.2d 607, 609 (1943); <em>Kluss v. Levene\u2019s Son, Inc., </em>55 N.Y.S.2d 108, 109, 269 A.D. 801, 802 (1946); <em>Westinghouse Elec. Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., </em>39 Pa. Cmwlth. 42,_, 394 A.2d 1071, 1073 (1978); <em>Brown v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., </em>20 Pa. Cmwlth. 330, 342, 342 A.2d 134, 136 (1975); <em>Shelley </em>v. <em>Central Woodwork, Inc., </em>207 Tenn. 411, _, 340 S.W.2d 896, 898 (Tenn. 1960). The few contrary decisions are not persuasive. <em>See Williams </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>237 La. 101, 105-06, 110 So. 2d 541, 543 (1959); <em>Affiliated Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>266 So. 2d 539, 540 (La. App. 1972); <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Dept. of Ind., Labor &amp; Human Rel., </em>76 Wisc.2d 595,_, 252 N.W.2d 33, 46 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>We hold that the term \u201cposthumous child\u201d referred to in Code \u00a7 65.1-66 includes an illegitimate, posthumous child. Therefore, the Industrial Commission did not err in its interpretation of the application of this provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Next, we address the commission\u2019s finding that the putative father had acknowledged the child even though the deputy commissioner had found the mother\u2019s testimony not credible. The employer directs us to the opinion of this Court that the Industrial Commission may not arbitrarily disregard \u201ca specific, recorded observation of a key witness\u2019 demeanor or appearance in relation to credibility.\u201d <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>5 Va. App. 374, 382, 363 S.E.2d 433, 437 (1987). This does not mean, however, that a deputy commissioner\u2019s finding regarding credibility necessarily binds the commission. <em>Id. </em>It means, instead, that the record must reflect a basis for a reversal of a deputy commissioner\u2019s decision that is consistent with the deputy commissioner\u2019s credibility finding. <em>Id. </em>at 383, 363 S.E.2d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In this case, the commission\u2019s opinion reversing the deputy commissioner is consistent with the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that the testimony of the child\u2019s mother was not worthy of belief. The commission expressly accepted the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that the child\u2019s mother was not credible but concluded that the remaining evidence sufficiently established that the father acknowledged the unborn child as his own and that the only evidence tending to rebut this was not sufficiently persuasive to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The deputy commissioner found that the child\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot credible, based upon observations of her appearance and demeanor and . . . findings that she gave false testimony about the decedent\u2019s residence prior to his death, and about the exclusivity of her sexual activity with the decedent.\u201d The child\u2019s mother testified that the decedent lived with her intermittently at her mother\u2019s home for approximately one year and, following that, for approximately fourteen months in her own residence prior to his death. She testified that he was the child\u2019s natural father and that he had openly acknowledged his paternity of the child. The full commission relied on the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings of credibility regarding the child\u2019s mother and disregarded her testimony in determining whether the deceased worker had acknowledged the child as his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Five other witnesses testified that the deceased worker cohabited with the child\u2019s mother during the time the child was conceived and that he had acknowledged the unborn child as his own. Three of the witnesses, the deceased worker\u2019s mother and her two daughters, were considered adverse to the claim on behalf of the child since an award for the child would have precluded an award to the deceased worker\u2019s mother. Nevertheless, these witnesses confirmed that the deceased worker cohabited with the child\u2019s mother, and they acknowledged conduct expressing their own familial interest in the child following his birth. The two other witnesses, friends of the child\u2019s mother, also testified that the deceased worker had lived with the child\u2019s mother during the time the child was conceived and had acknowledged his paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The rebuttal evidence consisted of two men who testified that they had engaged in sexual relations with the child\u2019s mother during the time of conception, although the child\u2019s mother denied this. The commission concluded that, even if their testimony were accepted, it established only \u201cthe possibility that two other men had access to [the child\u2019s mother] during the time the infant claimant was conceived . . . .\u201d It further reasoned that this only raised a possibility that the deceased worker and the other five witnesses may have been mistaken as to the actual paternity and that this possibility \u201cstanding alone\u201d was insufficient to justify denial of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Therefore, even when the testimony of the child\u2019s mother is disregarded, there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that the deceased worker acknowledged the unborn child as his own. Under our standard of review these factual findings are conclusive and binding on this Court. Code \u00a7 65.1-98; <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Watson, </em>219 Va. 830, 833, 252 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1979); <em>Russell Loungewear v. Gray, </em>2 Va. App. 90, 92, 341 S.E.2d 824, 825 (1986). Furthermore, the probative weight the commission gave the conflicting testimony is similarly within its province and not subject to our review. <em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Marvin, </em>1 Va. App. 435, 439, 339 S.E.2d 570, 572 (1986). Therefore, the commission\u2019s factual finding did not conflict with the deputy commissioner\u2019s view of the testimony of the child\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In summary, we hold that an illegitimate, posthumous child is a dependent under Code \u00a7 65.1-66(3) who is entitled to benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Furthermore, the commission\u2019s decision awarding compensation was not inconsistent with the deputy commissioner\u2019s finding that the child\u2019s mother was not credible; therefore, the commission did not arbitrarily disregard the deputy\u2019s finding. For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Baker, J., and Cole, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> The worker\u2019s mother also asserted a claim on her own behalf, alleging that she was a parent in destitute circumstances. A parent in such circumstances may be conclusively presumed to be dependent upon the deceased employee for support if there is no other total dependent. Code \u00a7 65.1-66(4). The deputy commissioner denied the claim of the worker\u2019s mother on the ground that she was not desitute, and the full commission affirmed this finding. The worker\u2019s mother did not appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
