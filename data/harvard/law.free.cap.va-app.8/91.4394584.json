The appellant contends, in effect, that <em>Ake </em>overrides Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 by requiring the appointment of a psychiatrist to assist the defendant in the preparation of an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Following Funk\u2019s arrest for rape, and after defense counsel made a preliminary showing that sanity at the time of the alleged offense would likely be a substantial issue, the trial court ordered that a psychiatric evaluation be conducted at Central State Hospital to determine Funk\u2019s mental state at time of the offense. Dr. Arthur Centor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a staff clinical psychologist at Central State, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the primary mental health professional who conducted the examination and evaluation and testified at trial. Over a two day period he personally interviewed, examined and conducted psychological testing of Funk. Dr. Centor indicated the total time spent in the evaluation was three hours and ten minutes, during which time he administered the Bender Gestalt test to determine organicity or brain damage affecting intellectual functioning and the Rorschach, or ink blot test, to determine the existence of any type of psychopathology. Dr. Ryan, a staff psychiatrist at Central State, also examined Funk for an unspecified time and consulted with Dr. Centor in the evaluation. Dr. Centor and Dr. Ryan had the benefit of an EEG administered to Funk by a neurologist and a physical examination by a medical doctor. Dr. Centor reported to defense counsel his findings that in his professional opinion Funk was sane at the time of the offense. The report to defense counsel did not inform him that other mental health professionals had participated in the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">After receiving Dr. Center\u2019s report, Funk requested that the trial court appoint a psychiatrist to evaluate him as required by <em>Ake. </em>The trial court initially granted the motion and ordered that Funk be examined by a psychiatrist. When the examination had not been performed the trial court denied the request for another continuance four days before trial, ruling that the <em>Ake </em>decision did not conflict with Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5 which authorized clinical psychologists to perform sanity at the time of offense evaluations. The court also ruled that even if <em>Ake </em>does require that a psychiatrist perform the evaluation, one had been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Phillip Edward Funk was convicted by a jury of rape and sentenced to twenty years in the penitentiary. On appeal, Funk asserts that his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the due process clause of the constitution was denied by the trial court\u2019s refusal to provide him with a competent psychiatrist to assist in his defense. Funk urges that <em>Ake </em>requires that once it appears that an indigent defendant\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense will be a significant factor at the trial, the court <em>must </em>provide him at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense a competent psychiatrist to assist in preparing and presenting his insanity defense. Since the trial court provided him with a clinical psychologist rather than a psychiatrist, Funk contends that the trial court infringed his constitutional right as defined in <em>Ake. </em>Alternatively, Funk contends that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>abused its discretion when, after ordering an examination by a psychiatrist, the court vacated its order, and denied him a continuance to obtain another evaluation, ruling that he had been afforded the psychiatric assistance required by law. We find no reversible error and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Ake </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. at 68, construed the constitutional due process guarantee as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">[W]hen a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Funk urges us to interpret the <em>Ake </em>decision in a manner that would, in effect, entitle an indigent defendant, upon a proper showing, to a comprehensive examination by a partisan psychiatrist who will assume an adversarial role and who will provide to an accused any available and plausible insanity defense. This is so because, not only is Funk objecting to not being provided a psychiatrist, but also objecting to having been examined and evaluated by a number of mental health professionals at Central State Hospital. Like other courts and Legislatures, we do not believe <em>Ake </em>paints with so broad a stroke. We do not construe <em>Ake </em>to limit the mental health professionals who are qualified to provide the flood of assistance envisioned in that opinion to medical doctors with a specialty in psychiatry. Although Justice Marshall, writing for the majority in <em>Ake, </em>repeatedly refers only to \u201cpsychiatrists\u201d and \u201cpsychiatric assistance,\u201d we think it clear that he uses those terms in a broad, generic sense, not intending to exclude other mental health professionals who are competent and qualified by education and training to make insanity evaluations. Justice Marshall\u2019s description of psychiatric experts is sufficiently broad to include all mental health professionals who by education and training are competent \u201cto identify the elusive and often deceptive symptoms of insanity\u201d and who can translate those findings into meaningful information for courts and juries in deciding legal in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>sanity or other relevant issues involving mental states. <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 80 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Prior to the <em>Ake </em>decision, various interdisciplinary studies in forensic psychiatry concluded that clinical psychologists, who are trained in forensic evaluations, are qualified and competent to evaluate a person\u2019s sanity at the time of an offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3The Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards, approved by the American Bar Association in August 1984, recommended that courts require psychiatrists <em>or clinical psychologists </em>or other designated mental health professionals who have received forensic training as the only professionals authorized to conduct insanity at the time of offense evaluations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Also, before <em>Ake, </em>the Virginia General Assembly, based on studies which concluded that clinical psychologists were competent mental health professionals to conduct forensic evaluations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provided in Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A), as enacted in 1983, that such evaluations \u201cbe performed by at least one psychiatrist or psychologist with a doctorate degree in clinical psychology who is qualified by training and experience to perform such evaluations.\u201d Following <em>Ake, </em>the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A) in 1986 to include designated mental health experts who met certain educational and licensing or registration requirements provided they were \u201cqualified by specialized training and experience to perform forensic evaluations.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>After the <em>Ake </em>decision, the Virginia Supreme Court has also recognized that <em>Ake </em>was not so broad as to recognize \u201ca constitutional right [for an indigent] to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own,\u201d <em>Gray v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 329, 356 S.E.2d 157, 166, <em>cert. denied, </em>108 S. Ct. 207 (1987) (quoting <em>Ake, </em>470 U.S. at 83). Likewise, the court has held that an indigent has no constitutional right \u201cto shop around\u201d at state expense until he receives a favorable report or a doctor willing to assist him. <em>Pruett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 266, 276, 351 S.E.2d 1, 7 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>107 S. Ct. 3220 (1987).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Considering the interdisciplinary studies and trends prior to the <em>Ake </em>decision, and the legislative and judicial responses since, we conclude that the Supreme Court did not intend to restrict to psychiatrists those mental health professionals who could perform evaluations of insanity at time of the offense. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court correctly ruled that the examination and evaluation of Funk by Dr. Cent\u00f3r and the mental health professionals at Central State Hospital satisfied the requirements of both Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A) and the due process requirements defined in <em>Ake.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Funk also claims that the trial judge abused his discretion in denying a continuance to obtain a second evaluation by a psychiatrist. The record reveals that the motion judge who ordered a second evaluation by a psychiatrist did so only because defense counsel prevailed in his argument that <em>Ake </em>required that a psychiatrist rather than a clinical psychologist was required in order to satisfy the due process requirements. Four days before trial, the trial court ruled that Funk had received an evaluation by mental health professionals which satisfied the statutory requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5(A) and the constitutional due process requirements. Funk was not entitled to further assistance at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense other than to have available at trial those witnesses to testify about their findings relevant to his sanity defense. Anything further would be an act of \u201cjudicial grace.\u201d <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. at 329, 356 S.E.2d at 166. Thus, the trial court provided Funk with \u201call that he was constitutionally or statutorily entitled to\u201d receive under <em>Ake </em>and Code \u00a7 19.2-169.5. <em>See Pruett, </em>232 Va. at 276, 351 S.E.2d at 7. Funk presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>through Dr. Centor the evidence on his mental state which was available. He does not contend that a continuance was necessary to enable him to further develop his insanity defense through Dr. Centor or the other mental health experts who had examined him. We find no abuse of discretion in denying a continuance since Funk was not entitled to receive an additional evaluation by a psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Barrow, J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b118-12\"> The Virginia Supreme Court said of Dr. Centor\u2019s qualifications to testify on sanity issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-13\">Edmonds objected at trial to the expert qualifications of Dr. Arthur Centor, a forensic psychologist and licensed clinical psychologist with a professional practice spanning 30 years, and on appeal \u201crenews that objection ... for the record.\u201d We approved of Dr. Centor\u2019s qualification as an expert witness in 1966, <em>Rollins </em>v.
