We conclude that earnings used in calculating an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d include earnings from non-covered employment; thus, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The employee, in addition to working twenty hours a week in a cleaning crew for the employer, did housecleaning for individual homeowners. She worked four hours per day for thirteen individual homeowners. The employer agrees that the work performed by the worker in the individual homes was similar to the work she performed for the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d consist of earnings \u201cin the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-6(A)(1). The employer agrees that this definition includes an employee\u2019s combined earnings from similar services for more than one \u201ccovered\u201d employer. <em>See Cottrell </em>v. <em>Hawthorne Aviation, Inc., </em>56 O.I.C. 71, 73 (1975); <em>cf. Hudson </em>v. <em>Arthur Treachers, </em>2 Va. App. 323, 326, 343 S.E.2d 97, 99 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>We conclude that an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d also include an employee\u2019s earnings from similar services for employment not covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Since the language of the applicable statute is clear and unambiguous, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-6, there is no need for further judicial construction. <em>Brown v. Lukhard, 229 </em>Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). The plain meaning of the statute requires that all earnings from employment, whether covered or not, should be included in determining the average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">This view is consistent with the legislative intent expressed in other language in the statute. The statute also provides that \u201cfor exceptional reasons . . . such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to as will most nearly approximate the <em>amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury. </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-6(A)(2) (emphasis added.) The amount this injured employee would have been earning were it not for the injury includes both covered and non-covered employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The provision in the Act excluding coverage for domestic servants, Code \u00a7 65.1-28, does not affect the determination of a covered employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wages.\u201d This provision does not define what earnings are to be included in determining the average weekly wage of a covered employee. Instead, it defines what type of employers and employees are covered by the terms of the Act. Moreover, the statutory definition of \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d does not incorporate an exclusion for domestic employees. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-6. Therefore, the determination of average weekly wages is controlled by Code \u00a7 65.1-6 and not by the provision defining who is covered by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The employer relies on language in <em>Faulkner v. Industrial Commission, </em>71 Ariz. 76, 223 P.2d 905 (1940), and argues that the employer and its carrier will be at risk for other employers which it qannot control or monitor and which have not paid premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance. This risk is no different than it would be if the employment were covered under the Act. The employer would have no greater ability to know about, to control or to monitor an employment in another covered employment than it would in non-covered employment. The payment of premiums for workers\u2019 compensation insurance by another employer does not benefit this employer; therefore, the lack of pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>ment of such premiums by a non-covered employer also does not affect this employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Counsel for the employer has argued that the employee was an independent contractor while working as a domestic servant and for this reason her earnings in that endeavor should not be included in determining her average weekly wage. However, this issue was not addressed in the appellant\u2019s brief, and we will not now consider it. <em>See Rogers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>170 Va. 417, 421, 196 S.E. 586, 588 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Finally, the employer contends that the burden of proof was on the employee and that the \u201ctone\u201d of the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion suggests that the burden rested on the employer. We do not read the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion as placing the burden of proof on the employer. More importantly, the commission\u2019s opinion did not do so. Since there was credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s determination of the worker\u2019s average weekly wage, the commission\u2019s decision must be affirmed. <em>See Dublin Garment Co. </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>2 Va. App. 165, 167, 342 S.E.2d 638, 638 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">For these reasons the award of the commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Duff, J., and Keenan, J., concurrred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
