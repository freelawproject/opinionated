Hope (appellant) alleges first, that the evidence was insufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on either charge, and second, that the trial court erroneously permitted the Commonwealth to introduce into evidence a gun found at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>scene of his apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The uncontradicted evidence is that at approximately 3:00 a.m. on April 30, 1987, the Henrico police responded to an activated burglar alarm at Eastgate Mall where, upon their arrival, they discovered that someone had broken into the mall through a skylight. Entry into Morton\u2019s Jewelry (Morton\u2019s) store, located inside the mall, had been gained by smashing the entrance door. Eighteen thousand dollars worth of watches and chains was stolen by smashing the glass cases which had displayed them. On the same day, approximately five hours later, Henrico County Investigator Williams received a call from an informant advising him that two black males, one of whom was named Mayfield (appellant\u2019s first name), were offering some stolen jewelry for sale and could be reached by calling a beeper number, leaving a number for callback, and adding two zeros at the end of this number for code purposes. After checking with his police department and learning the details of the theft from Morton\u2019s, at approximately 6:00 p.m. Williams called the beeper number and left his phone number and the code. Within two or three minutes a male who gave his name as \u201cHensley\u201d returned the call and told Williams that \u201cHensley,\u201d driving a gray Monte Carlo, would meet him in the parking lot of the Azalea Mall at 8:30 p.m. that same night. Special police forces were placed at the Azalea Mall to intercept \u201cHensley\u201d after the purchase was made, as well as to act as a \u201cback-up\u201d for Williams. Williams made contact with \u201cHensley,\u201d who drove up in a Monte Carlo with appellant seated in the passenger seat. Williams had been given $2,100 by police officials to make the buy, all of which had been photostated for identification purposes before he received it. When \u201cHensley\u201d approached Williams\u2019 car Williams told \u201cHensley\u201d he would deal only with one of them. \u201cHensley\u201d directed appellant to drive the Monte Carlo behind Williams\u2019 car and wait. \u201cHensley\u201d then went to the Monte Carlo, reached down toward the floorboard, picked up a blue-gray sports bag which contained the stolen watches and brought it to Williams, where they negotiated a sale of seventy-nine watches for $2,000. Among the watches purchased were Nicolet watches, which were sold exclusively by Morton\u2019s. When the sale was consummated \u201cHensley\u201d returned to his car and Williams drove off, giving a prearranged signal to the waiting police, who then closed in on the Monte Carlo. Seeing the police cars, appellant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u201cHensley\u201d abandoned their vehicle and attempted on foot to evade the police. An examination of the abandoned Monte Carlo revealed a beeper over the sun visor and the gym bag which had contained the stolen jewelry. The gym bag was found on the floorboard in front of the seat on which appellant was sitting as they drove off after the sale. Williams made an in-court demonstration proving that the beeper number was the one he had called.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Officer Russell ran after appellant, who fled into nearby woods. Appellant fell once but arose and continued to flee; however, after falling again he was apprehended and arrested at approximately 8:40 p.m. When returning from the place of arrest one of the officers found a loaded gun at the place where appellant had first fallen. After being arrested, appellant three times falsely stated his name to the police. While searching appellant, the police found $1,000 (one-half of the sale price for the stolen watches) in one of his pockets. The money found on appellant was identified as the money given to Williams to purchase the stolen jewelry. The remaining purchase money was found in the area where codefendant, later identified as Yves Henley, the driver of the Monte Carlo, was arrested. In addition to the money found in appellant\u2019s pocket, seven gold chains, identified as the same brand<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as those stolen from Morton\u2019s, were removed from around appellant\u2019s neck and one was removed from his mouth. Twenty watches and various items of jewelry, including a display container, were in the gym bag found in the Monte Carlo. One hundred watches had been stolen; seventy-nine watches were purchased by Williams and twenty were found in the bag, all of which were identified as having been taken from Morton\u2019s at the time of the break-in. There was no evidence presented to contradict any of the foregoing evidence, and all of the events described above occurred in less than a twenty-four hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In determining the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal of a conviction, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 502, 505, 297 S.E.2d 711, 713 (1982); <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 609, 612-13, 212 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1975). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The verdict of the trial court will not be disturbed unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Possession of property recently stolen is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of guilt of the crime of larceny, and throws upon the accused the burden of accounting for that possession. <em>Fout </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 184, 191, 98 S.E.2d 817, 821-22 (1957). No such account is disclosed by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Guilt of breaking and entering a building may be established by circumstantial evidence; eyewitnesses are not required. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 98 S.E.2d at 821. Appellant does not dispute that there was proof of a breaking and entering at Morton\u2019s and that goods were stolen from the store. The evidence supports an inference that both the breaking and entering and the larceny were committed at the same time, by the same person, as a part of the same criminal enterprise. When combined with proof that the stolen property was found in appellant\u2019s possession soon thereafter, a <em>prima facie </em>case of appellant\u2019s guilt of breaking and entering was established. <em>Guynn </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 478, 480, 259 S.E.2d 822, 823-24 (1979). No evidence was presented by appellant to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>case created by the evidence. We conclude from our examination of the record that the jury reasonably could have concluded from the evidence that appellant was a perpetrator of the breaking and entering and theft. The evidence sufficiently supports appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Over appellant\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted into evidence the gun and bullets contained therein which were found at the place appellant fell while attempting to avoid arrest. At trial, the ground for appellant\u2019s objection to the gun\u2019s admissibility was stated to be that \u201cthere is nothing to connect this man [appellant] with the pistol . . . they are not going to be able to tie this gun, the gun, to this man ... it is highly prejudicial to introduce it ... it makes him look like a criminal... I don\u2019t think we tied it to him.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s objection was based on the assertion that the Commonwealth had not \u201ctied\u201d the gun to appellant, while on appeal he limits his claim to an assertion that the \u201cintroduction of the gun was irrelevant and should not have been admitted.\u201d Rule 5A:18 requires that to save a point for appeal a party must make his objection at the time the evidence is offered, and state the specific grounds of the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Assuming without deciding that appellant preserved his objection, we find that the gun and bullets were properly admitted for the jury\u2019s consideration. Our review of the record discloses that to support the convictions the Commonwealth relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, which is as acceptable as direct evidence to prove guilt. <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1029 (1981). In all cases based on circumstantial evidence of guilt the <em>conduct </em>of the accused is an important factor in the estimate of the weight of circumstances which point to his guilt. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 882, 887, 147 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1966); see <em>also Bowie </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 381, 391, 35 S.E.2d 345, 349-50 (1945). In cases based on circumstantial evidence of guilt the Virginia Supreme Court has said that relevant evidence is any evidence which may throw light upon the matter being investigated, and while a single circumstance, standing alone, may appear to be immaterial or irrelevant, it frequently happens that the combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion. <em>Peoples </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 692, 704, 137 S.E. 603, 606 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">In <em>Bowie, </em>the Supreme Court of Virginia reaffirmed that evidence of flight may be considered as evidence of guilt along with other pertinent facts and circumstances. <em>Bowie, </em>184 Va. at 392, 35 S.E.2d at 350. The flight need not immediately follow the commission of. the crime since the defendant may be suspected and become aware of the suspicion at a later date. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>237 Md. 97, 105, 205 A.2d 254, 259 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>382 U.S. 945 (1965); 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 211 (13th ed. 1972). Thus, the acts or conduct of the defendant after the crime, which are not elements of the crimes charged, are admissible because they may tend to show a \u201cconsciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 692, 696, 111 S.E. 101, 102 (1922); <em>see also </em>20 Am. Jur. <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 291. In such cases, the defendant has no right to sanitize the evidence. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>104 Me. 394, 71 A. 1092 (1908). In <em>Lambert, </em>defendant was indicted for larceny and when arrested was found to be armed with a loaded pistol. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">There was no apparent occasion for any legitimate use of the revolver by the defendant that day, and, if it was not loaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and carried for the purpose of aiding him to escape . . . the defendant had full opportunity to explain for what purpose he did have it. \u201cIt is to-day universally conceded,\u201d says Mr. Wigmore, \u201cthat the fact of an accused\u2019s flight, escape from custody, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.\u201d The possession of the tools suitable for effecting an escape is also deemed an incriminating fact which may go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 397, 71 A. at 1093; <em>see State v. Davis, </em>535 S.W.2d 259, 260 (Mo. App. 1976); <em>Rodgers v. Texas, </em>468 S.W.2d 438, 440 (Tex. Crim. App. 1971). Trial judges are permitted wide discretion in determining whether to admit evidence such as is objected to here. We find no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Even if we found that it was error to have admitted the gun, we would find that such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Out of the imperative demands of common sense has grown the doctrine of harmless error. <em>See Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>151 Va. 533, 541, 145 S.E. 307, 309 (1928). Code \u00a7 8.01-678 provides that when it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be reversed for any error committed at trial. This statute evinces legislative approval of the doctrine of harmless error. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Standard Paint Co. v. E. K. Vietor &amp; Co., </em>120 Va. 595, 610, 91 S.E. 752, 757 (1917), appellate courts should not reverse for trial error unless injury is shown; such injury is not presumed but must affirmatively appear from the record. <em>See also Fenner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>152 Va. 1014, 1028-29, 148 S.E. 821, 825-26 (1929) (injury must be shown to have resulted from the alleged error). \u201cAppellate courts sit to correct substantial rather than fanciful errors.\u201d <em>Waynick </em>v. <em>Walrond, </em>155 Va. 400, 412, 154 S.E. 522, 525 (1930). To warrant a reversal the errors must be substantial; otherwise, litigation would be interminable. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>154 Va. 832, 852-53, 152 S.E. 547, 554 (1930); <em>Oliver, </em>151 Va. at 541, 145 S.E. at 309. The rule established by the Virginia Supreme Court is that error in a criminal case will require reversal of a conviction unless the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 21-22 (1967). That test is met where other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>of guilt is overwhelming. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 490, 495, 237 S.E.2d 791, 793 (1977). We conclude that even if it was error to admit the gun, and even if appellant had made the specific objection that he argues here, the evidence otherwise is so overwhelming of appellant\u2019s guilt that its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Appellant did not argue that the admission of the gun may have caused the jury to set an excessive punishment. He was sentenced to fifteen years on each charge, five years less on each charge than he could have received. The evidence disclosed the use of a beeper system to make contact with prospective purchasers of stolen property and indicates a well organized and sophisticated operation. Nothing in this record suggests that the sentence was excessive nor is there evidence to indicate that it was likely that a lesser sentence would have been imposed if the gun had not been introduced. Appellant offered no evidence in mitigation or excuse for his acts. We find no cause to disturb the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Accordingly, finding no error and for the reasons stated, the judgment of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Cole, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-7\"> Strict proof of the identity of the stolen articles is not required where the possession is unexplained and recent. <em>See Cook </em>v. Commonwealth, 214 Va. 686, 204 S.E.2d 252 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b524-9\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The Commonwealth established sufficient facts and circumstances which, if believed by the jury, could have supported the burglary and larceny convictions. However, for no legitimate reason apparent on this record, the Commonwealth offered and was allowed to place before the jury a gun that had no proven relationship to those offenses. The gun was found in a field near the place where the defendant fell as he fled when an undercover policeman attempted to purchase the stolen goods almost twenty-four hours following the burglary. No evidence connects the gun to the defendant or to the commission of the burglary and larceny offenses. I believe that it was prejudicial error to admit the gun as evidence, and that this error is grounds for reversing the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Inexplicably, the majority <em>sua sponte </em>invokes Rule 5A:18. The Commonwealth has neither alleged nor argued that this issue is barred by Rule 5A:18. The Commonwealth obviously has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>sought to bar the issue precisely because defense counsel properly preserved the issue before us. The objection was sufficient to alert the trial judge to the questions of possession, relevance, and prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">[Defense Counsel] Judge, I think there is nothing to connect this man with the pistol there. We are not dealing with any armed robbery, and they are not going to be able to tie this gun, the gun, to this man, other than that. I think it is highly prejudicial to introduce it. It goes back, it makes him look like a criminal, when we are not dealing with armed robbery or anything of that nature. I don\u2019t think we tied it to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">THE COURT: I am going to let it go to the jury, Mr. Maddox, for whatever they want to determine, and your objection is noted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">I can perceive no valid basis for raising the spectre of Rule 5A;18.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The Commonwealth made no showing of the relevance of the gun to proof of the larceny or burglary. In admitting the evidence \u201cfor whatever [the jurors] want to determine,\u201d the trial judge made no determination that the gun was relevant to the charges. It is established in our jurisprudence that there are evidentiary limits beyond which the Commonwealth may not proceed in attempting to obtain a conviction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Evidence which has no tendency to prove guilt, but only serves to prejudice an accused, should be excluded on the ground of lack of relevancy. For evidence to be admissible it must relate and be confined to the matters in issue and tend to prove an offense or be pertinent thereto. Evidence of collateral facts or those incapable of affording any reasonable presumption or inference on matters in issue, because too remote or irrelevant, cannot be accepted in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-10\"><em>Bunting </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 309, 314, 157 S.E.2d 204, 208 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of prosecution was based upon a presumption of theft arising from the defendant\u2019s unexplained possession of recently stolen property. Not only did the Common<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>wealth fail to establish that the defendant possessed the gun, but the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence establishes that the gun had \u201cno causal relation or logical and natural connection with the guilt of the defendant and [was] irrelevant and immaterial to the charges against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once the gun was admitted in evidence, the Commonwealth then proved that the gun was \u201ca six shot [and] was loaded.\u201d The only probative value of evidence that a loaded gun was found at a place in the field where the defendant fell was to create an inference in the minds of the jurors that the defendant possessed the gun and was therefore a dangerous criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The evidence thus served the dual purpose of allowing the Commonwealth to prove at once criminal propensity and bad character. It has long been established that \u201cevidence that the defendant has committed an unrelated crime is inadmissible against him.\u201d <em>King v. </em>Commonwealth, 217 Va. 912, 914, 234 S.E.2d 67, 69 (1977) (In a prosecution for attempted rape, evidence that the defendant was planning to use cocaine was inadmissible). Moreover, just as \u201c[a] defendant introducing mitigating evidence at the guilt phase of a trial may be found to have put his character in issue,\u201d <em>Duncan v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 342, 346, 343 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1986), the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of aggravating evidence has likewise put the defendant\u2019s character in issue. However, the Commonwealth may not put in issue the character of a defendant unless that defendant first makes his character an issue on his behalf. <em>Fields v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 300, 305-06, 343 S.E.2d 379, 382 (1986); <em>Weimer v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 47, 52, 360 S.E.2d 381, 383 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">It is also abundantly clear from the record that the Commonwealth used the loaded gun to urge the jury to levy a stiff sentence on the defendant. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney argued to the jury in closing argument that this was not a \u201cminor\u201d case but rather was \u201ca different kind of case\u201d because the defendant possessed a loaded firearm. Evidence in aggravation of punishment is not admissible prior to a determination of guilt. <em>See McClain </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 847, 861, 55 S.E.2d 49, 56 (1949); <em>see also Peterson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 289, 298, 302 S.E.2d 520, 526 (1983) (by statute evidence in aggravation is admissible in capital murder cases but only in the penalty stage). The defendant \u201cshall be adjudged guilty only on evidence admissible on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that issue.\u201d <em>McClain, </em>189 Va. at 861, 55 S.E.2d at 56. The sole purpose of seeking admission of the gun into evidence was to prove an aggravating factor unrelated to proof of the charged offense. It was inadmissible before the jury for that purpose. <em>Cf. Duncan, </em>2 Va. App. at 346-47, 343 S.E.2d at 395 (evidence of mitigating factors \u201cwas relevant only to the issue of punishment\u201d and was not appropriate \u201cevidence before the jury in mitigation of punishment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The gun was collateral to the issue of guilt and was not probative of any offense for which the defendant was being tried. \u201c[T]he evidence elicited by the Commonwealth was prejudicial in that the implications it raised tended to divert the minds of the jurors from the issues before them.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 497, 501, 303 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1983). \u201c[T]he error in admitting the evidence could have affected the [guilt] verdict [as well as the sentence], thereby denying [the defendant] the fair and impartial trial to which he was entitled.\u201d <em>King, </em>217 Va. at 915, 234 S.E.2d at 69. Accordingly, I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
