Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">James\u2019 employment as an ironworker with Capitol Steel commenced August 14, 1984. Two months later, James suffered a compensable injury to the left knee during a slip and fall incident. He was awarded temporary total disability benefits. In 1986, Dr. William Fortune, James\u2019 treating physician for the knee injury, informed Capitol Steel\u2019s insurance carrier that James\u2019 knee injury left him partially disabled, and, as a result, James would not be able to return to his regular employment. Dr. Fortune recommended that James begin vocational rehabilitation pursuing light work options. In a \u201cWork Capabilities Assessment\u201d report that was sent to Rehabilitative Services and Vocational Placement, Inc., Dr. Fortune indicated that James was capable of only sedentary work which did not require heavy lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">In addition to the compensable knee injury, James also suffers from other unrelated ailments which pre-date both his industrial accident and his employment with Capitol Steel. As a result of a laryngectomy in 1976, James speaks with difficulty through a small opening in his throat. A medical report which was submitted to the commission stated that James \u201chas to be very careful in that he free breathes and this is a common source of infection for him. He therefor [sic] cannot be around a lot of people. . . .\u201d James also suffers from hypertension, which he has had since 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Delores Margeson, a rehabilitation counselor, met with James on June 17, 1987. Her notes from this first meeting reveal that James informed her that he was receiving Social Security Disability benefits and that he was \u201cofficially retired.\u201d Margeson offered James job applications for a position at the V.A. Hospital and for the food service contractor at the National Rehabilitation Hospital. James refused to accept the applications and made it clear that he was not planning to work. He also failed to attend any subsequently scheduled meetings and eventually ceased all communication with Margeson.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Capitol Steel filed an application with the Industrial Commission requesting suspension of James\u2019 compensation benefits due to his refusal to cooperate with rehabilitation efforts as required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.1-88. At a hearing held before the deputy commissioner, James testified that the rehabilitation specialist had failed to consider all of his ailments in seeking suitable work for him. In response to inquiries whether he had informed Margeson of his other physical disabilities, James testified, \u201cNobody would listen to me. Last time she talked to me I told her I was retired.\u201d After reviewing the evidence, the deputy commissioner found that James \u201cis poorly motivated to return to work and is apparently little-interested in securing even sedentary work suitable to his condition.\u201d Payment of compensation was suspended until James cured his refusal to cooperate. On review, the full commission affirmed the decision and also found that James\u2019 offer at the hearing to cooperate with rehabilitation efforts was not sufficient to cure his refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Factual findings of the Industrial Commission will be upheld on appeal if supported by credible evidence. <em>Ivey v. Puckett Constr. Co., 230 </em>Va. 486, 488, 338 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1986). To support a finding of refusal of selective employment \u201cthe record must disclose (1) a <em>bona fide </em>job offer suitable to the employee\u2019s capacity; (2) [a job offer that was] procured for the employee by the employer; and (3) an unjustified refusal by the employee to accept the job.\u201d <em>Ellerson </em>v. <em>W.O. Grubb Steel Erection Co., </em>1 Va. App. 97, 98, 335 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1985); <em>also </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-63; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>City of Clifton Forge, 7 </em>Va. App. 538, 545, 375 S.E.2d 540, 544-45 (1989). Moreover, an employee\u2019s unjustified refusal to cooperate with placement efforts of the employer is tantamount to an unjustified refusal of selective employment under Code \u00a7 65.1-63. <em>Johnson, 7 </em>Va. App. at 547, 375 S.E.2d at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">James argues that he was under no obligation to cooperate with Margeson and that in view of his preexisting ailments, his refusal to do so was justified because the rehabilitation efforts were not within his residual capacity. The commission specifically held that <em>American Furniture Co. </em>v. <em>Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 334 S.E.2d 548 (1985), precluded consideration of James\u2019 other physical limitations in assessing whether his refusal to cooperate was unjustified. We do not read <em>Doane </em>to be as sweeping in its application as does the commission. In <em>Doane, </em>the claimant suffered an injury which was unrelated to employment and which occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>after claimant was disabled and unemployed. Due to that injury, the claimant argued that the selective employment was unsuitable. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]n employer ... is absolved of liability for compensation if the employee refuses selective employment because of a physical condition unrelated to the original industrial accident <em>and arising since the accident\u00e9 Doane, </em>230 Va. at 43, 334 S.E.2d at 550 (emphasis added). In this case, however, the circumstance relied upon to advance the claim that the job was unsuitable was a condition which pre-existed both the compensable injury by accident and James\u2019 employment with Capitol Steel. Neither the explicit language of <em>Doane </em>nor the beneficent purpose of the act, <em>see Burlington Mills Corp. </em>v. <em>Hagood, 177 </em>Va. 204, 211, 13 S.E.2d 291, 293 (1941), compels the conclusion that employment suitable to the employee\u2019s residual capacity does not require consideration of a condition which pre-existed the injury by accident and which was obvious to the employer when the employee was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u201c[Ejmployment \u2018suitable to [the employee\u2019s] capacity\u2019 means employment within the employee\u2019s residual capacity resulting from the industrial accident.\u201d <em>Doane, </em>230 Va. at 42, 334 S.E.2d at 550. Obviously, a component of the determination of residual capacity is the characteristic of the employee prior to the injury by accident. \u201cUnder the Virginia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, the employer takes the employee as he is. . . .\u201d <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Colonial Mechanical Corp., </em>3 Va. App. 408, 414, 350 S.E.2d 225, 228 (1986) (quoting <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>49 O.I.C 144, 147 (1967)). Having employed James with his obvious preexisting condition which causes him to speak with difficulty through a small opening in his throat, the employer cannot now be heard to claim that James\u2019 condition is not to be considered in determining his current residual capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Having made these observations, we conclude, however, that based on the facts of this case the issue of James\u2019 pre-existing condition is not dispositive. Although James asserts that Margeson failed to consider his pre-existing physical condition in her job search efforts, rendering her efforts \u201cunreasonable,\u201d the evidence in the record is to the contrary. Margeson testified that she used Dr. Fortune\u2019s Work Capacities Assessment as a guideline in her job search efforts on behalf of James. She initiated job development in accordance with Dr. Fortune\u2019s recommendations and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>strictions. James admitted at the hearing that Dr. Fortune was fully aware of all his physical limitations. He cannot now be heard to suggest that Dr. Fortune did not take into account his entire physical condition in encouraging vocational rehabilitation. Furthermore, Margeson\u2019s records suggest that she considered James\u2019 laryngectomy in her job search efforts. In one of her progress reports, Margeson observed that she located a sedentary job for James as a dispatcher but rejected it because \u201cit is difficult to understand Mr. James when he talks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The deputy commissioner found that James unjustifiably refused to cooperate with the employer\u2019s rehabilitation efforts. The commission also found that James told Margeson that he was unable to work and that he had retired. The record in this case contains abundant credible evidence in support of these findings. In the first scheduled meeting with Margeson which James attended, he informed Margeson that he was receiving Social Security and was \u201cofficially retired.\u201d James also refused to accept two job applications from Margeson at that time. Although Margeson scheduled five subsequent meetings with James, he failed to attend any of these meetings. In phone calls to James designed to encourage attendance at these meetings, Margeson testified that James reportedly told her \u201cthat he understood that [Margeson] had to do [her] job, but that, as he had told [her] before, he was not going to participate in the job search.\u201d Thereafter, James refused to accept Margeson\u2019s certified letters. At the hearing, James stipulated to the factual accuracy of Margeson\u2019s notes and fully acknowledged that he had failed to attend the scheduled meetings, stating only that he was \u201cnot able to work\u201d and \u201cwas retired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">James\u2019 refusal to meet with Margeson in order to discuss his work options, experience, and limitations frustrated her job search efforts in his behalf. This evidence establishes that James\u2019 unconditional rejection of Margeson\u2019s efforts demonstrated an unwillingness on his part to cooperate with rehabilitation efforts. James\u2019 unilateral action thwarted Capitol Steel\u2019s efforts to secure employment within James\u2019 residual capacity. <em>See Klate Holt Co. v. Holt, </em>229 Va. 544, 547, 331 S.E.2d 446, 448 (1985). Thus, the commission did not err in concluding that James refused to cooperate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>with reasonable rehabilitation efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The commission\u2019s determination that James\u2019 offer to cure his unjustified refusal was insufficient is also supported by credible evidence. Assuming that the refusal to cooperate with vocational rehabilitation could be cured by a verbal statement of willingness to cooperate, the commission could nevertheless find James\u2019 testimony at the hearing insufficient to cure the refusal. In order for a cure of a refusal to be effective it must be made in good faith. <em>See Thompson </em>v. <em>Hampton </em>Institute, 3 Va. App. 668, 671, 353 S.E.2d 316, 317 (1987). In response to his counsel\u2019s question whether he was presently willing to work with the rehabilitation counselor, James testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">A. It\u2019s like I said, what they gonna find for me to do. I\u2019m not educated. Sometimes I can\u2019t get around \u2014 what are they gonna find for me to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">Q. Mr. James, are you willing to work with them if they can find something you can do? If they take into consideration all your disabilities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">A. If they can find that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">Q. Are you saying yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-11\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-13\">A. If they can find that,. . . .find. . . . somebody. . . .you know. . . .my. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-14\">Q. Mr. James, have you always been willing to work with them to find something that you could do if they would take into consideration all of your disabilities if they were able to find something, were you willing always to work with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-15\">A. I\u2019m a realistic man. I believe in facing the facts. Whatever I\u2019ve told you I\u2019ve faced the fact that I\u2019m retired. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">The deputy commissioner, who observed the appearance and demeanor of the claimant, was in the best position to judge from James\u2019 verbal and nonverbal responses to these questions whether his offer to cure was made in good faith. The determinations of the deputy and full commission on this issue will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of the Industrial Commission is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Barrow, J., and Keenan, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
