For the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>sons that follow, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Frank and Gary Boothe were guests at Long\u2019s home in Botetourt County. The testimony is in conflict concerning the events that gave rise to the prosecution. According to the Boothe brothers, Long invited them over to smoke marijuana and promised to provide gasoline for their pick-up truck because the drive was approximately twenty miles each way. Long testified, however, that he invited the Boothes to his property to deer hunt. Long also testified that he only promised to allow the Boothes the opportunity to siphon gas from a neighbor\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">After they arrived at the Long residence, the Boothes drove to a nearby convenience store with Long and purchased two quarts of beer. When they returned to the residence, an altercation developed between Long and Gary Boothe over the gasoline. Gary Boothe testified that he objected to the plan to steal the gasoline and was angry with Long for having lured him such a long distance under \u201cfalse pretenses.\u201d Long was less specific concerning the reason the argument began; however, he did recall Gary Boothe making a comment about \u201cfalse pretenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The argument soon developed into a fist fight. Gary Boothe admitted that he \u201cprobably\u201d hit Long first. Frank Boothe stood some fifteen feet away and was not involved in the fight. At some point in the fight, Long yelled to his wife to call the police and broke free from Gary Boothe. Long went twenty feet to a spot where his pitbull terrier was chained. According to the testimony of Gary and Frank Boothe, Long unchained the dog, pointed at Gary, and said \u201cSic him, Dozer. Kill.\u201d The dog attacked Frank Boothe, instead, biting his leg. As the dog released Frank Boothe\u2019s leg and started off toward Gary Boothe and Long, who had resumed fighting, Frank Boothe grabbed the dog\u2019s collar. Frank Boothe testified that the dog bit him on the wrist before he was finally able to pin the dog between his legs. He kept the dog\u2019s head pressed to the ground, until Long called the dog. Long denied that he commanded the dog to attack or that he said, \u201ckill.\u201d He said that the dog slipped from his grasp when he and Gary Boothe resumed the scuffle.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Long also testified that Gary Boothe was armed with a shotgun and threatened Long\u2019s wife with the gun when she came out of the residence in response to the commotion. Long\u2019s wife testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>that Gary Boothe pointed a rifle at her. Long also testified that Gary Boothe hit him in the chest with the butt of the shotgun. The Boothe brothers denied possessing a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">After Long regained control of the dog, the two brothers got into their vehicle and began to leave the property. In the meantime, Deputy Dave Mullins of the Botetourt County Sheriff s Department arrived to investigate the calls from Long\u2019s wife. He stopped the Boothe\u2019s pick-up truck in the driveway. While Mullins waited for the rescue squad to arrive, he conducted a cursory \u201cplain view\u201d inspection of the truck and the area around the truck. He saw no guns. The Boothes told him that they did not have a gun. No gun was found on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">At the conclusion of all the evidence, the trial judge stated he believed the Boothe brothers\u2019 version of the incident. The trial judge convicted Long of malicious wounding and sentenced him to a suspended term of five years in the penitentiary and to three years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-51 proscribes the infliction of bodily injury upon another \u201cby any means.\u201d The statute, by its explicit terms, does not contain a limitation upon the means employed. Indeed, the focus of the established \u201ctest of the offense of maliciously . . . causing bodily injury is the intent with which the result is accomplished rather than the nature of the means. ...\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 55, 63, 41 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1947). We disagree, therefore, with Long\u2019s contention that, absent proof that the dog was trained to attack or vicious, the conviction of malicious wounding must be reversed. Because the statute specifies \u201cany means,\u201d the Commonwealth was not constrained to prove that the method Long used to cause bodily harm was inherently dangerous. <em>See id:, Fletcher </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 636, 639-40, 166 S.E.2d 269, 272-73 (1969) (assault with hands or feet will suffice as \u201cmeans\u201d provided the requisite intent is established). Once the Commonwealth established a basis upon which the trier of fact could have reasonably inferred that Long intended to command the dog to attack, the character of the dog was not relevant to the proof of \u201cmeans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In assessing the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction, \u201cit is our duty to consider [the evidence] in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give [the evidence] all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). We also are aided in our assessment of the evidence in this case by the trial judge\u2019s statement at the conclusion of the trial that he weighed the conflicting evidence in favor of the testimony of the Boothes. <em>See Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>142 Va. 639, 640-41, 128 S.E. 456, 456 (1925). With these principles as our guide, we conclude that the evidence established malice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">Malice inheres in the doing of a wrongful act intentionally, or without just cause or excuse, or as a result of ill will. It may be directly evidenced by words, or inferred from acts and conduct which necesarily [sic] result in injury. Its existence is a question of fact to be determined by [the trier of fact].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em>Dawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. at 61, 41 S.E.2d at 503. Long\u2019s conduct in releasing his dog while saying, \u201csic him, Dozer. Kill!,\u201d evinced ill will sufficient to constitute malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Moreover, Long\u2019s actions and command to the dog establish that Long intended that his dog would \u201cmaim, disfigure, disable, or kill\u201d his adversary. Code \u00a7 18.2-51. \u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind which may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case.\u201d <em>Ridley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 834, 836, 252 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1979). Intent may be shown by a person\u2019s conduct and by his statements. <em>Hargrove </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 436, 437, 201 S.E.2d 597, 598 (1974). That the dog attacked and wounded the brother who was not involved in the fray neither diminishes the maliciousness of the act nor negates the intent. <em>See Riddick v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 244, 248, 308 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1983) (\u201cif an accused shoots at another intending to kill him, and a third person is killed because of the act, that same intent follows the bullet and is transferred to the killing of the third person, even if such death was accidental or unintentional\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">Finally, the evidence revealed that Long had broken away from the fray, was distant from the combat, and was no longer defending himself when he released the dog. Although Long defended the case on the ground that he only got the dog because the Boothes threatened him and his wife with a gun and that the \u201cdog broke loose,\u201d the trial judge stated that he weighed the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>flicting evidence in favor of the testimony of the Boothes. The trial judge\u2019s determination of \u201cthe credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony are questions exclusively within the province of [the trier of fact].\u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 373, 337 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1985) (citations omitted). We cannot say as a matter of law that the trial judge erred in resolving against Long the conflicting evidence concerning the presence of guns and, thus, whether he acted in self defense when he released the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt the charge of malicious wounding and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Coleman, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b221-13\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-51 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b221-14\">If any person maliciously shoot, stab, cut, or wound any person or by any means cause him bodily injury, with the intent to maim, disfigure, disable, or kill, he shall, except where it is otherwise provided, be guilty of a Class 3 felony. If such act be done unlawfully but not maliciously, with the intent aforesaid, the offender shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
