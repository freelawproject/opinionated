J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahu\">May one who pleads guilty to accusations under two separate waivers of indictment, one charging breaking and entering a dwelling house by daytime with intent to steal <em>(N. J. S. 2A </em>:94-l, formerly <em>R. 8. </em>2:115-2), and the other larceny of personal property from the owner thereof <em>(N. </em>J. <em>S. 2A </em>:119-2, formerly <em>R. S. </em>2:145-2), be sentenced to terms of imprisonment on both, to be served consecutively ?</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The defendant signed two waivers of indictment requesting trial by the court without a jury, wherein he was charged respectively with willfully and maliciously breaking and entering the dwelling house of one Abraham Frankel with intent feloniously to steal the goods and chattels of Frankel; and the larceny of one Longine watch, one bottle of rum and cash, having a total value of $355, the property of Frankel.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>On August 12, 1948, when placed before the bar of the court to plead to the two charges, the defendant entered pleas of guilty to both. Subsequently, the court imposed a sentence of not less than five years nor more than seven years on each charge, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The defendant\u2019s application to the trial court for a correction of his sentences was, by letter opinion of the Monmouth County Court dated April 9, 1953, denied, from which denial defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The defendant contends that \u201cThe two charges were in fact one continuous criminal act, properly belonging as counts in a single indictment\u201d; that the two charges \u201cgrow out of the same transaction, yet differ in degree\u201d and, therefore, only one penalty could legally be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">A rule contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions has been firmly established in New Jersey. The identical question was discussed and decided in the case of <em>State v. Byra, </em>128 <em>N. J. L. </em>429 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1942); affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals on the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion and reported in 129 <em>N. J. L. </em>384 (1943). To indicate the controlling rule enunciated in the <em>Byra </em>case, we quote excerpts from the opinion of Mr. Justice Parker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">\u201c* * <em>* </em>But it is clear that burglary is proved on satisfactory evidence (1) of breaking and entering by night and (2) of the concomitant intent t\u00f3 commit a felony, whether that intent be carried out or not. If the \u2018felony\u2019 be in fact committed, it is a crime in itself, quite separate from the breaking and entering, and indictable as such. Hence the later practice of pleading-burglary in one count, charging -only the intent in connection with the breaking and entering, and larceny or other common law felony in a separate count. In such case there may be a conviction on either count or on both, the crimes being legally separate * * *, [citing the case of <em>Josslyn v. Commonwealth, </em>6 <em>Metc., Mass., </em>236 (1843)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">As noted in 9 <em>C. J. </em>1058, there is a lack of uniformity in the several states on this point, but we are decidedly of the view that under a count for breaking and entering with intent, the proof of the crime is complete when those two elements are shown, irrespective of whether there was a carrying out of the intent, and sentence may be pronounced accordingly; and that the actual perpetration of the larceny or other crime is no part of the offence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>of breaking and entering with intent but is a separate and distinct offence, at common law, and treated in a separate section of our Crimes Act. The former offence is denounced in <em>JR. S. </em>2:115 \u2014 1, formerly section 131 of the Crimes Act, and the latter in 2:145-2 formerly section 158 of the same act, <em>Comp. Stat. </em>1787, 1792. We consider the law in this state to be as stated in section 1062 of volume 1, <em>Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law, </em>viz., \u2018a first count may set out the breaking and entering with intent to steal, and a second may allege the larceny as a separate thing, and thereon the defendant may be convicted and sentenced for both.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>Cf. State v. Louden, </em>21 <em>N. J. Super. </em>497 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The defendant seems to be under the impression that there is a distinction between the effect of a plea of guilty voluntarily entered and a conviction by a trial on the merits.. Such a view is clearly erroneous. A conviction ensues whether one pleads guilty to the charge or is found guilty by the court or a jury as the result of a trial on the merits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cA plea of guilty, accepted and entered by the court, is a conviction or the equivalent of a conviction of the highest order, the effect of which, is to authorize the imposition of the sentence prescribed by law on a verdict of guilty of the crime sufficiently charged in the indictment or information.\u201d 14 <em>Am. Jur., Criminal Law, see. </em>272, <em>p. </em>952.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">This general rule is followed in this State as well as by textbook writers and the courts of other jurisdictions. \u201cWhich conviction may accrue two ways: either by his confessing the offence and pleading guilty; or by his being found so by the verdict of his country.\u201d 4 <em>Blackstone </em>Commentaries, c. XXVII; <em>Schireson v. State Board of Medical Examiners, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>570, 573 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1943); <em>State v. Ballard, </em>15 <em>N. J. Super. </em>417 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), affirmed 9 <em>N. J. </em>402 (1952); <em>In re Sabongy, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>334, 344 <em>(Law Div. </em>1952); <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>12 <em>Allen. </em>155, 172 <em>(Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. </em>1866); <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 <em>U. S. </em>220, 47 <em>S. Ct. </em>582, 71 <em>L. Ed. </em>1009 (1927); <em>Jenness v. State, </em>144 <em>Me. </em>40, 64 <em>A. 2d </em>184, 186 <em>(Me. Sup. Jud. Cl. </em>1949); <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Simmons, 361 <em>Pa. </em>391, 65 <em>A. 2d </em>353, 359 <em>(Sup. Cl. </em>1949); 22 <em>C. J. S., Criminal Law, </em>\u00a7 424, <em>page </em>656.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Incidentally, it appears from the briefs of the defendant and the State that subsequent to defendant\u2019s arrest and incarceration, an attempt was made by a representative of the prosecutor\u2019s office to get Compton to \u201cclear up\u201d a large number of robberies which had occurred in the county, upon an assurance to him that if he would cooperate, he would not be prosecuted as a fourth offender. Compton concedes in his brief that \u201cI indicated that I was particularly anxious to escape life imprisonment as a fourth offender under the habitual criminal act.\u201d Defendant vehemently denies his guilty participation in the so-called \u201ccrime wave.\u201d It is clear from the record that Compton was not prosecuted and convicted as a fourth offender which he might well have been, in which event a sentence of life imprisonment undoubtedly would have been imposed. While such an agreement has no binding effect upon the Court and is not looked upon favorably <em>(In re Sabongy, supra; State v. Miller, </em>16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>251, 84 <em>A. 2d </em>459 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951)), the defendant in the instant case suffered no manifest harm or injustice therefrom. Otherwise a sentence of life imprisonment might have been his misfortune.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
