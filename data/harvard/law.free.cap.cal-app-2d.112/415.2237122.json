No claim was asserted that any peace officer, the district attorney or the court had any part in the alleged representations or any knowledge of them. Petitions for habeas corpus have been heretofore filed by petitioner with various courts and have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">The present petition based solely upon alleged representations of petitioner\u2019s attorney presented no sufficient ground for granting the order sought. The appeal is without merit. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Aseltine, </em>139 Cal.App. 768 [34 P.2d 830]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Deutsch, </em>16 Cal. App.2d 121 [60 P.2d 155].)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
