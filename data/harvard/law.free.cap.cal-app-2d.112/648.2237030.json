LEON T. PAYTON, Appellant.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-10\">Eugene V. McPherson for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b666-11\">Edmund G. Brown, Attorney General, and William E. James, Deputy Attorney General, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b666-12\">DORAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO2\">This is an appeal from the judgment. Defendant was charged by information in two counts with issuing checks without sufficient funds. It was also alleged that defendant had been convicted twice before of a similar offense and had served a term therefor in the state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-13\">The trial was by the court' without a jury. The issue was by stipulation submitted on the preliminary examination transcript. The defendant admitted the two priors and the confinement in the state prison. Defendant was adjudged guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-14\">The witness Gloria Moore, a cosmetic buyer for a drug company, cashed one of the checks. The witness testified.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201cA. I questioned the cheek before I cashed it because I couldn\u2019t read the signature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t believe the check was any good, is that \u2022right? A. No, I didn\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">\u201cQ. You didn\u2019t believe it was any good? A. No, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">The other witness, Fay Henderson, a clerk in a retail store, testified with regard to the other check.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember as it was put through the bank because I spoke to the manager who O.K.\u2019d it. I refused to cash the check myself. I sent him to the manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">\u201cQ. And he O.K.\u2019d it? A. After the manager O.K.\u2019d it, I have nothing to do but do as he says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">\u201cQ. And you cashed it? A. I cashed it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">It is contended on appeal that \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain the judgment.\u201d It is argued in support thereof that the element of fraud is lacking. That, \u201cFraud implies a promise on a material matter relied upon by the person who is being defrauded and who has a right to rely upon the misrepresentation. In the present ease there was reliance by the persons defrauded but obviously they had no right to rely upon the implied representation that the cheek was good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Appellant\u2019s contention and argument lack support in the record and in the law.  As pointed out by respondent, \u201cThe intent to defraud, which admittedly is the gist of the offense, must in most cases if not in all cases, be proven by the circumstances surrounding the transaction in question. From the evidence adduced by the People, the trial court was justified in drawing the inference that the appellant intended to defraud the witness Moore and witness Henderson when he drew his checks on the dates in question and gave them to the two women with knowledge that he did not have sufficient funds in the bank.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
