DePMarmol was convicted in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County of burglary; in December, 1951, he filed in said court a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis; </em>the sole ground was claimed insufficiency of the evidence; the petition was denied and Del\u2019Marmol appealed from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The appeal is without merit.  Since the claim of insufficiency of the evidence could have been presented and reviewed on appeal, <em>coram nobis </em>does not lie. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coyle, </em>88 Cal.App.2d 967, 970 [200 P.2d 546]; People v. <em>Reid, </em>195 Cal. 249, 255 [232 P. 457, 36 A.L.R. 1435].) No excuse was offered for the long delay in filing the application.  \u201c It is well settled that a showing of diligence is prerequisite to the availability of relief by motion for <em>coram nobis.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Shorts, </em>32 Cal.2d 502, 512 [197 P.2d 330].)</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied August 21, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
