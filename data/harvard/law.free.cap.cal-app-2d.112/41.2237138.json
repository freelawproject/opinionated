This question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">This action is based on negligence and the facts pleaded do not establish a lack of due care on the part of the defendants. In <em>Mix </em>v. <em>Ingersoll Candy Co., </em>6 Cal.2d 674 [59 P.2d 144], the plaintiff attempted to state a cause of action based upon negligence, alleging facts substantially as pleaded by plaintiff herein. In that case the court held that the restaurant keeper, in the exercise of due care, was not required to serve in every instance a perfect chicken pie, in that all bones are entirely eliminated; that the customer had no right to expect such a perfect product and that it was not negligence on the part of the restaurant keeper to fail to furnish an entirely boneless chicken pie. In that case the decision of the trial court in sustaining a demurrer to the complaint was affirmed and the decision is controlling in the instant action. See, also, <em>Silva v. F. W. Woolworth Co., </em>28 Cal.App.2d 649 [83 P.2d 76].</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Barnard, P. J., and Griffin, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
