The. decedent, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>maiden lady aged about 93 years, died on January 31, 1949. The trial court found that there was no undue influence and no fraud. The appellant Helen Hough is a grandniece of Miss <em>Teeed; </em>appellant Mabel Croy is a niece; appellant Childrens Hospital is a beneficiary under the will of January 25, 1949. Contestants and respondents James Hough and Edith Pazderniek, the decedent\u2019s nephew and neice, claimed as beneficiaries under a previous will dated October 15, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Appellants\u2019 contention is that the record discloses no substantial evidence <em>\u201cto </em>show that Miss Teed had a mental sickness of such a degree that it incapacitated her from making a valid will.\u201d In regard to mental competency, it is urged that the trial court did not follow principles of law repeatedly laid down by the courts of this state, and that the \u201cuncontroverted evidence affirmatively proves the competency of the testatrix on January 25, 1949.\u201d Conversely, the respondents assert that there is substantial evidence in support of the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">It appears from the record that Ida Teed, a Columbia graduate, was a retired school teacher and had been an art instructor in the New York and Los Angeles public school systems. In August of 1948, decedent was admitted to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, then being acutely ill from a stomach hemorrhage. According to Dr. Urabec, decedent\u2019s physician, Miss Teed\u2019s condition improved after September, 1948. Likewise, an orthopedic specialist, Dr. Chappel, testified to decedent\u2019s improvement to such an extent that the patient was able to walk. On November 20, 1948, Miss Teed was discharged from the Good Samaritan Hospital and entered Longwood Manor Sanitarium where death occurred on January 31, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The respondents rely upon the principles enunciated in <em>Estate of </em>Teel, 25 Cal.2d 520 [154 P.2d 384], as follows: \u201cthe weight to be accorded to the evidence, and the province of a reviewing court, are the same in a will contest as in any other civil case. ... It is an elementary principle of law, that when a verdict is attacked as being unsupported, the power of the appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is <em>any substantial </em>evidence, contradicted or uneontradieted, which will support the conclusion reached by the jury.\u201d (Respondents\u2019 italics.) It is appellants\u2019 contention that the \u201csix items of evidence which they (respondents) contend constitute substantial evidence that Miss Teed was incompetent at the time she exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>cuted the will,\u201d do not meet the requirement of \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence, within the meaning of the above rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The items relied upon by respondents as \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence of Miss Teed\u2019s mental incompetency, comprise (1), the testimony of Jane Morgan, an acquaintance; (2) decedent\u2019s hospital chart; (3) medical testimony of Dr. J. M. Lacey; (4) testimony in response to a hypothetical question propounded to Dr. Victor Parkin, a psychiatrist; (5) previous wills executed and unexecuted by the decedent; (6) \u201cfailure of Ida Teed to know and comprehend the nature and extent of her property on January 25, 1949.\u201d A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of this evidence is essential to an understanding of the case. Unless the sum total of these items meets the above requirement, it must be assumed that the trial court\u2019s conclusion was wrong, both in fact and in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Jane Morgan testified to having known the decedent for some 18 years, visting Miss Teed periodically, the last conversation being at the sanitarium on January 20, 1949; that the witness found Miss Teed \u201cfailing rapidly\u201d; that \u201cshe would talk very fast and her breath was very short, and I was fearful she might have a heart attack, so I asked her not to talk. . . . She seemed very excited and she was trying to tell me.something but I couldn\u2019t understand her.\u201d On cross-examination it was brought out that decedent had \u201cdifficulty in enunciating,\u201d but the witness thought that \u201cif she knew what she was saying I could have got a drift of what she was trying to tell me regardless of whether she was enunciating clearly or not.\u201d When asked as to \u201cthe soundness or unsoundness of the mind of Miss Teed,\u201d the witness replied, \u201cWell, my opinion was her mind was affected. Q. That she was of unsound mind? A. Unsoundly, yes.\u201d The witness did not discuss decedent\u2019s property or relatives, and had \u201cno information with respect to her property or with respect to her relatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Decedent\u2019s hospital chart for January 24, 25 and 26, 1949, is the second item relied on as affording substantial evidence of mental incompetency. The notations for January 24, merely disclose that Miss Teed complained of various pains, was \u201cUp in chair while eating\u201d at 1:30, and shortly thereafter was \u201cReading paper\u201d; pulse was \u201cregular\u201d and \u201cunchanged,\u201d and respiration \u201cnormal.\u201d On January 25, the date when the will in question was executed, the patient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>was \u201cvery nervous at 7 a. m.; after eating breakfast complained of tightness in chest and exhaustion, \u201cwants to read but goes to sleep.\u201d At 4 p. m. the patient was \u201cmore comfortable\u2014reading. Dr. TJrabec here. Ate well\u2014visiting nurse while eating.\u201d At 6 p. m., \u201cpatient appears improved this p. m.\u201d According to the chart, \u201cMr. Olson &amp; Mr. Martin\u201d (attorneys) were there after decedent finished lunch at 1 p. m., at which time, according to the attorneys\u2019 testimony, the will was executed after Miss Teed had read and discussed the will, \u201cexpressed her desires,\u201d and had remarked, \u201cThis Will will certainly make my relatives mad.\u201d The chart indicates that on January 26, the patient was complaining, uncomfortable and nervous, and had \u201ca poor day.\u201d The chart contains no notations concerning Miss Teed\u2019s mental condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">According to respondents\u2019 brief, \u201cThe testimony of Dr. J. M. Lacey definitely shows that decedent was of unsound mind January 25, 1949.\u201d The witness, a physician of 25 years\u2019 experience, specializing in \u201cinternal medicine diagnosing,\u201d with six months\u2019 experience in a psychiatric hospital, first met Miss Teed two years before death; had seen decedent professionally on two occasions in September, 1948, at Good Samaritan Hospital, spending a total of approximately two or three hours with the patient. Dr. Lacey gave the patient\u2019s history as including gastrointestinal hemorrhage prior to entering the hospital and a stroke of paralysis about September 1, 1948, with a high degree of arteriosclerosis. Dr. Lacey stated that Miss Teed \u201cseemed to be very much of a crotchety old lady. She was 93 years old, and nothing would please her,\u201d and then expressed an opinion \u201cthat anyone with a history that she had . . . never does recover their mental equilibrium, so that their judgment is worth anything.\u201d With this basis, the physician concluded that when the will was executed, Miss Teed \u201cwas of unsound mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The fourth item of evidence alleged to constitute substantial proof of Miss Teed\u2019s incompetency is the testimony of Dr. Victor Parkin, a psychiatrist, who had never seen the patient. In response to a hypothetical question, the witness expressed an opinion that Miss Teed \u201cwas so far mentally enfeebled as to be of unsound mind.\u201d On cross-examination, in answer to the question, \u201cAnd to make a sound psychiatric judgment of an individual some personal observation of that individual should be made . . . ?\u201d the witness replied, \u201cIt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>is always desirable to form your own opinion from your observations and examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Dr. Parkin was read a statement written by decedent on December 13, 1948, saying, \u201cI am going to re-read Toynbee. In fact I have to read it several times to get the most out of it . Toynbee\u2019s or rather, the inferences from his book, are just what today thoughtful people are fearing. ... I just opened Churchill\u2019s book you just sent me, and there is the same idea\u2014a warning that our present civilization is in peril. That\u2019s what I get from Toynbee. It is not a thought to raise one\u2019s spirits.\u201d In answer to the question, \u201cWould you state the author of that statement was of unsound mind, Doctor,\u201d the witness responded, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Former wills and proposed wills of the decedent, \u201cin sharp contrast\u201d to the will in question, make up the fifth proposed item. In this connection respondents refer to <em>Estate of Mullen, </em>8 Cal.App.2d 684, 686 [47 P.2d 746] where it is held that \u201cA previously executed testamentary writing, conflicting with the propounded instrument, executed voluntarily and while decedent had recognized mental capacity, is an evidentiary fact from which undue influence or unsoundness of mind at the time of the later writing might be inferred, there being no explanatory facts.\u201d Appellants have commented on the fact that \u201cThe case is not in point for ... in the case at bar there was a very great deal of evidence introduced as to why Miss Teed changed her will and made a bequest to the Childrens Hospital. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Respondents\u2019 sixth and last \u201citem of substantial evidence,\u201d claimed to support the trial court\u2019s finding of incompetence, is \u201cthe failure of Ida Teed to know and comprehend the nature and extent of her property on January 25, 1949.\u201d According to appellants\u2019 brief, \u201cThe - argument appears to be this, that since Miss Teed used a layman\u2019s words \u2018personal property\u2019 when she meant \u2018personal effects\u2019 this is substantial evidence that Miss Teed was incompetent on the day she executed the will in question. Merely to state the proposition is to answer it. Proponents\u2019 argument is addressed to the construction of the will, not to the competency of the testatrix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Since, according to the well established rule as expressed in <em>Estate of Teel, </em>25 Cal.2d 520 [154 P.2d 384], hereinbefore mentioned, \u201cthe power of the appellate court begins .and ends with a determination of whether there is any <em>sub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number><em>stantial </em>evidence to support the conclusion\u201d that the testatrix was of unsound mind at the time of executing the will in question, it becomes necessary to consider the meaning of the italicized word \u201csubstantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Webster\u2019s International Dictionary defines the word as follows: \u2018 \u2018 Consisting of, pertaining to, of the nature of or being, substance, existing as a substance; material.\u201d Its meaning is further defined as \u201cnot seeming or imaginary, not illusive, real, true; important, essential, material, having good substance; strong, stout, solid, firm.\u201d  The word means \u201cconsiderable in amount, value or the like; firmly established, solidly based.\u201d Synonyms are \u201ctangible, bodily, corporeal, actual, sturdy, stable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201cSubstantial evidence,\u201d according to Words and Phrases, Fifth Series, page 564, where many definitions are collected, is evidence \u201cwhich, if true, has probative force on the issues.\u201d It is more than \u201ca mere scintilla,\u201d and the term means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable man might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d citing <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>National Labor Relations Board, </em>305 U.S. 197 [59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed 126].  To preclude a reviewing court from disturbing a verdict, it is essential that the supporting evidence be \u201csuch as will convince reasonable men who will not reasonably differ as to whether evidence establishes plaintiff\u2019s ease,\u201d quoting from <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>97 Mont. 1 [33 P.2d 262].  And as said in <em>Missouri Pac. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>195 Ark. 414 [113 S.W.2d 489], \u201cimprobable conclusions drawn in favor of a party litigant through the sanction of a jury\u2019s verdict will not be sustained where testimony is at variance with physical facts and repugnance is material and self-evident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The sum total of the above definitions is that, if the word \u201csubstantial\u201d means anything at all, it clearly implies that such evidence must be of ponderable legal significance. Obviously the word cannot be deemed synonymous with \u201cany\u201d evidence. It must be reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value; it must actually be \u201csubstantial\u201d proof of the essentials which the law requires in a particular case. Applying the foregoing definitions, and having regard for the well established legal standards of testamentary capacity, it cannot justly be said that the trial court\u2019s conclusion to the effect that Miss Teed was mentally incompetent, is supported either by law or by \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence. To sanction such a conclusion herein would in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>amount to a judicial pronouncement that old age with its accompanying disabilities is an almost insurmountable obstacle to the execution of a valid will. Such is not the law either in this state or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The rule of testamentary capacity is well stated in the recent ease of <em>Estate of Lingenfelter, </em>38 Cal.2d 571, 581 [241 P.2d 990] (March 14, 1952), where the Supreme Court says: \u201cThe most that can be drawn from all the accounts of her conduct is that she was ill, weak, highly nervous and excitable, and prone to violent outbursts of neurotic temper. The acts which led certain witnesses to express the opinion that she was of unsound mind has no bearing upon her testamentary capacity.\u201d  The court then quotes from <em>Estate of Perkins, </em>195 Cal. 699, 703 [235 P. 45], as follows: \u201cevery mental departure from the normal will not destroy a testamentary disposition. . . . Mental derangement sufficient to invalidate a will must be insanity in one of two forms: (1) insanity of such broad character as to establish mental incompetency generally, or (2) some specific and narrower form of insanity under which the testator is the victim of some hallucination or delusion. The evidence must establish that the will itself was the creature or product of such hallucination or delusion; that the hallucination or delusion bore directly upon and influenced the creation and terms of the testamentary instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Particularly applicable to the instant case is the following quotation from the same opinion: \u20181 Testamentary capacity cannot be destroyed by showing a few isolated acts, foibles, idiosyncrasies, moral or mental irregularities or departures from the normal unless they directly bear upon and have influenced the testamentary act.\u201d  At most, the alleged supporting evidence relied upon by respondents merely presents an ordinary, clinical picture of a very old lady, beset with various physical ills. This, under the rule just stated, is insufficient to disqualify a testatrix from testamentary disposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">idly,\u201d and unable to enunciate clearly, and thought the The witness Jane Morgan found Miss Teed \u201cfailing rap-patient\u2019s mind \u201cwas affected.\u201d Dr. Lacey characterized the patient as a \u201ccrotchety old lady\u201d whom \u201cnothing would please,\u201d and opined that \u201canyone with a history that she had . . . never does recover their mental equilibrium.\u201d Dr. Lacey admittedly had no personal knowledge of Miss Teed\u2019s condition since in September,- 1948, several months before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>the will was made, at which time the doctor had seen the patient on two occasions. Dr. Parkin, who had never seen decedent, was confronted with Miss Teed\u2019s letter, written December 13, 1948, and containing an intelligent discussion of books by Toynbee and Churchill. In answer to the question, \u201cWould you say that the author of that statement (Miss Teed) was of unsound mind?\u201d, stated, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like it to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The hospital chart makes no mention of any mental unsoundness or of any facts from which such an inference might be drawn. On the contrary it particularly notes that although nervous and uncomfortable, on the day the will was made, Miss Teed was able to read, visit with a nurse, and to confer with attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The other items of evidence relied upon as showing ineompetency, namely, former wills making other dispositions of property, and Miss Teed\u2019s use of certain language in the will here in question, add nothing to the sum total so far as proving any mental disqualification. The very purpose of making a new will, in most instances, is to effect a change in disposition of testator\u2019s property.  Also, the use of nonlegal terms in testamentary instruments casts no slur upon a testator\u2019s competency even though a court may later be called upon to interpret such terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">A survey of the entire record indicates that only by the use of conjecture and surmise, or by effecting a complete change in the law of testamentary capacity, can the judgment be sustained. So far as opinion evidence is concerned, it is fundamental that without some substantial basis therefor, a lay opinion is without value. Likewise, the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the most profound expert proves nothing except it finds support upon some adequate foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The record is full of letters from Miss Teed bearing dates all the way from October 28, 1948, to a week before death, in which are intelligently discussed all sorts of business, financial, social and other matters with a definiteness and understanding apparently well above average. Such matters as tax returns, trust distribution, accounts and bookkeeping, receive such attention as could only come from a keen, intelligent mind. Testimony of the two attorneys who prepared the last will indicates that the testatrix read and fully understood the document, and understandingly said, \u201cMr. Olson, this will make my relatives mad,\u201d which the present litigation proves to have been a correct prophesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>As hereinbefore indicated, the present inquiry involves not only the matter of \u201csubstantial\u201d evidence, but more important still, the correct law of testamentary capacity. That the courts of this state have shown no tendency towards restricting or altering the long established rule is evidenced by the recent case of <em>Estate of </em>Lingenfelter, 38 Cal.2d 571 [241 P.2d 990], hereinbefore mentioned. Neither in that case, nor in any other, can expression of law be discovered which can be legitimately construed as disqualifying the testatrix herein.  The presumption is that a testatrix is competent, and substantial evidence other than guesswork and general conjecture should be required to rebut such presumption. Such evidence does not appear in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Even though testatrix had reached the age of 93 years, was sielc, feeble and failing, and even though the patient had a history of arteriosclerosis and other concomitants of old age, the same rule exists. As said in appellant Childrens Hospital\u2019s brief, \u201cGiving respondents the benefit of every legitimate inference possible from the record, the fact stands out that they have not brought the case within the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
