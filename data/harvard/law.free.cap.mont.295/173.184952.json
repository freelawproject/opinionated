The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reversed the Department\u2019s decision that Dwight E. Dahl, doing business as Big Sky Concrete, and Big Sky Concrete, Inc. (collectively referred to as \u201cDahl\u201d), were uninsured employers under \u00a7 39-71-501, MCA (1993). We reverse the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">\u00b62 We address two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">\u00b63 1. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err in concluding that \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), allowed an employer to have a separate entity procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employees?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00b64 2. Did the Department\u2019s hearings officer err in determining that the workers at issue were Dahl\u2019s employees under the 1993 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b65 After many years of involvement in the concrete business in various capacities, Dahl started his own concrete business in Great Falls, Montana, in July of 1993. Dahl lacked business, accounting and general bookkeeping skills. As a result, he contracted with Olsten\u2019s Temporary Services (Olsten), a temporary service contractor, to provide him with concrete workers and to issue the workers\u2019 payroll checks, pay employer and employee taxes, and provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Dahl began obtaining workers from Olsten in July of 1993 and ceased doing so in November of 1993. Dahl again utilized Olsten\u2019s services from March through August of 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b66 Olsten considered the workers supplied to Dahl to be Olsten employees. Dahl paid Olsten once a week for its services. When Dahl expressed concern about workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Olsten assured him that the workers were properly insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b67 In August of 1994, the UEF audited Dahl for compliance with the workers\u2019 compensation insurance requirements. After completing its audit, the UEF concluded that Dahl was the actual employer of the workers provided by Olsten, that the proper entity was not insuring the workers, and that Dahl could not continue to operate with the employees until he was in full compliance with workers\u2019 compensation insurance requirements. The UEF informed Dahl of its conclusions via a letter which also informed Dahl that he could request a contested case hearing to challenge the UEF\u2019s determinations and that the UEF would issue a cease and desist order if Dahl did not request a contested case hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b68 Dahl discontinued his business on receipt of the UEF\u2019s letter and notified the Department that he desired to contest the UEF\u2019s determinations. Not realizing that Dahl had ceased operations and was contesting its conclusions, the UEF issued a cease and desist order. Thereafter, a Department hearings officer held a contested case hearing. The hearings officer found that Olsten provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the workers that it provided to Dahl but concluded that nine of the eleven workers were Dahl\u2019s employees rather than \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993). Thus, the hearings officer implicitly concluded that Dahl was an uninsured employer because he had not complied with the provisions of \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u00b69 Dahl petitioned the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for judicial review. Dahl argued that the workers which Olsten provided were \u201ctemporary workers\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(23), MCA (1993), and, since Olsten provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the workers, that he was not an uninsured employer. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court concluded that \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), did not require Dahl to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance in his own name and that, even if the workers were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(23), MCA (1993), and were, therefore, Dahl\u2019s employees, Dahl was not an uninsured employer because Olsten provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the workers. The UEF requested reconsideration but the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denied its request. The UEF appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b610 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court reviews the Department\u2019s decisions under the standards of review set forth in the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-101, et seq., MCA. <em>C.

In so doing, we review the Department\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. See <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Baldridge v. Board of Trustees, Rosebud County School Dist.

The UEF maintains that \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), standing alone, did not require Dahl to obtain workers\u2019 compensation coverage in his own name. Nevertheless, the UEF claims that \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA (1993), when interpreted to insure coordination with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as a whole, required Dahl to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance for those workers who were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(23), MCA (1993), and who were, therefore, Dahl\u2019s \u201cemployees\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b614 Dahl agrees that \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA(1993), standing alone, did not require him to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the workers which Olsten provided. Moreover, Dahl claims that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), and that this Court would have to \u201cinsert language\u201d into the statute to reach the conclusion that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b615 Section 39-71-401, MCA (1993), provides in pertinent part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(Emphasis added.) The 1993 Worker\u2019s Compensation Act defines an \u201cuninsured employer\u201d as an employer who has not complied with the provisions of \u00a7 39-71-401, MCA (1993).

Section 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), clearly and unambiguously requires the \u201cemployer\u201d to elect to be bound by \u201ccompensation plan No. 1, 2, or 3.\u201d Thus, contrary to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s interpretation, \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), precludes a separate entity from providing workers\u2019 compensation insurance for an employer\u2019s employees; it simply provides that the <em>employer </em>must procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance (by either \u201ccompensation plan No. 1,2, or 3\") for its employees. See <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 12 (stating that if the employer\u2019s workers were not temporary workers then the temporary service contractor was not the workers\u2019 employer and that the UEF correctly ordered the employer to cease operations on the grounds that the employer was an uninsured employer even though the temporary service contractor provided workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the workers).

Moreover, since the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), precludes a separate entity from providing workers\u2019 compensation insurance for an employer\u2019s employees, we do not, as the UEF suggests, need to look to the 1993 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as a whole to reach the conclusion which the UEF advances.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b6 17  Accordingly, we hold that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in concluding that \u00a7 39-71-401(1), MCA (1993), allowed an employer to have a separate entity procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b618 <em>Did the Department\u2019s hearings officer err in determining that the workers at issue were Dahl\u2019s employees under the 1993 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b6 19 Dahl argued that the hearings officer erred in determining that nine of the workers which Olsten provided to Dahl were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993).

Loney Concrete Construction, Inc., </em>WCC #9305-6799 (December 28, 1993), the workers which Olsten provided to Dahl were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Avb\">\u00b620  Section 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993), defines \u201ctemporary worker\u201d as \u201ca worker whose services are furnished to another on a part-time or temporary basis to substitute for a permanent employee on leave or to meet an emergency or short-term workload.\u201d Section 39-71-117(2), MCA (1993), provides that \u201c[a] temporary service contractor is the employer of a temporary worker for premium and loss experience purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b621 In the <em>Loney </em>case before this Court, Loney, a concrete construction business contracted with Olsten (the same temporary service contractor involved in the instant case) for workers. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5 and 7. Loney paid Olsten to cover wages, overhead costs and, presumably, a profit. Olsten paid Loney\u2019s workers and provided their workers\u2019 compensation insurance. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b622 The Department issued a cease and desist order to Loney on the basis that the workers utilized by Loney were not temporary workers and, therefore, that Loney, and not Olsten, was the employer responsible for their workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the payment of the premiums. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11. After the Department\u2019s hearings examiner determined that none of Loney\u2019s workers were temporary workers, Loney appealed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 11. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court affirmed the hearings examiner\u2019s findings that certain workers were not temporary workers. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 11. Loney appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b623 We first noted that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act defined a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d as a worker deployed to meet either an emergency or a short-term need. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 23. We stated that \u201can emergency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>is characterized by an immediate need that is unforseen.\u201d <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 23. Since the evidence showed that Loney consistently used the workers at issue for daily business functions such as job supervision, bookkeeping, and for keeping the minimum number of concrete workers to meet its baseline level of job activity, we held that Loney did not use the workers at issue to meet emergency needs. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b624 We also stated that \u201c[t]he Workers\u2019 Compensation Court appropriately distinguished core workers, who serve an employer\u2019s baseline needs, from temporary workers, who are only used short term.\u201d <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 23. Since the workers at issue served Loney\u2019s baseline needs and worked continuously and consistently for Loney, we held that Loney did not use the workers to meet short-term needs. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 23. Therefore, we held that there was substantial evidence to support the hearings examiner\u2019s findings that the workers at issue were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(24), MCA (1991). <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"A9q\">\u00b625  In the instant case, the undisputed evidence shows that the workers at issue worked for Dahl between six and fifteen weeks in 1993 and between eight and twenty weeks in 1994. Moreover, the evidence shows that Dahl had at least two workers for the weeks at issue and that Dahl frequently had four or five workers working during a week. Thus, Dahl did not use the workers to meet either an immediate need that was unforseen or for short-term demands. Instead, Dahl used the workers as core workers to serve his daily business functions from June 1993 to November 1993 and again from March 1994 to August 1994. Thus, as in <em>Loney, </em>since the workers which Dahl used served his baseline needs and worked continuously and consistently for him, they were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993). Accordingly, we hold that the Department\u2019s hearings examiner correctly determined that the nine workers at issue were Dahl\u2019s employees under the 1993 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b626 As a final point, we note that Dahl asserted in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that the hearings examiner erred in not apportioning the uninsured employers penalty between Big Sky Concrete, Inc. and Dahl personally, and that \u00a7 39-71-116(23), MCA (1993), is void for vagueness. Notwithstanding, neither the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court nor this Court has considered the merits of these issues. Hence, we remand this case to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court to resolve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b627 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\">. We recognize that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not address Dahl\u2019s argument that the hearings officer erred in determining that nine of the workers which Olsten provided to Dahl were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993). In general, this Court does not address issues that were not addressed by the lower court. See Rule 2(a), M.R.App.P. However, our standard of review in cases where the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court has reviewed a decision form the Department is the same as the standard of review utilized by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>Synek, </em>272 Mont. at 250, 900 P.2d at 886). Consequently, in the interests of judicial economy, we will review the hearings examiner\u2019s determination that nine of the workers which Olsten provided Dahl were not \u201ctemporary worker[s]\u201d under \u00a7 39-71-116(29), MCA (1993), and, thus, that they were Dahl\u2019s employees under \u00a7 39-71-118, MCA (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b201-3\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"A2Y\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b628 I join in the Court\u2019s opinion on issue one, which holds that Dahl could not have a separate entity purchase workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover his workers. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s opinion on issue two, however, which is the question of whether the workers at issue were Dahl\u2019s employees under the 1993 Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b629 I do not disagree with the law set forth by the Court in issue two. Rather, it is my view that \u2014 given the odd procedural posture in which this case is before us \u2014 we should not address this issue, but should remand to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court for resolution. The issue of whether the workers were Dahl\u2019s employees was, in fact, raised by Dahl \u2014 but not addressed \u2014 in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court because that court determined the issue of whether Dahl was required to provide his own workers\u2019 compensation insurance was dispositive. Since we are remanding on the other issues reserved by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, we should do the same with the issue of whether the workers were Dahl\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b630 I could not agree more with the Court\u2019s concern for judicial economy. Moreover, I understand its interest in furthering judicial economy by addressing the hearing examiner\u2019s determination that nine of the workers provided to Dahl were his employees, rather than having the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court do so. In this case, however, it is my view that Dahl\u2019s interest in having an opportunity to brief his issue of whether the workers provided by Olsten\u2019s were, in fact, his employees must trump our concern for judicial economy. Because the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not address this issue, it is not before us and Dahl quite properly did not address it in this appeal. For this Court to address an issue of such critical importance to a party to the appeal, without allowing that party to be heard, strikes me as unfair at the very least.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b631 Nor can I draw any consolation in this regard from the similarities between the present case and <em>honey. </em>There, the case proceeded in an orderly manner from the Department\u2019s hearing examiner stage to a review by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. The hearing examiner determined that none of the workers were temporary workers; on appeal, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court affirmed the finding that certain workers were not temporary workers, but reversed the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>examiner\u2019s finding as to the remaining workers. Loney appealed to this Court and we affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision that <em>certain </em>of the workers were not temporary workers but were his employees. <em>Loney, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 25. Thus, it is clear that, in <em>Loney, </em>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court performed a careful analysis to determine which of the workers at issue were actually Loney\u2019s baseline, or core, workers and, consequently, his employees under the workers\u2019 compensation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b632 In the present case, the Court does not explain the basis for its determination that all of the workers at issue were \u201ccore workers to serve [Dahl\u2019s] daily business functions.\u201d The Court notes that, in the aggregate, the workers worked between six and fifteen weeks in 1993 and between eight and twenty weeks in 1994. In addition, the Court points to the evidence showing that Dahl had \u201cat least two workers for the weeks at issue and that Dahl frequently had four or five workers working during a week.\u201d Nothing in that recitation of evidence, however, resolves the questions of how much work was Dahl\u2019s baseline load and how many of the workers were core workers needed to fill actual baseline needs as opposed to short-term workers needed to perform work over and above Dahl\u2019s baseline needs. It may well be true that, since Dahl used at least two workers for each of the weeks at issue, those workers were core workers needed for his baseline needs. It is not nearly as clear, however, that the additional workers also were core workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b633 I would remand the issue regarding whether the workers were Dahl\u2019s employees \u2014 an issue not addressed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court \u2014 to that court, together with the other issues being remanded. Because a remand is necessary on other issues, I cannot see how judicial economy is advanced by not remanding this issue as well, particularly since doing so would provide Dahl the opportunity to brief this issue in a subsequent appeal if one is to occur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
