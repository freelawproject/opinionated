Nichols (Nichols), <em>pro se, </em>appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">\u00b62 In January 1989, Nichols pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated assault and to one count of felony assault. He was sentenced to 20 years for the aggravated assault and to 10 years for the felony assault. The trial court imposed an additional 10-year sentence on the aggravated assault and an additional five-year sentence on the felony assault pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA. This statute provides for an enhanced penalty for offenses committed with a dangerous weapon. Written judgment was entered on March 1,1989. Nichols applied for sentence review but did not appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">\u00b63 Thereafter, in October 1990, Nichols moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The trial court deemed his motion to be a petition for post-conviction relief, ordered a response from the State, and, following a hearing, amended Nichols\u2019 sentence by vacating the sex of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fender treatment and restitution requirements imposed in the original sentence. The court did not amend the term of years to which Nichols was sentenced. This amended judgment was filed November 9, 1993. Nichols did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b64 Nichols\u2019 instant petition was filed March 4,1999, more than 10 years following his original conviction and more than five years following entry of the amended judgment. Nichols\u2019 application, styled as a \u201cMotion for Amended Sentence and Judgment,\u201d requested that the court strike the weapons enhancement sentences from each felony sentence. Nichols premised his claim for this relief on our decision in <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 294, 975 P.2d 312, wherein we held that application of \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, to felony convictions (there, felony assault) where the underlying offense requires proof of the use of a weapon, violates the double jeopardy provision of Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 16. The State objected to Nichols\u2019 petition. The District Court denied Nichols relief on the basis of the State\u2019s statute of limitations and retroactivity arguments. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b65 We address two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b66 1. Is Nichols entitled to retroactive application of this Court\u2019s decision in Guillaume?</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">\u00b67 2. Is Nichols\u2019 post-conviction claim statutorily barred?</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">\u00b68 Both issues involve the District Court\u2019s conclusions on and application of the law. Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>See State v. Baker </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 273, 280, 901 P.2d 54, 58 cert denied, 516 U.S. 1125, 116 S.Ct. 940, 133 L.Ed.2d 865 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">\u00b69 <em>Is Nichols entitled to retroactive application of this Court\u2019s decision in </em>Guillaume?</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">\u00b610  Retroactivity is properly treated as a threshold question which requires that application of a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions be evenhandedly applied to all who are similarly situated in cases pending on direct review or not yet final. <em>See State v. </em>Egelhoff (1995), 272 Mont. 114, 125-26, 900 P.2d 260, 266-67, <em>rev\u2019d on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>other grounds by Montana v. Egelhoff </em>(1996), 518 U.S. 37, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (citing <em>Griffith v. Kentucky </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 314, 328, 107 S.Ct. 708, 716, 93 L.Ed.2d 649; <em>Teague v. Lane </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 288, 300-01, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1070, 103 L.Ed.2d 334).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b611 A \u201cnew rule\u201d is one which \u201cbreaks new ground\u201d or \u201cimposes a new obligation\u201d on the government. Put another way, if the result of the case was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final, then the rule is a \u201cnew <em>rule.\u201d Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 126, 900 P.2d at 267 (citing <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. at 1070).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b612 Our decision in <em>Guillaume </em>announced a new rule of constitutional law when we held that Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution affords broader protection than the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution. Prior to <em>Guillaume, </em>in the absence of a case presenting the precise issue of the scope of Montana\u2019s constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy vis-a-vis that of the federal constitution, we deemed the protections afforded by Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution and by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be coextensive. <em>Guillaume </em>was the first case to announce the broader protection rule and this rule was not dictated by prior precedent. <em>See Guillaume, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-16; <em>State v. Zabawa </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 307, 310, 928 P.2d 151, 153; <em>State v. Schnittgen </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 291, 296, 922 P.2d 500, 503; <em>City of Helena v. Danicheck </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 461, 464, 922 P.2d 1170, 1172; <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 86, 90, 910 P.2d 247, 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b6 13 At the time we handed down our decision in <em>Guillaume </em>(February 19,1999), Nichols\u2019 case was not pending on direct review. His conviction had been final for over five years at a minimum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, at first blush the general rule of retroactivity would appear not to apply in Nichols\u2019 case. <em>See Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 125-26, 900 P.2d at 266-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b614  Notwithstanding, there are two exceptions to the general rule. The first exception is applicable when the new constitutional rule puts primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law to proscribe. The second exception is applicable when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the procedures used to convict the defendant are so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty as to constitute watershed rules of criminal procedure. <em>See Egelhoff, </em>272 Mont. at 126, 900 P.2d at 267 (citing <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 310-11, 109 S.Ct. at 1075-76). We conclude that the District Court correctly determined that neither exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b6 15 As argued by the State, the <em>Guillaume </em>\u201cnew rule\u201d expanded the double jeopardy protections afforded by the Montana Constitution beyond that afforded by the federal constitution. Our decision also invalidated the statutory scheme which authorized the enhancement of punishment for offenses committed with a dangerous weapon where the underlying offense required proof of the use of a weapon. <em>Guillaume </em>did not, however, put private, individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law to proscribe. Offenses committed with a dangerous weapon could still be prosecuted and punished after our decision just as they were before it was handed down. Only the extent of the punishment was proscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b616 Similarly, <em>Guillaume </em>did not set out a watershed rule of criminal procedure. Montana\u2019s double jeopardy provision had never been argued or construed to confer greater protection than the Fifth Amendment. While our decision, for the first time, held this to be the case, it cannot be said that <em>Guillaume </em>announced a rule so implicit in the concept of ordered liberty that it requires retroactive application to cases not pending on direct review and to cases that were final when our opinion was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b617 We hold that the District Court correctly refused to apply to Nichols\u2019 case either of the two exceptions to the general retroactivity rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u00b618 <em>Is Nichols\u2019 post-conviction claim statutorily barred ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">\u00b619  The District Court ruled that Nichols\u2019 claim was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set out at \u00a7 46-21-102(1), MCA (1997). As the State notes, however, since Nichols was convicted in 1989, he is not subject to the one-year bar as that statute of limitations applies only to those convictions which became final after the effective date of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1997) \u2014 April 24, 1997 \u2014 or within one year prior to that date. <em>See </em>Compiler\u2019s Comments to \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA (1997); Sections 9(1) and 10, Ch. 378, L.1997; <em>Hawkins v. Mahoney, </em>1999 MT 82, \u00b6\u00b6 7-15, 294 Mont. 124, \u00b6\u00b67-15, 979 P.2d 697, \u00b6\u00b6 7-15. Since Nichols\u2019 conviction became final, at the latest, follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ing entry of the November 9, 1993 amended judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, his petition for post-conviction relief is subject to the five-year statute of limitation set out in the pre-1997 version of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. <em>Hawkins, </em>\u00b6 10. Accordingly, the District Court correctly ruled that Nichols\u2019 petition was time-barred, albeit the court used the wrong statute of limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b620 Nichols, nonetheless, argues that we should disregard the procedural time-bar. He bases his argument on the \u201cclear miscarriage of justice\u201d exception which we articulated in <em>State v. Perry </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 455, 758 P.2d 268, and in <em>In re Petition of Gray </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 1, 908 P.2d 1352. However, in <em>Beach v. Day </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 370, 374, 913 P.2d 622, 624, we held that <em>Perry\u2019s </em>miscarriage of justice exception does not apply to post-conviction claims unless they allege newly discovered evidence which would establish that the defendant did not commit the offense. <em>Hawkins, </em>\u00b6 12. <em>See also State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, [294 Mont. 252, \u00b6\u00b633-34, 980 P.2d 622, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34, (miscarriage of justice refers to actual, not legal, innocence).</p>\n<p id=\"AiX\">\u00b621 Nichols\u2019 case does not fall within these exceptions. In the case at bar, Nichols pleaded guilty to the underlying offenses, both of which involved the use of a dangerous weapon, a knife. Without attacking the validity of his convictions, Nichols cannot be considered to have not committed or to be actually innocent of his crimes. His complaint that he should not have been sentenced to additional punishment under the weapons enhancement statute, while a legal error in light of <em>Guillaume, </em>does not equate with \u201cactual innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY, LEAPHART and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">. For purposes of this opinion we use the November 9,1993 amended judgment as Nichols\u2019 final conviction date. The result would obviously be the same were we to use, instead, his original March 1,1989 conviction date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">. Again, for purposes of this opinion, we use the date of Nichols\u2019 November 9, 1993 amended judgment, as the result would not be any different if we used the March 1,1989 judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
