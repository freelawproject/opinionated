Paterson (Paterson) appeals from the findings of fact, conclusions oflaw and judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denying his claim for temporary total disability benefits relating to a nonwork-related incident in July of 1996. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson\u2019s 1995 work-related injury reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">\u00b63 We also address, briefly, whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court applied the correct burden of proof and whether the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that the incident of July 4,1996, was a permanent aggravation of Paterson\u2019s back condition is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b141-13\">\u00b64 Paterson is a carpenter who had been a professional artist in the past. In March of 1995, Dick Anderson Construction (Anderson) hired Paterson as a commercial carpenter, a position which generally involves heavier labor than residential carpentry. On April 13,1995, Paterson injured his back at work when he slipped while carrying two steel forms, causing him to \u201ctwist and jerk\u201d in an effort to keep his balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">\u00b65 Paterson left work early the day of the injury, but did not file a workers\u2019 compensation claim with Anderson\u2019s insurer, the Montana Contractor Compensation Fund (MCCF). He did experience pain in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>his left buttocks, the back of his left thigh and his lower back, however, and received five chiropractic treatments in April and May of 1995. Anderson laid Paterson off on April 24, 1995, due to lack of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b66 Paterson subsequently worked for Rosenbaum Construction in May of 1995. Later that month, Paterson returned to work for Anderson as a commercial carpenter and again was laid off due to lack of work in September of 1995. In October of 1995, Talcott Construction (Talcott) hired Paterson as a commercial carpenter and laid him off the following month. During the winter and spring of 1995-96, Paterson remodeled a bar and helped perfa tape and paint a friend\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"AXg\">\u00b67 Talcott reemployed Paterson on July 1, 1996. On July 4, 1996, Paterson injured his back while working in his yard. He sought treatment at Columbus Convenience Care, received a shot of Demerol and a prescription for pain pills, and did not return to work for Talcott. Following his nonwork-related injury on July 4,1996, Paterson continued to experience lower back pain and, in November of 1996, an MRI disclosed that he had a \u201cmoderately-sized right posterior disc protrusion at L4/5 level... [and] a small posterior protrusion at Ll/2.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A7P\">\u00b68 Paterson saw several physicians \u2014 including Dr. Paul Gorsuch, a neurosurgeon \u2014 in the months after his 1996 nonwork-related injury. Dr. Gorsuch later referred Paterson to Dr. Ronald Peterson, a specialist in occupational and sports medicine, who became and remained Paterson\u2019s treating physician. Prior to the hearing, Dr. Peterson opined via letter that Paterson\u2019s 1995 work-related injury had not reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury. His opinion was based in part on Paterson\u2019s subjective reports to him.</p>\n<p id=\"Anx\">\u00b69 In December of 1996, Paterson filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the MCCF alleging that his 1996 nonwork-related injury was an exacerbation of his 1995 work-related injury and, therefore, compensable. The MCCF accepted liability for the 1995 work-related injury. With regard to the 1996 nonwork-related injury, however, the MCCF disputed liability, asserting that Paterson\u2019s subsequent wage loss and medical expenses resulted from a new injury or aggravation suffered on July 4,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b610 Paterson ultimately filed a petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court seeking compensation and benefits for the 1996 nonwork-related injury. During the two-day hearing on his petition, Paterson testified he experienced ongoing back pain after the 1995 work-related injury and was able to perform only light labor thereaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ter. Two witnesses corroborated his testimony. The MCCF presented numerous witnesses who testified Paterson performed heavy labor without complaining of back pain after his April 13, 1995, work-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">\u00b611 Dr. Peterson was the only physician to testify in person at the hearing. He testified after Paterson presented his case and before the MCCF presented all its witnesses. Because his opinion would be based in part on subjective reports, both parties asked Dr. Peterson for his opinion on whether Paterson had reached \u201cmaximum healing\u201d after the work-related injury in April of 1995 in light of their significantly different versions of events following that injury. Since the MCCF had not yet called its witnesses, it presented Dr. Peterson with a hypothetical scenario consisting of three components which it intended to establish through its witnesses\u2019 subsequent testimony. Based on the MCCF\u2019s hypothetical, Dr. Peterson agreed that Paterson did reach maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury. Paterson then paraphrased his version of events based on his witnesses\u2019 testimony and Dr. Peterson opined that Paterson had not reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"A-t\">\u00b612 After the hearing, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court entered extensive findings of fact, including findings that Paterson reached maximum healing prior to the 1996 nonwork-related injury and that the latter injury was a permanent aggravation of his back condition. Those findings were based on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s determinations that the MCCF\u2019s witnesses were credible and its three-component hypothetical scenario had been proven, as well as the court\u2019s reliance on Dr. Peterson\u2019s opinions. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court also entered conclusions of law, together with its judgment denying Paterson benefits for his 1996 nonwork-related injury. Paterson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b613 Is the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson\u2019s 1995 work-related injury reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b6 14 Workers\u2019 compensation benefits are determined by the statutes in effect on the date of injury. <em>King v. State Compensation Ins. Fund </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 335, 337, 938 P.2d 607, 608 (citation omitted). Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Paterson\u2019s work-related injury occurred in April of 1995, and, as a result, the 1993 workers\u2019 compensation statutes are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b615 In this case, Paterson sought temporary total disability benefits. Temporary total disability means \u201ca condition resulting from an injury... that results in total loss of wages and exists until the injured worker reaches maximum medical healing.\u201d Section 39-71-116(28), MCA(1993). \u201c[A] worker is eligible for temporary total disability benefits when the worker suffers a total loss of wages as a result of an injury and until the worker reaches maximum healing\u201d and the determination of temporary total disability \u201cmust be supported by a preponderance of medical evidence.\u201d Section 39-71-701(1) and (2), MCA (1993). In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">[i]f a claimant who has reached maximum healing suffers a subsequent nonwork-related injury to the same part of the body, the workers\u2019 compensation insurer is not liable for any compensation or medical benefits caused by the subsequent nonwork-related injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Section 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993). Maximum healing is the \u201cpoint in the healing process when further material improvement would not be reasonably expected from primary medical treatment.\u201d Section 39-71-116(14), MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b616 At the outset of the hearing, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court stated that the primary issue before it was \u201cwhether or not [Paterson] reached maximum medical healing with respect to the injuries of\u201895.\u201d In other words, it was \u201cjust an issue of whether or not [Paterson] had reached maximum medical healing before this exacerbation or aggravation of July of 1996.\u201d Paterson\u2019s counsel agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">\u00b617 As mentioned above, the MCCF presented Dr. Peterson with a hypothetical scenario consisting of three components during the hearing. In the first component, the MCCF set forth a factual scenario pertaining to Paterson\u2019s work history subsequent to the 1995 work-related injury, including for whom he worked and the type of work he performed. The MCCF emphasized Paterson\u2019s ability to engage in heavy labor involving bending, lifting, stooping and twisting, and that Paterson engaged in such labor for extended periods of time without exhibiting any apparent back problems or seeking additional medical care for his back after May of 1995. The second component involved an assumption that Paterson was not fearful of losing current \u2014 or obtaining future \u2014 employment if he mentioned an ongoing back problem. The third component involved an assumption that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>medical care was affordable and available after Paterson\u2019s final chiropractic treatment in May of 1995. Assuming those three components to be true, Dr. Peterson agreed that Paterson reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury. The MCCF then put on its witnesses in an effort to establish the facts contained in its hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\">\u00b6 18 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that each of the three components contained in the MCCF\u2019s hypothetical had been established. Relying on Dr. Peterson\u2019s opinion premised on those facts, the court ultimately found that Paterson reached maximum healing prior to his nonwork-related injury in July of 1996, and, on that basis, concluded pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), that the MCCF was not liable for compensation or medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b619 We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Kuntz v. Nationwide Mat. Fire Ins. </em>Co., 1998 MT 5, \u00b6 16, 287 Mont. 142, \u00b6 16, 952 P.2d 422, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Accordingly, we address the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings that each of the three components in the MCCF\u2019s hypothetical scenario was proven and its ultimate finding that Paterson reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\n<em>A. Paterson\u2019s work history and back symptomology after the April 13, 1995, work-related injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b620 The MCCF presented five witnesses who testified about Paterson\u2019s work history and back symptomology after his work-related injury in April of 1995. Terry Gibson, Scott Watson and Greg Schermele (Schermele) observed Paterson\u2019s work activities while employed by Anderson from May to September of 1995, the months immediately following Paterson\u2019s work-related injury. In essence, they all testified that Paterson\u2019s work was heavy labor involving bending, lifting, stooping and twisting. They also testified that Paterson did not complain of ongoing back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b621 Larry Dravecky (Dravecky) and Pat Laabs (Laabs), both superintendents for Talcott, observed Paterson\u2019s work activities in October and November of 1995. They testified that Paterson engaged in heavy labor on a daily basis and did not complain of back pain. Laabs also testified that Paterson reported no back problems in a health screening taken before he began working for Talcott.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u00b622 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court expressly found the testimony of Schermele, Dravecky and Laabs credible. Based on that testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>mony, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Paterson\u2019s work history and back symptomology were consistent with the factual scenario set forth in the first component of the MCCF\u2019s hypothetical to Dr. Peterson; namely, that Paterson continued to engage in heavy labor after his 1995 work-related injury and did so without apparent back problems. The referenced testimony constitutes substantial credible evidence supporting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, as the trier of fact, concerning witness credibility. <em>See Walls v. Travelers Indem. Co. </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 106, 111, 931 P.2d 712, 715 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b623  It is true that Paterson presented his own testimony \u2014 as well as that of several other witnesses \u2014 in support of his contentions that he performed only light carpentry duties and supervisory work for which he had an assistant after his injury in April of 1995. Thus, there was conflicting evidence on these matters. Our standard in reviewing the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings, however, is whether sufficient evidence exists to support those findings. <em>See Kuntz, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted). We do not determine whether evidence exists to support contrary findings. Walls, 281 Mont. at 110-11, 931 P.2d at 715 (citation omitted). Nor will we substitute our judgment for that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court regarding the weight to be given to the evidence. <em>Walls, </em>281 Mont. at 111, 931 P.2d at 715 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b624 Here, faced with conflicting evidence regarding Paterson\u2019s work history and back symptomology after his work-related injury in April of 1995, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court accepted the testimony presented by the MCCF and rejected that introduced by Paterson. In addition, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court expressly found that three of the MCCF\u2019s witnesses were credible and characterized portions of the testimony of Paterson and his supporting witnesses as fabricated, false, unpersuasive and unconvincing. We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson\u2019s work history and back symptomology were as presented in the MCCF\u2019s hypothetical to Dr. Peterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>B. Fear of losing current </em>\u2014 or <em>not obtaining future </em>\u2014 employment</p>\n<p id=\"AYE\">\u00b625 Jeff Albrecht (Albrecht), a carpenter for Anderson, worked with Paterson in the autumn of 1995. He testified that Paterson occasionally complained of back problems, but did not complain more than anyone else Paterson\u2019s age. In addition, Paterson\u2019s own testimony in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>dicated that he did not forego reporting ongoing back pain because he was fearful of not obtaining future employment. According to Paterson, when superintendent Dravecky hired him to work for Talcott in July of 1996, they agreed that Paterson would work only three days a week and would have an assistant to help him with the heavier work because of his ongoing back pain. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Paterson was not \u201cdeterred from reporting back pain to his current or prospective employers on account of any fear that he might lose employment or might not be able to obtain employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b626  The referenced testimony supports the court\u2019s finding. Moreover, the determination of whether Paterson was \u201cfearful\u201d was within the province of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court as the trier of fact and we will not substitute our judgment on review. <em>See Walls, </em>281 Mont. at 111, 931 P.2d at 715 (citation omitted). We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson was not fearful of losing current \u2014 or not obtaining future \u2014 employment if he reported ongoing back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\n<em>C. Affordable and available medical care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b627 Dr. Peterson testified that Paterson reported discontinuing his chiropractic treatments after April and May of 1995, notwithstanding ongoing back pain, because the treatment was a financial strain and he felt it aggravated his symptoms. As a result of Paterson\u2019s report, Dr. Peterson testified that, in order to agree Paterson reached maximum healing before the 1996 nonwork-related injury, he would have to be assured Paterson knew medical care was affordable and available.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b628 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was not persuaded that Paterson did not seek medical care after his chiropractic treatments in April and May of 1995 because of the cost or unavailability of care. Paterson\u2019s chiropractic records indicate that he sought treatments immediately after his April 1995 work-related injury and his July 1996 nonwork-related injury. In addition, Paterson testified he was aware workers\u2019 compensation insurance was available after his 1995 work-related injury which would have allowed him to explore different treatments. Paterson also was aware he had access to medical insurance after his 1995 work-related injury through the Montana Contractors Association Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b629 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was faced with deciding whether Paterson discontinued his treatments because his back pain had subsided or because of the cost and unavailability of medical care. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>It was within the court\u2019s province, as the trier of fact, to weigh the evidence and assess Paterson\u2019s credibility. <em>See Walls, </em>281 Mont. at 111, 931 P.2d at 715 (citation omitted). We conclude that substantial credible evidence supports the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson did not fail to seek medical care after his chiropractic treatments in April and May of 1995 because of the cost or unavailability of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b630 Having found that each of the three components of the MCCF\u2019s hypothetical was established, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court ultimately found that Paterson reached maximum healing after his 1995 work-related injury and before his 1996 nonwork-related injury. The court\u2019s maximum healing finding was based on Dr. Peterson\u2019s opinion that, if the three components were established, Paterson had reached maximum healing. Dr. Peterson\u2019s opinion constitutes substantial credible evidence supporting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b631 Paterson contends, however, that the MCCF presented no affirmative medical testimony on the issue of maximum healing. He asserts that the only substantial credible evidence on the issue was Dr. Peterson\u2019s unequivocal prehearing opinion that \u201cI do not believe that Mr. Paterson was at maximum medical improvement prior to the permanent exacerbation of his back experienced on 7/04/96.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b632 As discussed above, Dr. Peterson\u2019s prehearing medical opinion on the absence of maximum healing was based in part on Paterson\u2019s subjective reports. Presented with the MCCF\u2019s three-component hypothetical and asked to assume that the facts were true, Dr. Peterson changed his opinion and testified that, under those facts, Paterson had reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury. His revised opinion is no less \u201caffirmative medical testimony\u201d than the original opinion on which Paterson premises his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"AbC\">\u00b633 Paterson next contends that returning to work does not, in and of itself, resolve the issue of maximum healing. We agree. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Brien v. Central Feeds </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 267, 273, 786 P.2d 1169, 1172 (citation omitted). As discussed above, however, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson reached maximum healing was based on a number of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b634 Paterson also contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that he was not credible is misplaced because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>maximum healing determination was not dependent on his credibility. This contention is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b635 As discussed above, Paterson\u2019s credibility was relevant to the maximum healing determination because Dr. Peterson\u2019s prehearing opinion that Paterson had not reached maximum healing before the nonwork-related injury on July 4, 1996, was based on Paterson\u2019s report of his work history and back symptomology after the April 13, 1995, work-related injury. Once the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court rejected Paterson\u2019s version of those matters and found that the facts presented by the MCCF regarding subsequent work and back symptomology were established, a significant portion of the basis for Dr. Peterson\u2019s Initial opinion was negated.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b636  On the record before us, we conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings regarding Paterson\u2019s work history and back symptomology, his lack of fear of losing current \u2014 or not obtaining future \u2014 employment, and the affordability and availability of medical care are supported by substantial credible evidence. We further conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b637 Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court apply the correct burden of proof?</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b638 Paterson contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred by failing to shift the burden to the MCCF, pursuant to such cases as <em>EBI/Orion Group v. Blythe, </em>1998 MT 90, 288 Mont. 356, 957 P.2d 1134, <em>Caekaert v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 105, 885 P.2d 495, and <em>Belton v. Carlson Transport </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 384, 658 P.2d 405, after he established his entitlement to compensation by showing a clear connection between his current condition and the April 13,1995, work-related injury accepted by the MCCF. According to Paterson, the MCCF did not meet its burden under those cases and, therefore, a reversal of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s decision is required. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b639 In response to Paterson\u2019s petition for temporary total disability benefits, the MCCF relied on \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), in asserting it was not liable for Paterson\u2019s July 4, 1996, nonwork-related injury because he reached maximum healing before his subsequent nonwork-related back injury. The MCCF maintained its position in the pretrial order by contending it was not liable for Paterson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>claimed disability and medical benefits following the \u201cnon-industrial aggravation, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-407, MCA ....\u201d The pretrial order also stated that whether Paterson had attained medical stability at any time prior to the July 4, 1996, nonwork-related injury was at issue. Thus, it is clear that the MCCF sought to avoid liability under \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), from the outset of the proceeding in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b640 In addition, while Paterson\u2019s Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law raised <em>Belton </em>and <em>Caekaert, </em>he conceded therein that \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), was at issue and that the burden on the MCCF effectively was the same under either analysis: to establish that he had reached maximum healing and had sustained an injury after doing so. Paterson\u2019s stated position was that the MCCF had not met its burden of proving he attained \u201cmaximum healing at any time from the initial injury to the present\u201d and, therefore, the MCCF was liable. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), applied and that, on the basis of its findings that Paterson suffered a \u201csubsequent nonwork-related injury\u201d to his back on July 4,1996, and reached maximum healing prior to that nonwork-related injury, the MCCF was not liable for Paterson\u2019s subsequent medical expenses or compensation benefits pursuant to \u201cthe express and plain terms of [\u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993)].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b641 On the record before us, it is clear that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in concluding that \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), applies in this case and that the MCCF met its burden thereunder. Nor need we address the <em>Caekaert </em>and EBI/ <em>Orion </em>line of cases here. Those cases are factually distinguishable from the present case in that, unlike the present case, they involved subsequent insurers and did not involve \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), which expressly governs maximum healing prior to a subsequent nonwork-related injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b642 Moreover, since Paterson\u2019s position in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court was that the MCCF\u2019s burden was essentially the same under \u00a7 39-71-407(5), MCA (1993), and <em>Caekaert, </em>and that the MCCF\u2019s burden was to establish that he reached maximum healing prior to his 1996 nonwork-related injury, Paterson is asking us to address a new legal theory on appeal. We do not address for the first time on appeal a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>Unified Industries, Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u00b643 We conclude that Paterson has not established error by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court relating to the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">\u00b644 Is the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that the incident of July 4,1996, was a permanent aggravation of Paterson\u2019s back condition supported by substantial credible evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b645 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found that Paterson\u2019s 1996 nonwork-related injury was a permanent aggravation and that Dr. Peterson\u2019s opinion in that regard was not seriously disputed. Paterson contends that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in determining that his 1996 nonwork-related injury was a permanent aggravation rather than a temporary exacerbation which did not materially and permanently alter his condition. We review the record to determine whether substantial credible evidence exists to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings. <em>See Kuntz, </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\u00b646 Dr. Peterson agreed on direct examination that he previously had rendered an opinion that the events of July 4,1996, \u201cpermanently aggravated\u201d Paterson\u2019s back condition. His opinion did not change during his testimony and it constitutes substantial credible evidence supporting the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Paterson\u2019s 1996 nonwork-related injury was a permanent aggravation.</p>\n<p id=\"AeZ\">\u00b647 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that there was \u201cno serious dispute\u201d that Paterson\u2019s 1996 nonwork-related injury permanently aggravated his back condition also is supported by the record. As mentioned above, Dr. Peterson testified he had previously rendered an opinion that the events of July 4,1996, \u201cpermanently aggravated\u201d Paterson\u2019s back condition and Paterson did not cross-examine Dr. Peterson on the question of \u201cpermanent aggravation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\u00b648 Finally, we reject Paterson\u2019s effort on appeal to distinguish between a permanent \u201caggravation\u201d and a temporary \u201cexacerbation\u201d on the basis that he did not rely on such a distinction in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. While Paterson repeatedly used the term \u201cexacerbation\u201d in the pretrial order and his Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, he relied on Dr. Peterson\u2019s prehearing determination that the 1996 nonwork-related injury was a \u201cpermanent\u201d exacerbation of the 1995 work-related injury. In addition, his Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law requested a conclusion that Paterson\u2019s 1996 nonwork-related injury was a \u201cpermanent exacerbation\u201d of the 1995 work-related injury. Thus, the distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Paterson attempts to draw on appeal between a \u201ctemporary exacerbation\u201d and a \u201cpermanent aggravation\u201d is essentially a change in theory from that presented in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, and we do not address new theories raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Unified Industries, Inc., </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b649 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
