Johnson (Johnson) appeals from the order of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Fergus County, granting the motion for summary judgment made by Stephen M. Barrett (Barrett). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"AhX\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting Barrett\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\u00b63 In May of 1989, a vehicle-pedestrian accident resulted in the death of Ruth Eatinger (Eatinger). Eatinger\u2019s estate and survivors hired Johnson, a licensed attorney, to probate the estate and pursue wrongful death and survival claims against the driver of the vehicle that struck Eatinger. The heirs subsequently hired a different attorney to represent them and sued Johnson for conversion of settlement proceeds in the tort actions. One of Johnson\u2019s defenses was that he had asserted an attorney\u2019s lien against the settlement proceeds. After a trial in August of 1993, the jury rendered a verdict for the survivors and awarded them compensatory and punitive damages. Johnson appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\u00b64 One of the issues Johnson raised on appeal related to a jury instruction not given by the trial court. Noting that the focal point of his defense was an attorney\u2019s retaining lien, he contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on attorneys\u2019 charging liens, rather than attorneys\u2019 retaining liens, notwithstanding the fact that his counsel had offered only an instruction on attorneys\u2019 charging liens. We concluded that Johnson\u2019s failure to object to the instruction given barred his right to assert error in that regard. In addition, observing that Johnson\u2019s counsel stated he thought the language in the instruction on charging liens was broad enough to cover Johnson\u2019s defense, we refused to allow Johnson to benefit from an alleged error he created. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Eatinger v. Johnson </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 99, 106, 887 P.2d 231, 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">\u00b65 On December 19,1996, Johnson filed a complaint for legal malpractice against Barrett, who had represented him in the <em>Eatinger </em>conversion action, alleging Barrett was negligent in not submitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>an instruction on attorneys\u2019 retaining liens and that his negligence resulted in the adverse jury verdict. Barrett filed an answer denying Johnson\u2019s allegations and asserting several affirmative defenses, including that Johnson\u2019s action was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b66 Barrett subsequently filed a combined motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations and for Rule 11, M.R.Civ.R, sanctions against Johnson for including frivolous allegations for an improper purpose in his complaint. With regard to the statute of limitations, Barrett contended that Johnson knew of the facts which formed the basis for his legal malpractice claim as early as August 26, 1993, the date the jury rendered its verdict, but not later than December 9, 1993, when \u2014 after Barrett had provided the jury instructions submitted on Johnson\u2019s behalf at trial \u2014 he advised Barrett by letter for the second time to put Barrett\u2019s malpractice insurer on notice. Johnson argued that, while he knew no attorney\u2019s retaining lien instruction had been given, he did not know of Barrett\u2019s act of omission regarding the attorney\u2019s retaining lien instruction until he received a transcript of the instruction settlement conference on or after December 22,1993. The parties fully briefed the motions and presented oral arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b67 The District Court granted Barrett\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Johnson was aware of the facts essential to his cause of action against Barrett as early as August 26, 1993, but no later than December 9,1993, and that his complaint \u2014 filed December 19, 1996 \u2014 was not filed within the three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions. Johnson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\u00b68 A district court reviews a summary judgment motion under Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R, which requires that judgment be rendered \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact. If that burden is met, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to raise a genuine issue of material fact by more than mere denial or speculation. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (citation omitted). All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the offered proof must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>See Schmidt v. Washington Contractors Group </em>(1998), 290 Mont. 276, 280, 964 P.2d 34, 37 (citation omitted). Once a district court determines that no genuine factual issues exist, it then must determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Stutzman, 284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b69 This Court\u2019s standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling is <em>de novo. </em>We use the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by the district court. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 376, 945 P.2d at 34 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b6 10 Did the District Court err in granting Barrett\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b611 The statute of limitations applicable to legal malpractice actions is set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">An action against an attorney licensed to practice law in Montana ... based upon the person\u2019s alleged professional negligent act or for error or omission in the person\u2019s practice must be commenced within 3 years after the plaintiff <em>discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered </em>the act, error, or omission</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">(Emphasis added.) When a statute of limitations issue relates to actual discovery, the test is knowledge of the facts essential to the legal malpractice claim, rather than discovery of legal theories. <em>Loney v. Dye </em>(1997), 281 Mont. 240, 242, 934 P.2d 169, 170 (citation omitted). When the statute of limitations issue involves the time at which the plaintiff, through the use of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the facts, \u201c[t]he test is whether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation.\u201d <em>Peschel v. Jones </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 516, 525, 760 P.2d 51, 56 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u00b6 12 In the present case, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Johnson as the nonmoving party, the District Court determined that Johnson was aware of the facts underlying his legal malpractice claim no later than December 9,1993, and that the three-year statute of limitations began to run at that time. Johnson asserts error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\u00b6 13 Johnson contends that he was not aware of \u2014 that is, did not discover \u2014 the facts underlying his claim against Barrett until he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ceived the transcript of the instruction settlement conference on or after December 22,1993. It was only then, according to Johnson, that he knew Barrett had not offered an instruction on attorneys\u2019 retaining liens and, as a result, became aware of the facts underlying his legal malpractice claim. The problem with this contention is that, carried to its logical conclusion, Johnson could have delayed ordering the referenced transcript indefinitely, thereby delaying indefinitely the running of the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\u00b614 Moreover, on the record before us, it is clear that Johnson had received from Barrett by December 9,1993, a copy of the instructions Barrett offered at trial. At that point, Johnson was aware that no attorneys\u2019 retaining lien instruction had been submitted on his behalf and, indeed, on that date, Johnson wrote his second letter to Barrett advising Barrett to put his malpractice carrier on notice. Particularly as an experienced attorney, it is disingenuous of Johnson to suggest that he was not aware, as of December 9, 1993, of the facts essential to his legal malpractice claim. <em>See Loney, </em>281 Mont. at 242, 934 P.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b615 In addition, it is clear that Johnson had information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry regarding an omission by Barrett relating to instructions when he heard the District Court instruct the jury at the end of the trial. <em>See Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56. He also had \u201cthe opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation\u201d at that time or shortly thereafter, because the District Court file containing proposed and given instructions \u2014 a public record \u2014 was available for his review. <em>See Peschel, </em>232 Mont. at 525, 760 P.2d at 56. On this record, Johnson should have discovered the facts relating to Barrett\u2019s omission on or immediately after August 26,1993, through the use of reasonable diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b616  On this record, Johnson\u2019s legal malpractice claim accrued no later than December 9, 1993. He filed his action against Barrett on December 19,1996. Applying the three-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, we conclude that Johnson\u2019s legal malpractice action against Barrett was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"AzY\">\u00b617 Johnson advances two other theories under which he contends the District Court erred in applying the statute of limitations. We address those theories only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b618  First, relying on Monroe <em>v. Harper </em>(1974), 164 Mont. 23, 518 P.2d 788, <em>overruled in part by Blackburn v. Blue Mountain Women\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>Clinic </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 60, 75, 951 P.2d 1, 10, Johnson argues that the statute of limitations should be tolled because Barrett fraudulently concealed the facts regarding his failure to offer an attorney\u2019s retaining lien instruction. Johnson did not advance this theory in the District Court, however, and we do not address either issues raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory. <em>See Day v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b6 19 Johnson also advances a continuing tort theory under which he argues that actions of an alleged agent of Barrett subsequent to trial involving this Court\u2019s Commission on Practice tolled the statute of limitations until the date of the last injury from those actions. Johnson did not expressly plead a continuing tort in his complaint against Barrett, however; he alleged only that certain posttrial actions of an agent of Barrett \u201caggravated\u201d his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b620  Moreover, Johnson\u2019s continuing tort theory is based on the allegation that his damages continued \u2014 and increased \u2014 for a lengthy period of time after the unfavorable jury verdict in <em>Eatinger </em>and, under such circumstances, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the date of the last injury or damage. The plain language of \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, however, requires that a legal malpractice action be commenced within three years after the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the allegedly negligent \u201cact, error, or omission\u201d at issue. That language does not permit an overlay of the continuing damage or injury theory advanced by Johnson here.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u00b621 We conclude that the District Court did not err in granting Barrett\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that Johnson\u2019s legal malpractice action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
