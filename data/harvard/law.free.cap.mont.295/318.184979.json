Chief Industries and Hydro Flame filed cross-claims against each other seeking indemnification from the other in the instance either was found liable. Prior to trial the Durdens and Hydro Flame reached a court-approved settlement and the District Court dismissed both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>cross-claims with prejudice. Following a trial between the Durdens and Chief Industries, an appeal resulting in <em>Durden v. Hydro Flame Corporation, </em>1998 MT 47, 288 Mont. 1, 955 P.2d 160, and remand, Chief Industries sought to have its indemnity cross-claim reinstated. The District Court refused and certified its order as a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P. Chief Industries appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b62 The sole issue raised on appeal is whether, in a product liability action in which the finished product manufacturer and a component part manufacturer are named defendants, the rights of the finished product manufacturer to indemnity against the component manufacturer are extinguished upon the latter\u2019s settlement with the injured party.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b63 The Durdens filed this action against Chief Industries to recover damages for carbon monoxide poisoning they allegedly sustained while inhabiting a fifth-wheel trailer manufactured and sold by Chief Industries. The Durden\u2019s complaint was also filed against Hydro Flame Corporation, the manufacturer of the trailer furnace which is alleged to have been the source of the carbon monoxide. Chief Industries designed and installed the duct work and exhaust for the furnace which, according to the Durdens\u2019 expert, caused the trailer to be defective and unreasonably dangerous. The Durdens predicated each defendant\u2019s liability upon theories of breach of warranty and strict liability in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b64 As to Hydro Flame, the Durdens\u2019 complaint asserted that the furnace was defective as evidenced by the development of holes in the heat exchanger portion of the furnace. These holes were alleged to have allowed carbon monoxide to infiltrate the living space of the trailer. As to Chief Industries, the complaint alleged that the trailer was designed and manufactured in a defective and unreasonably dangerous condition because it incorporated a defective heating system, failed to have carbon monoxide detection devices, and failed to include adequate and complete warnings. It further alleged that Chief Industries failed to \u201cproperly inspect and test\u201d the furnace.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b65 Both defendants denied the allegations made in the complaint. Chief Industries filed a cross-claim against Hydro Flame by which it sought indemnity from Hydro Flame in the instance that it was found liable to the Durdens pursuant to a theory of strict liability. Hydro Flame likewise filed an indemnity cross-claim against Chief Industries. Shortly prior to trial the Durdens and Hydro Flame reached a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>court-approved settlement and the District Court dismissed the cross-claims of both Chief Industries and Hydro Flame with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b66 Following a jury trial between the Durdens and Chief Industries, the District Court granted the Durdens\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, finding that the trailer was defective, and granted a new trial on damages. The jury, nevertheless, found no causation between the defect and the Durdens\u2019 claimed injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b67 Following an appeal, we reversed the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law, but affirmed the grant of a new trial. Upon remand, Chief Industries sought to have its indemnity cross-claim reinstated by the District Court. The District Court refused and certified its order as final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b), M.R.Civ.P. Chief Industries appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\u00b68  This Court, when examining the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law, is required to \u201cdetermine whether [the district court\u2019s] interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 67, 71, 915 P.2d 175, 177. Thus, the standard of review is plenary. <em>See Blackwell v. Lurie </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 351, 943 P.2d 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\u00b69 This appeal presents a practical dilemma between two competing public policies. One is the promotion of settlements, and the other is the placing of responsibility upon the \u201cup stream\u201d manufacturer of a defective product as opposed to the retailer or distributor of that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">\u00b610 Chief Industries maintains that the latter policy, placing responsibility upon the \u201cup stream\u201d manufacturer of a defective product, is the more important public policy because in the context of a product liability action, a merchant should be able to claim indemnity from the \u201cup stream\u201d manufacturer who made a defective product sold by the merchant. Only this way, according to Chief Industries, is the party who is ultimately responsible for the defect, the party who pays for the resulting damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\u00b611 Hydro Flame, on the other hand, argues for the first policy because given the number of lawsuits filed, and the unavailability of resources and time, it is essential that lawsuits be encouraged to settle. It maintains that there would be little incentive for a manufacturer to settle with a plaintiff if it believed it still had to defend an indemnification cross-claim from a \u201cdownstream\u201d retailer or distributor.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u00b612 In <em>State, ex rel., Deere &amp; Co. v. District Court of the Fifth Judicial District </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 384, 730 P.2d 396, we considered a settlement between a plaintiff and one of two defendants, and determined that when one defendant in a negligence action settles with the plaintiff it can \u201cbuy peace\u201d from not only the plaintiff, but from the other defendants who seek damages in contribution or indemnity, or both, by way of cross-claim. <em>Deere </em>involved negligence, strict liability, contribution, and indemnity. In our decision in <em>Deere, </em>we relied upon the language of \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, which concerns negligence, multiple defendants, joint and several liability, and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b613 This action, on the other hand, is brought pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, as it existed in 1994. That statute indicates that principles of comparative negligence shall be applicable concerning named defendants; however, notably absent is any mention of multiple defendants or any reference to \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA. Section 27-1-703, MCA, is by it its terms limited to negligence actions and does not mention actions in strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u00b614 <em>Deere </em>involved a negligence action against the operator of a bulldozer that backed into the plaintiff. The plaintiff also brought suit against the manufacturer of the bulldozer. The manufacturer settled with the plaintiff. The operator sought contribution and indemnity from the manufacturer. We held that a \u201cjoint tortfeasor who settles with the claimant before judgment on the claim is entered in a district court is not subject to claims for contribution or indemnity from the nonsettling joint tortfeasors,\u201d <em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 392, 730 P.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\u00b6 15 Chief Industries is correct when it notes that because this case sounds in strict liability and not negligence, \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, does not directly apply to this case. However, the policy statements made in <em>Deere </em>with regard to the promotion of settlements in cases in which indemnity is involved, do offer some guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00b6 16 We recognize the importance of Chief Industries\u2019 public policy argument that a judicial system which places liability for injuries from defective products on the manufacturer of the defective product, provides protection for Montana\u2019s consuming public and also serves to prevent the inequity of requiring a retailer or distributor to bear the cost of injury created by a manufacturer. We also recognize that a judicial system which allows individual litigants to settle with one defendant in a multiple defendant case conflicts with the rationale for allowing strict liability against \u201cdownstream\u201d parties (without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>proof of fault) in order to allow them to act as a conduit to pass liability \u201cupstream\u201d to the manufacturer of the defective product. It is clear that Montana adopted strict product liability in order to place responsibility upon the manufacturers of defective products. <em>See Brandenburger v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 506, 514, 513 P.2d 268, 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">\u00b617 In order to allow \u201cdownstream\u201d parties to \u201cact as the conduit through which liability may flow to reach the manufacturer,\u201d a Montana federal court allowed cross-claims and third-party complaints for indemnification against a manufacturer. <em>See Jones v. Aero-Chem Corp. </em>(D. Mont. 1987), 680 F.Supp. 338, 339. That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">This \u201cupstream\u201d indemnification fosters the policy behind strict products liability by placing final responsibility for injuries caused by a defective product upon the entity initially responsible for placing that product into the stream of commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>Jones, </em>680 F.Supp. at 340. It further stated that \u201c[t]he persons or entities on the chain of distribution of a defective product can be an efficient \u2019\u2019conduit\" for the imposition of liability on a manufacturer only if they in turn are allowed to seek indemnification from the manufacturer.\" <em>Jones, </em>680 F.Supp. at 340. This policy fosters the desire to place responsibility for injury caused by a defective product on the manufacturer of that product and helps prevent inequitable imposition of liability on \u201cdownstream\u201d parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b6 18 Chief Industries claims that in the absence of imposition of liability on the \u201cupstream\u201d manufacturer, the manufacturer would have little economic incentive to remove a defective product from the market. It argues that the retailer or distributor could always refuse to order that product in the future, but the economic effect on the manufacturer of the loss of these few sales would be extremely limited and have little impact. Finally, Chief Industries maintains that without indemnification, the retailer or distributor might also suffer financial disaster merely because it unknowingly sold a defective product. Indemnity shifts full responsibilities for injury to the manufacturer and provides an incentive to the manufacturer to withdraw or correct the defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b6 19 The conflicting public interest presented in this case, however, is that of the encouragement of settlements as we discussed within the context of negligence in <em>Deere. </em>In <em>Deere </em>we held that a joint tortfeasor who settles with the claimant before judgment on the claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>entered in a district court, is not subject to claims for contribution or indemnity from the nonsettling joint tortfeasors against whom judgment may be rendered. <em>See Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 392, 730 P.2d at 402. This is so even though \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, states that the trier of fact is to determine the degree of negligence among each of the joint tortfeasors. Actual recovery is allowed only against those tortfeasors who have not settled with the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b620 The policy reasons for encouraging settlements and avoiding unnecessary litigation are numerous. Settlements may reduce litigants\u2019 costs by the elimination of litigation expenses and the risk of an extreme verdict. Settlements eliminate the stress associated with trials. The public may see a reduction in the costs associated with litigation, and a more efficient and timely judicial system. Public policy is served by allowing a litigant to buy his or her peace and terminate his or her involvement in litigation. As observed by this Court nearly seventy years ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">The law favors compromises. This is especially true in tort actions, not only because they relieve the labors of courts, and avoid expense, but also because, where the parties agree between themselves upon a settlement of the claim, the result reached is frequently a more equitable adjustment than is possible to be had in a court of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\"><em>Black v. Martin </em>(1930), 88 Mont. 256, 269-70, 292 P. 577, 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b621 Although Chief Industries contends that <em>Deere </em>is inapposite to this case as its cross-claim is not based upon negligence, but rather upon strict liability, we note that our holding in <em>Deere </em>was not so limited. In <em>Deere, </em>we framed the principal issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">The principal issue we decide here is that a joint tortfeasor who settles with the claimant before judgment on the claim is entered in a district court is not subject to claims for contribution or indemnity from the nonsettling joint tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-9\"><em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 386, 730 P.2d at 398. This statement of a common law principle is not as limited as Chief Industries contends. Given the facts of this case, distinctions which Chief Industries attempts to draw, even if appropriate, do not compel a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">\u00b622 The Durdens pled their case, prepared their case, and tried their case as if Hydro Flame and Chief Industries were joint tortfeasors, not as if Chief Industries\u2019 liability was predicated solely upon its status as a \u201cseller\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA. Because the injury allegedly suffered by the Durdens was carbon monoxide poisoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>and the poisoning could have come about from either or both Hydro Flame\u2019s product failure or Chief Industries\u2019 misinstallation of Hydro Flame\u2019s product, then \u201cas a practical matter they both are to blame.\u201d <em>Deere, </em>224 Mont., at 398, 730 P.2d at 405. The Durdens\u2019 presented trial testimony that there were several defects, that each defect was uniquely traceable to an identified defendant, and that each defect could cause carbon monoxide infiltration. Each, therefore, is alleged to be a joint tort-feasor in strict liability. InDeere we broadly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdA\">We discuss first the effect of a prejudgment settlement by one or more joint tortfeasors with a plaintiff on the rights to contribution or indemnity of the remaining nonsettling joint tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 387, 730 P.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b623 As with \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, confusion reigned at the time we announced our decision in <em>Deere </em>as to whether, despite the provision in the statute allowing the trier of fact to determine the degree of negligence among each joint tortfeasor, the right of a settling tortfeasor to be free from claims of contribution or indemnity from nonsettling tortfeasors was derived from common law principles, and not from anything set forth in the statute. In <em>Deere </em>we noted that in <em>Kussler v. Burlington Northern, Inc. </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 82, 606 P.2d 520, we adopted the rule of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 885 (1985) which established that the release of one joint tortfeasor is not a release of any other joint tortfeasors unless the document is intended to release the other tortfeasors, or the payment is full compensation, or the release expressly so provides. We stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">[I]n the case at bar then, following <em>Kussler, </em>there can be no doubt that as between the plaintiff Campbell and Deere &amp; Company, the latter defendant is completely exonerated from any further liability for damages to Campbell. If therefore, following Deere\u2019s compromise settlement with Campbell, Wade\u2019s Backhoe can bring Deere &amp; Company back into the action on a theory of contribution between joint tortfeasors, the finality of Deere\u2019s compromise settlement is in serious question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\"><em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 392, 730 P.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">\u00b624 Our resolution of the issue in <em>Deere, </em>thus, clearly provided that our conclusion was based on common law principles, and was not dependent on the language of \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">Consequently, under amended \u00a7 27-1-703, there is no right of contribution under Montana law in favor of a joint tortfeasor or tortfeasors against whom judgment for the plaintiff is entered from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>other joint tortfeasors who have settled with the plaintiff prior to judgment. The judicial tenets that the law favors compromise and that a compromising party ought to be able to buy his peace with finality override the seeming unfairness to non-settling parties who did not participate in the compromise nor control its direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH9v\"><em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 393, 730 P.2d at 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b625 Contribution distributes loss among joint tortfeasors by requiring each to pay his or her proportionate share based upon his or her proportion of the negligence which proximately caused the injuries. <em>See Raisler v. Burlington Northern R.R. </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 254, 258, 717 P.2d 535, 537. Indemnity, on the other hand, shifts the entire loss from the one who has been required to pay it to the one who should bear the loss. <em>See Raisler, </em>219 Mont. at 258, 717 P.2d at 537. The right to indemnity is an equitable principle, based on the general theory that one compelled to pay for damages caused by another should be able to seek recovery from that party. <em>See Poulsen v. Treasure State Indus. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 69, 82, 626 P.2d 822, 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b626  In <em>Deere, </em>we noted that \u201c[t]he remedies of indemnity and contribution are in theory mutually exclusive. Indemnity is an all-or-nothing proposition, representing in effect total contribution.\u201d <em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 398, 730 P.2d at 405. In light of that observation, it is clear from <em>Deere </em>that a \u201cjoint tortfeasor\u201d who settles with the claimant is not subject to claims for contribution or indemnity from the nonsettling joint tortfeasors. Our decision is equally applicable to contribution claims in negligence cases, as it is to indemnity claims in product liability cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">\u00b627 Since our adoption of strict liability in <em>Brandenburger v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 506, 513 P.2d 268, its primary objective has always been to place responsibility for injuries caused by defective products on those responsible for placing those products in the stream of commerce, not on the consumer. Moreover, the policy which led courts initially to allow strict liability claims against retailers and wholesalers of defective products was likewise to ensure maximum protection to the injured plaintiff, not out of any concern for the fair apportionment of liability between tortfeasors. As explained by the California Supreme Court in <em>Vandermark v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(Cal. 1964), 391 P.2d 168, the first decision extending strict liability to a retailer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">Retailers like manufacturers are engaged in the business of distributing goods to the public. They are an integral part of the over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>all producing and marketing enterprise that should bear the cost of injuries resulting from defective products. <em>In some cases the retailer may be the only member of that enterprise reasonably available to the injured plaintiff. In other cases the retailer himself may play a substantial part in insuring that the product is safe or may be in a position to exert pressure on the manufacturer to that end; the retailer\u2019s strict liability thus serves as an added incentive to safety. </em>Strict liability on the manufacturer and retailer alike affords maximum protection to the injured plaintiff <em>and works no injustice to the defendants, for they can adjust the costs of such protection between them in the course of their continuing business relationship.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWd\"><em>Vandermark, </em>391 P.2d 171-72 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"An4\">\u00b628 A system which allows indemnity claims to be maintained in product liability actions in which one of the defendants chooses to settle with the plaintiff would discourage settlements because there would be little incentive for a manufacturer to settle if it still had to defend an indemnification claim. It would also force injured consumers into protracted litigation that, due to the vagaries of our justice system and the expense of litigation, might result in an inadequate recovery or no recovery at all. Moreover, such a system would make it virtually impossible for less than all defendants to settle a case. No defendant would ever settle if it thought it could be brought back into the action and have to pay attorney fees and a potential judgment. On the other hand, by following the policy articulated in <em>Deere, </em>defendants who do not settle will be put at risk if other defendants settle. In the long run, this will promote settlement rather than trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b629 In most instances, the consuming public has little interest in who pays for the damages caused by the use of a defective product as among the retailer, wholesaler, or manufacturer. However, in all cases, the public has a strong interest in seeing that compensation is made for the physical, emotional, and often catastrophic injuries caused by the use of a defectively made product. We agree with the District Court that this interest far outweighs any interest an individual retailer or wholesaler of a defective product might have in placing ultimate responsibility on the manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b630 Finally, Chief Industries asserts that the policy articulated in <em>Deere </em>will cause plaintiffs to settle for less than full value with manufacturers and then leave local \u201cmom and pop\u201d retailers to pay for an unfair amount of remaining damages. The dissent expresses the same concern. Such a view assumes that an injured plaintiff would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>rather settle, for less than the actual damages, with an out of state defendant which manufactured a defective product and go to trial against a local business which is only secondarily liable. There is no basis in fact for such an assumption and it flies in the face of sound litigation strategy and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b631  Accordingly, we conclude that in accordance with well established common law principles and the public policy favoring settlements, a settlement by one tortfeasor precludes claims for both contribution and indemnity against the settling tortfeasor, irrespective of the nature of the underlying tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b632 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b348-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AMM\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">\u00b63 3 As the maj ority opinion points out, resolution of the issue on appeal presents a practical dilemma of choosing between two competing public policies \u2014 one favoring settlements and the other favoring placing responsibility upon the \u201cup stream\u201d manufacturer of a defective product notwithstanding that the manufacturer is released from liability by the injured plaintiff. In the context of this case \u2014 a strict products liability action \u2014 I cannot agree with the Court that the former policy must take precedence over the latter. To the contrary, I conclude that the latter policy must control. Indeed, the majority\u2019s resolution of the policy issue flies directly in the face of this Court\u2019s long-standing, consistent adherence to the core principle of strict liability in tort \u2014 that of placing liability on the party primarily responsible for the injury occurring. Our decision significantly compromises this principle and disserves the consuming public for whose protection we adopted the doctrine of strict products liability in the first place. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">\u00b634 Montana adopted the doctrine of strict liability in tort in <em>Brandenburger v. Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., Inc. </em>(1973), 162 Mont. 506, 513 P.2d 268. We did so based upon important public policy considerations to which we have consistently adhered for the past two-plus decades. <em>Sternhagen v. Dow Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 168, 174, 935 P.2d 1139, 1142. Specifically, \u201cthe doctrine of strict liability was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>evolved to place liability on the party primarily responsible for the injury occurring, that is, the manufacturer of the defective product.\u201d <em>Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont at 514, 513 P.2d at 273 (quoting <em>Lechuga, Inc. v. Montgomery </em>(1970), 12 Ariz. App. 32, 467 P.2d 256, 261 (Jacobson, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b635 The important public policy considerations which we articulated in <em>Brandenburger </em>in support of our adoption of the strict liability doctrine include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">1. The manufacturer can anticipate some hazards and guard against their recurrence, which the consumer cannot do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">2.

Aero-Chem Corp. </em>(D. Mont. 1987), 680 F. Supp. 338, had no difficulty in concluding that allowing actions for indemnity in strict products liability cases was entirely consistent with Montana\u2019s strong commitment to the protection of the consuming public. The federal district court was entirely correct in its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">\u00b639 In <em>Aero-Chem, </em>the plaintiff, Jones, sued the manufacturer of a defective tear gas canister, Aero-Chem, for injuries she sustained when the canister accidentally discharged. By way of a third party action, Aero-Chem sought indemnity from the designer/manufacturer of a defective valve incorporated into the canister, Emson. <em>Aero-Chem, </em>680 F. Supp. at 338- 39. The court denied Emson\u2019s motion for summary judgment noting, first, that, while we had not addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the question, \u201c[t]he decisional law extant in Montana ... provides clear guidance as to what the Montana Supreme Court would conclude if presented with the precise issue.\u201d <em>Aero-Chem, </em>680 F. Supp. at 339. Pointing to our \u201cunequivocal]\u201d adoption of Section 402A of the Restatement of Torts in <em>Brandenburger </em>and to our adoption of the equitable principle of indemnity in <em>Poulsen v. Treasure State Industries, Inc</em>.(1981), 192 Mont. 69, 82, 626 P.2d 822, 829, the court found the two theories perfectly compatible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\">The principle of indemnity, like the doctrine of strict products liability, is bottomed on the desire of the public to impose liability for an injury on the person or entity primarily responsible for that injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">Recognition of the fact that the doctrine of strict products liability and the principle of indemnity are premised on the same public concern, leads to the logical conclusion that the public interest is best served by allowing indemnity based on the principle of strict products liability. There is nothing inherent in the principle of indemnity which makes it inapplicable to strict products liability actions, nor visa versa. Not only are the principles compatible but they both serve to accomplish the same result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u201c[U]pstream\u201d indemnification fosters the policy behind strict products liability by placing final responsibility for injuries caused by a defective product upon the entity initially responsible for placing that product into the stream of commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\"><em>Aero-Chem, </em>680 F. Supp. at 339-40.1 completely concur in this rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\u00b640 Indeed, as pointed out above, in <em>Brandenburger </em>this Court observed that by allowing the injured consumer to hold retailers of the defective product also responsible, those entities may, thereby, serve as an effective \u201cconduit\u201d through which liability may flow to reach the manufacturer, where ultimate responsibility lies. <em>Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont. at 514, 513 P2d at 273. Obviously, this important policy reason for adopting strict liability in tort is completely frustrated to the extent that the retailer is prohibited from seeking indemnification from the manufacturer. Quite to the contrary, the \u201cultimately responsible\u201d manufacturer can, via settlement, effectively shift the damages caused by its placing the defective product into the stream of commerce to downstream retailers who did nothing more than un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>wittingly sell the defective product to the consumer. <em>See Aero-Chem, </em>680 F. Supp. at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b641 Furthermore, allowing the manufacturer of a defective product to \u201cbuy its peace\u201d serves as a disincentive for it to \u201canticipate ... hazards and to guard against their recurrence.\u201d <em>Brandenburger, </em>156 Mont. at 514, 513 P.2d at 273 (citation omitted). Why spend the money to design and build a safer product, when the manufacturer\u2019s economists and accountants can demonstrate that it will cost less in the long run to simply settle the few law suits that will inevitably result from injuries caused by the defective product, without incurring any risk of having to indemnify downstream defendants?</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b642 Rather than \u201cdiscouraging] the marketing of defective products\u201d and requiring the manufacturer to insure the risk of injury and distribute that expense among the public as a cost of doing business,\" <em>see Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont. at 514, 513 P.2d at 273, our decision in the case <em>sub judice </em>even more will encourage manufacturers to do what they already do\u2014 analyze decisions to market or to continue marketing defective products on the basis of the cost/benefit ratio. That is, if the accounting department can show that the manufacturer will likely have to pay $1.50 per unit to settle anticipated personal injury cases caused by the product\u2019s defective design or fabrication, but that it will cost $2.75 per unit to make the product safer, the benefit of marketing the defective product will outweigh the cost of improving it. The result? The manufacturer will continue to market the product with the defect. So what if a few hundred or a few thousand people a year are killed or maimed by the product? At least profits will be maximized!</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\u00b643 Adopting a public policy of allowing the manufacturer in a strict products liability case to \u201cbuy its peace\u201d one case at a time without risk of indemnity may well benefit the individual plaintiff. Such a policy does absolutely nothing, however, to uphold, much less advance, the core principles of strict liability in tort \u2014 that of protecting the consuming public and placing ultimate financial responsibility on the manufacturer. Under such a policy the individual plaintiff may win the battle but the consuming public will most assuredly lose the war.</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">\u00b644 Likewise, allowing the \u201cultimately responsible\u201d manufacturer to settle out of a products liability case free of any risk of a later indemnity action fails to foster the other public policy considerations articulated <em>in Brandenburger. </em>What will force a manufacturer to disclose complicated manufacturing processes or damning, secret, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>intra-organization test reports or memoranda concerning its defective product if the manufacturer can place the product into the stream of commerce knowing full well that it can settle out of individual lawsuits with no risk of ever having its ultimate responsibility determined? What will protect other consumers who have no more ability than the injured plaintiff to investigate the soundness of the product and who are, likewise, lulled by advertising, marketing devices and trademarks, from the manufacturer\u2019s cost/benefit-driven decision to continue marketing the defective product? See <em>Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont. at 515, 513 P.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b645 Having adopted the theory of strict liability in tort for the purpose of assuring that liability for putting a defective product into the stream of commerce is placed on the party primarily responsible for the injury occurring, that is, on the manufacturer, I can discern absolutely no way in which our instant decision fosters that or any of the other important public policy considerations articulated in <em>Brandenburger </em>or in our subsequent products liability case law. In fact, as pointed out above, the reverse is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b646 In short, as the federal court in <em>Aero-Chem </em>correctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APg\">No compelling justification exists which warrants relieving the manufacturer of a defective product from responsibility for damages caused by that entity\u2019s product. Ultimate liability for injury emanating from a defective product should be placed upon that entity responsible for creation of the product, [citation omitted]. Ultimate responsibility should not be fixed simply by the fact that an injured consumer chooses to seek compensation from one commercial entity rather than another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\"><em>Aero-Chem, </em>680 F. Supp. at 341. A more enlightened approach would allow a downstream retailer of a defective product or defective component part of a product to seek indemnity from the upstream manufacturer of the product or component part.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b647 The majority rejects this approach, however. Rather, the Court trumpets policy reasons for encouraging settlements and avoiding \u201cunnecessary\u201d litigation \u2014 i.e. reducing costs, eliminating the risk of extreme verdicts, lessening trial stress, and efficiently using judicial resources. No doubt these are legitimate policy reasons favoring settlements in negligence actions and in many other sorts of lawsuits. As facially persuasive (though speculative) as they are, however, these reasons are antithetical to the core principles of strict liability in tort articulated at length above.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u00b648 The essential rationale of strict products liability is to benefit the consuming public, not the individual plaintiff. We adopted strict liability in tort to \u201cafford the consuming public the maximum protection from dangerous defects in manufactured products by requiring the manufacturer to bear the burden of injuries and losses enhanced by such defects in its products.\u201d <em>Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont. at 517, 513 P.2d at 275. To this end, we will not permit manufacturers to use the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d defense in strict products liability actions because to do so, \u201cwould inject negligence principles into strict liability law and thereby sever Montana\u2019s strict products liability law from the core principles for which it was adopted \u2014 maximum protection for consumers... with the focus on the condition of the product, and not on the manufacturer\u2019s conduct or knowledge.\u201d <em>Sternhagen, </em>282 Mont. at 176, 935 P.2d at 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b649 Yet, in the case at bar, we are content to throw these core, remedial principles to the wind in favor of some theoretical benefit to some future plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who, for whatever reason, chooses to settle with the manufacturer of the defective product leaving the retailer \u2014 merely a \u201cconduit\u201d to the \u201cultimately responsible\u201d manufacturer \u2014 to shoulder the financial burden. True, maybe the plaintiff will not have to try part of his or her case; maybe he or she can obtain, via the settlement, some seed money to finance the remaining claim against the retailer; maybe some trial costs will be saved; and maybe some judicial resources will be conserved. Nevertheless, given the lofty reasons <em>why </em>we adopted the theory of strict liability in tort, I am mystified by our present about-face, rejection of these core principles. There simply is no justification for our determination that a few speculative benefits which might accrue to one plaintiff should trump the very real and greater benefit of protecting all consumers from dangerous product defects. Nor should we preclude the fact-finder from determining the manufacturer\u2019s liability and, if found to be responsible, from holding it financially accountable in a suit for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b650 And, that is not all that is wrong with this picture. As much as the majority tries to pound the square peg of settlement \u2014 by application of <em>State ex. rel. Deere &amp; Co. v. District Court </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 384, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>730 P.2d 396 \u2014 into the round hole of strict liability in tort, its attempt is unavailing. The Court tries to distance the case from its roots, but the fact is <em>Deere </em>was decided as a negligence/comparative negligence case under \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA, not as a strict liability case under \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA. See <em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 393, 730 P.2d at 402. Even the trial court acknowledged that <em>Deere </em>was not directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b651 In <em>Deere, </em>the plaintiff was injured by a bulldozer manufactured by Deere and operated by Wade\u2019s Backhoe. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that Deere negligently designed the bulldozer and that Wade\u2019s Backhoe negligently operated it. Plaintiff settled with Deere. Wade\u2019s Backhoe then filed a third party complaint for indemnity and contribution against Deere. Count one of the third party complaint alleged strict liability for defective manufacture against Deere; counts two and three alleged negligent design and failure to warn. On denial of its motion for summary judgment based on settlement, Deere applied for, and we accepted supervisory control. <em>Deere, </em>246 Mont. at 386, 730 P.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">\u00b652 We decided <em>Deere </em>on the issue of whether the third party complainant, Wade\u2019s Backhoe, could bring an action for contribution against the settled and released joint tortfeasor, Deere. <em>See Deere, </em>246 Mont. at 387, 730 P.2d at 399.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following a lengthy discussion and review of Montana\u2019s negligence law we resolved the issue in Deere\u2019s favor, citing \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">In Montana, there is but one statute on the subject, the amended Sec. 27-1-703, MCA, and <em>from it </em>we determine that a joint tortfeasor who settles with the claimant before judgment on the claim is entered in a district court is not subject to claims for contribution or indemnity from the non-settling joint tortfeasors against whom judgment may be rendered. Even though the amended section does give a sued joint tortfeasor the right to bring in other joint tortfeasors as defendants in order to insure contribution, and even though the section states that the trier of fact is to determine the degree of negligence among each of the joint tortfeasors, <em>the right of contribution under the amended statute is \u201cproportional to the negligence of the parties against whom recovery is allowed.\u201d Clearly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>that statutory language excludes a party against whom recovery is not allowed, e.g. a tortfeasor who has previously settled.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><em>Deere, </em>224 Mont. at 393, 730 P.2d at 402 (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s pronouncement that <em>Deere </em>was resolved on \u201ccommon law principles and was not dependent on the language of \u00a7 27-1-703, MCA,\u201d the opposite is true. In fact, the contribution issue was reviewed, discussed and decided by this Court entirely within the context of negligence and comparative negligence principles and was clearly decided by reference to the negligence/comparative negligence statute. Importantly, absolutely no reference was made to the strict liability statute, \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, adopted years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\u00b653 Again, in applying <em>Deere </em>to the strict products liability case at bar, the majority has simply ignored this Court\u2019s consistent rejection of attempts to inject negligence principles into strict liability in tort and its steadfast refusal to sever Montana\u2019s strict products liability law from its core, remedial principles of providing maximum protection to consumers of defective products and placing financial responsibility on the \u201cultimately responsible\u201d manufacturer regardless of its conduct or knowledge. <em>Sternhagen, </em>282 Mont. at 176, 935 P.2d at 1144. The majority does not stop there, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b654 Recognizing that indemnity \u201cshifts the entire loss from the one who has been required to pay it to the one who should bear the loss\u201d \u2014 precisely the underlying rationale of strict liability in tort \u2014 the Court then goes on to disallow indemnity actions in strict liability cases. With passing reference to <em>Deere </em>(which, as demonstrated above, is completely inapplicable) and with lip-service to <em>Brandenburger </em>(which is what this case is actually about), the majority, without further authority or any real analysis, rejects indemnity in strict liability cases, concluding that to allow such actions would discourage settlements. Assuming that is true, so what? As previously discussed, this whole approach is bogus in the context of a strict liability case. The Court\u2019s overarching concern for settlements is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b655 Moreover, I take particular exception to the majority\u2019s statement that the consuming public has little interest in who pays for the damages caused by the use of a defective product but that the public has a strong interest in seeing that the injured person is compensated for his or her injuries. Actually, the <em>public </em>wants defective and dangerous products removed from this nation\u2019s store shelves so that members of the <em>public </em>will not be injured. The <em>plaintiff </em>wants to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>compensated. Where that compensation comes from is immaterial to the <em>plaintiff. </em>Strict liability in tort was adopted to serve both goals. <em>Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont. at 514-15, 513 P.2d at 273. Settlement serves only the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b656 And that is precisely the point that seems to be lost on the majority. Allowing upstream indemnity actions will not preclude the injured plaintiff from ultimately obtaining full compensation for his or her injuries. While the plaintiff may actually have to try the case, juries are more than willing to fairly compensate injured plaintiffs for injuries in products liability cases. In fact, if anything, modern experience demonstrates that in products liability cases, trial juries award not only substantial compensatory damages, but, often, punitive damages as well \u2014 especially where manufacturers are shown to have callously disregarded issues of product safety. (And, if that were not true, \u201ctort reformers\u201d would not be falling all over themselves to put caps on damages and to deny Americans meaningful access to the courts and to full legal redress for their injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b657 Moreover, allowing indemnity actions in strict liability cases may actually promote settlements. Retailers may be more willing to settle if those entities know that they can seek indemnity from the upstream manufacturer. Similarly, manufacturers, knowing that they will have to indemnify downstream retailers, will likely be more inclined to make good faith settlement offers, rather than simply \u201cbuying their peace\u201d for bottom dollar.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b658 Allowing indemnity actions in the context of product liability cases serves the precise goals for which we adopted strict liability in tort in the first place \u2014 maximum protection for consumers against dangerous defects in manufactured products with financial responsibility being placed on the \u201cultimately responsible\u201d entity that placed the defective product into the stream of commerce. Disallowing indemnity actions by application of negligence/settlement principles in products liability cases disserves and frustrates these goals. Moreover, it is as likely that settlements will be promoted by allowing indemnity actions as it is that settlements will be discouraged. However, even accepting at face value the majority\u2019s rationale that settlements will be more difficult, the possibility of lessening a plaintiff\u2019s opportunities for settlement without diminishing his or her ultimate right of full legal redress is a reasonable price to insure the greater public good.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u00b659 I would reverse the decision of the District Court, and I respectfully dissent from our failure to do so.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-4\">DISTRICT JUDGE PREZEAU, sitting for JUSTICE LEAPHART, concurs in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-16\">.
